This whole compound is rather miserable; a few thistles grow in corners and a little enclosed patch of cotton-bushes is the ‘garden’. But the people are very handsome, like most highlanders. Both men and women have the basic bone-structure that good looks become even more pronounced with old age and everyone shows the finest of teeth that seem never to decay. Few highlanders are conspicuously tall, though the young sub-chief here is well over six feet and devastatingly handsome. I suspect that he and several of his contemporaries have some Italian blood. This is not because of any difference in colouring (many of the highlanders are quite fair-skinned, owing to their part-Semitic ancestry), but because of a difference in physique. The spindly limbs of the highland men and the exaggerated buttocks of the women clearly distinguish them from any European race.",

It lies thirty miles outside of the barrier reef and forty miles east of Belize City, just far enough off the beaten path to give it an air of isolation. There weren’t many cruisers in Belize in the nineties and only a handful of charter boats. Of those, only crewed charters were allowed to sail to Lighthouse because the atoll is littered with uncharted coral heads that can slice through a boat’s hull like a hot knife through butter. The chart shows a fringing reef surrounding a lagoon that’s about twenty miles long and five miles wide with a half-dozen sandy, palm-covered cays scattered along the reef. The lagoon area is not properly charted and is simply marked “numerous coral heads”, an understatement if ever there was one. It’s all gorgeous and unspoiled—white sand and coral awash in gin-clear water. It’s also home to the Blue Hole, made famous by Jacques Cousteau in the early seventies, and to the Half Moon Caye Natural Monument.",

She wanted to know what to see and where to go. I tried to pay attention to their conversation but was distracted by the city and the noise. I stared out the window and watched the world pass by in slow motion. Young men swarmed the sidewalks. They traveled in packs of five or six. Most of the young men wore a uniform of blue jeans and T-shirts, and they draped their arms across each other’s shoulders as they walked, like a friendly, rambling huddle. Elderly women, dressed in long black abayas, paced through lanes of stalled traffic. They carried bags of facial tissue and offered the packets to passing drivers, but there were few buyers. Mopeds zipped between the lanes and around the tissue sellers. Their drivers and passengers showed no fear. At one corner, I watched a dog rummage through a mound of trash. He found something interesting and ran off with it. On another corner, I noticed a sedan parked along a curb. Its front wheel was booted and I wondered what, in a city of such utter madness, that driver did to earn a boot. Above all else, I noticed the noise. The blare of horns flooded my ears and squeezed my brain.",

They scrambled on, speechless with haste, drunk with sun and air and their own hearts; and presently he dragged her up the last hillock, and there lay the ocean. He had sworn to himself that one day he would come back and see it with the girl he loved; but he had not known that the girl would be Laura Lou.

Her husband was a mechanic, the best one in Khandyga or anywhere, and he believed in repairing vehicles as his mission in life. The village was poor now, with much unemployment, she said, and her children could no longer get a good education there. Sometimes there was not much food in the stores, the streets melted into the permafrost every summer and had to be repaved, and winter was dark and sooty and very cold. She said she loved Khandyga anyway, especially in the summer, a beautiful time of year, when she and her husband and children sometimes went on four-thousand-mile drives to see relatives in Kazakhstan.",

He wore a tartan cap with a bobble; his eyes were enormous, their pupils a pair of ventilation-holes in the plywood; a ring hung from the lobe of his left ear; the scar of a knife-slash, freshly stitched, disfigured his right cheek; the tough shoots of his beard were perhaps ten days old. Drawn in thick black felt-tip pen, his portrait was signed, “CHUKKA FROM DY JANUARY ’95” in the top right-hand corner, and “BLAKEY FAEBCK MAY ’95” in the left.",

Such orders, too; involving a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte walk with Manby, which he, faint for want of food, worn out after his long day's preaching, was to take in the cold. Through the raw February night he was to walk with Manby, with almost the one person in the world he could never forgive. Well did he know she had done nothing, that she had merely been a chance spectator, but he could never forgive her for having seen him in the moment of humiliation. Fanny, who was the humiliator, he could and did forgive, for she was a sinner and he was going to save her, but the maid needed no saving. Patently blameless, she was just a virtuous parasite. And again he thought of her--though he tried not to, for, after all, he was a priest and it was Lent--as a tick.",

It’s one of the most technically challenging mountains on earth, but Nick and I just took a day hike from town up to the lake at its base, on a rare sunny day, the last day of Patagonian summer. We stood on floating pieces of ice in the lake under the Fitz Roy Glacier, and ate sandwiches in the sun. That night we found a little apartment over a tapas restaurant for about thirty dollars. The smell of baking bread wafted up from the restaurant, and we rattled the one twin bed while the ever-present Patagonian wind rattled the windows.",

Then, when the shirts looked more black than gray and “someone” complained, Ralph would lash out. My Carhartts with the duct-tape-patched crotch got the axe. Nic’s red hat, against uniform policy, had to stay in the locker. The rules seemed to comfort Ralph somehow, as if shaking a finger made him bigger. The problem is, asking manual laborers to look clean and act right is a losing battle, and everybody knows it. We even have Virgil on our side: “All things by nature,” he wrote in 30 BCE, “are ready to get worse.” It’s okay, Ralph. Entropy is not just a trails problem. It’s a law of the universe, and you’re in good company, centuries of zealots and philosophers, preachers, and generals, all questing after impossible order, thumping their desks, drawing clear lines, watching them fade as soon as the troops leave the door.",

They have tried in vain to get the armed forces to fly over the areas of high probability during their routine patrols and maneuvers. They have also failed in attempts to gain the use of spy satellites that have the acuity to photograph trash cans from space. Not only is the target not specific in this case, but the area to be searched is at least 200 miles across, or 31,400 square miles. If each photo covered 900 square feet, or 30 feet on a side, it would take over a billion photos to check out the area. In every direction in which my family have turned to get a physical search under way, they have found a roadblock.",

Everywhere in America, on every vacant lot where kids play baseball, and in the hospitals too, where crippled children dream of movement forever denied their thin and warped little bodies, they think of you, their hero.

At the third house the boy paused, turned, ran swiftly up the wooden steps and rang the bell; almost instantly a small slot-like peep-hole in the door was opened, an inquiring beak-like nose, a wisp of blondined hair peered out, the door was opened, the boy entered in a glow of reddish light, the door was closed behind him, and the train, gathering rapidly in speed now, went on, past the police-station where the night-time cops were sitting, past spokes of brown streets, old buildings, warehouses, factories, station tenements, the sudden barren glare of corner lamps – the grimy façade of old rusty buildings – the single substance and the million patterns of America!",

I reached out and grasped the carpet of soft weed, and hanging for a long moment to adjust my body to the swing of the sea, hoisted myself dripping and panting on to the shelf beside him. We tiptoed back the way he had come, over the slippery shelves to the firm dry rock. ‘I have some papers,’ he said, ‘which I wish you to see, to help me fill in.’ I had a drink of fresh water from the spring and climbed the rock with him to the little white terrace, now brilliantly situated in the very eye of the sinking sun which had set fire to the misty slopes above Lapithos. The light flowed out from the horns of the mountain, squeezed out laterally now, in a shaft of thin pencils, touching in the unsubstantial silhouettes of the fort­resses and capes with a dream-like unreality. The terrace with its whitewashed walls was a glittering sun-trap, and here the old man brought me a single uncomfortable chair to sit on, above the hushing of the sea and the faint tingle of wind which snatched at the old Turkish pennant, holding and releasing it, blowing and lapsing. The long dusk began to settle with a shiver, and one of the silver peaks began to nibble the disc of travelling light – throwing a deep cool penumbra of shade into the valleys. Soon the light evening wind would be rushing across the Mesaoria to set the windmills turning in Nicosia; the homing yachts would flutter and tremble outside the Kyrenia bar; and Sabri on his little balcony at the police mess would glance at his watch and incline his cheek to take the breath as he sat contemplating the hard enamel of the water and the Turkish mountains huddled in shadow like a flock of sheep.",

He had just put down his valise again, and was looking at the piece of paper for the sixth or seventh time, when someone came out of the old dormitory at the head of the campus, ran down the steps, and came striding down the path where the boy was standing. The boy looked up and gulped a little as the creature of pantheresque beauty, moving with the grace, the speed, the delicacy of a great cat, bore down swiftly on him.",
