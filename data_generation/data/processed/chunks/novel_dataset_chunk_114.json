What a strange lost world this was. And then at long last we arrived in Thurso, the northernmost town on the British mainland, the end of the line in every sense of the word.

A small number of marine species, however, have shown an unusual resilience. One is the Atlantic killifish. The presence of this silvery, leopard-spotted fish, otherwise known as the mummichog or the mud minnow, in the polluted waters of the Passaic and in Newark Bay was first noted in the 1990s. Killifish are little slips of fish, which eat worms and mosquito larvae and serve in turn as foodstuff for a great many bigger fish. Despite their daintiness, they are extremely hardy. They don’t mind if the water is fresh or salty, warm or cold, and in winter they simply burrow into the mud to escape the ice. NASA sent them to space, to see if they could swim in zero gravity. (They could. They spawned there too.)",

In much the same way that hills and winding roads serve to magnify distances in hilly countries, adding hours to road journeys and isolating towns on the far side of mountains, the opposite was true in the uniformly level Netherlands. Journey times were shortened and fields of vision lengthened. On train journeys, for example, Rotterdam’s jagged skyline would become visible on the horizon perhaps fifteen miles before arrival. The constant presence of rivers and canals also warped dimensions in curious ways, causing frequent lengthy diversions. It was rarely possible to walk directly to a destination without taking several detours to cross stretches of water. ‘The bridge was up’ was a trusted excuse for Dutch office workers running late.",

So they stopped remembering her at all, and there remained only the man who had given her the bread, upon whose chest she was still hammering with the hand which still clutched the fragment of the morsel, while she tried to cry something at him through the wet mass in her mouth.",

The garden was hardly larger than twenty square yards, but crammed with trees standing shoulder to shoulder at such close quarters that their greenery formed an almost unbroken roof. There were too many – some would have to go: I caught myself up with a start. It was early for me to begin behaving like the house’s owner. Abstractedly I counted them again: six tanger­ines, four bitter lemons, two pomegranates, two mulberry trees and a tall leaning walnut. Though there were houses on both sides they were completely hidden by greenery. This part of the village with its steep slope was built up in tiers, balcony upon balcony, with the trees climbing up between. Here and there through the green one caught a glint of the sea, or a corner of the Abbey silhouetted against it.",

I know I was horrified by the fanciness of the place they took me to—it was a clinic for foreign diplomats, apparently—but was told firmly to shut up. The doctor was German. She said that my blood was “black with malaria” and that I should be flown immediately to the United States. At that point, my friends hesitated. I was able to make my absolute opposition to such a drastic measure understood, and they were reluctant to overrule me. There was discussion of my survival chances, and of all the malaria cases the doctor had seen in forty years in Asia. They did not put me on a plane.",

Fortunately, both John and Beck were wickedly funny and had the group in stitches. Beck, however, was in the habit of turning his monologues into scathing, Limbaughesque rants against bed-wetting liberals, and at one point that evening I made the mistake of disagreeing with him: in response to one of his comments I suggested that raising the minimum wage seemed like a wise and necessary policy. Well informed and a very skilled debater, Beck made hash out of my fumbling avowal, and I lacked the where withal to rebut him. All I could do was to sit on my hands, tongue-tied and steaming.",

Thirty or so figures, all in black, are sitting stock-still in the night. They are in the throes of a winter retreat, rohatsu, in which they will sit like this, all but uninterruptedly, for seven days. Monks patrol the aisles with sticks, ready to hit anyone who threatens to drop off. Every forty-five minutes or so, the practitioners are allowed to break from their zazen positions to relieve themselves in buckets in the woods, or in rough outhouses known and feared throughout the Zen community. Most of them use the breaks, however, to continue their meditation unbroken, marching, in spellbound, silent Indian file, round and around a central pine tree. My host, I notice, is probably thirty years older than most of the fresh-faced young men and women in attendance; yet as they walk around the tree, at top speed, he seems at least thirty years stronger, too.",

The Tuichi, which flowed by about fifty yards from where I stood, looked threatening. Its waters were black, and the current so swift it seemed that someone had filmed the river and was showing it at double speed. So many enormous trees floated downstream that the water itself was barely visible. The river had washed over its shores, gathering up all that booty.

Under\nits influence and Gertrude's the editor spent less and less of his time\nin Fleet Street.

The prisoners had thought the machine grease might be butter; they said it tasted about as much like butter as American bread tasted like bread. They showed no ill effects afterward. In The Gulag Archipelago, Solzhenitsyn told of a work detail in Kolyma who were doing excavations when they came across a frozen-solid, perfectly preserved ancient stream complete with prehistoric fish and salamanders. He said that a magazine of the Soviet Academy of Sciences reported that unfortunately these interesting specimens could not be studied, because the workers who unearthed them ate them on the spot.

Céleste, before leaving, had drawn down the blinds and turned on the electric light, and the white and gold room, with its blazing wall-brackets, formed a sufficiently brilliant background to carry out the illusion. So untempered a glare would have been destructive to all half-tones and subtleties of modelling; but Undine’s beauty was as vivid, and almost as crude, as the brightness suffusing it.

The burnt wreckage of his antique car collection, famously torched by rivals, Los Pepes and the Cali Cartel, is on display, an odd combination of sculpture garden and junkyard. Pablo’s family home is a ruin, long ago torn apart brick by brick by looters searching for hidden caches of money. The land itself is not especially beautiful: rolling hills, brown and tired pastures, worn-out ground, eroded gullies. There is a fine exhibit tracking Escobar’s rise and fall, but it tells a story most Colombians either already know or would like to forget.",

His wife packed us ham sandwiches and sliced carrots and beer and Snickers. We threw fingers for driving shifts.",

Diners of all colours, ages, shapes and sizes sat shoulder to shoulder on the floor as voluntary servers ladled out dal and flipped steaming chapattis onto metal plates. An average of 100,000 people were fed here every day. Daunted by the clamour of crowds, I lingered for a few moments behind a pillar, watching friends and families, then went to collect my bag as an overwhelming sense of loneliness kicked me in the stomach.",

Marcus was waiting for him and already had the slings submerged. He inched his way in, and Donald held Lone Eagle in place with a boat hook while Marcus started the lift. With the slings firmly in place, they tied a line between them to stop them from slipping and put the scraps of carpet in place to protect the hull. Marcus increased the lift until Lone Eagle’s deck was flush with the travel lift deck, and they both stepped off and moved away to watch the lift.",

Around the Barkhor, the traditional pilgrim’s circuit that also comprises Lhasa’s central, age-old marketplace, you see figures from the farthest reaches of human experience. Pilgrims whose faces and clothes are encrusted with black, and who have walked two thousand miles or more to visit the holy city, sometimes prostrating themselves every step of the way. Wild men from Kham, tassels of red strung around their hair, and others who stride around with ceremonial daggers. People sticking their tongue out at one another for hello in the ancient Tibetan way, and, inside the Jokhang Temple, in the dark, lit up by butter-lamps that throw a strange light into their faces, countrywomen singing folk songs as they prostrate themselves before an auspicious statue. All day and into the night much of Lhasa is a constant murmur of sacred chants and shuffle of prostrations, as locals fall to the ground again and again, stretching themselves out in honor of a culture that is fast dying and a leader who is long gone.",

    "target_paragraph": "For half a century, the embattled Burmese military has been surrounded on all sides by this chaotic dissent. It used also to have to fend off the well-armed Communist Party of Burma, which wanted to instigate a revolution and overthrow the state. Gradually the Burmese army was able to regain control of ethnic areas: as the state propaganda used to put it, the insurgents ahman-taya pyan-deh—‘came back to the truth’. In the mid-1970s Ne Win launched the notorious hpyat lay byat or ‘four cuts’ policy, which was designed to cut insurgents off from their key means of survival: food, funds, recruits and information. The theory was that insurgents derived their strength from villagers who supported the ethnic armies fighting on their behalf. Burmese soldiers razed whole villages to the ground, forcing their inhabitants into mass relocation camps. Villagers were, and still are, used as living shields between the Burmese army and nationalist forces. They are coerced into walking in front of the army’s troops to act as human minesweepers for landmines laid by the insurgents. I once met a Padaung woman, with brass rings wound around her neck, who was living in a refugee camp in Thailand. When the insurgent army in her area began blowing up electricity poles erected by the regime, she and her friends were forced by Burmese soldiers to stand beneath the poles to protect them from the rebels. The women had to stand alone throughout the night, one woman to a pole, and hope that the forces on their side would see them before they attacked. Hundreds of thousands of villagers caught in the crossfire of these conflicts have fled to neighbouring countries and are now stranded in and around refugee camps along Burma’s borders with Thailand and Bangladesh. The sheer brutality of the hpyat lay byat campaign is astounding. One Karenni freedom-fighter I talked to on the Thai-Burma border joked that the four cuts included a fifth command issued to Burmese soldiers who fought against ethnic insurgents: cut off their heads.",

Its sand was toasted golden, the water the colour of emeralds, and the surf frothed and fizzed around teenagers splashing – metres from a gargantuan bulk carrier that had run aground. The River Princess looked less than regal, sitting sulkily on the edge of the water, black, rusting and abandoned, casting a sinister shadow across the waves. Ten years ago the 20,000-tonne tanker had drifted in a storm and hit the Goan shore, but was yet to be adopted by shipbreakers. Instead, a politicised salvaging process had begun. Numerous tenders to remove the ship had been awarded and withdrawn and now Goa Tourism, which had taken possession of the ship in 2003, was embroiled in disputes with the original owners over prices for the ship’s scraps. That the ship had already caused over 1 km of coastline to erode, encouraged strong and dangerous currents and could at any time break in half and destroy the beach seemed of little importance to anyone involved. After Passepartout had paddled on the edge of the water we made our way back to the villa, preferring to swim in a pool full of fag butts.",

I walked home that night feeling like the air could move through me, like I was clean linen fluttering on a clothesline, like New York itself had become a city made of rice paper—and I was light enough to run across every rooftop. I started going to the chants every Tuesday. Then I started meditating every morning on the ancient Sanskrit mantra the Guru gives to all her students (the regal Om Namah Shivaya, meaning, “I honor the divinity that resides within me”). Then I listened to the Guru speak in person for the first time, and her words gave me chill bumps over my whole body, even across the skin of my face. And when I heard she had an Ashram in India, I knew I must take myself there as quickly as possible.",

Two long escalators, installed skew-whiff at the geomancer’s insistence, crawl in steep diagonal through the open space to the working floors above, and riding up there feels like riding up to the gondola of a fairly unwelcoming airship. But just as Hong Kong itself combines the steely with a distinct note of the celebratory, so this remarkable building also gradually reveals to the visitor a kind of audacious endearment – a touch of devil-may-care. It is all so boyishly modern, so absolutely state-of-the-art, so piratically pleased with itself! Wherever you look there is something startling – mirrors to deflect sunlight into working areas, criss-cross escalators, vistas of bare steel. Through the enormous glass windows on the north side you can see the grand expanse of the harbour, and the ships lying there rank on rank look almost as though they are awaiting a signal from The Bank to sail away with their booty.",

Two years later the Italian geographer Agustín Codazzi issued a preliminary inventory of the statues. Not until 1911, however, did the megaliths finally come to the attention of the world, unveiled in a series of photographs at the International Congress of Americanists in London by the German geographer Karl Theodor Stöpel. A surge of interest resulted in a fully equipped archaeological expedition, led by Konrad Theodor Preuss, which set out for Colombia in 1913.",

Oh—h, Meestaire”—so eager, plaintive, pleading, strange—and off the road, in the arroyo bed a shattered Ford, a dead man, two drunk Mexicans—“Meestaire”—and then the eerie nearness of the wild coyote yelp—“Meestaire”—and it is seven miles to go to Santa Fe.",

The Americans, of course, predominate, and even those who are Hawaiian born, have, as elsewhere, a strongly national feeling. The far smaller English community hangs together in a somewhat cliquish fashion, and possibly cherishes a latent grudge against the Americans for their paramount influence in island affairs. The German residents, as everywhere, are cliquish too. Then, since the establishment of the Honolulu Mission, church feeling has run rather high, and here, as elsewhere, has a socially decisive tendency. Then there are drink and anti-drink, pro and anti-missionary, and pro and anti-reciprocity-treaty parties, and various other local naggings of no interest to you.",

The National Assembly refused his request, so, after blowing up his guns and ammunition dumps, he fled in the direction of Lhasa with the English radio operator Ford. Two days later he found his way barred by Chinese troops and both men were captured. I have already referred to the fate of Robert Ford.",

Every rooftop and mailbox wears a jaunty cap of snow for months on end.
