The kind that says: \"Damn! It's hot!\" in South Carolina, slouches in shirt-sleeves and straw hat down South Main Street, drops into Evans Drug Store for a dope, says to the soda jerker: \"Is it hot enough fer you to-day, Jim?\" The kind that reads in the paper of the heat, the deaths, and the prostration, reads it with a certain satisfaction, hangs on grimly day by day and loses sleep at night, can't sleep for heat, is tired in the morning, says: \"Jesus! It can't last for ever!\" as heat lengthens into August, and the nation gasps for breath, and the green that was young in May now mottles, fades and bleaches, withers, goes heat-brown. Will boast of coolness in the mountains, Admiral Drake. \"Always cool at night! May get a little warm around the middle of the day, but you'll sleep with blankets every night.\"",

The face of the tousled and pyjama-clad young man who had crept to the door displayed familiar symptoms of hangover. His bloodshot eyes signalled helpless appeal. ‘I’m sorry!’ he said. ‘Can’t speak …’, then: ‘Kopfweh!’ pointing to his head. Headache … A woman’s voice moaned expiringly in the background, and I stole away. (There were similar signs in many faces and flats; it was the end of carnival, which political upsets had failed to damp. Shrove Tuesday was only a few days off.) In an armchair in a large drawing-room on another floor, inert as an aardvark or a giant ant-eater and moving his head slowly from side to side with the puzzled expression of a ruminant, sat a middle-aged man, wide-eyed. Beyond the negative and slow-motion rocking of his head, he returned no answer to my awestruck overtures. Again, there was nothing for it but retreat. But the last sitters of the morning were a jolly retired Admiral and his wife surrounded by Biedermeier and Sezession furniture. He declared, with a breezy quarterdeck laugh, that he was still an active Admiral from whom, with the loss of Trieste and Fiume – his navy had retired. His midshipman’s dirk and his dress-sword hung on the wall. There were enlarged photographs of the gun-decks of warships in those lost ports. One of these illustrated a tour of inspection by Archduke Franz Ferdinand, his whiskers twisted up fiercely under his cocked hat.",

On either bank the land was rich and fertile; above the sky was bright blue, and a light breeze cooled the already intense heat of the sun. It was difficult to imagine that this peaceful, plentiful countryside held any threat to anyone.",

He hoisted the staysail and had a look at the reef lines. He could put a reef in the staysail, but he knew it would take a bit of fancy footwork on the foredeck if it was blowing that hard. He hoped that the staysail and two reefs in the main would be enough, but his plan, if it got bad, was to just run on the staysail. He hadn’t done that before but hoped that with the staysail close to the center of effort at the mast that Lone Eagle should ride just fine.",

In the process they came close to destroying Egypt’s tourist industry, and as a result foreigners have now been banned from the vicinity of Asyut. But journalists have occasionally been allowed into the area to report on the government’s (often heavy-handed) attempts to quell the Islamist uprising. I therefore went straight to the Egyptian Press Centre, presented my credentials and duly made an application, in triplicate. I was told to return in a week. Rather than hang around Cairo, waiting for bureaucrats to shuffle my papers and rearrange their red tape, I decided to take the opportunity to visit two important Byzantine sites that I had always wanted to see.",

What she saw in the mirror repulsed her, and she was certain that anyone who looked at her would feel the same.

The trees in the park around the capitol and the hill had the thrilling, clean austerity of morning, of first light, of frost, and of November.",

At New York airport a press conference had been arranged and he was taken aback when handed a prepared statement, to be read to the journalists, expressing his admiration for the brave people of Israel and detailing their tribulations. Politely Glubb Pasha explained that he always drafted his own statements. A blunt warning followed: if he didn’t comply, his lectures might be boycotted wherever Zionist pressures are felt. Sir John however was not for turning and on that tour his earnings fell way below the expectations of Foyles Lecture Agency.",

Because all our campsites were just places along the road, the bathroom arrangements had to be of the walk-off-into-the-bushes variety. Tending to necessities while under insect attack was a real experience. I recalled what a Siberian traveler named Hans Jacob Fries had written about this problem more than two centuries ago: Fries was a Swiss doctor whose book, Reise durch Sibirien (Travel in Siberia), described a journey he made in 1776 and, incidentally, became one of the earliest books to use that serviceable title. Fries wrote that during his passage through western Siberia he was bitten on a “delicate portion of my privy parts . . . so severely by a horse fly . . . that for three days I didn’t know where to turn on account of the pain, and I had the greatest trouble to prevent the setting in of gangrene.” The recollection of Fries’s misfortune filled me with caution, not to say fear.",

None of us wanted to ride, preferring to walk along the rusty red train track in a dutiful homage to Stand by Me. From the size of the track, no wider than one side step, the train was minuscule. Matheran had an entry fee of 25 per person, to be paid at a ticket hut before setting off on the track leading to the town. I approached the window and handed over 30. Reaching down, the vendor snapped up the three tens and pushed back my ticket along with a chocolate bar and no explanation. Confused, I peered down and was about to protest when the puzzle pieced itself together. He had no change and the chocolate was worth 5. I wondered how far the bar could move into circulation if I tried to use it to buy a cup of tea on a train. I broke it into pieces and fed it to the monkeys who bounded along behind us, grabbing at our bags, trying to fish out the remainder of the biscuits. Fed up with their stalking, we threw them a bag of Lay’s crisps that they tore open, devoured and then licked clean. It only made them keener to stick with us, seeing us now as a mobile tuck shop.",

A warm, bright fire of coals would be burning in a hearth of small dimensions, with a sturdy and sensible alignment of shovels, pokers, and tongs to one side, their brass very highly polished, and with no revolting antiquey-ness of pseudo-Revolutionary bed warmers. The mantel would be an unadorned piece of creamy marble; above, extending the entire distance to the ceiling, there would be an eighteenth-century French mirror, with a simple gilded border, somewhat mottled with small brown patches at the lower edges. The sole object upon the mantel would be an ornate, gilded, eighteenth-century clock, very feminine and delicate. All of the furniture would have strong but delicate proportions. There would be a table behind the divan—a round leaf of polished walnut. Scattered about its surface would be several periodicals and magazines: a copy of The Dial, Vanity Fair, which he might pick up without comment, tossing them back carelessly with a slight ironical lifting of the eyebrows, copies of The Century, Harper’s, and Scribner’s, but none of The Atlantic Monthly. There would also be copies of Punch, of Sketch, The Tatler, or sporting and dramatic magazines, filled with pictures of hunt and chase, and many small photographs showing members of the English aristocracy, gaunt, toothy men and women, standing, talking, tailored into squares and checks with the toes of their large feet turned inwards, or caught walking, with their open mouths awry, and an arm or leg cutting angularly the air, with such legends below as, “Captain McDingle and the Lady Jessica Houndsditch caught last week enjoying a chat at the Chipping-Sodbury Shoot.”",

By then it was too late to quit; they both had too much invested now, not even counting Snopes’s five dollars: two days of getting up before dawn, to sit for two hours in the parked car without even a cup of coffee, waiting for what they were not even sure they would recognise when they saw it. It was the third morning; McKinley and his mule had departed on schedule: so regular and normal that he and his uncle didn’t even realise they had not seen Snopes yet until Essie Meadowfill herself came out of the house on her way to work. To Charles it was like one of those shocks, starts such as when you find yourself waking up without knowing until then you were asleep; his uncle was already getting out of the car to begin to run when they saw the hog. That is, it was the hog and it was doing exactly what they expected it to do: moving toward Meadowfill’s orchard at that twinkling purposeful porcine trot. Only it was not where it should have been when it first became visible. It was going where they expected it to be going, but it was not coming from where it should have been coming from. It was coming not from the direction of Snopes’s house but from that of McKinley Smith’s. His uncle was already running, possibly from what Ratliff called his uncle’s simple instinct or affinity for being where something was going to happen, even if he wasn’t always quite on time, hurrying—Charles too of course—across the street and the little yard and into the house before old Meadowfill would see the hog through the window and make the shot.",

She stared down the audience defiantly. And then she began to belly dance.",

    "target_paragraph": "My intention was to retrace the route my father always took to my grandparents’ house in Winfield – through Prairie City, Pella, Oskaloosa, Hedrick, Brighton, Coppock, Wayland and Olds. The sequence was tattooed on my memory. Always having been a passenger before, I had never paid much attention to the road, so I was surprised to find I kept coming up against odd turns and abrupt T-junctions, requiring me to go left here for a couple of miles, then right for a few miles, then left again, and so on. It would have been much more straightforward to take Highway 92 to Ainsworth and then head south to Mount Pleasant. I couldn’t imagine by what method of reasoning my father had ever settled on this route, and now of course I never would know. This seemed a pity, particularly as there was almost nothing he would have liked better than to cover the dining-room table with maps and consider at length possible routings. In this he was like most Midwesterners. Directions are very important to them. They have an innate need to be oriented, even in their anecdotes. Any story related by a Midwesterner will wander off at some point into a thicket of interior monologue along the lines of ‘We were staying at a hotel that was eight blocks north-east of the state capitol building. Come to think of it, it was north-west. And I think it was probably more like nine blocks. And this woman without any clothes on, naked as the day she was born except for a coonskin cap, came running at us from the south-west . . . or was it the south-east?’ If there are two Midwesterners present and they both witnessed the incident, you can just about write off the anecdote because they will spend the rest of the afternoon arguing points of the compass and will never get back to the original story. You can always tell a Midwestern couple in Europe because they will be standing on a traffic island in the middle of a busy intersection looking at a windblown map and arguing over which way is west. European cities, with their wandering streets and undisciplined alleys, drive Mid-westerners practically insane.",

Bartlett contemplated the trials ahead: the polar sea ice, with its ever-shifting pack, left rifts and open leads that would prevent traveling in a straight line; when leads opened, they’d need to either find a narrow nearby crossing, or travel a mile or even farther to find a safe place to cross; to get across young or new ice, they’d need to unload sleds to avoid breaking through, ferrying smaller loads, then reload the sleds on the other side. All of this he and Hadley and Kuraluk were proficient at, but not the others. It would take a toll. And the ice they would encounter was by no means flat. Instead, Bartlett told some of the others, “The ice is continually cracking and shifting and piling up in fantastic ridges from pressure when the fissures close up … and its surface is so much rougher than the crystal levels of lakes and ponds on which the landsman goes skating that there can hardly be any comparison.”",

But what began truly to fascinate me, as I read more widely in geology, was the realization that each stone had a story attached to it: a biography which stretched backwards in time for epochs. I felt obscurely proud that my life had intersected with each of these inconceivably ancient objects; that because of me they were on a window-sill and no longer on a beach. Occasionally, I would take two stones and, cupping one in my hand, use it to shatter the other. There would be a crack, an orange sprig of fire and a smudge of rock-smoke. I would briefly be pleased that I had achieved what billennia of geophysical forces had not.",

Andreas indicated the saint and the girl. ‘Sacred,’ he said, ‘and profane: perhaps they cancel each other out. . . . They used to have his head in the cathedral in Patras, but when the Turks captured the Peloponnese, a Byzantine prince ran off with it to Rome and sold it to the Pope. One of the Palaeologues, I think. It was a sort of a passport.’ The icon’s ribbon also suspended a little chaplet of those blue beads that repel the Evil Eye from cattle; the corollas of purple plastic convolvulus nodded from the green-wrapped wire spiralling round the windscreen and a cone of tin screwed to the dashboard held three paper roses; yellow, magenta and pink. A celluloid cockatoo sprung to a rubber sucker on the pane bobbed to and fro with the jolting and the dozen cutout bluebirds glued at random about the glass completed a decor that trembled and winked like a jungle between our eyes and the stark crags into which we were climbing. Rich in modulations and orchestrated by gestures, the voice of Andreas moved from theme to theme with a smoothness surpassing any change the hoarse gears of his vehicle could attempt.",

With a fresh expenditure of persuasion and violence she got the motor going, and they backed out of the trail, and started down the mountain. About halfway of the descent Miss Spear turned into another trail, deeply shadowed, and they took out their provisions, and began to climb through the forest. Presently the little woodland noises, twitter of birds and stir of leaf, were all merged in the tinkle of an unseen brook, and a little farther on they met the brook itself, leaping down wet ledges in a drip of ferns and grasses, till it led them to the rocky pool encircled with turf of which Miss Spear had told him. There she unpacked the basket, and Vance brought two stones, and some twigs to lay across them; but they could find no dry fuel in that mossy dripping place, and had to eat their eggs raw, and munch the ham between slices of stale bread. Luckily the coffee was piping hot, and when Vance had drained his cup his tongue was loosened, and there poured from him all that he had been revolving in his mind, and thirsting to utter, since his first encounter with Miss Spear at the Willows. He could hardly keep the thread of the talk in his hands, so quickly did one idea tumble out after another, and so many new trains of thought did Miss Spear’s answers start in the coverts of his mind.",
