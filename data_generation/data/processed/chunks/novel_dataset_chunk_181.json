Miss Raycie, being crippled by rheumatism, sat above stairs in a large cold room, meagrely furnished with beadwork tables, rosewood étagères and portraits of pale sad-looking people in odd clothes. She herself was large and saturnine, with a battlemented black lace cap, and so deaf that she seemed a survival of forgotten days, a Rosetta Stone to which the clue was lost. Even to my mother, nursed in that vanished tradition, and knowing instinctively to whom Miss Raycie alluded when she spoke of Mary Adeline, Sarah Anne or Uncle Doctor, intercourse with her was difficult and languishing, and my juvenile interruptions were oftener encouraged than reproved.",

They and the wolves are the only wild beasts of the country. The latter descend during the cold months in all directions from the clefts and beech-woods of Faito on Mount Sant’ Angelo; they seldom attack “Christians.” Yet only two years ago a boy of fifteen was devoured near Cava by one of these furies–nothing was found save his feet encased in their thick boots; and a woman was lacerated by another while cooking macaroni in her kitchen. The ravening she-wolves are blamed for these desperate deeds. It was calculated that during last winter over one hundred dogs had been eaten by them in the district of Preazzano and Ticciano, which lies just outside the gates of Siren land–these gates being the openings which lead from the Sorrentine plain between walls of rock into higher regions, the flying buttresses of the mighty Sant’ Angelo.",

Berries ripen overnight; tourists lessen, trickle, then stop, as if their source dried up. Wolves and bears scarf all the calories they can find. Snowshoe hares and ptarmigan change to the white that will conceal them in snow. In Denali, summer is intermission to winter’s concert. We guzzle drinks in the lobby with friends, buy CDs, and make a quick trip to the bathroom; any minute, the lights will flicker and the rest of the show will begin.",

As I walked through the soft dawn light a fox crossed my path, trotting briskly – then took fright, dropped his empty dog-meat tin and raced away. The Zin canyon remains invisible until it’s there – an absent-minded walker could tumble over the edge into rocky depths. That edge is crumbly; but I soon found a safe way down, a pebble-slithery zigzagging goat trail. During my descent the sun rose, spotlighting the opposite cliff wall; its distinct layers of white, russet and gold were mathematically regular.",

In every exhibit room of every hall, the corners were pitch black, and the display cases were obscured by shadows. We strolled around the first floor, through a dozen rooms, each filled with glass display cases or monuments perched on pedestals. We marched backward through time. Centuries and millennia passed and history unwound with our every step. We witnessed Egypt through the ages: Roman, Greek, New Kingdom, Middle Kingdom and Old Kingdom with a few intermediary periods thrown in along the way. We admired tools and weapons and papyri and clothing and all the incredibly interesting and significant artifacts one might expect to find in one of the world’s largest and most important museums. The treasures of King Tut, unearthed near Luxor in 1922, filled a special exhibit hall, but I was more interested in the relatively mundane objects I found elsewhere.",

The path meandered and climbed, so much so that I grew breathless again and propelled myself onwards by pushing my hands against my knees, but the scenery and setting were so fabulous that I was dragged on, as if by magnets. Near the top of the hillside the path levelled out and ran through a grove of pine trees, heavy with the smell of rising sap. On one side of the path were grand villas ? I couldn’t imagine by what method they got the furniture there when people moved in or out ? and on the other was a giddying view of the island: white villas strewn across the hillsides, half buried in hibiscus and bougainvillaea and a hundred other types of shrub.",

I had arranged to meet an old friend and colleague, so I went now to Chancery Lane and caught an Underground train. I do like the Underground. There’s something surreal about plunging into the bowels of the earth to catch a train. It’s a little world of its own down there, with its own strange winds and weather systems, its own eerie noises and oily smells. Even when you’ve descended so far into the earth that you’ve lost your bearings utterly and wouldn’t be in the least surprised to pass a troop of blackened miners coming off shift, there’s always the rumble and tremble of a train passing somewhere on an unknown line even farther below. And it all happens in such orderly quiet: all these thousands of people passing on stairs and escalators, stepping on and off crowded trains, sliding off into the darkness with wobbling heads, and never speaking, like characters from Night of the Living Dead.",

Blood was soon streaming from over half the twelve players’ heads and hands and backs but they carried on regardless. The pace was tremendously fast and the horses streaked up and down the pitch foaming with sweat. Polo sticks were broken and replaced by the minute and the ball flew all over the place like a meteor – as often in the air as on the ground. The band played non-stop in time to the thudding hoofs and wild, whirling, clashing sticks and the faster the game the faster the music, till the three musicians were in almost as much of a lather as the horses.",

(I am Julian Lowe, I eat, I digest, evacuate: I have flown. This man . . . this man here, sleeping beneath his scar. . . . Where do we touch? Oh, God, oh, God: knowing his own body, his stomach.)",

Catherine, who was a mumbler, had had to speak up and sing up. There was no help for it.

Only like a bee, drawn by some sweetness or sharpness in the air intangible to touch or taste, one haunted the dome-shaped hive,* ranged the wastes of the air over the countries of the world alone, and then haunted the hives with their murmurs and their stirrings; the hives which were people. Mrs Ramsay rose. Lily rose. Mrs Ramsay went. For days there hung about her, as after a dream some subtle change is felt in the person one has dreamt of, more vividly than anything she said, the sound of murmuring and, as she sat in the wicker armchair in the drawing-room window she wore, to Lily’s eyes, an august shape; the shape of a dome.",

Dusty thickets sheltered the cicada, whose triumphant din grated and rasped through the palpitating atmosphere. In dusty enclosures, supposed to be gardens, shrivelled geraniums, scattered sparsely, alone defied the heat. Flags drooped in the stifling air. Men on the verge of sunstroke plied their tasks mechanically. Dogs, with flabby and protruding tongues, hid themselves away under archway shadows. The stones of the sidewalks and the bricks of the houses radiated a furnace heat. All nature was limp, dusty, groaning, gasping. The day was the climax of a burning fortnight of heat, drought, and dust, of baked, cracked, dewless land, and oily, breezeless seas, of glaring days, passing through fiery sunsets into stifling nights.",

Or the Jews, with their prepuce-collecting Yahweh, who created light on the first day and several days later, apparently as an afterthought, created the sun: ‘Six days He labored; on the seventh He was arrested.’ Or the Roman Catholics, with their dogmatic assertion of the physical Assumption of the Virgin Mary – launching her on a flat trajectory into outer space, like a shot off a shovel, without even a crash helmet or a pressure suit. Or the Hindus, with their sanctified ritual for nasal emunction: only one nostril may be discharged at a time, etc. Or the small-town atheist for that matter, with his Little Blue Books and sneering jokes against ancient and venerable institutions.",

Or so I thought when I walked through grand and silent rooms to a small dusty-rose and blue dining salon and was received with what appeared to be bemused contempt. I was told (but not for several awkward moments) that I had entered a working school for employees. The employees were embarrassed, not contemptuous, though the same could not be said of the clerk who deposited my traveler's checks in the safe-deposit box in apparent disbelief that I had no important jewelry to leave with her.",

I went to GUM to buy something heavy to weigh down my suitcase for the homeward journey; I was as terrified in advance of the empty suitcase as I had been of the packed suitcase. GUM, the great department store of the U.S.S.R., is a hybrid born of Macy’s basement and an oriental bazaar, and you’d have to be Russian not to see it as a big black joke. Elbowing, shoving, and pushing with the other citizens, I found a counter selling curtain material. A weary sales-woman, besieged by shoppers, got the idea that I wanted four metres of some fairly odious thick yellow cotton brocade. I took a chit to the cashier and back to the sales counter and so spent one boiling hot hour on a single purchase. Even so, a suitcase with a pair of jeans, two T-shirts, a sweater, four metres of curtain material, and a lot of scrunched-up newspaper was not going to be easy to explain.",

Her suggestion that Ralph should take Paul to his grandparents, and that the West End Avenue house should be let for the summer, was too practical not to be acted on; and Ralph found she had already put her hand on the Harry Lipscombs, who, after three years of neglect, were to be dragged back to favour and made to feel, as the first step in their reinstatement, the necessity of hiring for the summer months a cool airy house on the West Side. On her return from Europe, Undine explained, she would of course go straight to Ralph and the boy in the Adirondacks; and it seemed a foolish extravagance to let the house stand empty when the Lipscombs were so eager to take it.",

The cause was a territorial dispute between the Hudson’s Bay Company and the Russian-American Company over whether Russia or Britain possessed trading rights in specific places along the Pacific coast. In 1825, a treaty fixed an international border at latitude fifty-four degrees forty minutes north?now the southernmost point of the Alaska panhandle. A much less specific line of demarcation was drawn parallel to the irregular coast by connecting the dots of mountain summits near the Pacific. Everything west of that imaginary crooked line was Russian. That vaguely defined boundary was still uncertain when the Harriman team saw the flags waving over White Pass City, where Canadian officials extracted duties from miners on land claimed by the United States. The dispute remained unresolved until an international tribunal established the international border in its current location in 1903. Canadian frustration with Britain’s weak negotiating on its behalf?frustration that was completely justified, incidentally?accelerated the movement toward independence from the British Crown.",

An American missionary, Asenath Nicholson, who travelled through Ireland during the Famine, distributing Bibles and food, wrote of how, as flesh fell slowly from the bones, hope left the mind, until the starvation victim moved into a state of depressed inanity. She recorded that, in the ‘second stage of dying’, the starving would stand in the same spot for hours, ‘giving a vacant stare, and not until peremptorily driven away will they move’. Those even closer to death, Nicholson wrote, could be told because of the way their heads bent forwards; they would walk ‘with long strides, and pass you unheedingly’. In the workhouses, children lay for days before they died, eerily motionless. ‘In the very act of death still not a tear nor a cry,’ observed an English clergyman, Sidney Osborne, visiting a Limerick workhouse. ‘I have scarcely ever seen one try to change his or her position . . . two, three, or four in a bed, there they lie and die, if suffering still ever silent, unmoved.’ William Carleton, in The Black Prophet, his Famine novel of 1847, described the ‘fearful desolation’ he had encountered in the western parishes: gaunt figures, ‘their eyes wild and hollow, and their gait feeble and tottering’, the roads black with funerals, the death-bells pealing forth in every parish ‘in slow but dismal tones’, and how in the soup shops ‘wild crowds’ swarmed, ‘ragged, sickly, and wasted away to skin and bone’.",

It sometimes seems impossible that so many ships, of so many different flags, so many categories, can safely move in and out of such a jam-packed waterway; for some years the capsized and burnt-out hulk of the largest of all liners, the Queen Elizabeth, lay off Stonecutters Island, and it used to greet every ship entering from the west like a memento mori to navigators.2 In earlier times the traffic looked even more uncontrollable. In the last chapter we surveyed the harbour through the proud eyes of the High Victorians, and recognized only its majesty, but actually in photographs of that time it can appear almost anarchic. Quite apart from the tumult of junks, sampans, ferry-boats and launches, the big ships appear to be in a state of confusion, facing this way and that, some steaming cross-channel, some making for the open sea, some apparently sinking with the weight of the lighters moored at their flanks, or about to collide with that queer old hulk in the middle of them, the Victor Emmanuel.",

This beach does have the rented chairs but, since it joins the preserve, it’s not as crowded. We’re able to take a long, long walk on the beach followed by a siesta in our tiny individual cottage. We’re near San Vincenzo, where Italo Calvino summered. The town shops sell rubber beach balls, rafts, and sand pails. At evening, everyone strolls around buying postcards and eating ice cream. Beach towns are beach towns. We find an outdoor restaurant and order cacciucco, a big fish stew. Several kinds of fish, filleted at the cart, are piled in a large white bowl and a hot broth is poured over them. The waiter spreads creamy roasted garlic on slices of toasted bread and we float them in the soup, breathing in the heady aroma. Two fierce little bug-eyed lobsters eye us from our bowls. The waiter keeps coming around, ladling in enough to keep the bread afloat. When he brings the salad, he wheels over a cart of olive oils in crocks, clear bottles, colorful ceramic ones, dozens of choices for our salad. We ask him to select for us and he pours from on high a thin stream of pale green oil onto a bowl of red and green radicchio.",

An Australian was pressing his claim on a local girl in the next room and she, laughing, was dancing away. I saw lizards on the walls of my room, and I awoke one morning to find that the lizard was nothing but a light switch. I went up into the hills, summoning all my strength for the one-hour trip, but something in me was evacuated: a guardian spirit vanished in the night.",

Stephen was so large to be tongue-tied and frightened—a curious creature, not devoid of attraction. In a way—her own way—she was almost handsome; no, quite handsome; she had fine eyes and beautiful hair. And her body was supple like that of an athlete—narrow-hipped and wide shouldered, she should fence very well. Angela was anxious to see her fence; she must certainly try to arrange it somehow.\nMrs. Antrim had conveyed a number of things, while actually saying very little; but Angela had no need of her hints, not now that she had come to know Stephen Gordon. And because she was idle, discontented and bored, and certainly not over-burdened with virtue, she must let her thoughts dwell unduly on this girl, while her curiosity kept pace with her thoughts.\nTony stretched and whimpered, so Angela kissed him, then she sat down and wrote quite a short little letter: ‘Do come over to lunch the day after tomorrow and advise me about the garden,’ ran the letter. And it ended—after one or two casual remarks about gardens—with: ‘Tony says please come, Stephen!’",
