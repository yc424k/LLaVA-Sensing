That the ranch came with eight additional horses was not a worry. There was so much pasture we could let the horses self-feed—locals called this ‘grazing’—and still have plenty left for a few spare equines. Besides, we both wanted a radical change of lifestyle. On a ranch we’d be outdoors. I’ve read all the Little House on the Prairie books, so I knew what that meant: fixing fences, checking cows, tracking water through ditches, cutting and selling hay, bringing hot covered casseroles to neighborhood potlucks, helping those neighbors with branding. That our ranch was eighty miles and two hours of winding mountain roads from the nearest shoe store or pharmacy was put in the category of “minor inconvenience.”",

Throughout the four months I had remained very aware of the incidence of fatalities from train accidents, but had shoved the likelihood of a crash to the darkest corner of my mind and locked the door. However, in February 2009, within hours of the railway minister Lalu Prasad detailing the ‘steep reduction in the number of railway accidents’ during a parliamentary speech, the Coromandel Express had derailed 100 km from Bhubaneswar, leaving at least 15 people dead and more than 140 injured. Despite having escaped theft, injury, death and derailment in over 70 journeys, I incorporated the policy normally reserved for bus and taxi rides: I put my head down and went to sleep – waking at midnight as the heavily delayed train, number 75, rolled into the capital of Orissa.",

    "target_paragraph": "The civilian occupation of the West Bank, based on the Allon Plan, began in the hot depths of the Jordan Valley immediately after the Six-Day War in 1967. Yigal Allon, then chairman of the Ministerial Committee on Settlements, had an ambition to strengthen Israel’s defences by redrawing the border to include the Jordan Valley and Judean desert. His strategic plan, though never openly government-approved, determined settlement locations until 1977. Monika sketched its outlines without quoting its central message: ‘Maximum security and maximum territory for Israel, with a minimum number of Arabs’. Allon saw the planting of ‘a Jewish presence’ as the first step towards annexation.",

Now, appearing on the palace balcony above the square, the nation’s kindly grandmother looked close to tears. ‘Some moments ago I abdicated from the throne,’ she told the tangoed masses in Dutch, a light breeze ruffling her dark purple dress. ‘I am happy and grateful to introduce you to your new King, Willem-Alexander.’ The national anthem began to play, and the former Queen stood back from the balcony. The new King stepped forward, ruddy as a farmer in his dark suit and pale tie, flanked by his wife Maxima, an Argentinian beauty who had shaken off her past as a junta leader’s daughter to win millions of Dutch hearts. Next to the royal couple stood their three cherubic daughters, visibly nervous but as pretty as Disney princesses in their matching yellow dresses. They waved to the tangerine crowd, and applause rippled through the city like thunder.",

This village was a recruiting centre for the ‘bandits’ (Castro-speak) or ‘patriots’ (Eisenhower-speak) who fought on in these mountains until 1966, the terrain helping local militia to set up deadly ambushes while evading capture. The Escambray conflict, small scale but embittering, dragged on only because of lavish US air-drops: weaponry and food and medical supplies.",

At 6:00 A.M., as they skirted a steep rock promontory called the First Step, twenty-one-year-old Eisuke Shigekawa and thirty-six-year-old Hiroshi Hanada were taken aback to see one of the Ladakhi climbers, probably Paljor, lying in the snow, horribly frostbitten but still alive after a night without shelter or oxygen, moaning unintelligibly. Not wanting to jeopardize their ascent by stopping to assist him, the Japanese team continued climbing toward the summit.",

A timely cave, where part of the opening had been roughly walled in with dry-stone masonry to form a sheepfold, gaped invitingly at nightfall; but it was hopping with insects, so I left it for a smaller one about the size of an opera box and I can only have been asleep a little while when a liquid rippling, not caused by water, woke me up. Below, just discernible in the starlight, a great flock of sheep was on the move and hundreds of little cleft feet were trotting by. Shepherds and dogs passed in dead silence. It was as though the animals were being rustled; I watched until they had vanished, and next day they seemed like sheep in a dream.",

When Ajay is listening, his ears almost seem to perk up. If one of us speaks, he holds up his finger to silence us. He is like a concert master, listening for the viola that is out of tune. But still there is no tiger. “It is too cold for them,” Sudhir says and Ajay agrees. Tigers like the heat. No one expected this cold.\nHours go by and we keep driving around. Every so often we run into the jeep, filled with that family of disgruntled tourists, wrapped in sweaters and blankets. Our guides stop and talk in Hindi. Where can the thirty-three tigers and twelve cubs that inhabit Pench be? But we are having good luck with woodpeckers.\nWe stay out even as the sun begins slipping below the trees, and no one has seen a tiger. The game park closes in an hour, and we begin to see our breath. Sudhir asks if I am ready to return to the hotel, but I want to stay out as late as we can. I am not ready to give up the search. Ajay and Sudhir seem pleased with my decision. We’ve come to a fork in the road and Ajay points to the right. “We will go a different way now,” Sudhir says as we head off.\nAt closing time, as we leave the game park, we are silent but in a different way. I sense their disappointment. “We have a few more days,” I say.\nSudhir and Ajay exchange looks, and Sudhir explains: “Ajay is our guide only for today. Tomorrow we will have another. They are taken in order.” But I don’t want another guide. I want the man who can hear the flapping of wings and know the name of the bird.\nOn our way we drop Ajay at his home in a nearby village. The road is dusty, and the houses are mostly made of mud. We pull up to a mud house. In front a young woman in a rose-colored sari is shaping dough. She is clearly with child. Ajay greets her, and then he goes inside. Given the odds of having the same guide tomorrow, I doubt that I will see him again.",

She took her time unlocking the door and let the rain run over her plaited hair and past her eyes and down her cheeks. It struck her how quickly the meeting had unfolded, how little time it took to confirm four of her family dead. She had given those left behind a right to mourn and wear black and receive visitors who would come in, saying “Ndo nu.” She had given them a right to move on after the mourning and count Arize and her husband and parents as gone forever. The heavy weight of four muted funerals weighed on her head, funerals based not on physical bodies but on her words. And she wondered if she was mistaken, if she had perhaps imagined the bodies lying in the dust, so many bodies in the yard that recalling them made salt rush to her mouth. When she finally got the car open and Ugwu and Baby had dashed in, she sat motionless for a while, aware that Ugwu was watching her with concern and that Baby was almost falling asleep.",

Relief came in the form of a green-eyed tabby cat that slunk into the room and began weaving its way around my shins. We talked happily about cats for a good ten minutes, and then the conversation stopped again. I realized there was nothing else to say. I’d had these kind of meetings before, where everyone sits round and makes polite chit-chat and we all stubbornly avoid any mention of the current political situation in Burma. We discuss the weather, and I am asked if I have visited the ancient capital of Pagan, and then the conversation generally peters out. When the same thing happened in this case, the man’s wife gave a little bow and left the room. I told my host that I had to be going as well, and he walked me to the door. ‘You’re lucky we’re having such splendid weather at the moment,’ he said as we shook hands and said goodbye.",

This I did for hours every day, sitting in a chair. The exercise was exceedingly painful but it gradually improved my condition and eventually I was able to go out into the garden and warm myself, like an old man, in the spring sunshine.",

There they moored and went off variously to clamber over the cascades or have a swim. One of the swimmers was a young American model named Ginger Faye Meadows. As she and another young woman stood waist-deep on a rock ledge under the waterfall, one of them noticed the cold, steady eyes and half-submerged snout of a crocodile coming toward them. Now imagine it. You are standing with your back to a rock wall, much too steep and slippery to climb, with nowhere to retreat, and one of the deadliest creatures on earth is coming toward you—a creature so perfectly engineered to kill that it has scarcely changed in 200 million years. You are, in short, about to be killed by something from the age of the dinosaurs.",

Passepartout and I had begun to tremble from the caffeine and wobbled into the back of Ranjit’s jeep, which bounced and slammed along the dirt tracks to the factory. Row after row of geometrically perfect bushes stretched on for miles as pickers plucked the old leaves to make way for the second flush – provider of the purest tea. Inside the factory, Ranjit lined up a row of cups and began to slurp and hiss his way through each batch, before spitting like a cobra into a wooden column. He had the bull’s-eye precision of a pro and stepped back, gesturing towards the cups.",

    "target_paragraph": "Perhaps it was in this way that Haitians began to deceive themselves about actualities and to throw a gloss over facts. Certainly at the present time the art of saying what one would like to be believed instead of the glaring fact is highly developed in Haiti. And when an unpleasant truth must be acknowledged a childish and fantastic explanation is ready at hand. More often it is an explanation that nobody but an idiot could accept but it is told to intelligent people with an air of gravity. This lying habit goes from the thatched hut to the mansion, the only differences being in the things that are lied about. The upper class lie about the things for the most part that touch their pride. The peasant lies about things that affect his well-being like work, and food, and small change. The Haitian peasant is a warm and gentle person, really. But he often fancies himself to be Ti Malice, the sharp trickster of Haitian folk-lore.",

One after another they came out on the flat space on the top and stood overcome with wonder. Before them they beheld an immense space—grey sands running into forest, and forest merging in mountains, and mountains washed by air, the infinite distances of South America. A river ran across the plain, as flat as the land, and appearing quite as stationary. The effect of so much space was at first rather chilling. They felt themselves very small, and for some time no one said anything. Then Evelyn exclaimed, ‘Splendid!’ She took hold of the hand that was next her; it chanced to be Miss Allan’s hand.",

He never signs up, and still they let him play!” The women, after almost every shot, cried, “Amazing!” or “Pico-san’s balls are so incredible,” even though many Japanese men in our circle were far more skilled. When Hiroko came to meet me at the studio once, she marveled, “You’ve become a teen idol!” She never guessed that her bedraggled, hairless husband would become a kind of mascot, a sporty proto-Bieber in his mid-fifties.",

There was an unusually good breakfast too, which increased this feeling,—eggs and bacon, a combined luxury not before seen on our table. The fledglings hung over the stove with heated cheeks preparing relays of it under Mrs. Menzies-Legh’s directions, who, while she directed, held the coffee-pot in her arms to keep it warm. She explained she did so for my second cup. I might and indeed I would have suspected that she did so not to keep the coffee but her arms warm, if it had not been such a grilling day. Heat quivered in a blue haze over the hop-poles of the adjacent field. The sunless farmhouse looked invitingly cool and shady now that the surrounding hill-tops were one glare of light. To hold warm coffee in one’s arms on such a morning could not possibly show anything but a meritorious desire to make amends; and as I am not a man to do what the scriptural call quench the smoking flax, and yet not a man to forgive too quickly recently audacious ladies, I dextrously mingled extreme politeness with an unshakable reserve.",
