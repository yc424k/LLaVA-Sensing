I shouldn’t have worried about missing it: the entrance for the guests’ quarters was huge, a white concrete frame recalling the entrance to a Hollywood studio, set off by warm glowing lights. Juvenile palm trees sprouted alongside manicured pathways, bordering tidy flowerbeds of gerberas and chrysanthemums.",

The Limited had a barber and a ladies’ hairdresser, bathrooms with hot baths, laundry facilities, an observation car with writing tables and complimentary stationery, even a stenographer for taking dictation. It was capable of covering the 960 miles in eighteen hours, but after several crashes, including one in 1916 in which twenty-six people died, a slightly more cautious trip of twenty hours became the scheduled norm. Even so, the Twentieth Century Limited was still the fastest and most comfortable form of travel not just in America, but anywhere on earth.",

At intervals during the night I was half-awakened by the impassioned quarrelling of two men in the next room or by drunken arguing, singing and laughter from the restaurant. All-night parties were a feature of such lodging-houses; doubtless the locals slept throughout the heat of the day.",

Here one might say to those sliding lights, those fumbling airs, that breathe and bend over the bed itself, here you can neither touch nor destroy. Upon which, wearily, ghostlily, as if they had feather-light fingers and the light persistency of feathers, they would look, once, on the shut eyes and the loosely clasping fingers, and fold their garments wearily and disappear. And so, nosing, rubbing, they went to the window on the staircase, to the servants’ bedrooms, to the boxes in the attics; descending, blanched the apples on the dining-room table, fumbled the petals of roses, tried the picture on the easel, brushed the mat and blew a little sand along the floor. At length, desisting, all ceased together, gathered together, all sighed together; all together gave off an aimless gust of lamentation to which some door in the kitchen replied; swung wide; admitted nothing; and slammed to.",

He spots our red-blotched Western faces through the crowd, yells us a “welcome” and throws me a key to a church lodging. The crowd suddenly goes quiet, for all know there’s no room at the inn—this tiny town is absolutely jam-packed with people and we have just been given a true blessing. Rebecca and I cheer Peter and his priest as we battle our way back through the wet air and the swarm of thousands and thousands of south Indians. The scale and density of the crowd are extraordinary and things are far less organized and controlled than at the Kumbh Mela. In a way, the scene is also more alien. Bobbing above the sea of blue, green, pink and purple silk saris are bright orange bald heads. Men, women, children and babies have shaved their skulls and then painted them with a thick paste of sandalwood. The sight of women without hair is more shocking to me than a sadhu with a penis sword; for an Indian woman, giving her hair to God is an act of incredible devotion and commitment. Rebecca and I take photos of the grinning baldies and they pose proudly in front of giant altars they’ve carried for miles. Saint Anthony stares from a jungle setting, Saint Francis of Assisi is painted pink and blue, the angel Gabriel is decorated with tinsel and Saint Sebastian stands surrounded by flowers. The basilica’s saints are also lined up ready to be carried to the sea for Mary’s birthday party. Endless queues of people wait to kiss statues’ feet and put jasmine around laden necks.",

It made everything for the moment rather unreal: the carriers sitting in the dust, the quiet drift of huts, the forest edging up over the horizon became no more than a backcloth for a lovely unclothed cabaret figure. One couldn’t really believe in Mr Reeves, who appeared in a sinister melodramatic way from behind some curtains dressed in a scarlet fez and a long native robe; his heavy black Victorian side-whiskers, his thick grey skin, his voluptuous mouth were just part of the Paris revue. But somebody turned the gramophone off upstairs, and we were removed at once from the dour company of Mr Reeves by a smart miniature black officer with glittering gaiters. He said, ‘Won’t you come upstairs? The President will see you in a moment.’",

I’d give anything to postpone having to direct Bernard back to the hotel, an endeavor sure to prove what I’ve been saying: that I have no navigational ability whatsoever. We’re on the fourth bus to leave the hotel, which delays the inevitable for an extra hour. I’m test driving what will be my outfit for the next month: sand-colored eightpocket cargo pants, fetchingly rolled up to capri length to expose my white cotton socks. I’ve put on my favorite lavender short-sleeve shirt, which has two more pockets. Sturdy shoes are on my feet, in case walking to Ulaanbaatar becomes a reality. The overall effect is one of baggy competence. It does not boost my vanity, but does make me feel efficient.",

Despite the lateness of the hour – the round visage of a clock above the bar told him it was just four o’clock – there were several people in the place, and it was doing an open thriving business. Several men, who by their look were probably railway workers, taxi-drivers, and night-time prowlers of the station district – (one even wore black leather leggings and had the fresh red complexion and healthy robust look of a countryman) – were standing at the old dark walnut bar and drinking beer. The bartender stood behind the bar with his thick hands stretched out and resting on the bar, and with a wet cloth in one hand. He wore an apron and was in his shirt-sleeves; he had the dead eyes and heavy sagging night-time face that some bartenders have, but he could be seen talking to the men, responding to their jests, with a ready professional cordiality that was nevertheless warily ready for any situation that might come up. And further down the bar, another man was drinking beer and with him was a woman. She was one of the heavy coarsely friendly and experienced prostitutes that one also finds in railway sections; she was drinking beer, talking to the man amiably and with coarse persuasiveness, and presently she took his arm with a rude persuasive gesture and jerking her head towards the stairs pulled him towards her. Grinning rather sheepishly, with a pleased but foolish look, he went along with her, and they could be seen going upstairs. When they were gone, the other men drinking at the bar spoke quietly to the bartender, and in a moment he could see them shaking with coarse guffawing laughter. Behind the bar, in old ornately carved walnut frames, there were big mirrors, and at the top of the central mirror there was an American flag, fluted and spread fan-wise, and below this there was a picture of the beetling eyebrows and nobly Roman features of the President of the United States, Warren G. Harding. The whole place looked very old and shabby, and yet somehow warm; dingy with old lights, and stained with drink and worn with countless elbows, and weary and worn and brutal with its memories of ten thousand nights of brawls and lust and drunkenness – its immeasurable age and dateless weariness of violence and desire.",

For over two years the Sultan and his merry men roamed through Ladak and Baltistan, living on what they could pillage. Then Sultan Said died, while his son Iskander was attempting the conquest of Lhasa. During this attempt the Kashgar army was reduced, by altitude, cold and hunger, to twenty-seven men.",

Complimenti! Vai avanti! Congratulations, they would say. Go ahead. Knock yourself out. Be our guest. Nobody once said, “How completely irresponsible of you,” or “What a self-indulgent luxury.” But while the Italians have given me full permission to enjoy myself, I still can’t quite let go. During my first few weeks in Italy, all my Protestant synapses were zinging in distress, looking for a task. I wanted to take on pleasure like a homework assignment, or a giant science fair project. I pondered such questions as, “How is pleasure most efficiently maximized?” I wondered if maybe I should spend all my time in Italy in the library, doing research on the history of pleasure. Or maybe I should interview Italians who’ve experienced a lot of pleasure in their lives, asking them what their pleasures feel like, and then writing a report on this topic. (Double-spaced and with one-inch margins, perhaps? To be turned in first thing Monday morning?)",

Main Street quickly became two-lane Route 10, and we followed the winding coast until the pavement ended abruptly a few minutes later. The terminus was at the former Orca Cannery where the Harriman team had witnessed the horrors of salmon processing. The complex had since been converted into an adventure sports lodge and, aside from a few improvements (such as a heli-skiing pad), still looked just like the line drawing of Orca in the Harriman Alaska Series. We wandered the first floor, which was deserted, then returned to Bird’s Element and drove back toward town. If the Copper River Highway were ever extended, we’d be able to drive on to Chitina, Glennallen, Tok, and?assuming we didn’t take a wrong turn and end up in Chicken (pop. 7)?keep going all the way to Daytona Beach if we felt like it. It would be the epic road trip of a lifetime. I hope no one ever gets to take it.",

Getting out of Espirito Santo Bay was going to be easy – pull the pick and sail out toward the shelf taking up a south- southeasterly heading until they got to the 100-fathom line. The wind was easterly tending southeasterly, which made it a close reach. He set Monitor and let Lone Eagle do her stuff. She settled right down on the rhumb line that he had programmed into the chart plotter. Monitor was a dream, it took advantage of every lift and brought you back on your angle to wind after every knock. His eyes darted from the compass to the chart plotter and then the knot meter. Where was that counter-current?",

These were clothes for sauntering along the veranda at Mackinac or perhaps going on a jeep safari, but patently not for hiking. One of the women, arriving a few paces behind the others and walking through the mud as if it were radioactive, peered into the shelter at me and Katz and said with undisguised distaste, “Ooh, do we have to share?”",

Then it was full-golden in the evening in the theatres, shining with full-golden warmth and body on full-golden figures of the women, on fat red plush, and on the rich, faded, slightly stale smell, and on the gilt sheaves and cupids and the cornucopias, on the fleshly, potent, softly-golden smell of all the people. And in great restaurants the light was brighter gold, but full and round like warm onyx columns, smooth, warmly-tinted marble, old wine in dark, rounded, age-encrusted bottles, and the great blonde figures of naked women on rose-clouded ceilings. Then the light was full and rich, brown-golden like great fields in Autumn; it was full-swelling golden light like mown fields, bronze-red picked out with fat, rusty-golden sheaves of corn, and governed by huge barns of red and the mellow, winy fragrance of the apples.",

Much of Siberia’s taiga rests on permafrost, implying a shaky future for the forest if the permafrost melts, and a shakier one, scientists say, for the earth’s atmospheric chemistry. Huge amounts of climate-changing methane would be released into the air.",

And when he steps out of the store half an hour later, carrying his bags full of groceries, he watches in amazement as thousands of miners and farmers march down the road in front of him. The miners are in helmets and matching backpacks, and many have something slung over their shoulder. John watches in surprise and fear as one of the miners reaches into his shoulder sling, pulls out a stick of dynamite, lights it and tosses it away from the procession. This happens every few minutes, causing an almighty BOOM that shakes the street and sets off car alarms. John says it felt like he was watching a militia march into town. He gets home that afternoon visibly shaken and ready to get outta here.",

We had a conversation this very evening, I walking by the side of his horse as he rode slowly out of the town just now.

Make Sam dig you some worms and go fishing. If this family needs any head-holding-up done, I’ll tend to it myself.” He turned the knob. “Hell and damnation, all this hullabaloo and uproar because one confounded running bitch finally foxed herself.

It was an unusual place, just the same as in the photographs: there were no cars or bicycles along the streets; almost no shops or restaurants or cinemas; nothing, in fact, to distract from the spotless and unworldly hush. I walked for two hours round the city, but I came across no shocks or surprises, nothing charming or touching or strange; nothing at all, in fact. There were no smiles on the people’s faces, no fears, no expression. The ashen pallor of a ghost hung over the huge, unbending, earless streets. Here, in a sense, was Marxism in the raw and by the book; both the apotheosis of the system and its epitaph. The block-capital streets and numbered towers, the two-hundred-foot monuments and impersonal megaliths, the featureless statues and murals, seemed a kind of abstract of Communism, as flawless as a blueprint; they also seemed a kind of memento mori, the last souvenirs of a system that was elsewhere all but extinct. The more modern the buildings in Korea, the more the country felt outdated. Korea, in that sense, was generic.",
