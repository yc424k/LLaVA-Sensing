    "target_paragraph": "By June 1990, 16,250 cases of full-blown AIDS had been reported to NACP from Tanzania’s twenty regions and Dr Makwetta said it was impossible to estimate how many were dying unregistered in their homes – especially in the south – where shame remains a powerful factor. The NACP 1990 surveys found 81,000 pregnant women to be HIV + and during that year more than 24,300 Tanzanian babies were born infected. Extreme poverty, in Dr Makwetta’s view, was largely responsible for the speed of the virus’s spread. For instance, Kagera’s economy has been devastated during the past decade by a matoke weevil and the falling price of coffee (falling for the grower, not for the consumer). He therefore supported, with reservations, the latest official idea, ‘Intersectoral Co-operation’ – a five-year plan based on the collaboration of several government departments and non-governmental organisations whose responsibilities touch on various aspects of the AIDS crisis. He didn’t need to explain his reservations. I could visualise ‘Intersectoral Cooperation’ all too clearly as a menacing new breeding-ground for delay and dissension leading to paralysis.",

    "target_paragraph": "For picturesqueness Hamāh is not to be outdone by any town in Syria. The broad river with its water wheels is a constant element of beauty, the black and white striped towers of the mosques an exquisite architectural feature, the narrow, partly vaulted streets are traps to hold unrivalled effects of sun and shadow, and the bazaars are not as yet disfigured by the iron roofs that have done so much to destroy the character of those at Damascus and at Homs. The big mosque in the centre of the town was once a Byzantine church. The doors and windows of the earlier building are easily traceable in the walls of the mosque; the lower part of the western minaret was probably the foundation of an older tower; the court is full of Byzantine shafts and capitals, and the beautiful little Kubbeh is supported by eight Corinthian columns. On one of these I noticed the Byzantine motive of the blown acanthus. When they grew weary of setting the leaves in a stereotyped uprightness, the stone-cutters laid them lightly round the capital, as though the fronds had drifted in a swirl of wind, and the effect is wonderfully graceful and fanciful. Kbēs and I climbed the citadel hill, and found the area on the top to be enormous, but all the cut stones of the fortifications have been removed and built into the town below. My impression is that the isolation of the mound is not natural, but has been effected by cutting through the headland that juts out into the valley, and so separating a part of it from the main ridge. If this be so, it must have been a great work of antiquity, for the cutting is both wide and deep.",

They pitch camp at Rongbuk on 29 April, and almost immediately things start to go wrong. A blizzard – the blizzard they didn’t meet in the badlands on the way in – tears into the Base Camp. The air is furious with snow. The temperature plunges to a depth almost too low for the thermometers to record. The plan this year is even more complex and multi-cogged than the effort of two years earlier. There are more camps, more porters, more equipment. This would have been fine in good weather, but the pitiless turn in the temperature – it drops as low as fifty degrees of frost at night – has made epic even the simplest segment of the operation, the ascent of the East Rongbuk glacier. The blue surface ice on the glacier is the texture of glass and the hardness of diamond. It is difficult to walk on in hob-nailed boots, and practically impossible for the porters in their slipshod shoes. But still the expedition battles on, everybody deteriorating by the day. Reaching Camp III, the camp below the North Col, Mallory finds the dud oxygen cylinders from 1922, piled against the rough cairn they had built to commemorate the seven dead Sherpas. The whole place has changed less than he can believe possible: the cold and the altitude have done their preservative work, stopping time in its tracks. Nothing ages up here; the snow just configures and reconfigures itself, drifts up against the cairn and melts away. There is nothing to tell the time by.",

My first hike was seven kilometers; the second, fifteen; the third, eighteen; and the fourth, twenty-four. People cautioned me against attempting longer, more arduous hikes so early in my training, but moderation is not my strong suit, especially when I embrace an idea. I don’t believe in warming up (surely the mere act of getting out of bed each morning and putting on the kettle is warm-up enough), and I’ve never been good at locating my pulse, much less checking it (standing and breathing is sufficient evidence that my system is functioning).",

Night had set in for more than half an hour, but she had not had the candles lighted, for when Farfrae was away she preferred waiting for him by the firelight, and, if it were not too cold, keeping one of the window-sashes a little way open that the sound of his wheels might reach her ears early. She was leaning back in her chair, in a more hopeful mood than she had enjoyed since her marriage. The day had been such a success; and the temporary uneasiness which Henchard’s show of effrontery had wrought in her disappeared with the quiet disappearance of Henchard himself under her husband’s reproof. The floating evidences of her absurd passion for him, and its consequences, had been destroyed, and she really seemed to have no cause for fear.",

It is bordered on the south by Loch Nevis, on the north by Loch Hourn, west by the Sound of Sleet, and east by an unbelievable series of guardian mountains some over 1,000 metres. Knoydart’s claim to fame is: you can’t get there from here. Your first option is a thirty minute boat ride from Mallaig. The other is to walk over some challenging terrain, for twenty-five kilometres. The far western end once was croft land with families and sheep, supporting four families. The crofters were relocated to Mallaig and told to be fishermen, which they did. Over time, Knoydart was abandoned. Then, people started to come back. But not the people you think. As one resident says when asked how many of the people who live on Knoydart are natives or near natives, the answer is “None.” People come to Knoydart for the way of life which amounts to 125 people doing things to support themselves in various enterprises, including running the remotest pub in Scotland.",

He taught them all and everything. He carried the key to the building in his pocket as a merchant carries the key to his store. He unlocked it each morning and swept it, he divided the boys by age and size into water-carrying and wood-cutting details and by precept, bullying, ridicule and force saw that they did it, helping them at times not as an example but with a kind of contemptuous detached physical pleasure in burning up his excess energy. He would ruthlessly keep the older boys after school, standing before the door and barring it and beating them to the open windows when they broke for these. He forced them to climb with him to the roof and replace shingles and such which heretofore Varner, as Trustee, had seen to after the teacher had nagged and complained to him enough. At night passers would see the fierce dead glare of the patent lamp beyond the lean-to window where he would be sitting over the books which he did not love so much as he believed that he must read, compass and absorb and wring dry with something of that same contemptuous intensity with which he chopped firewood, measuring the turned pages against the fleeing seconds of irrevocable time like the implacable inching of a leaf worm.",

Among the local inhabitants opinions have always been divided; some say that it emits a sound like the beating of kettle-drums and then only ten or twelve times a year; others maintain that it only happens on Fridays; almost all agree that it is most likely to occur when the wind is strong from the north-west.",

It was an ice-yacht – a raft on four rubber-tyred wheels under a taut triangle of sail and manned by three reckless boys. It travelled literally with the speed of the wind while one of them hauled on the sail and another steered with a bar. The third flung all his weight on a brake like a shark’s jawbone that sent showers of fragments flying. It screamed past with an uproar of shouts as the teeth bit the ice and a noise like the rending of a hundred calico shirts which multiplied to a thousand as the raft made a sharp right-angle turn into a branch-canal. A minute later, it was a faraway speck and the silent landscape, with its Brueghelish skaters circling as slowly as flies along the canals and the polders, seemed tamer after its passing. Snow had covered the landscape with a sparkling layer and the slatey hue of the ice was only becoming visible as the looping arabesques of the skaters laid it bare. Following the white parallelograms the lines of the willows dwindled as insubstantially as trails of vapour. The breeze that impelled those hastening clouds had met no hindrance for a thousand miles and a traveller moving at a footpace along the hog’s back of a dyke above the cloud-shadows and the level champaign was filled with intimations of limitless space.",

But, as I soon found out, the chief attraction of Horonobe (population 4,600) is its generous choice of bars (there are twenty-two). The third one I hobbled into that evening had a wonderful antique draft-beer cooling machine that the mama-san had to keep stoking with ice, a twenty-year-old Wurlitzer juke box, and a massive color television on which a red-bearded American wrestler was smashing a Japanese wrestler called Strong Kobayashi over the head with a ringside chair.",

They watched her proud undulance and her balanced rhythm in the waters. She was their darling and their joy, and they loved her. The officers walked along her decks talking in low, excited voices. Sometimes one could see them alone together, gesticulating, debating passionately, pausing in silence to observe the ship again, then continuing with more vehemence and pride than before.",

Echoing the ‘tremble and obey’ injunctions of the Dragon-Emperor, Blake had gone on to warn the indigenes that, whatever their equanimity, ‘all must render implicit obedience’. All, however, did not. The Viceroy of Guangdong might sanction the new arrangements, but the people of the 400-odd New Territories villages were profoundly suspicious of them. They had more or less run their own affairs for centuries, under the quavering but familiar authority of the Manchus. Their system of land tenure was infinitely complex, their clan system powerful. They were afraid that the British would play havoc with their traditions, and grossly damage the feng shui. ‘We hate the English barbarians,’ proclaimed a placard, ‘who are about to enter our boundaries and take our land, and will cause us endless evil.’",

In one corner the men were sitting on packing boxes at a long table made of boards laid across barrels, the smoky light of little oil-lamps reddening their cheeks and deepening the furrows in their white foreheads as they laboured over their correspondence. Others were playing checkers, or looking at the illustrated papers, and everybody was smoking and talking—not in large groups, but quietly, by twos or threes. Young women in trig uniforms, with fresh innocent faces, moved among the barrels and boxes, distributing stamps or books, chatting with the soldiers, and being generally home-like and sisterly. The men gave them back glances as honest, and almost as innocent, and an air of simple daylight friendliness pervaded the Avernian cave.",

Unfortunately, the plane carrying me back to Heathrow met with a sudden snowstorm and was diverted to Amsterdam. With all flights cancelled, an unkind security guard kicked me out of Schiphol airport and I trudged through thick snow to a series of hotels, each overcrowded with other stranded passengers. Shivering in a T-shirt and cotton trousers better suited to Caribbean climes, I was seriously contemplating sleeping in a subway station when I remembered that I did, in fact, know someone who lived in the Netherlands. Kneeling by a frozen canal, I dug a sun-bleached ticket stub from the bottom of my backpack and sent a message to the skinny girl asking if she’d like to meet for dinner. She invited me round to her place in Rotterdam that evening, and I never left.",

He felt the old lift of the heart, as pristine as ever, as on the first day; he would never lose it, no matter how old in hunting and pursuit: the best, the best of all breathing, the humility and the pride. He must stop thinking about it. Already it seemed to him that he was running, back to the station, to the tracks themselves: the first train going south; he must stop thinking about it. The street was busy. He watched the big Norman draft horses, the Percherons; the trim carriages from which the men in the fine overcoats and the ladies rosy in furs descended and entered the station. (They were still next door to it but one.) Twenty years ago his father had ridden into Memphis as a member of Colonel Sartoris’ horse in Forrest’s command, up Main street and (the tale told) into the lobby of the Gayoso Hotel where the Yankee officers sat in the leather chairs spitting into the tall bright cuspidors and then out again, scot-free——",

I bend and lash together the aluminum tubing into a semicircle with an axle that runs across the bottom. All of the ends are well padded to prevent damage to the raft’s canopy or arch tube. This framework keeps the face of the bonnet open and facing the wind. The plastic still is lashed to the framework and blows forward like a small sail. I’ve fitted a piece of tubing into the bottom of the bonnet and led it inside so that when it rains I can keep busy filling containers. The bridle tied to the stern keeps the bonnet upright, but I can adjust the angle so that the face can point directly into the rain. Also note that the water collection cape is beginning to deteriorate and tear. I’ve pulled up the rusty gas bottle and have it tied to the exterior handline. For hours each day I stand and keep watch, often gazing ahead, hoping for the cloud formations to finally reveal land.",

For it is the travelers, influenced by their perceptual experience of pleasure or satisfaction at seeing and walking around Vienna and Prague, that have actually spread the message (and photos) to all future travelers about the beauty of these places.

The heavy oak tables were set about with benches, hearts and lozenges pierced the chair-backs, a massive china stove soared to the beams overhead, logs were stacked high and sawdust was scattered on the russet tiles. Pewter-lidded beer-mugs paraded along the shelves in ascending height. A framed colour-print on the wall showed Frederick the Great, with cocked hat askew, on a restless charger. Bismarck, white-clad in a breastplate under an eagle-topped helmet, beetled baggy-eyed next door; Hindenburg, with hands crossed on sword-hilt, had the torpid solidity of a hippopotamus; and from a fourth frame, Hitler himself fixed us with a scowl of great malignity. Posters with scarlet hearts advertised Kaffee Hag. Clamped in stiff rods, a dozen newspapers hung in a row; and, right across the walls were painted jaunty rhymes in bold Gothic black-letter script:",

    "target_paragraph": "In the deep shade of this perennial greenery the people dwell. The foreign houses show a very various individuality. The peculiarity in which all seem to share is, that everything is decorated and festooned with flowering trailers. It is often difficult to tell what the architecture is, or what is house and what is vegetation; for all angles, lattices, balustrades, and verandahs are hidden by jessamine or passion-flowers, or the gorgeous, flame-like Bougainvillea. Many of the dwellings straggle over the ground without an upper story, and have very deep verandahs, through which I caught glimpses of cool, shady rooms, with matted floors. Some look as if they had been transported from the old-fashioned villages of the Connecticut Valley, with their clap-board fronts painted white, and jalousies painted green; but then the deep verandah in which families lead an open-air life has been added, and the chimneys have been omitted, and the New England severity and angularity are toned down and draped out of sight by these festoons of large-leaved, bright-blossomed, tropical climbing plants. Besides the frame houses there are houses built of blocks of a. cream-coloured coral conglomerate laid in cement, of adobe, or large sun-baked bricks, plastered; houses of grass and bamboo; houses on the ground and houses raised on posts; but nothing. looks prosaic, commonplace, or mean, for the glow and luxuriance of the tropics rest on all. Each house has a large garden or \"yard,\" with lawns of bright perennial green, and banks of blazing, many-tinted flowers, and lines of Dracæna,. and other foliage plants, with their great purple or crimson leaves, and clumps of marvellous lilies, gladiolas, ginger, and many plants unknown to me. Fences and walls are altogether buried by passion-flowers, the night-blowing Cereus, and the tropæolum, mixed with geraniums, fuchsia, and jessamine, which cluster and entangle over them in indescribable profusion. A soft air moves through the upper branches, and the drip of water from miniature fountains falls musically on the perfumed air. This is mid-winter! The summer, they say, is thermometrically hotter, but practically cooler, because of the regular trades which set in in April, but now, with the shaded thermometer at 80° and the sky without clouds, the heat is not oppressive.",

It wasn’t a large building, but it gave a good grounding in the history and development of Canberra. What surprised me was how very recent most of it is. Several of the walls had blown-up photographs of Canberra as it was in times past, and most of these were arresting when compared with the present. Lake Burley Griffin,*7 for instance, wasn’t filled until 1964. Before that, for many years, it was just a muddy dip between the two halves of the city. On another wall a pair of matched aerial photographs showed Canberra in 1959 (pop. 39,000) and Canberra now (pop. 330,000). Apart from the addition of a few large buildings in what is known as the Parliamentary Zone and the filling of the lake, what was remarkable was how little changed the city looked.",

He made the summit, but it was due only to the concerted efforts of his six guides that Auldjo survived.

Thus thawed, he was able to descend the final few hours of the mountain. He staggered back to a hero’s welcome in Chamonix, spent two days recuperating, then bid a tearful farewell to his guides and set off for London.",

From the outskirts of this group Glennard wandered to another, where a voice as different as possible from Hollingsworth’s colorless organ dominated another circle of languid listeners.",

I scanned the plain, in the vain hope that some predator might make my life easy by being perched on a termite mound, and settled my eye on the baboons that were moving, softly grunting, and feeding around the deck. A distance apart sat Beau, clutching his knees and shivering. He was cold. I’d never seen an animal’s teeth chatter before, and my heart went out to him. I would have given him a blanket if I could, but he would have run away at any approach, and all he would do with a blanket was tear it up anyway. Baboons are smart, but not geniuses. Eventually he went and sat next to a female baboon, huddling against her. But she had a baby to feed, so she got up and walked away. He tried to get warmth from a young male, who also moved on; then Beau sat back down, shaking and looking miserable, the gleam in his eyes dimmed.",

Instead, we surrendered the halls to another wave of tour groups and looked for the exit. Along the way, we stopped at the mezzanine level where an arrow pointed to the restrooms. WCs, the sign read. The water closets were squalid. The rooms had no electricity, and the only light came from a slim ray of sun that sneaked through the blacked-out windows. The tile floors were pitted and worn slick from a century of use and neglect. There was no toilet paper (there never is), and there was no running water. On my way out, I bumped into a janitor. She held out the pocket of her apron and shook it with bravado: baksheesh. On the wall, right above her, another sign read No Tipping.",
