At least I thought it was correct. I gave him a pile of dinars and stumbled out. It was correct ? I recognized a corner shop ? but I still had to find my way along the steps and alleys. Everything looked different at night and I was drunk and weary.

When new to the Holy Land, my ambition was to write as ‘neutral’ a book as possible. A mere month later, sitting in Ben-Gurion airport, I confided to my diary – ‘This is a sick society! As at present constituted, Israel can’t survive.’ Even as I wrote those words I reproached myself for being so categorical at the end of a brief visit, before I had set foot in the OPT. Yet, while continuing to feel uneasy, I’ve never been tempted to moderate that first strong reaction. Therefore I was comforted by Martin Kemp’s reminder that ‘neutrality can provide a cover for amorality disguising itself as “fairness” or “impartiality”’.",

On the way from Rodger’s Harbor, they’d passed Cape Waring, and the beach was strewn with ample driftwood. Even more encouraging, “tens of thousands of crowbills were nesting on the cliffs south of Cape Waring.”* As evidence, Munro produced a dozen of the birds, which he’d shot with Malloch’s Mauser pistol. Munro thought that the best current action would be for McKinlay to go with Hadley and Kuraluk and his family there, to a prominent sandspit he’d seen near a small bay, and set up the large dome-shaped bell tents that they’d brought from the Karluk. Munro and Maurer would help McKinlay make a few trips back north to Shore Camp and guide the others there too. The hunting prospects, and arrival of birds, appeared most promising near Cape Waring. After they were all safely encamped, Munro—and possibly Maurer—would return to Templeman at Rodger’s Harbor. With this settled, Munro and Maurer departed north to Shore Camp to gather their belongings before moving down to support Templeman at Rodger’s Harbor.",

Admittedly, we were all a little nervous; feeling apprehensive because the currents below were strong. After months of training in the warm, tropical, coastal waters of Singapore, and for a couple of my teammates out of Dubai, I could hardly believe we were finally in Bhutan, ready to begin the challenge we had set ourselves a few months ago. The pristine, gushing rivers of this hidden Himalayan kingdom was a brand-new environment for us to paddle in. In truth, the moment was made even more exceptional because, ultimately, we knew we were here to support women impacted by domestic abuse, a cause in line with WOAM’s mission, and also because the adventure itself was pioneering. Indeed, we were the first team to ever Stand-Up Paddle Board in the Kingdom of Bhutan and attempt the descent of two of its rivers.",

Sometimes I was looking across wide bowls of tree-tops before plunging into them; at others, striding over grassy saddles or scrambling on those expanses that, from below, looked like bald patches; but most of the time I followed whatever dim woodland tracks I could unravel; breaking off, every so often, to side-step across unstable and irksome cascades of shale: then back under the branches. As usual, on lonely stretches, poetry and songs came to the rescue, sometimes starting echoes. I still had plenty of food; there were dozens of streams to drink from, many of them thick with watercress, and as I flung myself face down beside one like a stag at eve, I thought how glad I was, at that particular moment, not to be standing properly at ease on the parade ground at Sandhurst. Oxford would have been better; but this was best.",

An arrow on the edge of my map pointed south to Katahdin Iron Works, site of an improbable nineteenth-century factory in the woods and now a state historical monument. According to my Trail Guide there was public parking at the old iron works, so there must be a road out. At the bottom of the mountain, we watered up at a brook that ran past, and then started off along the logging road. We hadn’t been walking more than three or four minutes when there was a noise in the near distance. We turned to see a cloud of dust heading our way led by an ancient pickup truck moving at great speed. As it approached I instinctively put my thumb out, and to my astonishment it stopped about fifty feet past us.",

His family home has been turned into a hotel, he finds, and, checking in, he can only identify himself as a “foreign correspondent” (even as, of course, living in East Anglia, he writes in a language that none of his neighbors can follow). Every afternoon he sits alone in the “empty bar room,” and in the evenings he watches the regulars from the corner, a kind of shellshocked Rip Van Winkle. Those who find this too metaphorical to be true might here recall that the opening movement of the book told us that everything that Stendhal remembered of the campaign in Italy was a fiction: what is important is not just what happened, but what our fevered minds imagine to have happened.",

Where do you shop?” I asked her in genuine admiration.\n“From my own boutique in Oleyya,” she replied, coolly, blowing a smoke ring. After a moment, she went on, “This is all from my store. You should visit. Perhaps you will find something you prefer,” she replied, only a glint of excitement in her eye giving away her pride. Her accent was harsher than Zubaidah's and the color of her skin darker, closer to my own, though her English was measured and excellent. This was Hudah, born and bred in Riyadh, of an undiluted Saudi family, a family that allowed their daughter to be a business owner! In Riyadh! Immediately, I wondered if she was married but instinctively knew she was unwed. She seemed too independent. I was pleased to recognize some of myself within this woman.\nIn the Kingdom, women had been asserting their economic independence for some time. I was stunned to discover a number of other women at the party were also business owners, of clothing boutiques, hair salons, or even, like my friend Zubaidah, owners of chic stores purveying hard-to-find European wares like hand-turned glassware or rare porcelain. It is estimated that forty percent of private wealth in Saudi Arabia is held by Saudi women, and even though women are not permitted to hold a business directly, many do so through the front of a male representative, often a family member. More than fifteen thousand firms are owned and operated in this manner, and their women owners are allowed to be elected to business guilds and chambers of commerce in Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dharan.4",

Course we could do with a bit o’ wind.” I crawl up on the foredeck and stuff one of the jibs into its sack. Cold water runs down my spine and up my arms.",

At first they dance in place, alternately crouching and rising, the left hand always extended in a graceful posture, the fans fluttering ceaselessly. Then the lines begin circling, the two columns changing position with mincing, graceful steps.

They did not turn or notice him: completely absorbed in one another, it seemed to him that they had forgotten him as completely as if they had never known him, and he was suddenly stabbed with a horrible chagrin at sight of their free gaiety, a bitter anguish of despair because of the triumph of their laughter. Then he was conscious of a single, blind and overpowering desire – to get away from them, to get away unseen, to get away somewhere – anywhere – so long as he could escape the agony of meeting, the naked shame of revelation. He signalled to a waiter, paid his bill, and quickly made his way out among the tables into the noisy crowd that thronged for ever past upon the pavement. He set his face blindly away from them and plunged ahead: it seemed to him that he could hear Starwick’s shout of recognition, his voice calling to him above the thousand mixed vociferations of the crowd – and like a man pursued by devils, he set his head down blindly and fled.",

The light fell either upon the smooth grey back of a pebble, or the shell of a snail with its brown circular veins, or, falling into a raindrop, it expanded with such intensity of red, blue and yellow the thin walls of water that one expected them to burst and disappear. Instead, the drop was left in a second silver grey once more, and the light now settled upon the flesh of a leaf, revealing the branching thread of fibre beneath the surface, and again it moved on and spread its illumination in the vast green spaces beneath the dome of the heart shaped and tongue shaped leaves. Then the breeze stirred rather more briskly overhead and the colour was flashed into the air above, into the eyes of the men and women who walk in Kew Gardens in July.*",

As we neared Binz the road runs down close to the sea, and through the overhanging branches we could see that we had rounded another headland and were in another bay. Also, after having met nothing but shy troops of deer, we began to pass increasing numbers of bath-guests, walking slowly, taking the gentlest of exercise before their evening meal. Charlotte had been fairly quiet. Her head, apparently, still ached; but suddenly she started and exclaimed 'There are the Harvey-Brownes.'",

It’s a dialogue of lefts, rights, and straight aheads that we’ll repeat daily for the next five weeks, sufficient distraction that soon the cars around us fade into a blur. The route book turns out to be a practical affair, and despite my misgivings I rattle off one instruction after another without error.

I fumed inwardly at this waste of money and the consequence soon becomes apparent. Unlike the average black hospital, Botshebelo’s is underused, with numerous empty beds and some empty wards in which cheerfully chatting nurses were relaxing. Only the outpatients’ department was as busy as one would expect. Even the paediatric ward had empty cots, from which I did not deduce that the average Botshebelo child is robust. A young woman doctor, avoiding my eye, gave one explanation: ‘This is a forwarding hospital, we send the most serious cases elsewhere. And of course we also have clinics in the different sections.’ Later, Ngoako’s explanations were different. ‘They spent so much on the buildings there’s nothing over to staff and run it properly. And for most of our people even the low fees charged are too high.’ A familiar Third World story: Pretoria’s toleration of corruption aligned the white supremacists’ administration with those of Moi in Kenya, Mugabe in Zimbabwe, Mobuto in Zaire.",

After descending the front steps he stopped, as if to consider the way he should take. On seeing this through the door held open, Mr Vladimir lingered in the hall to get out a cigar and asked for a light.

    "target_paragraph": "TEXTURE AND TAGINE\nIn contrast to the sobering angst present on the truck, sites like Chefchaouen or Fez in Morocco provided such endorphin pumping positive vibes for the group that I thought if we could take the journey in little bites, from ancient desert outpost to capital city, and ignore the day-to-day animosity between the Mechanic and everyone else, we just might make it all the way to Cape Town. Like children with a sudden attack of attention deficit disorder, we all seemed to need something bigger than personalities and peeves to focus on in order to remind us that we were here to fulfill a dream. Morocco, and Fez in particular, provided just the right dose of distraction.\nMorocco is all about shape, texture, and color. Everything looks and tastes hi-def and 3-D. It all starts with the national dish, tagine. First of all, you eat tagine out of a tagine. Tagine is the only meal that has the same name as the pot it comes in. The tagine pot with its Mount Fuji-shaped lid is the color of a golden leaf in autumn and the tagine meal inside is thick and creamy. It was so delicious and the weather so cold in Morocco that we never tired of eating the hot spicy dish. With it we drank glass after glass of hot sweet tea filled to the brim with bright green mint leaves. The entire town of Chefchaouen was painted sky blue—except for the doors, which were trimmed in vibrant turquoise. Almost all the door fronts were decorated with rows of shiny bumps that looked like flattened conquistador hats. In place of knobs were enormous brass rings. Everything—spice, fabric, carpets, and lamps, even tiled Mosques––was vividly colored. It was as if a paint store exploded over the entire country. The air smelled of earth and spice. Except in Fez that is, where the air smelled like vomit.\nThe ancient city of Fez is home to an enormous grid of leather dying vats swarming with barelegged men and wet animal skins. The pungent throat-tightening stench of fermenting hides unique only to Fez was so pervasive that we could smell the vats long before we could see them. It’s an olfactory experience somewhat like a combination of fish sauce and Scott’s gym socks, only more humid. Apparently the hides are soaked in watery pigeon poo because something in the poo concoction makes the leather soft and supple. I know I’d go all floppy if you smeared pigeon poo on me too.\nAside from the odiferous funk that is Fez, it was there we felt most like time travelers. We visited the University of Al-Karaouine, which was founded in 859 CE. It is the oldest continuously operating university in the world and it looks it. Later, as we walked through the ancient souk (marketplace), we again felt as if we had stepped back in time. Until we were brought back to the present by a laugh track as we passed a café where djellaba-clad men inside were watching an American sitcom. “Hey! Seinfeld is on!” Scott exclaimed. We looked up to see thousands of satellite dishes competing for space on rooftops all over Fez. I watched the men inside sipping tea while intent on the TV screen and wondered if they had already seen “The Puffy Shirt” episode and what they would think of “The Contest.”\nWe sat down in the café to ponder the abundance of satellite dishes in Fez and ordered our second tagine meal of the day. “I can’t wait to get to the real Africa,” I said. Despite all the rich colors and aromas that surrounded us, I was anxious to get to the real Africa, the one without satellite dishes. I wanted to get to the Africa of my mind’s eye and Morocco was feeling just a bit too European. Soon I got my wish. In the coming weeks we would see parts of Africa so real I was sorry I wished for it.",
