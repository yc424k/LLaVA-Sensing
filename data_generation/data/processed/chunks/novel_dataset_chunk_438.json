The plaque is in the hand of Ingen, a Rinzai monk who fled from China to Japan after the fall of the Ming dynasty. At that time, Zen in Japan was in a state of decadence: teaching at the head temples of Daitoku-ji and Myoshin-ji in Kyoto had lost all rigor, and Zen was becoming a mere formula. When Ingen arrived in Nagasaki in 1654, he created a sensation. Tall, white-haired and austere, Ingen stood for no nonsense. ‘With a wild blow from my stick, I show who will live and who will die’, reads one of a pair of plaques by him at Manpuku-ji; on the other side, it says, ‘With a fierce Katsu! I shout who is dragon and who is snake’.",

It was hard to see how things could get worse. But, predictably, they did. We could hear the distant sound of running water. We knew that our intended path tracked downhill to the valley bottom, and that water travels downwards. Therefore, I reasoned, using mountain skills honed via considerable experience of watching Bear Grylls, that if we found the river and followed it, we'd eventually reach our destination. We slogged across the boggy ground, at times up to our knees in slimy mud. The waterproof qualities of our walking boots now punished us by retaining water rather than repelling it, and we squelched, slid and stumbled towards the river, which turned out to be a small, fast flowing mountain stream.",

    "target_paragraph": "I liked Weymouth a good deal more than I’d expected to. It has two claims to fame. In 1348 it was the place where the Black Death was introduced into England, and in 1789 it became the world’s first seaside resort when that tedious lunatic George III started a fashion for sea bathing there. Today the town tries to maintain an air of Georgian elegance and generally nearly succeeds, though like most seaside resorts it has about it a whiff of terminal decline at least as far as tourism goes. The Gloucester Hotel, where George and his retinue stayed (it was a private house then), had recently closed and now Weymouth didn’t have a single decent large hotel, a sad omission in an old seaside town. But I’m happy to report that it did have many good pubs and one outstanding restaurant, Perry’s, all of them in the harborfront district, a renovated area with fishing smacks bobbing on the water and a jaunty nautical air that makes you half expect to see Popeye and Bluto come loping round the corner. Perry’s was crowded and cheerful and a joy to the spirits after Lulworth. I had local mussels from Poole—after three days of hard walking it came as a shock to realize that Poole was still local—and a highly creditable sea bass, and afterward retired to the kind of dark and low-ceilinged pub where you feel as if you ought to be wearing a bulky Arran sweater and a captain’s cap. I enjoyed myself very much and drank so much my feet stopped aching.",

As she moved beside him, with her long light step, Selden was conscious of taking a luxurious pleasure in her nearness: in the modelling of her little ear, the crisp upward wave of her hair – was it ever so slightly brightened by art? – and the thick planting of her straight black lashes. Everything about her was at once vigorous and exquisite, at once strong and fine. He had a confused sense that she must have cost a great deal to make, that a great many dull and ugly people must, in some mysterious way, have been sacrificed to produce her. He was aware that the qualities distinguishing her from the herd of her sex were chiefly external: as though a fine glaze of beauty and fastidiousness had been applied to vulgar clay. Yet the analogy left him unsatisfied, for a coarse texture will not take a high finish; and was it not possible that the material was fine, but that circumstance had fashioned it into a futile shape?",

A thousand men, with white-bearded old General Rosalio Hernandez riding ahead, went out almost at once, and the repair train followed them a few miles to a place where the Federals had burned two railroad bridges a few months before. Out beyond the last little bivouac of the immense army spread around us, the desert slept silently in the heat waves.\nThere was no wind. The men gathered with their women on the flat-cars, guitars came out, and all night hundreds of singing voices came from the trains.",

Five miles is still Hogganbeck range, even if we wasn’t downwind.” They went on. The boy could still hear Boon talking, though presently that ceased too. Then once more he and Sam stood motionless together against a tremendous pin oak in a little thicket, and again there was nothing. There was only the soaring and sombre solitude in the dim light, there was the thin murmur of the faint cold rain which had not ceased all day. Then, as if it had waited for them to find their positions and become still, the wilderness breathed again. It seemed to lean inward above them, above himself and Sam and Walter and Boon in their separate lurking-places, tremendous, attentive, impartial and omniscient, the buck moving in it somewhere, not running yet since he had not been pursued, not frightened yet and never fearsome but just alert also as they were alert, perhaps already circling back, perhaps quite near, perhaps conscious also of the eye of the ancient immortal Umpire. Because he was just twelve then, and that morning something had happened to him: in less than a second he had ceased forever to be the child he was yesterday. Or perhaps that made no difference, perhaps even a city-bred man, let alone a child, could not have understood it; perhaps only a country-bred one could comprehend loving the life he spills. He began to shake again.",

Now that Starwick was here, this unfamiliar world, in whose alien life he had struggled like a drowning swimmer, became in a moment wonderful and good. The feeling of numb, nameless terror, rootless desolation, the intolerable sick anguish of homelessness, insecurity, and homesickness, against which he had fought since coming to Paris, and which he had been ashamed and afraid to admit, was now instantly banished. Even the strange dark faces of the French as they streamed past no longer seemed strange, but friendly and familiar, and the moist and languorous air, the soft thick greyness of the skies which had seemed to press down on his naked sides, to permeate his houseless soul like a palpable and viscous substance of numb terror and despair, were now impregnated with all the vital energies of living, with the intoxication of an unspeakable, nameless, infinitely strange and various joy. As they walked across the vast court of the Louvre toward the great arched gateway and all the brilliant traffic of the streets, the enormous dynamic murmur of the mysterious city came to him and stirred his entrails with the sensual premonitions of unknown, glamorous and seductive pleasure. Even the little taxis, boring past with wasp-like speed across the great space of the Louvre and through the sounding arches, now contributed to this sense of excitement, luxury and joy. The shrill and irritating horns sounded constantly through the humid air, and filled his heart with thoughts of New Year: already the whole city seemed astir, alive now with the great carnival of New Year’s Eve.",

I was strangely nostalgic about the journey’s end, knowing I would miss the ritual of getting up every day to meet a cool morning, the smell of smoke from the fires that huddles of locals made to warm themselves. How weird it is to breathe dust and exhaust all day, to battle heat and truck horns and piles of shit on the road and yet want to be nowhere other than where you are. Since my plan was to head home and settle, I knew this would likely be my last big drifting, impulsive travel adventure.",

    "target_paragraph": "The first months of his life were passed at Three Mile Cross, a working man’s cottage near Reading. Since the Mitfords had fallen on evil days – Kerenhappock was the only servant – the chair-covers were made by Miss Mitford herself and of the cheapest material; the most important article of furniture seems to have been a large table; the most important room a large greenhouse – it is unlikely that Flush was surrounded by any of those luxuries, rain-proof kennels, cement walks, a maid or boy attached to his person, that would now be accorded a dog of his rank. But he throve; he enjoyed with all the vivacity of his temperament most of the pleasures and some of the licences natural to his youth and sex. Miss Mitford, it is true, was much confined to the cottage. She had to read aloud to her father hour after hour; then to play cribbage; then, when at last he slumbered, to write and write and write at the table in the greenhouse in the attempt to pay their bills and settle their debts. But at last the longed-for moment would come. She thrust her papers aside, clapped a hat on her head, took her umbrella and set off for a walk across the fields with her dogs. Spaniels are by nature sympathetic; Flush, as his story proves, had an even excessive appreciation of human emotions. The sight of his dear mistress snuffing the fresh air at last, letting it ruffle her white hair and redden the natural freshness of her face, while the lines on her huge brow smoothed themselves out, excited him to gambols whose wildness was half sympathy with her own delight. As she strode through the long grass, so he leapt hither and thither, parting its green curtain. The cool globes of dew or rain broke in showers of iridescent spray about his nose; the earth, here hard, here soft, here hot, here cold, stung, teased and tickled the soft pads of his feet. Then what a variety of smells interwoven in subtlest combination thrilled his nostrils; strong smells of earth, sweet smells of flowers; nameless smells of leaf and bramble; sour smells as they crossed the road; pungent smells as they entered bean-fields. But suddenly down the wind came tearing a smell sharper, stronger, more lacerating than any – a smell that ripped across his brain stirring a thousand instincts, releasing a million memories – the smell of hare, the smell of fox. Off he flashed like a fish drawn in a rush through water further and further. He forgot his mistress; he forgot all human kind. He heard dark men cry ‘Span! Span!’ He heard whips crack. He raced; he rushed. At last he stopped bewildered; the incantation faded; very slowly, wagging his tail sheepishly, he trotted back across the fields to where Miss Mitford stood shouting ‘Flush! Flush! Flush!’ and waving her umbrella. And once at least the call was even more imperious; the hunting horn roused deeper instincts, summoned wilder and stronger emotions that transcended memory and obliterated grass, trees, hare, rabbit, fox in one wild shout of ecstasy. Love blazed her torch in his eyes; he heard the hunting horn of Venus. Before he was well out of his puppyhood, Flush was a father.",

Between 1991 and 1994 army numbers were reduced from 55,000 to 37,000 and since Soviet subsidies ended the LPA has received no outside funding and neither bought nor repaired weapons – a healthy situation, in my view. Less healthy is the new dependence of ill-paid (or unpaid) soldiers on ‘private enterprise’. The us State Department alleges that the Lao government and army are into drug trafficking and encourage the Hmong to grow both opium and marijuana. Given the source of this allegation, one’s first reaction is scepticism – nor is there any shred of evidence to link the government with such trafficking. However, the army’s peculiar circumstances (local commanders unable to pay their men) make it seem likely enough that certain LPA officers, following the French example, are taxing rural opium traders.",

Westward, but still within the borders of the good, green East, that night-time glow and smoulder of hell-fire is Pittsburgh. Here, St. Louis, hot and humid in the cornfield belly of the land, and bedded on the mid-length coil and fringes of the snake.

This was not due to poor planning but because space in our small refrigerator was too valuable to devote to egg storage when we left Samoa. We later shifted some eggs into the cooler as space was freed up, which extended their shelf life. It’s well known to long distance sailors that fresh eggs that have never been cold stored will last for more than a month without refrigeration, even in tropical heat, if they are turned every day. The easiest way to turn eggs is to take the whole carton or plat and flip it upside down one day and right side up the next, alternating the orientation every day. This keeps the inside of the shells moist and non-porous, preventing oxidation from taking hold.",

As he stepped up his anti-immigration rhetoric, pies were thrown and violence threatened. Fortuyn, however, didn’t take his critics too seriously. According to one report, when he was assigned a new group of bodyguards, he took them out drinking for the evening and ended up helping them home.",

Brochures circulated around the world, enticing packs of male visitors from Japan and Germany and the Gulf on special sex-tour vacations with the assurance that in Bangkok “you can pick up girls as easily as a pack of cigarettes” (those who found even that too onerous could select their companions from photo booklets before leaving home). In the city itself, accredited tourist agencies organized expeditions around Bangkok’s most breathtaking natural wonders—its pretty shopgirls. By now, in fact, an estimated 60 percent of all the country’s visitors came only for the dirt-cheap sex, and more than a million girls were waiting to oblige them. And since their international reputation—not to mention their gross national product—depended on the mass production of pleasure, the authorities made sure that the fantasy business was the best-run industry in town: well organized, fastidiously tended and lavishly displayed. All the playboys of the Western world made for Bangkok, and Bangkok was increasingly made for them.",

Nowadays most of the drinkers were day visitors from the cruise ships, who thronged the Front Street shops selling jewelry, sweatshirts, and other mementos. From what I could tell from looking through the windows of congested stores, the sale of useless junk to transients was the biggest driver of Ketchikan’s economy. I asked Kiffer about a rumor that all the waterfront shops were secretly owned by the cruise companies. “I’ve been trying to answer that same question for ten years,” he said.",

Built on top of the Rift wall, it was a charming stylish resort hotel, set in a garden, with plenty of normal people wearing summer clothes and drinking around the swimming pool.

The icy water gripped my ankles, then ran into my boots. Suddenly it became much deeper. The current was strong. Too strong. My grip on Syd’s arm tightened. Despite the flat rocks, I had to lean into it, fighting the current to keep from being pushed over. Bending my knees, I leaned forward, found footing, then forced my leg on, dragging it against the flow. Teeth clenched, heart pumping, we edged on. The water splashing up over my shirt. The current shifting about me like a wrestler looking for an opening. The cold water numbed my legs. My pack with its open belt shifted about. But I went on, drawn by Syd’s guiding arm.",

The degree to which one learns to listen to the voice of the journey is the degree to which one enjoys the journey and benefits from it.

The view is of Harris and Lewis and, most probably, a view I will never see again. Nor is it likely I will get to the Hebrides again in my lifetime, which is a double edged sword. It is beautiful there. But, it will change and, I am thinking, not in a good way. I am getting depressed. Time to find tea and cake. At Ardmair, the nominated tea shop does not exist anymore. The next twelve kilometres is a really long, slow grind up, with one spectacular outlook, and another promised tea shop at Drumrunie. This also does not exist. North of Ullapool is not where tourists go. They go back to Inverness. I am headed into the wilderness, sort of, where civilised opportunities such as shops and tea houses are rare finds. What replaces these creature comforts is spectacular beauty. But for now, I am thinking tea and cake would be nice.",

Without a pause, and possibly guided by the stray beam of light on the landing, the new-comer ascended the staircase as the first had done. Grace started: it was a lady. Grace was sufficiently visible, and the lady came to her side.",

Thus she proceeded mile after mile, ascending and descending till she came to Bulbarrow, and about midnight looked from that height into the abyss of chaotic shade which was all that revealed itself of the vale on whose farther side she was born. Having already traversed about five miles on the upland she had now some ten or eleven in the lowland before her journey would be finished. The winding road downwards became just visible to her under the wan starlight as she followed it, and soon she paced a soil so contrasting with that above it that the difference was perceptible to the tread and to the smell. It was the heavy clay land of Blackmoor Vale, and a part of the Vale to which turnpike-roads had never penetrated. Superstitions linger longest on these heavy soils. Having once been forest, at this shadowy time it seemed to assert something of its old character, the far and the near being blended, and every tree and tall hedge making the most of its presence. The harts that had been hunted here, the witches that had been pricked and ducked, the green-spangled fairies that ‘whickered’ at you as you passed; – the place teemed with beliefs in them still, and they formed an impish multitude now.",

Dick Cook shot a wolf near Eagle not long ago and stewed it in a twenty-one-quart pressure cooker. His ilk in eager numbers gathered around the pot and ate twenty-one quarts of wolf. Not all gatherings are impromptu. To celebrate the 1976 vernal equinox, for example, the river people held a tribal convention just below the mouth of the Nation. It was planned many months in advance and went on for nearly a week. To them, the vernal equinox is a more important date than Easter, just as December 21st is a more important date than Christmas, and in each case by a factor so large it tends to dismiss the comparison. The vernal equinox is the fulcrum of light and dark which holds the promise of warmth to come, of the summer fish runs and garden harvests, the growth of Brussels sprouts and Mary Jane. Nearly everyone grows the latter. The law does not frown upon the practice in Alaska. In the long northern light, the compound serrate leaves will rise on tall stems to the height of a man, and as whole stands come together, enmeshing, interdigitating, they form colonies of such spiky luxuriance that small segments of the banks of the Yukon appear to have been painted there by Henri (le Douanier) Rousseau.",

He dropped a long pole between the Xs, tying it down securely. He reinforced each end with a third pole, tied at the crotch of each X, the lower end jammed into the ground. He tied everything together with panchos, the fibres between the bark of a tree and its wood. (Balsa trees yield good, strong panchos, though climbing vines, which are always abundant, are surprisingly resilient and can be tied into many knots without breaking.)

Every day he rode out sight-seeing. This morning I followed him and looked at the buildings he looked at. There is not much left. Seven minarets and a broken mausoleum are all my portrait of the age. But their history supplies the rest, and for this I must turn to later writers, soldiers and archaeologists. Two in particular have guided my curiosity here.",
