Everything in it was harmoniously shabby, with a subtle sought-for shabbiness in which Darrow fancied he discerned the touch of Fraser Leath.

He has, at a conservative estimate, sixty-one hundred pairs of running shoes, and every one of them represents a greater investment of cumulative design effort than, say, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge. These shoes are amazing. I was just reading a review in one of his running magazines of the latest in “Sport Utility Sneakers,” as they are evidently called, and it was full of passages like this: “A dual density EVA midsole with air units fore and aft provides stability while a gel heel-insert absorbs shock, but the shoe makes a narrow footprint, a characteristic that typically suits only the biomechanically efficient runner.” Alan Shepard went into space with less science at his disposal than that.",

    "target_paragraph": "There was not much room to move in the first flat I tried that afternoon. The floors were blocked with trunks, crates and containers of varied and enigmatic shapes, with THE KOSHKA BROTHERS stencilled over them in scarlet letters. Multilingual posters displayed the masked and hooded Brothers crossing gorges on tight-ropes, shooting each other out of cannon, flying through the air to clasp hands in a criss-cross of spotlights, piling up in precarious and many-layered pagodas and thundering round the insides of giant barrels on motor bicycles. There were Koshka sisters too, and white-haired ancestors and crawling descendants, all talking volubly in Czech. They were athletic, smiling, handsome, slightly stunned-looking and nearly identical figures who continued flexing their knees and feeling their biceps as they spoke, or slowly rotating alternate shoulder blades. I was lost for several minutes in this crowd. At last, with sinking heart, I approached a muscle-bound patriarch and mumbled my set proposal about doing a sketch. He spoke no German, but he gave me a friendly pat and despatched a descendant into the next room, who returned carrying a glossy photograph of the whole tribe. It showed all the Koshkas balanced in a vertiginous grande finale of which he was the supporting Atlas at the base. He signed it with a friendly message and a flourish and led me politely from Koshka to Koshka and each of them, from the seasoned grandsire to the minutest of unbreakable tots, added a signature with a kind word or two and a fringe of exclamation marks. When all the signatures had been garnered, I again murmured something about doing a sketch, but in a strangled voice, for my nerve had long gone. There was a pause, then they all burst out in a joyful deprecating chorus: ‘No! No! No! Iss a present! For de Picture, ve take not vun groschen! Not vun! Iss free!’ But they were sincerely touched at the idea of my pilgrimage.",

In January 2015, Shaimaa El Sabbagh, a member of Socialist Popular Alliance, was shot and killed by Egyptian police at Tahrir while she placed flowers on a memorial. Witnesses said the police opened fire with no warning, and Shaimaa died on the sidewalk, in her husband’s arms. We were advised to avoid protests at all times.

But there is a whole legion of windmills, and Don Quixote would have gone off his head. There they spin, hither and thither, upon the pale-blue sea-levels.

Perhaps it shouldn’t have been surprising, since he was in the film business and knew all about lenses and cameras. His favorite subjects were his children, and he filled albums with our pictures. He also took some surf shots of me, Domenic, and Becket at Rincon, Secos, and Zuma, and that was where he got the article idea. He saw that I was always glued to the surf mags. He knew I liked to write. If I would just write a story for a surf mag, he would supply the pictures. I tried to explain that the surf mags didn’t care about writing, they cared about pictures, and that he would never in this life take a photograph they would publish—not unless he moved to the North Shore and followed the top surfers everywhere for a couple of winters and got very, very lucky. Nonsense, he said. The article was the thing. If it existed, he could supply adequate pics.",

After sleeping at Islamkillah, the frontier post, we bumped across the twelve-mile strip of no-man’s-land that separates the two countries, accompanied by flocks of marsh birds and their gloomy plaints. At Kariz, while the Persian customs delayed us, a German accosted me. He had just escaped from Russia, where he had been naturalised, and had walked this far on his way to India, only to be turned back by the Afghan authorities. His wife was ill in the village; they were penniless and desperate. I was fumbling for some money to give him, when he vanished in a fit of pride.",

It was a beautiful bush, spreading very widely, and all the time she had sat there talking she had been noticing the patches of shade and the shape of the leaves, and the way the great white flowers sat in the midst of the green. She had noticed it half-consciously, nevertheless the pattern had become part of their talk. She laid down her sewing, and began to walk up and down the garden, and Hirst rose too and paced by her side. He was rather disturbed, uncomfortable, and full of thought. Neither of them spoke.",

On their backs they carry knapsacks and in their hands, sometimes a stick, sometimes a stout umbrella; I have seen them making the ascent of the Viale dei Colli at Florence with ice-axes. They are the Wander-Birds, and they come, as their name (so romantic and applied so unironically), their Schillerian name too manifestly proclaims, from Germany. Many of them have walked all the way, across the Alps from Berlin to Taranto and back, with no money, living on bread and water, sleeping in barns or by the road-side. Adventurous and hardy youths! I feel the profoundest admiration for them. I even envy them, wishing that I possessed their energy, their hardiness. But I do not imitate them.",

We saw the monarch go out to the chase, and heard the roaring of the lion, half paralyzed by the dart in its spine, which animates the stone with its wild anguish. Human victims cried out under nameless tortures; the tide of battle raged against the walls, and, red with carnage, rose into the palaces.

By 2001 this educational establishment had aroused such public concern that it became WHISC, the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. Norma laughed angrily. ‘The phrase “security cooperation”, that’s supposed to make torture acceptable – inevitable, for “homeland safety”! The name change was a sop to the House of Representatives who wanted to close SOA and hold a congressional investigation. That was a bi-partisan move, defeated by only ten votes.’",

We turned a corner and saw, gleaming in the distance, the golden roofs of the Potala, the winter residence of the Dalai Lama and the most famous landmark of Lhasa. This moment compensated us for much. We felt inclined to go down on our knees like the pilgrims and touch the ground with our foreheads. Since leaving Kyirong we had covered over six hundred miles with the vision of this fabulous city ever in our mind’s eye. We had marched for seventy days and only rested during five. That meant a daily average of almost ten miles. Forty-five days of our journey had been spent in crossing the Changthang—days full of hardship and unceasing struggle against cold, hunger and danger. Now all that was forgotten as we gazed at the golden pinnacles—six miles more and we had reached our goal.",

There is a government hospital in Bangli for mental patients, but families seem reluctant to send sick people to seek professional help. The people in our village just ignore these problem citizens if at all possible. There are psychiatrists, but the families of the unbalanced people do not seem to want to seek their services.",

There were the carts waiting, drawn up along the street; and the packages sliding down into them from the warehouses. Again they came out in front of St Paul’s. He looked up. There was the same old man still feeding the sparrows. And there was the Cathedral. He wished he could feel again the sense of weights changing in his body and coming to a stop; but the queer thrill of some correspondence between his own body and the stone no longer came to him. He felt nothing except anger. Also, Sara distracted him. She was about to cross the crowded road. He put out his hand to stop her. ‘Take care,’ he said. Then they crossed.",

He has a quietly modulated voice, and the wide stare of a wounded creature. He grew up mostly in Wisconsin, stepson of a railroad switchman, and went to Cudahy High School, in Milwaukee, and straight into the U.S. Marines. He worked for eight years on the assembly line at American Motors. “That’s enough to drive a man completely insane.” It drove him, at any rate, to Vietnam—as a reënlisted Marine. “That’s one place I’d rather forget, to tell you the truth. I hear all this petty-ante bitching around here, and I think, They should really have something to bitch about. This town is divided between the outlaws and the do-gooders. I don’t give a damn about their stories about each other. I try to stay out of it. This is just like every other bush town. If I could be, I’d be in the high country, or on the Yukon River.”",

There is only one network in Norway and it is stupefyingly bad. It’s not just that the programmes are dull, though in this respect they could win awards, but that the whole thing is so wondrously unpolished. Films finish and you get thirty seconds of scratchy white circles like you used to get when your home movies ran out and your dad didn’t get to the projector fast enough, and then suddenly the lights come up on the day’s host, looking faintly startled, as if he had been just about to do something he wouldn’t want the nation to see. The host, always a handsome young man or woman with a lively sweater and sculpted hair, fills the long gaps between programmes by showing endless trailers for the rest of the evening’s highlights: a documentary on mineral extraction in Narvik, a Napoleonic costume drama in which the main characters wear moustaches that are patently not their own and strut around as if they have had a fence post inserted rectally (but are trying not to let it affect their performance) and a jazz session with the Sigi Wurtmuller Rhythm Cadettes. The best that can be said for Norwegian television is that it gives you the sensation of a coma without the worry and inconvenience.",

She was a fresh, pretty woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves. Her starched skirts crinkled as she came and went. Farther down, before one of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down, telling her beads. A good many persons of the pension had gone over to the Chênière Caminada in Beaudelet’s lugger to hear mass. Some young people were out under the water- oaks playing croquet.

Cripples and lepers line the paths, their sores weeping with pus, twisted and bleeding stumps for limbs. Camels, horses and Jeeps stir up the fine sand that swirls upward, caking my skin, encrusting my eye sockets and grinding between my teeth. Smells rise: shit and burning onions, incense and urine, sandalwood and spicy sweat, heady hash and burning cowpatties.",
