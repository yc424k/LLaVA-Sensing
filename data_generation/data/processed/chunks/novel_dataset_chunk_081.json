It is the Little Palace, not often visited and never owned by the state, so that it has a different quality from the rest, more what it all was for Count Fede. You go back from Roccabruna or scramble up behind the Serapeum, through mud and nettles and barbed wire, and find yourself after a while in a court probably as rich and glittering once as most of the big palace, but so tangled and shady and still now, it is as though somewhere among the olives you had crossed a line beyond which the tremendous tensions of the villa have no more hold; they have snapped away from you, and you have moved on in a sudden lightness and peace to another kind of place. The ruins do not stick out here; a single dead pine towering over the grove, a shiny skeleton without a green twig or a stitch of bark left, that ought to have toppled years ago, has far more rage and drama. They have given in; their geometry is dominated by trees and innumerable birds, thrushes and all kinds of little field ones and nightingales, and over your head the roots of other trees push clutching and fearfully exposed, like the minds of sleepwalkers, down the ancient walls.",

Wherever a man of dignity was needed, there stood Hoover. To give the commerce secretary his due, he presented an air of statesmanship that the president declined to provide. It was he who addressed the nation by radio. “It is difficult to picture in words the might of the Mississippi in flood,” Hoover reported to the nation from Memphis. “To say that two blocks from where I stand it is at this minute flowing at a rate ten times that of Niagara seems unimpressive. Perhaps it becomes more impressive to say that at Vicksburg the flood is 6,000 feet wide and 50 feet deep, rushing on at the rate of 6 miles an hour. Behind this crest lies the ruin of 200,000 people. Thousands still cling to their homes where the upper floors are yet dry.… This is the pitiable plight of a lost battle.”",

    "target_paragraph": "I had seen not one tourist in Jericho and next morning I discovered why. By chance, while seeking the sixth-century Shalom Yisrael synagogue, I came upon their ghetto, a few miles from the centre, reeking of affluence. Here were spacious grounds startlingly litter-free (not a cigarette butt in sight), two long swimming-pools shimmering invitingly, another empty as a concession to the prevailing drought, and tastefully tiled paths winding between high glossy green hedges, trimly shaped. The eight-storey hotel overlooked rows of Miami-style bungalows from which, at 7.30 a.m., aged couples were making their way to an acre-wide restaurant. Behind the hotel a bamboo grove concealed five coaches: Israel-registered, Hebrew-scripted, their passengers’ nationalities pasted in English on the windscreens – American, Russian, Japanese, French, British. The lack of security astounded me; I was strolling around with a knapsack on my back having walked unchallenged through the main gateway. Then I visited a ‘Ladies’ Rest Room’ opposite the reception desk where a crimson-faced Texan granddad was having a tantrum about a mistreated shirt, sent to the laundry with all its buttons but returned without any. I spent a long time in the ‘Ladies’, having a thorough wash-down (the first for days) yet when I emerged nobody seemed to notice my surely unauthorised presence. It would have been easy to plant a bomb or two in waste-bins. From this Jericho Resort Village tourists are driven to romantic Ancient Jericho, then returned to Jerusalem on a main road by-passing the impoverished reality of contemporary Jericho.",

It would have been better to borrow one from the techniques photographers use to ‘blow up’ a negative. But seen objectively, from the other end of the corridor – from the Cyprus which I had known two years before – the image changed. The outlines of all that we know as civic life grew hazy with the Habeas Corpus Act lying sus­pended, Communist and Enotist alike behind bars, and the press under restriction; this was a state at war with itself.",

Rows of the same thin plywood shacks, shuttered and boarded, lined each small bay. Yet the day was fine. The only clouds were the cream-white halo that capped Mount Kimpoku on distant Sado. The light August breeze in the pine groves teased out their fragrance and sent it scurrying with me up toward the low hills. Ahead of me a car stopped and an irate-looking man climbed out and began to scoop a space for me on his cluttered back seat.",

But the locals who were crowding the narrow aisles had no time for such common-or-garden fare. They had come to savor the real exotica: bright orange toy guitars; a bowling shirt that read “Rick’s Carpet Center, Granada Hills”; and posters, fluttering along the sides of ramshackle stalls, of Jennifer Beals and Phoebe Cates—the newly canonized goddesses of the Orient—sitting in Mustangs, showing off UCLA letter jackets or simply carrying themselves as embodiments of the Promised Land. The largest crowd of all congregated around a craftsman who was meticulously brass-rubbing Maidenform ads onto T-shirts.",

As train number six clattered across the Panval Nadi bridge near Ratnagiri, a nauseating thrill swirled in my stomach as I peered between my knees at the drop. A sheet of water stretched to the horizon and I thought of King Thebaw, one of the few characters in The Glass Palace based on a real person. In 1885, he and his family were exiled by the British from Burma to Ratnagiri, where he lived out his remaining years in a rundown palace. The palace still remains in Ratnagiri and I imagined the king standing at his bedroom window every morning, looking out through his binoculars across this expanse of grey-blue water, watching for boats and signs of visitors.",

Before unpacking, Gillian went back to the front desk and approached the desk clerk and explained his need to study. The woman told her about a basement room they had that was vacant and went on to explain that it was a big room with a king-size bed, a kitchenette, and a conference table. It was perfect. They moved their bags, and Gillian checked out the kitchenette – “This will work,” she said and grabbed her purse and headed for the door – “Going to do a bit of shopping for dinner.”",

In 1929, Sarnoff attended a conference of radio engineers in Rochester, New York, and there saw a presentation by a clever inventor named Vladimir Zworykin. Like his compatriot Igor Sikorsky, the aircraft designer, Zworykin had grown up rich in Russia but had fled to America following the Russian Revolution. Although Zworykin spoke almost no English on arrival, he landed a job with Westinghouse in Pittsburgh and so impressed the directors that he was soon given his own lab.",

A couple of months later, twenty police cars would descend on this site at night, catching eighty men in the middle of sex acts and dragging them out of the bushes to detain and question them. After the police mandated blood tests and forced the men to produce their ID cards, it would be revealed that many of them were married. For some of the wives, the arrest wouldn’t come as a surprise. For others, it would.

Already, sleek new towers were coming up in every corner of the city to house visitors; there were said to be more first-class hotels on Orchard Road alone than in all Australia. But none of them would ever be able to offer memories and experiences dating back to the year of Victoria’s Jubilee. Raffles was the place where, as J. G. Farrell had it, one could taste “the old feeling of space and tranquility which used to make Singapore such a pleasant place to live in”. And in a city that was developing “vertical farms” and high-rise factories, Raffles was a blessedly al fresco and human-scaled place where, in Farrell’s words, locals gathered to gaze at the lucky few from Europe “dining on the lawn beneath the tall pencil palms”.",

She and the winter volunteers ran the teams, and Gabe and I skied, breaking trail ahead of the team in deep snow, towed behind the sled like a water-skier when river ice became too slick for kick and glide. Kara, who’d been mushing for years, gave me a quick lesson—shift your weight like so, brake hard on hills, don’t run over the dogs, and the cardinal rule of mushing: never, never let go of the sled. My first stint on the runners included a twenty-foot drop off a corniced snowdrift (I knew you’d be fine, Kara said) and a quarter-mile belly-drag along the Teklanika River flats, gripping sled runners with both hands, spread eagle, so as to never, never let go of the sled.
