Again, large waves bounced off our windscreen, and at one point I almost stalled as we descended into a large pot-hole in the rocky river bed, but we eventually emerged on the far bank to the cheers of the South Africans. I unhooked the winch, and we stuttered and spluttered back to camp, our new bull bar arrangement causing some quizzical looks from the few other campers present as we returned at dusk.",

Not that they saw any other people; at least Christopher didn’t, for he saw only Catherine, and he ate watercress and jam and radishes and rock-cakes quite unconsciously, drinking in every word she said, laughing, applauding, lost in wonder at what seemed to him evidences of a most unusual and distinguished intelligence. Once he thought of Lewes, no doubt at that moment with his long nose in his books, and how for hours he would prose on, insisting on the essential uninterestingness and unimportance of a woman’s mind. Fool; ignorant fool. He should hear Catherine. And even when she said quite ordinary things, things which in other people would be completely ordinary, the way she said them, the soft turned-upness of her voice at the ends of her sentences, the sweet effect as of the cooing of doves he had noticed the first day, made them sound infinitely more important and arresting than anything that idiotic Lewes, churning out his brain stuff by the yard, could ever say. Male and female created He them, thought Christopher, gazing at her, entranced by the satisfaction, the comfort, the sense of being completed, her presence gave him. Admirable arrangement of an all-wise Providence, this making people in pairs. To have found one’s other half, to be with her after the sterile loneliness with Lewes and the aridity of his own sketchy and wholly hateful previous adventures in so-called love, was like coming home.",

The moon floated out once in a while, and the thick trees ahead became dimly outlined. The vandals were somewhere there. Ugwu hoped for a little more light; the moon had been more generous earlier when he buried his ogbunigwe about thirty yards ahead. Now the darkness brooded. The cable felt cold in his hand. Next to him, a soldier was mumbling prayers in the softest voice, so soft that Ugwu felt he was whispering in his ear. “Mother of God pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.” He shook the spider off and stood up when the vandals started shooting. The rattle of gunfire was scattered, loud then faint; the infantry was returning the vandals’ fire from different directions and those vandals, those dirty cattle rearers, would be confused and would have no idea that the ogbunigwe mines were waiting for them.",

The single notes of the opening motif of Chopin’s Fifteenth Nocturne fell pensively into the waitingroom. Miriam, her fatigue forgotten, slid to a featureless freedom. It seemed to her that the light with which the room was filled grew brighter and clearer. She felt that she was looking at nothing and yet was aware of the whole room like a picture in a dream. Fear left her. The human forms all round her lost their power. They grew suffused and dim.... The pensive swing of the music changed to urgency and emphasis.... It came nearer and nearer. It did not come from the candle-lit corner where the piano was.... It came from everywhere. It carried her out of the house, out of the world.\nIt hastened with her, on and on towards great brightness.... Everything was growing brighter and brighter....\nGertrude Goldring, the Australian, was making noises with her hands like inflated paper bags being popped. Miriam clutched her wool-needle and threaded it. She drew the wool through her canvas, one, three, five, three, one and longed for the piano to begin again.",

She quickly made us cups of butter-tea and for the first time I drank this brew with relish. The warmth ran through our frozen bodies and brought us to life again. Only then did we notice what a picturesque figure our young hostess made. Over her bare skin she wore a sheepskin cloak reaching down to the ground. In her long black pigtail she wore mussel-shells, silver coins and various cheap ornaments imported from abroad. She told us that her two husbands had gone out to drive in the animals. She said they had 1,500 sheep and a great many yaks. We were astonished to find polyandry practised among the nomads. It was only when we were in Lhasa that we came to know all the complicated reasons which led to the simultaneous existence in Tibet of polyandry and polygamy.",

They’re aghast at the putrid-smelling monkeys beside the road, the bamboo huts, the psychedelic movie posters, the scarecrows keeping crows off partially built buildings, the tough female road workers shoveling bitumen, the matted hair of the street children and the towns with more temples than Chinese takeaways. They scream “fuck” and flinch every time the car swerves to narrowly avoid head-on collisions with trucks, cars and slow-moving tractors. They take photos of the chilies drying on the road and the people stacking hay. They attempt to plug their ears to the blast of the horns and endlessly politely repeat “no thank you” to the people who push and invade their space every time we stop and get out of the car. By the end of the first day they look limp and filthy, exhausted and like they could kill me.",

Twice while on stand during the next three years he heard the dogs strike its trail and once even jump it by chance, the voices high, abject, almost human in their hysteria. Once, still-hunting with Walter Ewell’s rifle, he saw it cross a long corridor of down timber where a tornado had passed. It rushed through rather than across the tangle of trunks and branches as a locomotive would, faster than he had ever believed it could have moved, almost as fast as a deer even because the deer would have spent most of that distance in the air; he realised then why it would take a dog not only of abnormal courage but size and speed too ever to bring it to bay. He had a little dog at home, a mongrel, of the sort called fyce by negroes, a ratter, itself not much bigger than a rat and possessing that sort of courage which had long since stopped being bravery and had become foolhardiness. He brought it with him one June and, timing them as if they were meeting an appointment with another human being, himself carrying the fyce with a sack over its head and Sam Fathers with a brace of the hounds on a rope leash, they lay downwind of the trail and actually ambushed the bear. They were so close that it turned at bay although he realised later this might have been from surprise and amazement at the shrill and frantic uproar of the fyce. It turned at bay against the trunk of a big cypress, on its hind feet; it seemed to the boy that it would never stop rising, taller and taller, and even the two hounds seemed to have taken a kind of desperate and despairing courage from the fyce. Then he realised that the fyce was actually not going to stop. He flung the gun down and ran. When he overtook and grasped the shrill, frantically pinwheeling little dog, it seemed to him that he was directly under the bear. He could smell it, strong and hot and rank. Sprawling, he looked up where it loomed and towered over him like a thunderclap. It was quite familiar, until he remembered: this was the way he had used to dream about it.",

The traveller Isabella Bird, in 1879, thought it looked like Genoa. The young Kipling, arriving ten years later, was reminded of the Calcutta style. Very few of these buildings are left intact, but embedded among the tower-blocks one may sometimes see the half-blocked remains of a colonnade, with balconied windows above it, perhaps, as of a piano nobile, and sagging jalousies.",

This setback had not put a damper on his Himalayan career, however: he’d gone on to climb K2, Lhotse, Cho Oyu, Ama Dablam, and, in 1993, Everest without supplementary oxygen. An exceedingly calm, circumspect man, Groom was pleasant company but seldom spoke unless spoken to and replied to questions tersely, in a barely audible voice.",

In consequence, it receives 246 inches of snow a year and snowpacks of twenty feet. In one memorable storm in 1969, 98 inches of snow (that’s eight feet) fell on the summit in three days. Wind is a particular feature; on average it blows at hurricane force (over 75 mph) on two winter days in three and on 40 percent of days overall. Because of the length and bitterness of its winters, the average mean annual temperature at the summit is a meager 27°F. The summer average is 52°F—a good 25 degrees lower than at its base. It is a brutal mountain, and yet people go up there—or at least try to—even in winter.",

    "target_paragraph": "Il Cenacolo has been restored so many times (and it is again being restored); the building that houses it was bombed on August 16, 1943; protected by sandbags, the end wall on which The Last Supper is painted remained standing; the walls on which Leonardo painted in oils were always damp. . . . How faded it is! Scaffolding obscures much of it. By craning your neck, you can see the Son of God in prescient isolation, betrayed so that, according to solemn doctrine, we might live. Judas is more clearly present, in the dim fresco, than is Christ. The great work seems to be vaporizing before our eyes, its mortal music thinning. But to stand in its presence is unutterably moving. “Behold the hand that betrayeth me,” Jesus said; Leonardo didn't use an arrangement of hands simply as a means to solve a technical problem. One is conscious of that hand, it is like a blow to the heart; it is also a glory; Judas's betrayal set in motion the wheels of salvation. And the photographs of the bombed refectory (the roof and one wall were destroyed) are a kind of counterpoint to Leonardo's work: They tell us that the Prince of Peace is betrayed daily.",
