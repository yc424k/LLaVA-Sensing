She sat gripping the armrests as we took off. The pilot, Larry, treated this journey as if it were a mail route he’d flown a thousand times. I peered out, wishing I could see Asia—the Chukchi Nos (nos means “nose”), the very tip of the continent—but the weather, though calm enough to fly in, was still densely overcast, so that even the ends of the plane’s wings were obscured. No bells or sirens went off as we crossed into Russian airspace. I felt I was in an X-ray machine: a big change had taken place, but silently and invisibly.",

In twenty minutes my clothes were soaked, and before I was even out of the city I stopped to cool off in the Chido Museum and dripped my way round a fine collection of ornamented bandori – the backpacks used by country people for humping firewood, vegetables, and kids. The most elaborate of these were the iwai-bandori, designed for carrying wedding trousseaus, and the colors and patterns reminded me of the Navajo rugs I had once seen in New Mexico. (Speaking of the Navajo, I have often wondered why people who strive to depict the Japanese as quaint have never resorted to the Red Indian ploy. The written character for ‘moon’, for instance, is the same as the written character for ‘month’, so the Japanese, like the Hollywood redskins, speak of things happening ‘many moons ago’. To my knowledge, no one – not even the most frantic quaintifier – has ever translated the expression that way, but the quaintifying industry is alive and kicking, and if the Japanese would only start wearing feathers on their heads the oversight could quickly be expunged.)",

Second level is a community that is really proud of itself but struggling a bit to retain its specialness. I go to the Tourist Information Centre expecting the usual nothingness with a rack full of brochures. The Centre does, indeed, have brochures. It also is chock full of exhibits with a cadre of volunteers who are glowing with local pride. Assynt seems more to them than lots of scrub tress, rock, and open land.

There are certainly elements of the joker and buffoon that Iris had described: Lutyens incessantly doodles on the writing paper, turning the P & O crests on successive letterheads into a tiger, a man with a turban and an elephant. His first action after arriving in India is to play a game of musical chairs (‘Mrs Brodie who weighs 20 stone or more was the most energetic of the party and broke two chairs entirely [amid] many a scrimmage and wild shriek …’). Later, on seeing the hideous government buildings of Simla, Lutyens writes that they are ‘a piece of pure folly such as only Englishmen can achieve: if one were told the monkeys had built them one would have said what wonderful monkeys, they must be shot in case they do it again.’",

As the USS Memphis steamed toward its berth at the Washington Navy Yard, it was accompanied by four naval destroyers, eighty-eight airplanes, two giant dirigibles (one of them the Los Angeles, whose last official duty had been to look for Nungesser and Coli on the lonely north Atlantic), and fleets of private boats whose sheer numbers and slapdash maneuverings added an element of mayhem and near misses to the proceedings. Onshore a festive atmosphere reigned, with bands playing merry airs and a large crowd waiting in happy expectation. Mrs. Lindbergh was present, too, but was unaccompanied by the president, to the surprise of many. In fact, Calvin Coolidge was not always terribly comfortable in a nautical setting. Recently he had been sent to review the American fleet from the bridge of the presidential yacht, the Mayflower, at nearby Hampton Roads, but he got seasick even though the ship wasn’t moving and refused to wear the naval uniform provided?a breach of protocol and an insult to the navy. He went below after just twenty minutes and completed his review from a reclining position while looking bleakly out a porthole. For Lindbergh’s arrival he decided to wait in the city.",

His nine handsome, healthy, charming children dote on Rachel; they range from a grown-up daughter to a cherubic four-year-old nicknamed Apollo. Mrs Sadiq is President of the women’s branch of the PPP and works hard to arouse feminine interest in regional developments and improvements.

I felt like kissing the ground when we stepped out on the tarmac at Fiumicino. We crazily went into Rome to do a little shopping, then were really beyond thinking as we drove to Cortona in a hilarious rented Twingo, purple with mint green interior. We hit the autostrada in a bumper car and in a state of exhaustion. Still, the wet and vibrant landscape filled us with elation—that lit-from-within green and many trees still twirling colored leaves. When we left in August, it was sere and dry; now the freshness has reasserted itself. At dark we finally arrived. In town we picked up bread and a pan of veal cannelloni. The air felt charged and invigorating; we no longer wanted to collapse. Laura, the young woman who cleans, had turned up the radiators two days ago and the stone walls had time to lose their chill. She even had brought in wood, so on our first night here, we had a little feast by the fire, then wandered from room to room, checking and touching and greeting each object. And so to bed, until Marco aroused us this morning. “Laura said you arrived. I thought you’d want the doors right away.” Always, always when we arrive there is something to haul from A to B. Ed helped him hoist the doors and held them steady while Marco wiggled the hinges onto the metal spurs.",

Whole castles have vanished from my memory, whole cities that I have never visited again, but that white room, festooned with papier-maché fruits and flowers; the tall windows; the many tables; the black screen round the door with three golden cranes flying upward on each panel; the palm-tree in the centre of the room; the swish of the waiter’s feet; the cold expensive elegance; the mien of the diners as they came in every evening—their air of earnestness as if they must go through a meal prescribed by the Kur authorities and their air of sobriety as if they must seek not by any means to enjoy their meals—those things I shall not easily forget. And then, one evening, in the twilight, I saw Edward Ashburnham lounge round the screen into the room. The head waiter, a man with a face all grey—in what subterranean nooks or corners do people cultivate those absolutely grey complexions?—went with the timorous patronage of these creatures towards him and held out a grey ear to be whispered into. It was generally a disagreeable ordeal for newcomers but Edward Ashburnham bore it like an Englishman and a gentleman. I could see his lips form a word of three syllables—remember I had nothing in the world to do but to notice these niceties—and immediately I knew that he must be Edward Ashburnham, Captain, Fourteenth Hussars,* of Branshaw House, Branshaw Teleragh. I knew it because every evening just before dinner, whilst I waited in the hall, I used, by the courtesy of Monsieur Schontz, the proprietor, to inspect the little police reports that each guest was expected to sign upon taking a room.",

The seismograph traces didn’t fit the profile for an earthquake or mining explosion, and anyway the blast was 170 times more powerful than the most powerful mining explosion ever recorded in Western Australia. The shock was consistent with a large meteorite strike, but the impact would have blown a crater hundreds of feet in circumference, and no such crater could be found. The upshot is that scientists puzzled over the incident for a day or two, then filed it away as an unexplained curiosity—the sort of thing that presumably happens from time to time.",

In 1760 a young aristocrat from the scarp-foot village of Wiston named Charles Goring decided to add his own layer of history to the Chanctonbury earthworks. He planted beech saplings in a well-spaced circle and, according to one story, then daily carried bottles of water up the slope to irrigate his saplings on that arid downland summit (according to the other story, he got his servants to do this job for him).",

She looked at it there sleeping in the early sunlight with its windows green and blue with the reflected leaves. The faint thought she was thinking of Mrs Ramsay seemed in consonance with this quiet house; this smoke; this fine early morning air. Faint and unreal, it was amazingly pure and exciting. She hoped nobody would open the window or come out of the house, but that she might be left alone to go on thinking, to go on painting. She turned to her canvas. But impelled by some curiosity, driven by the discomfort of the sympathy which she held undischarged, she walked a pace or so to the end of the lawn to see whether, down there on the beach, she could see that little company setting sail. Down there among the little boats which floated, some with their sails furled, some slowly, for it was very calm, moving away, there was one rather apart from the others. The sail was even now being hoisted. She decided that there in that very distant and entirely silent little boat Mr Ramsay was sitting with Cam and James. Now they had got the sail up; now after a little flagging and hesitation the sails filled and, shrouded in profound silence, she watched the boat take its way with deliberation past the other boats out to sea.",

On the road, moreover, I turned into a tyrant, setting a merciless pace as we bummed around Western Europe, living on crackers and fresh air, sleeping under the stars. There was always someplace new, someplace better, we had to be. I dragged her on grueling pilgrimages to rock festivals (Bath) and surf towns (Biarritz) and the old haunts (and graves) of my favorite writers. Caryn, less callow, did not see the reason for all the hurry. She pressed dried flowers in her journal, went to museums, and, already fluent in French and German, undertook to learn each language we encountered. She finally dug in her heels on the western Greek island of Corfu after I announced that I had a burning desire to see more “Turkish influence.” I could go hunt for Ottoman minarets on my own, she said. And so I up and left her on the remote, mountain-backed beach where we were camping au naturel. Neither of us, I suppose, believed I would really do it, but I had become adept at, if nothing else, moving quickly through strange territory at low cost, and within a week I was in Turkey itself, newly intent on traveling overland to India. Motion, new companions, new lands were my drugs in those days—I found they did wonders for the adolescent nerves. Turkish influence fascinated me for about half an hour.

Since anything else I could do outside would be life threatening, it is a great day for a whiskey tour. If I get sick after sampling the product, I have a comfortable place across the street in which to be so. I ruck up at Jura Whiskey Distillery. The distillery tour areas are closed for cleaning. Because of this and there is only me, my tour will be free. The world renowned Jura Distillery usually charges for the tours to put a damper on the freeloaders. I get a whole hour tutorial from Danielle who is proud of what she does. She is very informative and forthcoming. In my continued obsession with public infrastructure, I ask if they treat the water before they do the first mix. Danielle says, “No.” She adds that someone does a weekly check of the stream feeding the distillery to make sure a deer hasn’t died in it.",

Before saying good-night he inspected our flea-bags, laid out on the earthen floor with space-blankets wrapped around them.

Happily a few geographical features are resistant to the Zionists’ ‘Change the face of Israel’ ideology. Looking directly up at Deir Quruntal on its high ledge near the summit one sees nothing but harsh golden-brown rockiness, surely unchanged since Jesus spent 40 days here resisting Satan’s dirty tricks. However, it’s essential not to look south. There the Telepherique’s lamentable terminus has inflicted a large metallic scar near the boulder known as ‘Jesus’s seat’. By any reckoning this Swiss investment is unnecessary. The path to the monastery entrance is indeed dusty, quite steep, narrow and in places uneven. But even with my dicey hip I made it to the top in 20 minutes. So why desecrate such a hallowed mountain with a cable car?",

The aunt refused to send Eliza to school and instead kept the young girl as a domestic in the house until she turned 14, when Farnham, determined to succeed and “decrease the misery in the world,” insisted upon an education. After six years of schooling, Farnham moved to Illinois where she met and married Thomas Jefferson Farnham, a lawyer and travel writer. In addition to Life in Prairie Land, an account of her trip alone to Illinois, she wrote two novels and a collection of essays entitled Woman and Her Era, in which she discusses vocations and intellectual interests for women. Farnham also worked as matron of the women’s division of the New York State prison at Sing Sing and during the California gold rush went West to rally for better conditions for needy women.",

The historian had asked me not to visit her again, because she did not want to attract any more attention to herself, and, though I went back to the Golden Banyan Tree Tea Shop a couple of times, I never saw my chess-playing friend again. Every morning the guest house owner asked me when I was going to leave. He told me that the MI came to the guest house two or three times a day while I was out to ask him if he had managed to get any information about who I was and why I was wandering around Katha on my own. More than a few times, while I walked around town following Orwell’s sketch map, I had noticed that I was being followed. And there were a number of strangers, like the long-haired Soe, who approached me in the street to quiz me. They may just have been friendly or innocently curious, but by then I saw everyone as a potential informer. One evening, while I wandered through the night market, a broad-shouldered man began walking beside me. He was smartly dressed in a blue-and-pink-checked longyi, and had a black beret perched jauntily atop his head. He wanted to know my name and occupation, and where I had come from, and what I was doing in Katha. I noticed, beneath the long folds of his longyi, he was wearing canvas army boots. He followed me along the stalls of the market, repeating his questions until I turned into my guest house.",
