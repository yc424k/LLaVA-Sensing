    "target_paragraph": "A story from The Washington Post of July 1, 1990, caught my attention. It mentioned the “palpable sense of giddiness” in the air in Nome since the border had been opened and quoted a lot from a Nome real-estate broker named Jim Stimpfle. He had all kinds of ideas. He described wonderful cruises from Nome to Chukotka that might be possible—a New Year’s package, for example, in which celebrants would sail to Provideniya before the holiday, enjoy a New Year’s Eve party in Russia, and then (thanks to the time change at the International Date Line, which here coincides with the Russian-American border) return to Nome for the repeat of New Year’s Eve on the following day. Because of the ice conditions at that time of year, a Soviet icebreaker would be required, but that was a mere detail to Mr. Stimpfle. “Imagine,” he told the Post, “you’re soaking in a hot tub on the deck, sipping Stolichnaya and listening to the strains of Rimsky-Korsakoff. The Northern Lights are out. Polar bears are frolicking on the ice. And you are smashing your way to the Evil Empire. It’s the last great trek on earth.”",

The food – a savoury and wholesome country soup, broiled fish, succulent thick slices of roast beef, tender, red, and juicy as none he had ever tasted before, a crisp and tender salad of endive, and camembert and coffee – was as delicious as the Countess had predicted; the wine – a Beaujolais, of which the old woman drank half a glass – both cheap and good; the service of the old waiter, suave, benevolent, and almost unctuously attentive; and his own mixed feelings of alarm, astonishment, embarrassment at the position in which he had been placed, resentment at the imposture into which the old woman had compelled him, and wild, helpless, mounting, and astounded laughter – were explosive, indescribable.",

Rome is then breathless, withdrawn. If you are with a Roman when this phenomenon occurs—everything against the bleached and empty sky assumes a singularity and integrity, and nothing trembles but the heart of things—you will hear him sigh; an agitated fatalism like a little whirlwind will possess him, and—Romans like to define themselves, it is a form of forgivable narcissism in a city of regarded artifacts; his city is not only its intimidating stones—perhaps he will choose the ephemeral occasion to tell you that Romans are a “meteorological” lot. And so they are, like necromancers attuned to weather; perhaps it comes of growing up so intimately under the sign of the Cross, of pledging oneself in the name of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God that moves across the waters (as children blow bubbles, as angels blow clouds). The Romans profess themselves to be governed by the spirit of the winds that play across their sweet, grand city—the ponentino, a pet of a wind, the westerly sea breeze that cools the hottest August day on afternoons when help is needed and despaired of; the tramontana, the steely northerly winter wind that threads the air and stirs the palms with Alpine cold and searches into every place (the wind is brutto, it incites to murder); the scirocco, the siren wind of Africa, hot, suggestive, weakening.",

Its full name is the Library of the Forest, La Biblioteca del Bosque. It has so far been a quarter of a century in the making, and at last count it consisted of more than 1,100 books – though its books are not only books, but also reliquaries. Each book records a journey made by walking, and each contains the natural objects and substances gathered along that particular path: seaweed, snakeskin, mica flakes, crystals of quartz, sea beans, lightning-scorched pine timber, the wing of a grey partridge, pillows of moss, worked flint, cubes of pyrite, pollen, resin, acorn cups, the leaves of holm oak, beech, elm. Over the many years of its making, the library has increased in volume and spread in space. It now occupies the entire ground floor and basement of an apartment building in the north of Madrid. Entering the rooms in which it exists feels like stepping into the pages of a Jorge Luis Borges story: ‘The Library of Babel’ crossed with ‘The Garden of Forking Paths’, perhaps.",

Unlike the much larger, and older, Egyptian Museum in Cairo, the Nubia Museum’s interior was cool and quiet and bereft of visitors. The Egyptian Museum’s windows were painted over, to protect the fragile exhibits from the solar beating, but the Nubia Museum has no windows at all. The lighting – best described as minimalist – accentuates the exhibits as discrete entities; each is bathed in a soft glow. Where the larger Egyptian Museum was overstuffed with ancient treasures, the Nubia Museum floor was sparse in all the right ways. Where the Egyptian Museum swarmed with busloads of sweaty foreign tourists, the Nubia Museum drew only a handful of locals and intrepid explorers, which seems to be part of a trend. Our guidebook described the Nubia Museum as “little-visited,” and that’s a darn shame.",

Arrived at Nepenthe they rented a small villa, rather out of the way, which they called the Residency. The change of climate did them good. So did the appointment. He was now a person of consequence—the sole representative of a Foreign Power on the island. His official rank procured him not only dignity and a new start in life but, what was still more urgent, credit. It brought him into contact with the local authorities—with the red-haired rachitic judge, for instance, between whom and Mr. Parker there sprang up an intimacy which was viewed with vague forebodings. The lady, being a Catholic—Mr. Parker, too, was suspected of Roman proclivities—was confessed by the parish priest. That was a point gained; the PARROCO being above suspicion, among foreigners at least. She stayed mostly indoors, inventing scandals about people and writing voluminous letters to warn new-comers of the appalling immorality of the place.",

I put my hand in the water and cupped some of it and tasted salt. Sergei immediately stripped down to his briefs and dove in and swam. Volodya recorded the event with the video camera while I made a sketch of the bay and the ocean and the sky. During his dip, Sergei stepped on a sea urchin spine, a painful development, but he mentioned it only in passing among the shouting, hilarity, and mutual congratulations. Finally we were here.

Sussex folklore, mostly from the late nineteeth and early twentieth centuries, is rife with examples of it as a portal to the otherworld. Arthur Beckett in his 1909 The Spirit of the Downs had reported that ‘if on a moonless night you walk seven times round Chanctonbury Ring without stopping, the Devil will come out of the wood and hand you a basin of soup’, in payment for your soul, which sounds like a poor exchange. More energetic variants of the summoning story stipulated that practitioners should circumambulate the Ring seventeen times on a full-moon night while naked, or run backwards seven times around the Ring at midnight on Midsummer Eve. The ghosts that had been summoned in this manner, apart from the Devil, included a Druid, a lady on a white horse, a white-bearded treasure seeker, a girl child, and Julius Caesar and his army. It clearly got crowded up there on busy nights.",

My lust for new scenes, new adventures, vanished in a bitter puff as I sat there in the Turkish scrub, not bothering to make camp.

Several cafes were wrecked in pitched battles between customers and rioters. Elsewhere in the city, the roaming mobs turned on anything with an American theme?movie theaters showing American films, American hotels, stores that sold American goods. According to the London Times correspondent, the rioters particularly targeted American shoe stores for some reason. To the disgust of many, the mobs also desecrated the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In trying to restore order, some two hundred policemen were injured. Several were stabbed.",

At last we found and reached what was surely the Maypole. It resembled the final yards of a galleon’s topmast, the body of a ship long since sunk into those deep sands. At its base, currents had carved basins in whose warm water we wallowed our feet, sending shrimps scurrying. We took an onwards bearing and continued over the silver shield of the water.",

Example: large jugs of fresh mango and guava juice, three cups of milky coffee, two toasted ham and cheese sandwiches, a two-egg omelette, a pyramid of crisp oven-warm rolls with imported (from Germany) butter and local honey. Thus fuelled, I turned towards Holguin’s tourist challenge, Loma de la Cruz. Its four hundred and fifty-eight steps – wide, concrete, shadeless, heat-reflecting – did not tempt me though the reward is a panoramic view (say the guide-books) and a thatched restaurant. At the bottom of the steps I turned right to follow a rough track through a sprawling village on ledges of mountain overlooking the city. This was a post-Revolution settlement of terraced concrete block housing: one-storey, white- or pink-washed, unglazed windows barred, outside spiral stairways giving access to flat roofs with laundry-lines and herb gardens. Soon the track became a steep boulder-path (a stream bed after heavy rain), climbing between hedges of neatly clipped candelabra cactus and fiery crotons. Beyond the settlement, around a shoulder, a track descended to an invisible motor-road past a colossal obsolete water-storage tank (obsolete for lack of pumping fuel). Another path would have taken me past clusters of bohios on the opposite slope. More tempting was a barely discernible pathlet zig-zagging upwards through high, thick grass. This was an easy climb, the wet grass cooling and bushy shade available at intervals. Only crowing cocks, grunting pigs and frequent bird calls broke the silence. The last stage was a scramble over smooth boulders, then I was looking directly across a shrub-filled valley to the mini-fort and restaurant on Loma de la Cruz and could enjoy the panoramic view without having toiled up those four hundred and fifty-eight steps.",

From Macksville the next morning I drove sixty miles up the Pacific Highway to Grafton, then headed inland on a steep and lonely road up and through the Great Dividing Range. Four hours later, in hot and empty sheep country, I reached Delungra—a gas station and a couple of houses with long views over mostly treeless plains—and there I turned down a back road that followed a twisting, sometimes nearly washed-out course on its way to the small town of Bingara twenty-five miles to the south. A couple of miles short of Bingara, I came to a small rickety-looking bridge over a half-dry creek. A little sign announced it as Myall Creek. I pulled the car into the shade of a river gum and got out to have a look. There was no memorial, no historical plaque. Nothing at all to indicate that here, or at least somewhere in the immediate vicinity, was where one of the most infamous events in Australian history took place. To one side of the bridge was a forlorn rest area with a pair of broken picnic tables and a good deal of shattered bottles in the stubby grass around the edge. In the sunny middle distance, perhaps a mile away, stood a large farmhouse, surrounded by fields of unusually verdant crops. In the other direction, and much closer, an overgrown track led to a white building. I walked along it to see what it was. A sign announced it as the Myall Creek Memorial Hall. It wasn’t much of a monument to a terrible slaughter, but at least it was something. Then on a wall of the building I noticed a hand-painted sign and discovered that it had nothing to do with the slaughter; it was a memorial for the dead of two world wars.",

As he saw them coming down the steps together he felt a sudden, blind rush of affection for all of them, and saw that all of them were fine people. Elinor came towards him instantly, and spoke to him warmly, kindly, and sincerely, without a trace of mannerism or affection or concealed spitefulness. Starwick stood by quietly while he talked to Elinor: Ann looked on sullenly and dumbly and thrust her hands in the pockets of her fur jacket. In the dull, grey light they looked like handsome, first-rate, dignified people, who had nothing mean or petty in them and with whom nothing but a spacious, high and generous kind of life was possible. By comparison, the Frenchmen coming from the museum and streaming past them looked squalid and provincial; and the Americans and other foreigners had a shabby, dull, inferior look. For a moment the bitter and passionate enigma of life pierced him with desperation and wild hope. What was wrong with life? What got into people such as these to taint their essential quality, to twist and warp and mutilate their genuine and higher purposes? What were these perverse and evil demons of cruelty and destructiveness, of anguish, error and confusion that got into them, that seemed to goad them on, with a wicked and ruinous obstinacy, deliberately to do the things they did not want to do – the things that were so shamefully unworthy of their true character and their real desire?",

There’s a special guest in the crowd tonight, Governor Warren T. Legless, who I can see sitting with his pretty young wife, Bobbie Rae, in a box seat just below us here in the press-box.’ Shannon was a genius at this sort of thing. I remember one time the phone call from the ballpark didn’t come through – the guy at the other end had gotten locked in a toilet or something – and Shannon didn’t have anything to tell the listeners. So he delayed the game with a sudden downpour, having only a moment before said it was a beautiful cloudless evening, and played music while he called the ballpark and begged somebody there to let him know what was going on. Funnily enough, I later read that the exact same thing had happened to Ronald Reagan when he was a young sports-caster in Des Moines. Reagan responded by having the batter do a highly improbable thing – hit foul balls one after the other for over half an hour – while pretending that there was nothing implausible about it, which when you think about it is kind of how he ran the country as President.",

And honk. My left hand in mid trucker wave, my right hand on the edge of the steering wheel, I couldn’t quite wrap my head around what I was hearing. I glanced again at my wave-partner, his forehead furrowed into a question while his rig passed mine. Puzzled myself, I returned both hands to the steering wheel. The much louder air horn could only sound with the pull of a thin silver wire that hung down near the edge of the windshield while the city horn looked and functioned more like a car’s horn. Though the city horn sounded more quietly, it still made an irritating raspberry noise that continued to blare while the truck rolled along.",

The whole column streamed past Captain Mitchell at a run, the thundering noise of their feet dying away suddenly on the shore. His captors held him tightly, disregarding his declaration that he was an Englishman and his loud demands to be taken at once before their commanding officer. Finally he lapsed into dignified silence. With a hollow rumble of wheels on the planks a couple of field guns, dragged by hand, rolled by. Then, after a small body of men had marched past escorting four or five figures which walked in advance, with a jingle of steel scabbards, he felt a tug at his arms, and was ordered to come along. During the passage from the wharf to the Custom House it is to be feared that Captain Mitchell was subjected to certain indignities at the hands of the soldiers—such as jerks, thumps on the neck, forcible application of the butt of a rifle to the small of his back. Their ideas of speed were not in accord with his notion of his dignity. He became flustered, flushed, and helpless. It was as if the world were coming to an end.",

But the cloud brought rain, and next morning he looked out of his window into a cold grey blur. They had planned an all-day excursion down the Seine, to the two Andelys and Rouen, and now, with the long hours on their hands, they were both a little at a loss...There was the Louvre, of course, and the Luxembourg; but he had tried looking at pictures with her, she had first so persistently admired the worst things, and then so frankly lapsed into indifference, that he had no wish to repeat the experiment. So they went out, aimlessly, and took a cold wet walk, turning at length into the deserted arcades of the Palais Royal, and finally drifting into one of its equally deserted restaurants, where they lunched alone and somewhat dolefully, served by a wan old waiter with the look of a castaway who has given up watching for a sail...It was odd how the waiter's face came back to him...",

The door opened a little and, by turning an inch, I could see his face silhouetted in the doorway.

They were busy dipping wooden pans into the current at the downstream end of little conduits improvised with planks; kneading and sifting the mud and the gravel, wringing and searching shaggy wet sheepskins which had been cunningly placed under their flimsy sluices; all of them peering down, rapt as kestrels.

For some two miles it runs wide and straight between the murky waters of a listless port and a row of tall, grim-looking commercial buildings. A pedestrian walkway bisects this thoroughfare, its line of straggly trees half-shading a few seats in urgent need of repair. At one end is the horse-bus ‘terminus’, under an ancient ceiba tree, and these long carriages far outnumber motor vehicles. The Trio’s suggesting a ride in one caused a slight contretemps between their elders. Horse-buses operate within the national-peso economy and are not licensed to carry tourists. (Havana’s tastefully decorated nineteenth-century two-wheelers have special licences.) However, one driver volunteered to break the law for CP5; his four-wheeled twelve-seater was drawn by a large mule and a small horse and had an insecure canvas awning. Rachel then argued that large groups were awaiting transport and it didn’t seem fair for us to jump that queue. I saw her point, but I also saw those three hopeful little faces. We compromised. I’d go with the girls, Zea could sit on my lap, we wouldn’t be hogging the bus, its driver could have our CP5 (big bucks for him) plus half a national peso from nine others. We waved goodbye to Rachel – still looking disapproving – and trotted off on the sandy equine lane that runs parallel to the tarmac.",

    "target_paragraph": "There were only two other patients in the white men’s ward: the purser of a gunboat, who had broken his leg falling down a hatch-way; and a kind of railway contractor from a neighbouring province, afflicted by some mysterious tropical disease, who held the doctor for an ass, and indulged in secret debaucheries of patent medicine which his Tamil servant used to smuggle in with unwearied devotion. They told each other the story of their lives, played cards a little, or, yawning and in pyjamas, lounged through the day in easy-chairs without saying a word. The hospital stood on a hill, and a gentle breeze entering through the windows, always flung wide open, brought into the bare room the softness of the sky, the languor of the earth, the bewitching breath of the Eastern waters. There were perfumes in it, suggestions of infinite repose, the gift of endless dreams. Jim looked every day over the thickets of gardens, beyond the roofs of the town, over the fronds of palms growing on the shore, at that roadstead which is a thoroughfare to the East, — at the roadstead dotted by garlanded islets, lighted by festal sunshine, its ships like toys, its brilliant activity resembling a holiday pageant, with the eternal serenity of the Eastern sky overhead and the smiling peace of the Eastern seas possessing the space as far as the horizon.",
