He was absolutely positive and certain. He let him come on because it did not matter. A dead man, anyhow. He noticed the dilated nostrils, the wide eyes, the intent, eager stillness of the face, and then he fired.",

We were careful not to make a breach in our manners by outstaying our welcome, and our camp was up before the sun. To wake in that desert dawn was like waking in the heart of an opal. The mists lifting their heads out of the hollows, the dews floating in ghostly wreaths from the black tents, were shot through first with the faint glories of the eastern sky and then with the strong yellow rays of the risen sun. I sent a silver and purple kerchief to Fellāh ul ’Isa, “for the little son” who had played solemnly about the hearth, took grateful leave of Namrūd, drank a parting cup of coffee, and, the old sheikh holding my stirrup, mounted and rode away with Gablān. We climbed the Jebel el ’Alya and crossed the wide summit of the range; the landscape was akin to that of our own English border country but bigger, the sweeping curves more generous, the distances further away. The glorious cold air intoxicated every sense and set the blood throbbing — to my mind the saying about the Bay of Naples should run differently. See the desert on a fine morning and die — if you can. Even the stolid mules felt the breath of it and raced across the spongy ground (“Mad! the accursed ones!”) till their packs swung round and brought them down, and twice we stopped to head them off and reload. The Little Heart, the highest peak of the Jebel Druze, surveyed us cheerfully the while, glittering in its snow mantle far away to the north.",

You are plunged in repose there, coming in from the beautiful baroque stage work of the little piazza, built around the façade of the same church; you have dropped a fearful distance, into pure peace. That is a complexity too, with the in-sloping pavement of the court extending the play in depth of the porticoes. The peacefulness, really more a lordly calm, is from the center imposing itself so unquestionably, as it does also in the staircase and the temple, and in that sense it seems true that space is not active, as it is in the piazza outside and would be for Borromini. The terms of definition tend to be reversed, and what is most engrossing is that both are involved in Saint Peter’s.—But these three toys, almost more beautiful when one is only lying thinking about them in the dark, are also and more plainly of the world of that forbidding grey palazzo the Cancelleria, which Bramante may have had nothing to do with but he could have had. It is in his “style,” as the Farnese is in Michelangelo’s.",

Now we are at my door. We face each other. He gives me a warm hug. This is an improvement; for the first few weeks, he would only shake my hand. I think if I were to stay in Italy for another three years, he might actually get up the juice to kiss me. On the other hand, he might just kiss me right now, tonight, right here by my door…there’s still a chance…I mean we’re pressed up against each other’s bodies beneath this moonlight…and of course it would be a terrible mistake…but it’s still such a wonderful possibility that he might actually do it right now…that he might just bend down…and…and…",

It is the smell of old worn woods, warm, resinous, sultry, getting into our very entrails somehow with its strange and nameless fragrance of sorrow and delight; the smell of the wooden baseball bleachers, of the old worn plankings of an amusement park, passed over by a million feet since morning; and it is the smell of street-cars, car-barns, the faded day-coach plush of trains, the smell of bridges and of old wharves and piers, of hot tarred roofing, and of tar out in the streets, of summer’s fatigue, quietness, and summer’s ending, the quiet and tranquil sorrow of memory as we remember youth, our father’s voice upon the night-time summer porch, the smell of the grape-vines and the ripened grapes, the grinding screech and halt of a street-car on the hill above our father’s house, and the knowledge that all this is lost, our father dead, our childhood gone, another year, our first in the great man-swarm of the city, ended – and this, the knowledge of the bitter briefness of our days, is somehow mixed with the smell of the sea in harbours, the freshening breeze of evening, the call of ships, and, somehow, God knows how, with the intolerable thrill and promise of the unknown voyage.",

My friends who have been studying Yoga for a long time say you don’t really see the impact that an Ashram has had on you until you leave the place and return to your normal life. “Only then,” said the former nun from South Africa, “will you start to notice how your interior closets have all been rearranged.” Of course at the moment, I’m not entirely sure what my normal life is. I mean, I’m maybe about to go move in with an elderly medicine man in Indonesia—is that my normal life? It may be, who knows? In any case, though, my friends say that the changes appear only later. You may find that lifelong obsessions are gone, or that nasty, indissoluble patterns have finally shifted. Petty irritations that once maddened you are no longer problems, whereas abysmal old miseries you once endured out of habit will no longer be tolerated now for even five minutes. Poisonous relationships get aired out or disposed of, and brighter, more beneficial people start arriving into your world.",

Yet there are wandering breezes and a harmonious wave-lapping suggestive of coolness. They lie in a rough circle, and anyone but a geologist familiar with the inevitable “quaquaversal dip” would take them to be the relics of a submerged crater, an illusion which is strengthened by the outward slope and half-moon shape of the greater islet, and by the riven pinnacles of stone gnawed by the waves into bizarre shapes and painted, wherever the spray can reach them, to a murky brown. And this is exactly what one old traveller called them - a mistake for which he was sternly rebuked by Breislack. So Dumas talks of the “granitic ramparts” of Capri, and a Swiss, writing only three years ago, praises its ‘parois verticales de porphyre et basalte’. A deplorable lack of general intelligence, seeing that the principal charm of all Italian scenery, its graceful outlines and much of its delicate aerial tints, are exclusively due to a peculiar natural formation. Limestone, and no other rock, is able to produce them.",

Ioannis and Constantine are the commonest Christian names in Greece; shortened to Yanni and Costa, they are the equivalent to Tom and Dick, and as easily confused. Finally, Kazis and Ghazis: in certain Greek mouths, K and G can be almost indistinguishable. Costa Ghazis and Yanni Kazis are plainly the same man.

That too, however, was hardly unique: the anti-Western dictators of African countries (followers of that great non-Westerner Karl Marx) proverbially drove Mercedeses, while President Sukarno, to name just one, had turned his back on the West in a fit of nationalism and decided to make Jakarta a great modern metropolis—by stocking it with Western hotels and conveniences. In a movie like Mard, the cry of patriotism was a great rabble-rouser; but the great audience-pleaser was still the parade of foreign goods. Evil was foreign, and so too was the good life. That was a contradiction common to just about every developing country.",

Michelangelo’s square, subtly enlarged by the trapezoid angle of the side palaces and the views back from their ends, is the most rational in the city, a strong thrust, up through the night imagery, of grace and mastery of form, as the Dome is or that other creation partly from the same mind, although a mere private house, the Palazzo Farnese. The proportions are exquisite, and to scale with the human body; the three façades with their balustrades and statues—crochetwork of the aging Renaissance—the two side ones with their porticoes and the somewhat insincere elegance of their upper window columns, the Senators’ Palace at the back presiding by reason of its clock-tower and handsome double stairs, are a text of unity, a single, and considering the actual size, oddly spacious experience. But the larger design is something else; shabbiness, wreckage, unreason will pour in on you in a moment.",

The term “heteronormative” has since passed into popular parlance; at the time, however, it was breathtakingly radical to consider how persistently heterosexuality pervaded every facet of public life.",

Bending to enter, I stumbled over the raised stone threshold and fell on to the horns of a ruminating dzo. She made indignant noises as she scrambled to her feet and my guide gave an alarmed squeal; but she hadn’t really taken umbrage and was in any case tethered to a roof-support. Half this room was filled with neatly stacked firewood and sweet-smelling hay. My guide beckoned me on through an even lower door into a dark, smoky living-room, very hot and crowded, where my head just touched the roof-beams when I stood erect. In the centre was a wood-stove and sitting cross-legged on the floor beside it was an elderly man, with a small face under a big turban, running up a kamiz on a sewing-machine. I peered around as the womenfolk shrank back against the wall, modestly drawing their cloaks over their faces and protectively clutching their whimpering small children. The tailor stared at me, unsmilingly, while continuing to operate his machine. When I held out my container and asked for kerosene he stood up, still without any change of expression, and led me through the lowest door of all into an adjacent cubby-hole – his ‘shop’. It was stocked with two jerrycans of kerosene, half a sack of ata, four bars of soap, a cardboard carton of tea-dust, a bag of rock-salt and a small cluster of nylon socks hanging from a nail. (I fail to see the point of nylon socks in the Karakoram, but they have probably become a status symbol.) This, I felt, was as far from Harrods as one could get.",

Her guests each with his or her jar of almond cream and sunburn lotion came aboard in bright babbling surges, calling, “Ship ahoy, everyone,” and other suitable nautical cries, while various casuals, gathered along the quay, looked on with morose interest.

To get to it, to the place to which all roads once led, I walk from the Capitol down the Via della Consolazione, a road that becomes a leafy path; I like it, the damp earth smells like tea. . . . I liked it until I saw a sign that said DERATIZATION GOING ON. DON'T TOUCH THE BAIT. Well, who would? But where is the bait? . . . And I find myself soon in the cradle, heart, and graveyard of the ancient world. To walk where Caesar walked and feel no thrill is strange. I need much less—I can read history and mysteries into an object I can hold in the palm of my hand—or much more. For some, the absence of detail—the very lack of obelisks, fountains, roofs of hammered gold—acts as a spur to the imagination. Stendhal's advice, tongue in cheek, was to “imagine what is lacking, and disregard what is there.” But my imagination can't reconstruct the Forum as it once was, nor can it disregard the mutilation that is there. . . . The statues are forever fallen, the columns smashed, the roofs ungilded, the narrow streets peopled not by hundreds of men in tunics and togas, smelling of garlic and pomade—they have all stepped over the brink into the great chasm—but by enervated tourists with guidebooks (maps to a bomb site) at a loss to know if they are looking at a prison, a theater, or a temple. There is no consolation to be derived here from the transitoriness of things. The silence of the distant world is deafening.",

The round tower, narrowing upwards and decorated at the top with a zigzag ornament, was placed upon a low octagonal structure which in turn rested upon a square base (Fig. 58). I climbed the winding stair that I might survey the country through which Naif was to take us. It was incredibly desolate, empty of tent or village save where to the west the palm-groves of Kebeisah made a black splash upon the glaring earth. The heavy smoke of the pitch fires hung round Hit, and the sulphur marshes shone leprous under the sun?a malignant landscape that could not be redeemed by the little shrines which were scattered like propitiatory invocations among the gleaming salts.",

The frequency with which we stopped was quite incredible, given the absence of any evidence of human life on the road, but I was wedged into my seat and could not observe what, if anything, was going on. A knot of scoots suddenly took an interest in the book I was reading. It was by John Shelby Spong, and it was called Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism. It was an excellent book, but I had considerable difficulty in conveying this to the scoots, who seemed to think the Bible was the exclusive province of Catholics anyway.",

He stood in the customs line and reread Kainene’s note. Is love this misguided need to have you beside me most of the time? He would ask her to marry him when he returned to Port Harcourt. She would first say something like, “A white man and no money to speak of. My parents will be scandalized.” But she would say yes. He knew she would say yes. It was something about her lately, a mellowing, a softening from which this note had come. He was not sure if she had forgiven him for the incident with Olanna?they had never talked about it?but this note, this new openness, meant that she was ready to move forward. He was smoothing the note on his palm, when a young very dark-skinned customs officer asked, “Anything to declare, sir?”",

The truck churned on up the road leaving a dense white cloud like a fog behind it. My hair and shirt were white with the dust, and the water of the mountain streams was too bitter to wash the dry taste off my tongue. Higher, the dead stumps left by the loggers were bone white, and the smell of the old volcano, like a moldy larder, had forced its way into every copse. No forest is ever wholly silent. There is always the sound of the wind in the trees, the sound of the branches as they move, the minute sounds of the scavenging lizards, the sounds the birds make when they stop singing. But on the road to Osorezan these sounds had all died. There was not the slightest hint of a breeze nor of any form of animate life, and the twigs and branches were stiff as stone. I was alone on the road to Osorezan, but I felt a greater loneliness than comes from merely being alone.",

Bartlett grinned and shook Kataktovik hard by his shoulders, then sank to his knees. He patted the snow-covered ground with his mittens, breathing thick plumes of condensation into the frigid air. The two had trudged for seventeen days since leaving Icy Spit on Wrangel Island and, by Bartlett’s calculations, traveled about two hundred miles. He could not be sure exactly where they had landed,* but he knew for certain, based on his estimates, that they still had many hundreds of miles to go to reach the far eastern coast of Siberia, where he might find a ship to take them to Alaska to seek rescue ships. As difficult as his journey had already been, he knew they were less than a third of the way to their destination. They would need help.",

Water is very scarce; all that is used in the boiling-house and elsewhere has been carefully led into concrete tanks for storage, and even the walks in the proprietor's beautiful garden are laid with cement for the same purpose. He has planted many thousand Australian eucalyptus trees on the hill-side in the hope of procuring a larger rainfall, so that the neighbourhood has quite an exotic appearance. Below, the coast is black and volcanic-looking, jutting into the sea in naked lava promontories, which nature has done nothing to drape.",

This was not the sort of Asian scene I’m used to: where were the overloaded passengers, the begging children, the shouting competing porters, the hawkers, the cripples, the litter? Everyone carried conventional amounts of luggage in conventional containers, barefooted coolies moved through the crowds in an orderly fashion pushing handcarts of goods to weighing offices, no beggars or cripples were admitted, not so much as a grape pip or a matchstick defiled the ground. From high rafters depended several bilingual (Thai and English) notices warning people about an on-the-spot fine for littering – 2,000 baht. Burger King et al. fed the multitude and a mini-supermarket, facing the concourse, sold most of the things one might find in its twin back home. The many seats and benches were crowded – apart from rows of plastic chairs within a roped-off monks’ enclosure at the base of a towering, glittering shrine dedicated to the King and surrounded by paper flowers and electric ‘candles’. Above the shrine hung a life-size photograph of HM as a young man, wearing the sort of comic opera uniform universally beloved by senior military officers. In mid-afternoon a platoon of novice monks arrived, each carrying only an umbrella; possessing nothing, they travel without luggage. I saw few smokers – mostly coolies – but an alarming number of adults and obviously distressed children were using asthma inhalers.",

They watched the Texan enter the lot and cross it, the horses flowing before him but without the old irrational violence, as if they too were spent, vitiated with the long day, and enter the barn and then emerge, leading the two harnessed mules. The wagon had been backed under the shed beside the barn. The Texan entered this and came out a moment later, carrying a bedding-roll and his coat, and led the mules back toward the gate, the ponies huddled again and watching him with their various unmatching eyes, quietly now, as if they too realised there was not only an armistice between them at last but that they would never look upon each other again in both their lives. Someone opened the gate. The Texan led the mules through it and they followed in a body, leaving the husband standing beside the closed gate, his head still bent and the coiled rope in his hand. They passed the wagon in which the wife sat, her gray garment fading into the dusk, almost the same color and as still, looking at nothing; they passed the clothesline with its limp and unwinded drying garments, walking through the hot vivid smell of ham from Mrs Littlejohn’s kitchen. When they reached the end of the lane they could see the moon, almost full, tremendous and pale and still lightless in the sky from which day had not quite gone. Snopes was standing at the end of the lane beside an empty buggy. It was the one with the glittering wheels and the fringed parasol top in which he and Will Varner had used to drive. The Texan was motionless too, looking at it.",

    "target_paragraph": "Ordinarily it is possible for a man to walk across quicksand, if he keeps moving. But if he stops, funny things begin to happen. The surface of the quicksand, which may look as firm as the wet sand on an ocean beach, begins to liquefy beneath his feet. He finds himself sinking slowly into a jelly-like substance, soft and quivering, which clasps itself around his ankles with the suction power of any viscous fluid. Pulling out one foot, the other foot necessarily goes down deeper, and if a man waits too long, or cannot reach something solid beyond the quicksand, he may soon find himself trapped. The depth to which he finally sinks depends upon the depth and the fluidity of the quicksand, upon the nature of his efforts to extricate himself, and upon the ratio of body weight to volume of quicksand. Unless a man is extremely talented, he cannot work himself in more than waist-deep. The quicksand will not pull him down. But it will not let him go either. Therefore the conclusion is that while quicksand cannot drown its captive, it could possibly starve him to death. Whatever finally happens, the immediate effects are always interesting.",
