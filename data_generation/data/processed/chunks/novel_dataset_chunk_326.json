We were now passing through the Gansu Corridor and the train chugged along between two parallel ranges of mountains. The chequer-boards were interrupted by wooden farmhouses and gravel farm tracks. As we pushed on up the corridor, the paddy slowly began to give way to narrow fields of russet-brown soil, newly harvested of grain. The blue-jacketed peasants tending the paddy-shoots were replaced by other groups of villagers standing in circles around yellow piles of harvested wheat. They were winnowing the chaff from the grain, throwing spadefuls in the air and letting the chaff drift away in the breeze. Some of the men were leaving the group, bent double under great bundles of straw. Others were digging the fields, either by hand or with the aid of a horse plough. On the fallow strips, horses and sheep were grazing, watched by shepherds. One squatted some distance away from his flock chewing on a straw.",

It was hot, bright, treeless, unpeopled. We drove through salt flats and sand dunes on dirt roads and camped at a remote, flyblown surf spot known as Cactus, where the water was cold and a deep Southern Ocean blue. There were two long lefts, one called Cactus, one called Castles, breaking off a rocky headland, and a heavy right a few hundred yards west called Caves. The swell was solid, day after day. Some days it was more than solid. The wind was hot, full of dust, and offshore, blowing out of the great central desert. Bryan rode the lefts. I was riding a new board now, a pale blue 6'9\" rounded pintail that I had bought in Torquay, a beach town in Victoria. I had left my South Pacific board, not without regret, for sale on consignment at the shop where I found the pintail. I hoped the pintail, which was built in New Zealand, might work as my new all-around board. It was light and fast and on bigger days at Caves seemed able to handle a serious drop without sideslipping.",

Today being Sunday few people were about and those few were mostly Indians – on whom we’ll be chiefly dependent for months to come, so we studied them closely. Their physical resemblance to the Tibetans dispels any doubts one might have had about migrations from Central Asia across the Bering Straits. Andean Indians are on average much smaller than Tibetans: otherwise the likeness is uncanny. Not only are their features Tibetan, but often their hairstyles (including some men’s plaits), and the way they carry their babies, and sometimes even their gestures and expressions. Their gait, however, is different. Tibetans stride out – men and women alike – while the Indian women, many of whom go bare-footed, proceed most oddly with an irregular hopping/running/trotting movement not unlike a pheasant’s. They also seem much less robust than the Tibetans and evidently they age quickly. We saw several apparent grandmothers suddenly swinging their infant burdens off their backs and sitting by the roadside to suckle them. Nor are they as out-going as Tibetans; rather the other extreme, with a tendency to keep their eyes averted or downcast on seeing gringoes. We are fascinated by the women’s Panama hats and layers of skirts of varying hues. Often two or even three hats are worn simultaneously, as status symbols: the equivalent of the Hindu woman’s gold bangles. Children wear them too: even toddlers, still travelling on Mamma’s back.",

Nine growers’ oils are lined up along a table in the piazza, with pots of olive trees around for ambiance. “I couldn’t have imagined this, could you?” Ed asks me as we try the fourth or fifth oil. I couldn’t. The oils, like ours, are profoundly fresh with a vigorous element to the taste that makes me want to smack my lips. The shades of difference among the oils are subtle.

There are wide eyes, curious eyes, worried eyes, weeping eyes. My own fill with tears, which I try to choke down. I reach through a tangle of arms and grasp the ice-cold ginger beer that is being thrust toward me. These people do not know me. We don’t even have a common language. How can they ever know what each step through my hell was like? Yet I have the overwhelming feeling that we belong to one another, that in this moment we see life as one. In their eyes there is a reflection of my own fate. The paths of our lives are separate, but the essence of our lives is together.",

This road runs like an infected scratch down the tough, rough, healthy body of the unprogressive highlands and on coming to these towns one knows that they are sick. Contact with our world seems to suppress the best and encourage the worst in the highland character; here it is evident that already the locals have degenerated from an integrated, respect-worthy peasantry into a community of coarse and crafty primitives. Walking around Debarak – or sitting in its bars, watching highlanders in dirty jeans and T-shirts drinking ‘Chianti’ and smoking cigarettes – one sees a much cruder aspect of the highland culture than one would ever see in an isolated settlement. At the foundation of this culture certain indigenous Hamitic–Negroid influences are being forever delicately balanced by Asian–Hebrew–Christian influences; and apparently the lightest touch of Westernisation can tip the balance in favour of the less advanced tradition.",

He stood there covered with frowns. I couldn’t for the life of me figure out how he had gotten up there—his boulder seemed isolated in an expanse of dangerously streaming water from all sides, and clearly he didn’t know what to do now. He tried to ease himself into the silvery current and wade the last ten yards to shore but was instantly whisked away like a feather. For the second time in two days I sincerely thought he was drowning—he was certainly helpless—but the current carried him to a shallow bar of gleaming pebbles twenty feet farther on, where he came up sputtering on his hands and knees, struggled up on to the bank, and continued on into the woods without a backward glance, as if this were the most normal thing in the world.",

But he is spotlessly clean and wears his dhoti, which is always of the finest muslin, more gracefully than any other Hindoo I have seen, so that it falls almost to the level of his insteps. On his bare feet he wears old-fashioned buckle shoes, which are both becoming and sensible, since they have so frequently to be shuffled off; and on his head a round black hat, like Babaji Rao’s, into which he crams his long oily tress of blue-black hair. His carriage is calm and dignified, conscious of the superiority of his caste; his demeanour reserved, thoughtful, and attentive.",

Last year it was taken over by English-speaking Jill and Hugh (Jo’burg-bred) who describe themselves as ‘refugees from the rat-race and pollution and violence’. Said Jill, ‘We liked Tarkastad’s clear air and tranquillity – nobody warned us about the local farmers! You’d think they owned the town and the hotel! They know they underpin the local economy, there’s nothing else. Some weekends they get mad drunk, breaking the place up, shooting at the ceilings, throwing wads of money on the floor to pay for the damage – then reeling off shouting for their wives to drive them home. They’re like naughty nasty children – not normal. Cheap labour and subsidies spoiled them long ago. I’ll not weep if the blacks get bits of their farms.’",

After the second Intifada, the municipality restored this pleasant space where mature trees shade wooden tables and benches, shrubs are neatly pruned, litter-bins are emptied and toddlers frolic around a fountain of spring water with mugs attached. Directly above, Mount Ebal slopes towards the plain and a suburb of white residential blocks shows few Defensive Shield scars though the nearby factories and government offices were obliterated. Here I sometimes sat in the sun, writing my notes until interrupted by curious mothers, grandmothers or older sisters.

Occasionally too one notices a strangely lovely tree whose transparent leaves have now turned to the palest gold and adding to this beauty is the unceasing music of the Tibetan flute. All day, from dawn to dusk, wherever you go in this region, you hear that flute being played in the distance; yet never once have I seen it being played, which makes me feel that it’s the original ‘music of the spheres’ – an illusion fostered by the quiet, simple tunes.",

I would have felt an intruder, as I felt in those district clubs where the billiard rooms were still hung with framed cartoons of the 1930s, where the libraries had gone derelict, the taste of a generation frozen, and where on the smoking-room walls were stained engravings, difficult to see through the reflections on the dusty glass, of tumultuous horsemen labelled ‘Afridis’ or ‘Baluchis’. Indians could walk among these relics with ease; the romance had always been partly theirs and now they had inherited it fully. I was not English or Indian; I was denied the victories of both.",

But all the while, as he went along before the entrance and the show windows filled with books which flanked it on both sides, he peered sharply out of the corner of his eye like a spy who had to find out what was going on inside the building without letting the passers-by observe his interest. He walked to the end of the block and turned about and then came back, and again as he passed in front of the publishing house he kept his face fixed straight ahead and looked stealthily out of the corner of his eye. For fifteen or twenty minutes he repeated this strange manoeuvred, and each time as he approached the door he-would hesitate and half turn as if about to enter, and then abruptly go on as before.",

It was universally agreed that nobody could make a more appetizing mayonnaise sauce for cold fish and lobsters. No mayonnaise was quite like theirs; no, not quite. Its flavour lingered on the palate; it haunted your memory in distant lands, like the after-glow of some happy love-affair. Nice girls, too; well-mannered; not very difficult to caress, and never jealous of each other. \"It's all in the family,\" they used to declare.",

With it you win all men if you are a woman?and all women if you are a man.” Asked by a reporter to name some notable possessors of “It,” Glyn cited Rudolph Valentino, John Gilbert, and Rex the Wonder Horse. Later she extended the list to include the doorman at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.",

I’m not the type who travels with photos of my loved ones—I don’t quite know why. Perhaps it’s because a celluloid image does not do justice to them or anyone. I prefer the memory of action and voice—the laughter, the cries, even the sarcasm-laced sound bites of adolescence. But lying there on a cold floor—without letters from home, without wallet-sized photos—I suddenly wished to be like normal people who are heavily armed with such totems whether they are heading across the planet or around the corner to the grocery store. As I thought of my children’s faces and voices, I wondered what they would have thought of their mother sleeping on a mat on a cold floor. Would they have recognized me with my long, straggly hair, gaunt, makeup-free face, and sweat-stained clothing? This was only our eighth day on the road, but in a strange way I felt that I had always lived this way.",

Davis and Wooster were smart, able aviators, and their plane, a Keystone Pathfinder built in Bristol, Pennsylvania, was gleamingly new and powered by three Wright Whirlwind engines. What the outside world didn’t know was that upon delivery the plane turned out to weigh 1,150 pounds more than it was supposed to. Davis and Wooster took it up in a series of test flights, each time cautiously increasing the fuel load, and so far had experienced no problems. On April 26, two days after Chamberlin’s emergency landing, they scheduled their final test flight. This time they would take off with a full load of seventeen thousand pounds, nearly a quarter more than the plane had attempted to lift before.",

Together they moved to Paris, where Borglum trained as a sculptor (one of his teachers was Auguste Rodin). Borglum lived in Europe for eleven years before he abandoned his wife and returned to the United States, where he quickly established himself as a sculptor.",

This trek is classified as moderate to difficult, but it is not the terrain or hours on the trail?between five to seven hours on average per day depending on the itinerary?that are the real difficulty; it is the altitude itself. We set off from the village of Lukla, perched at 2,800 metres above sea level, just a short scenic flight from Kathmandu, where we had landed at Tenzing-Hillary Airport, incidentally considered one of the most dangerous airports in the world. On one side of the single runway, which has a 12 per cent gradient, we could see the mountains, and on the other, sheer nothingness?a complete drop. Thus, it is no surprise that when our team landed there in October 2012, we held our collective breaths and hung on tightly to our seats as the pilot came in for the precarious final approach. I can still remember how excited we all were, even if a bit nervous to embark on such a challenging trek.",

It was the work of Buffon and others like him which began the transformation of Ussher’s implausibly precise dating of 4004 BC into a totem of idiotic biblical literalism.* For, once the duration of the earth’s past was no longer confined to 6,000 years, it was possible to speculate more systematically on what changes might have been wrought over wider spans of time.

It was a kind of pickup truck on pontoons, with screws that looked like giant crayons on either side to power it through the water, and a paddle wheel arrangement on the front to help it, they said, “walk” from the water up onto any floating ice they encountered. They took the vehicle to Wales, drove off into the strait, failed to make sufficient headway, and soon became tightly frozen in ice fifty yards from shore. Eskimos from Wales cut them free with chain saws and hauled them back to land. When I saw the Englishmen on the streets of Nome in their bright red coats and black trousers, and they smiled by lifting their upper lips to expose their top teeth, I understood that Monty Python’s Flying Circus had been simply a documentary.)",

This was nearly unprecedented—in five seasons, I had had perhaps half a day where inclement weather was stiff enough to warrant truancy (then, it was lightning at a high alpine work site, our hair fuzzed out, metal tools tossed aside in the brush.) This day off wasn’t hard to justify. Visibility was shit, sawing sketchy. At this rate, we’d have to clear the trail again anyway, and there was no other task to do instead, the drains all covered in snow, the tool cache organized, the cabin clean from last season’s closing-up hitch. Reasons aside, why turn down a free day in such a strange and quiet world? We stashed our tools and hard hats, opening senses to the unexpected snow. We hiked a while together before Kent, with wet feet and a sore Achilles, headed back to the cabin, promising hot drinks for us when we returned. After two miles, I turned around, my mind on the book I’d left beneath my sleeping bag that morning, and the hot chocolate Kent would have waiting. Gabe said he wanted to get to the clearing ahead, and he’d catch up. We parted, disappearing into opposite ends of the whiteout.",
