One day in 1987 Fallows was standing at a window in a London bank waiting to be served, when a would-be robber named Douglas Bath stepped in front of him, brandished a handgun, and demanded money from the cashier. Outraged, Fallows told Bath to “bugger off” to the back of the line and wait his turn, to the presumed approving nods of others in the queue. Unprepared for this turn of events, Bath meekly fled the bank empty-handed and was arrested a short distance away.",

Antelopes such as kudu, impala, and bushbuck and mammals such as giraffe, wildebeest, and zebra will look at and study us deeply once they notice our presence. A humble, subservient gaze downward is the appropriate response to their examination. We must remain calm, quiet, composed, and non-threatening. The more humility we emit the longer the animal will remain in our presence. Also, the more humble we are the closer the animal will come. There is no need to prove our superiority to these animals. We are not superior here. Just try to walk out and live in the bush without any mechanical protection. These animals do that daily. Even if we take that step, we become only equal to them, not superior. Thus, a call for humility is appropriate.",

I didn’t tell you I had a baby, did I? She’ll be four months old day after tomorrow, and to look at her you wouldn’t think I’d ever had a sick day. I’d give anything to show you the baby, Miss Bart, and we live right down the street here – it’s only three blocks off.’ She lifted her eyes tentatively to Lily’s face, and then added with a burst of courage: ‘Why won’t you get right into the cars and come home with me while I get baby’s supper? It’s real warm in our kitchen, and you can rest there, and I’ll take you home as soon as ever she drops off to sleep.’",

Or, I can scurry along today and, perhaps, make it to safety early. The further north I ride, the fewer the alternative route options.

One flowed broad and deep through a patch of thick, dark jungle, and beside it Jock looked at me reproachfully; so after a quick swim I led him back to the grasslands, where for two hours we wandered up and down the high banks of several narrow, shallow rivers, whose fording points were always elusive. A few settlements lay on distant hillsides but we only met one local, a youth who asked all the usual questions in Amharinya: ‘Where are you coming from? Where going to? Why alone? Why on foot?’ Trying to answer, I walked on through the knee-high grass, leading Jock – who dawdled today, if not led. (The girths had to be tightened three times during the morning, as he got rid of his wind.) Then I felt a nervous jerk on the halter and looked round to see our companion racing away, clutching my sun-hat and an injara-basket which had been tied to the top of the load. I was furiously angry – the more so as I had been about to stop to put on my hat – but pursuit would have been futile. This theft is serious, for the basket (recently purchased in Gondar) contained compass, map, altimeter, torch, tin-opener, spoon, today’s lunch-tin of tuna fish, water-pills and malaria pills. The pills and tin-opener I should be able to replace in Dessie, but the map and compass are irreplaceable between here and Addis – and without them it may be rather difficult to find Addis. At this latitude the midday sun doesn’t help much and my sense of direction is not reliable on wriggly tracks.",

On some of the precipices isolated pines grow from what appears to be bare rock, and this phenomenon occurs right up to the 10,000-foot summits of the lower peaks. The effect is extraordinarily beautiful, as these simple lines of rock and tree sweep upwards in harmony. All day the sky remained quite clear but the few wisps of white cloud that did go drifting over the highest peaks looked dingy beside those immaculate snow-caps. It was very unpoetic of me, but I couldn’t help thinking of ‘Persil Washes Whiter!’ Even up here at the head of the valley it got so hot around midday that I had to remove my sweater and walk in shirtsleeves; but now, at 7 p.m., the frost is severe.",

The serene surface of the lake, still unappreciably diminished when the smaller tanks were drying up, reflected the short line of low white buildings on its opposite shore, with their domes, chhatris and minarets overhung by heavy-foliaged trees?but reflected it mistily, as though the sharp contrast between moonlight and shade above had run together in the water below. Everything was so peaceful and so still. The air was heavy with the sweet scent of the sajna trees around me, in the shadows of which cows lay placidly in the dust. Fireflies glimmered above them, frogs and crickets filled the night with small sounds, and only the great radiant moon gave light, overflowing and spilling upon the world. On the gleaming face of the water not a ripple moved to disturb that other city below its brink, hardly less real, it sometimes seemed to me, than the one above.",

Obviously the tribesmen had been given orders not to kill, as the surveyors were only wounded, and no Afghan would miss a man-sized target. I’ve often seen them potting tiny birds from fantastic distances just for the hell of it, which sounds a horrid hobby but is no worse than shooting such a glorious thing as a cock-pheasant for its food value. By now I’ve got quite used to all the men around me carrying rifles as Irishmen carry umbrellas and I’ve learned to beware of falling over the stacked weapons when entering a dark, windowless tea-house from bright sunshine.",

Just a block off the main drag at 8:55 in the morning, one could see twentysomethings with wet hair hustling to work from their dormitory-like lodgings, juggling jumbo coffees and smartphones. Two brothers from Mumbai whom I met at the gym said they’d come for the summer on H-1B work visas. Their airfares would be reimbursed only if they completed their contracts. The Skagway library was empty on the inside but bustling outside as cruise ship workers on break for the afternoon used the free Wi-Fi to make Skype calls home in a half-dozen languages.",

Some were lying on charpoys, snoozing away the last minutes before their first meal for thirteen hours. Others sat out on carpets beneath the shady trees enjoying the cool of the evening. Nearby, little boys were playing with brightly coloured diamond-shaped kites which they flew up into the warm evening breeze. They pulled sharply at the strings, then released the kites so that they flew in a succession of angular jerks, higher and higher into the pink evening sky. While most of the fliers were quietly attempting to raise their kites as high as possible into the heavens, some of the boys were engaged in battles with their neighbours. They locked strings with the kites of their enemies and attempted, by means of the ground glass glued on their strings, to cut their opponents’ kites free. Yet, on the rooftops, the kite fliers were easily outnumbered by the pigeon fanciers—the kabooter baz— who stood on almost every terrace, hands extended into the air calling to their pigeons: Aao! Aao! Aao! (Come! Come! Come!) Above them, the sky was full of the soft rush of beating wings, clouds of pigeons dipping and diving in and out of the domes and through the minarets. The flocks whirled and wheeled, higher and higher, before nose-diving suddenly down towards their home terrace on the command of their flier. Some came to rest on the bamboo pigeon frames—horizontal slats of trellising raised on a pole—that several of the fliers had raised above their roofs.",

The proprietress, a frizzy dyed blonde, snapped ‘No room!’ and scowled at me. José pleaded for floor-space in her own quarters: he knew I was equipped to sleep anywhere. In reply she slammed the door. On his own initiative José then tried three other casas – scattered, we were walking for half an hour. Obviously Señor Nasty had no power to order anyone to shelter me; José was on the same mission as Sergei. By now it was dark, San Cristobal’s minor streets are unlit and the pavements’ defects presented a real hazard. Back at the non-hotel Señor Nasty abused my guide for his ‘failure’, then ordered us to try again in another barrio. Whereupon I rebelled, sat on the steps and said, truthfully, that I was too tired to walk one more metre. At that José borrowed a bicycle from a by-stander and pedalled away into blackness.",

Its airy bulk sits on the Piazza of San Lorenzo, a happy place with its large outdoor market, its blue and orange and white and green umbrellas and open stalls nestled up against the church—clothes, leather goods, and bow ties in every possible color displayed. God seems so domestic in Italy—this marvelous juxtaposition of bow ties and architectural grandeur. The cloisters of San Lorenzo—Brunelleschi's—are serene, as by definition cloisters are; outside is hurly-burly. The message we receive is that bow ties and human vanities belong to God as much as worship and as death do; and a very nice thing that is, Savonarola notwithstanding.",

We’re moving so slowly no air is going through the radiator to cool her engine, which is now apparently minutes away from blowing up. We barely make it to the parking area, but barely is still enough for the course marshals to stamp an acceptable arrival time on my time card. Popping the hood, Bernard reports that the fan, which is supposed to force extra air into the radiator, has fallen off its perch and has been blocking air from the radiator instead. Why did it fall off so soon? Because it was installed backwards.",

He suddenly realized the existence of a world beyond his college walls; it made him feel like a hot-house flower exposed to the blustering winds of March. Life was no longer a hurdle in a steeple-chase to be taken at a gallop; it was a tangle of beastly facts that stared you in the face and refused to get out of the way. With growing years, during vacation, he came in contact with a new set of people; men who smiled indulgently at mention of all he held most sacred—art, classics, literature; men who were plainly not insane and yet took up incomprehensible professions of one kind or another—took them up with open eyes and unfeigned zest, and actually prospered at them in a crude worldly fashion.",

At that hour, as I had learned, there were always several people at the studio, who came in every day and brought things to help out when they happened to have the money-biscuits, or sugar, or tea itself. I liked to go there because being an American was not a bad thing at Julia's. If anything, it was good. She and her friends had such a dread of being insular that they would have made me welcome even if they had disliked me personally. They didn't dislike me—they teased me, but they didn't dislike me. And so I had another place to relax in, as well as the Reading Room. I seldom missed a week at Julia's, and sometimes we indulged in little extra sprees that were inexpensive—a bus trip to see the gardens at Hampton Court when the tulips were in bloom, or a meal in Soho. I didn't really enjoy long jaunts, though. I felt guilty about neglecting the Reading Room.",

He had been used to think of himself as being like John Peel with his coat so grey … Up through the heather, over Wharton’s place; the pack running wild; the heather dripping; the mist rolling up … another kind of mist than this south country silver sheet. Silly stuff! Magical! That was the word. A silly word … South country … In the north the old grey mists rolled together, revealing black hillsides.",

In the little pueblo of Jacas Chico, which we reached after a few more downhill miles, we were warmly welcomed and a twelve-year-old girl was sent into the depths of a nearby valley to cut five kilos of oats, for which we were charged only 30 soles. Her mother produced hot water for coffee, to accompany the dozen musty-stale buns we found in a bare-shelved grocery.",
