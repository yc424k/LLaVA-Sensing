At the end of Burmese Days just before Flory commits suicide, he drags his terrified black cocker spaniel, Flo, into his bedroom and blows her head to pieces with his pistol. Tun Lin fondly remembered how much the British loved their dogs. During the Second World War, he said, many British people shot their dogs before the Japanese soldiers took over, because they could not bear to leave them with the enemy. He described a documentary about England’s dog shows that he had seen on a friend’s satellite television. ‘On Discovery Channel I saw many, many dogs having their fur washed and combed and eating wonderful food,’ he said, chuckling at the absurdity of it all. ‘In England you can have a better life as a dog than you can have as a human being here in Burma.’",

But she had been thinking for a while about giving up the house in Guanabacoa for something more centrally located. Traveling to and from Guanabacoa was a nightmare. The apartment the federation had in mind for them would be convenient, but it needed so much plumbing and electrical work that Pipo—who had poured countless hours into repairing their house in Guanabacoa—refused to even consider it.",

Then I thought of the Dalai Lama, asked not long ago by a colleague of mine how he regarded the discos at the foot of the Potala. “No problem,” he said, “no problem,” implying that such surface changes were not important, provided that something more fundamental, in his people’s souls and stomachs, was respected.",

Here the climate was tolerable, though for an hour or so sweat showered off me at every step; then clouds quickly piled up and a cool breeze rose. On the four-mile stretch to Ghinda I passed many other walkers – ragged, lean Muslim tribesmen, highlanders draped in shammas (white cotton cloaks) and skinny children herding even skinnier goats. Everyone stared at me suspiciously and only once was my greeting returned – by a tall, ebony-skinned tribesman. One doesn’t resent such aloofness, since surprise is probably the main cause, but I soon stopped being so unrewardingly amiable. Already I notice a difference between cycling and walking in an unknown country; on foot one is even more sensitive to the local attitude and one feels a little less secure.",

They flew in groups and letter-sets over my dune hollow, moving fast and softly, often passing just a few yards above me, unaware of my presence. These were stealth-fliers, making the transition from predatorless sea to hazardous land, coming in low to avoid danger. Sometimes all I could hear of an incoming group was the tweeting of their wings. Against the dark sky they were visible only as silhouettes. Occasionally the birds sensed me even in the darkness, for they veered off, honking their alarm, and banking from side to side. Some went over so fast that I did not even see them, only heard a squeak and a rush of displaced air, and looked up to see unbroken sky, and a young horned moon.",

    "target_paragraph": "Tin Aye poured some tea into his saucer to cool it down, and sipped from it noisily. ‘So did he really shoot the elephant?’ he asked. This was a question that has obsessed Orwell’s biographers. Just as Orwell often used scenes from real-life in his fiction, so, it has been suggested, he may also have included fictional elements in some writing presented as autobiographical. Throughout his life Orwell was known as an animal-lover, and he was remembered by his colleagues in Burma for his motley collection of strays. His various lodgings were overrun by goats, geese and other farmyard creatures. Nevertheless George Stuart, an old Burma hand who was interviewed in the late 1980s, said that he clearly remembered having drinks one Sunday morning at the Moulmein club when Orwell received news that an elephant had escaped and went off to hunt the beast down. ‘He was very nonchalant over the whole affair,’ said Stuart, recalling that Orwell showed little emotion other than stroking his toothbrush moustache. Stuart speculated that the incident probably ruined Orwell’s colonial career. An elephant was considered a valuable asset to any timber firm—more valuable even than the Indian coolie it trampled to death—and Orwell would have been severely reprimanded for such unnecessary slaughter. It was not long after the incident that he was transferred from Moulmein to a quiet post in Upper Burma called Katha. For most of Orwell’s friends who were interviewed there was no question that the deed had been committed. When one biographer questioned Orwell’s second wife, Sonia, over a bottle of wine or two in a London restaurant she replied, ‘Of course he shot a fucking a elephant. He said he did. Why do you always doubt his fucking word!’",

But when they understood that all was decided, most of the objectors became allies. Warming to the scheme after initial demur, Mr Prideaux undertook to write to India putting my démarche in a favourable light; I determined to announce the fait accompli by letter when I was safely on the way, perhaps from Cologne … Then we planned the despatch of those weekly pounds – each time, if possible, after they had risen to a monthly total of four – by registered letter to suitably spaced-out postes restantes. (Munich would be the first; then I would write and suggest a second.) I next borrowed fifteen pounds off the father of a school friend, partly to buy equipment and partly to have something in hand when I set out. I telephoned to my sister Vanessa, back from India again a few years before, and married and settled in Gloucestershire. My mother was filled with apprehension to begin with; we pored over the atlas, and, bit by bit as we pored, the comic possibilities began to unfold in absurd imaginary scenes until we were falling about with laughter; and by the time I caught the train to London next morning, she was infected with my excitement.",

Things didn’t improve much after she arrived in Havana. She found a place to live when she took an off-the-books job taking care of an elderly man who was in poor health. When Cary and Esperanza joined her in Havana, they lived in a school dormitory, but Zenaida was desperate for something stable, and she thought the only sure way to find that was to join a microbrigade that the hospital was forming to erect several multifamily buildings in San Agustín, a neighborhood on the outskirts of Havana.",

The Firth of Forth gleamed in the distance and the little parks and squares seemed alive with green. I trudged up The Mound to the Old Town terraces to take in the view and was astonished to see how different the city looked. Princes Street was still a scar of architectural regrettabilities, but beyond it the hills were thronged with jaunty roofs and thrusting steeples that gave the city a character and graciousness that had entirely escaped me the day before.",

It is to discover the continent’s mythological crucible, the great outback, the never-never, that decrepit desert land of infinite blue air and limitless power.

In the night, in the dark, I have heard the feet of rain upon the roofs, the glut and gurgle of the gutter spouts, and the soaking gulping throat of all the mighty earth, drinking its thirst out in the month of May – and heard the sorrowful silence of the river in October. The hill-streams foam and welter in a steady plunge, the mined clay drops and melts and eddies in the night, the snake coils cool and glistening under dripping ferns, the water roars down past the mill in one sheer sheet-like plunge, making a steady noise like wind, and in the night, in the dark, the river flows by us to the sea.",

I decided in the morning; I started in the afternoon. I stood in the shade of Churchgate Station and debated whether I had it in me to cross the exposed street to the Tourist Office. Debate languished into daydream; it was minutes before I made the crossing. A flight of steps remained. I sat below a fan and rested. A lure greater than a liquor permit roused me: the office upstairs was air-conditioned. There India was an ordered, even luxurious country. The design was contemporary; the walls were hung with maps and coloured photographs; and there were little wooden racks of leaflets and booklets. Too soon my turn came; my idleness was over. I filled in my form. The clerk filled in his, three to my one, made entries in various ledgers and presented me with a sheaf of foolscap papers: my liquor permit. He had been prompt and courteous. I thanked him. There was no need, he said; it was only a little paperwork.",

She was as still as if landed on the blocks in a dry dock — only she was like this,” He held up his hand, palm under, the tips of the fingers inclined downwards. “Like this,” he repeated. “I could see the line of the horizon before me, as clear as a bell, above her stem-head; I could see the water far off there black and sparkling, and still — still as a-pond, deadly still, more still than ever sea was before — more still than I could bear to look at. Have you watched a ship floating head down, checked in sinking by a sheet of old iron too rotten to stand being shored up? Have you? Oh yes, shored up? I thought of that — I thought of every mortal thing; but can you shore up a bulkhead in five minutes — or in fifty for that matter? Where was I going to get men that would go down below? And the timber — the timber! Would you have had the courage to swing the maul for the first blow if you had seen that bulkhead? Don’t say you would: you had not seen it; nobody would. Hang it — to do a thing like that you must believe there is a chance, one in a thousand, at least, some ghost of a chance; and you would not have believed. Nobody would have believed. You think me a cur for standing there, but what would you have done? What! You can’t tell — nobody can tell. One must have time to turn round. What would you have me do? Where was the kindness in making crazy with fright all those people I could not save single-handed — that nothing could save? Look here! As true as I sit on this chair before you . . . ”",

He flung away the cigarette. “Goodbye,” he said, with the sudden haste of a man who had lingered too long in view of a pressing bit of work waiting for him; and then for a second or so he made not the slightest movement. The downpour fell with the heavy uninterrupted rush of a sweeping flood, with a sound of unchecked overwhelming fury that called to one’s mind the images of collapsing bridges, of uprooted trees, of undermined mountains. No man could breast the colossal and headlong stream that seemed to break and swirl against the dim stillness in which we were precariously sheltered as if on an island. The perforated pipe gurgled, choked, spat, and splashed in odious ridicule of a swimmer fighting for his life. “It is raining,” I remonstrated, “and I . . . ” “Rain or shine,” he began brusquely, checked himself, and walked to the window. “Perfect deluge,” he muttered after a while: he leaned his forehead on the glass. “It’s dark, too.”",

Sterilizing water is tedious work: from now on, I was a more than usually remarkable sight on the march as I swung my water bottle like an Indian club in an effort to dissolve the tablets, which were as hard as lead shot and far less appetizing.

One day its breath was in the air, a haunting premonition of its spirit filled the hearts of men with its transforming loveliness, working its sudden and incredible sorcery upon grey streets, grey pavements, and on grey faceless tides of manswarm ciphers. It came like music faint and far, it came with triumph and a sound of singing in the air, with lutings of sweet bird cries at the break of day and the high, swift passing of a wing, and one day it was there upon the city streets with a strange, sudden cry of green, its sharp knife of wordless joy and pain.",

Baker could not fully explain his fixation with the birds; he knew only that he was committed to a quest whose meaning he did not understand, but whose necessity he could not refute. So absolute was his commitment that, during the months of pursuit each year, he would go almost entirely feral, avoiding human contact as far as possible, keeping to cover wherever he could.",

I dawdled along it, bird-watching, then suddenly came out amidst a glory of giant magnolia trees in full flower. These semi-encircled the District Officer’s residence, one of those magnificent colonial bungalows that have a palatial air despite being single-storeyed.

Then the desert was a green valley with a forest that fed animals like gazelle (and the cheetahs that fed on the gazelles). But for some years, there was a drought and the riverbed silted over. When the rains returned, the river couldn’t push through its old course, so it turned east, and formed the Nile Valley we know today. Before it moved, the river fed aquifers deep underground, and that’s where we now see the oases of Dakhla, Kharga, and Siwa. In those days, the river drained into the Mediterranean a hundred miles west of Alexandria.”",
