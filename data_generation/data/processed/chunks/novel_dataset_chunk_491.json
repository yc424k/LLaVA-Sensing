People led call-and-response chants in Hindi, carrying banners and flags, and I didn’t see one painted face in the crowd. These people didn’t care if they were recognised. On the oval, the hijras danced the Karakattam, a Tamil Nadu folk dance, shrieking and whooping as an American exchange student joined in and the drumming grew more frenetic.

Toward the end of his life, he believed that he had flown across the Atlantic with Lindbergh, “but I got no credit because I was Italian.” The truth was that he worked with Bruno Hauptmann, the convicted kidnapper of the Lindbergh baby [a ladder built by Hauptmann rested against the loft window of my bedroom in Grandpa's country bungalow, and this was an object of terror to me; children do not believe death puts people out of reach, and I thought Hauptmann, executed, would get me next], so there was some link between him and Lindbergh, and he so much preferred his version to the truth it soon became the truth for him.) This driver sets himself to please; he points to every spigot, to everything that might conceivably be called a fountain and says: “Bernini.” And: “Ah, the bats,” he says, “Qaddafi sends them, full of Arab blood.”",

Feeling less real than before behind my dark glasses, which rattled in their broken frame, the Bombay street splintering into dazzle with every step I took, I walked, unnoticed, back to the hotel, past the fat, impertinent Anglo-Indian girl and the rat-faced Anglo-Indian manager in a silky fawn-coloured suit, and lay down on my bed below the electric ceiling fan.",

But suddenly we are out of the trees and moving across open grassland. The mountain is in front of us, a crackling mess of red, the wind blowing in our faces. We push blindly through the undergrowth. On the side of the mountain it’s hot, hotter than I could ever have imagined. We lose our minds a little then. At first we spread out one by one, trying to cut a break along the bottom. It should be getting light, but the sun just meets a burnt-brown sky. Nobody knows what to do and the fire is everywhere. So we forget everything Robert has told us. We scramble up the sides of the mountain and lose ourselves. I am on my own, snuffing out coals. Dousing. Shouting. I stamp on burning logs and calm steaming dirt. But I need more water, more tools, more blankets, more help. I know Agustino has asked people to come. But there are fires everywhere. We’re not the only ones who need help.",

All around gloved waiters moved like mime artists, twirling plates above their heads and taking wide steps around each other. A thali arrived with a turret of biryani in the centre and a pappadum that opened like a lotus, revealing diced salad. I dived in feeling sorry for Passepartout, who was stirring a bowl of pineapple yoghurt, unable to cope with anything solid. Once the last plate was wiped and the final drop drained, we swayed back to the suite for an early night before the morning arrival in Aurangabad to visit the caves at Ellora and Ajanta. An orchid, damp with dew, lay on the duvet next to a card inscribed in gold: God bless the inventor of sleep, the cloak that covers all men’s thought. It was a quotation from Cervantes, who had obviously never tried to sleep on an Indian train. For the next two hours we snaked crazily along the tracks, my neck jolting into an early onset of spondylosis. Abandoning sleep, I opened up my book to see if King Thebaw was settling into his new home any faster than I was. Passepartout, meanwhile, had turned the colour of mint chutney.",

More recently the advertising industry has had a profound influence on official attitudes, too. The Government information service is in many ways no more than a huge public relations company, producing brochures and reports as extravagant as any private firm’s, while the Royal Hong Kong Observatory, from its austere premises upon a Kowloon hillock, issues each year a calendar so glossy that one almost expects its monthly photographs to portray nubile girls, instead of View Across Mirs Bay, or Forest Activities in Guangdong Province. ‘One Of The World’s Biggest Homemakers’, is how the Hong Kong Housing Authority describes itself.",

The five whites on board lived amidships, isolated from the human cargo. The awnings covered the deck with a white roof from stem to stern, and a faint hum, a low murmur of sad voices, alone revealed the presence of a crowd of people upon the great blaze of the ocean. Such were the days, still, hot, heavy, disappearing one by one into the past, as if falling into an abyss for ever open in the wake of the ship; and the ship, lonely under a wisp of smoke, held on her steadfast way black and smouldering in a luminous immensity, as if scorched by a flame flicked at her from a heaven without pity.",

There were no cars, no pollution, no noise other than chirping birds and the Nile’s gentle current breaking at the shores. Until then, we barely realized how much we missed trees and grass after days and weeks surrounded by the monotone deserts. It was, as they say, love at first sight.",

But I must confess I was slightly nettled by the way the rest of the party had gone off without waiting to see whether I would not like to go too. At first, busied by breakfast, I had not thought of this. Presently, in the hop-field, it entered my mind, and though I would not have walked far with them it would have been pleasant to let the rest go on ahead and remain myself in some cool corner talking to my gentle but lately so elusive friend.",

Lately, however, I have come to suspect that perhaps you can get too much choice. I found myself edging around to this view recently when I was at the airport in Portland, Oregon, standing in a line of about fifteen people at a coffee stand. It was 5:45 A.M., not my best time of day, and I had just twenty minutes till my flight was to be called, but I really, really needed to get some caffeine into my system. You know how it is.",

We steamed mildly up the stream to Kousseri. The houses were of adobe, built like baby forts. In the market, Mandara women (the tribe of Ali, the Elephant King) wore myriad short braids on their heads and deeply incised scars on their faces and nothing much else. A young girl had a scar—a narrow black welt—running straight between her brows on to her nose, thus achieving a look of hideous anxiety which a lifetime would, with bad luck, leave on any of us. The Banana women (another tribe) are the ugliest to date, almost too ugly to look at, with anthropoid features, and lip and nostril plugs, and shocking bodies.",

The car was on a regular route, from Guanabacoa to El Curita Park. From there, he walked half a mile through the colonnaded walkways of Old Havana to the Prado, near the cross street called Refugio. Back in Havana’s colonial past, the main gate to the city was barred at night to protect against pirates. Those who weren’t able to get inside before the gates closed took refuge in this area until the gates reopened the next morning. The wall was torn down long ago, but a cannon is still shot off at nine each night to mark the symbolic closing of the gate. And the name of the street remains Refugio.",

I crawled into my camouflaged little niche. The stones cut into my back, but they weren’t as bad as the cold. I was soaking wet and had no fire or anything with which to cover myself. I took the bandanna from around my neck and tied it over my face, and the warmth of my own breath gave me at least the illusion of comfort. Frightening thoughts filled my mind: wild animals, snakes. What if I didn’t find the pack? What if Kevin didn’t get here? I would either be devoured by wild beasts or die of starvation. I felt desperate, desolate, and I leapt out of the niche.",

One day, when arrangements were in progress for getting home corn from one of the aforesaid farms, Elizabeth-Jane received a note by hand, asking her to oblige the writer by coming at once to a granary on Durnover Hill. As this was the granary whose contents Henchard was removing, she thought the request had something to do with his business, and proceeded thither as soon as she had put on her bonnet. The granary was just within the farm-yard, and stood on stone staddles, high enough for persons to walk under. The gates were open, but nobody was within. However, she entered and waited. Presently she saw a figure approaching the gate—that of Donald Farfrae. He looked up at the church clock, and came in. By some unaccountable shyness, some wish not to meet him there alone, she quickly ascended the step-ladder leading to the granary door, and entered it before he had seen her. Farfrae advanced, imagining himself in solitude; and a few drops of rain beginning to fall he moved and stood under the shelter where she had just been standing. Here he leant against one of the staddles, and gave himself up to patience. He, too, was plainly expecting some one; could it be herself? if so, why? In a few minutes he looked at his watch, and then pulled out a note, a duplicate of the one she had herself received.",

We watched the rain fall on the Andes from his little twin bed, an arm’s reach from his “kitchen”—a hot plate—and his “half bath”—a toilet underneath a shower head. He kissed body parts, then tested me on the Spanish words for them, obviously. He reported that I was even speaking Spanish in my sleep, which felt like an enormous triumph.

Augustus Pelham, the diarist, liked a calm atmosphere in which to tell his stories; he liked attention; he liked to elicit little facts, little stories, about the past and the great dead, from such distinguished characters as Mrs Hilbery for the nourishment of his diary, for whose sake he frequented tea-tables and ate yearly an enormous quantity of buttered toast. He, therefore, welcomed Katharine with relief, and she had merely to shake hands with Rodney and to greet the American lady who had come to be shown the relics, before the talk started again on the broad lines of reminiscence and discussion which were familiar to her.",

One looked across at me, its eyeshine gleaming gold with the last light, then all three moved off westwards along the chalk tracks.

Passing his hand over the sheep’s left flank, and selecting the proper point, he punctured the skin and rumen with the lance as it stood in the tube; then he suddenly withdrew the lance, retaining the tube in its place. A current of air rushed up the tube forcibly enough to have extinguished a candle held at the orifice.",

Small extrovert children romped around the open spaces, making new friends as they went. A happy mixed family occupied the seats opposite mine, in the next block – white wife, black husband, toddler son was happy if left free to wander. Only his maternal grandfather, an army officer, was allowed to restrain him: pick him up and carry him round while grandad’s cap was repeatedly removed, tried on, then flung to the ground with a chortle. As the overhead clock registered 2.30, 3.30, 4.30, no one seemed disgruntled. Beside two of the platforms long trains stretched away into the distance looking as though they had been stationary for months if not years. And maybe they had.",

The rivers would run forever, and April would come as sweetly and as fairly and with as sharp a cry when all their strident tongues were stopped with dust. Yes! For all their bicker and the fever of their fierce uneasiness, she wanted to tell them that their cries would go unheard, their love would be misprized, their pain unnoticed, that the glory of the Spring would still shine calmly and with joy when all their flesh was rotten, and that other men some day on other pavements would think of them, of all their efforts and endurances, even of all their crimes and boasts of power, with pity and with condescension.",

Harriman’s bear-hunting party walked up and down over the slippery glacier until 11:00 P.M., slept lightly, and started again at 4:00 A.M. The second day, “we trudged slowly over ice in a drenching rain,” Merriam recorded in his journal. This was a prelude to a long march through knee-deep wet snow. The experienced scout Yellowstone Kelly,* who’d spent the prior summer in Alaska, took stock of conditions and dropped out. Urged on by Harriman, team members roped themselves together to forge ahead across several snow-filled crevasses. When they finally gazed down into Howling Valley, Merriam wrote, “we not only saw no signs of life, but not a single track.” The hunt was abandoned.",

That notion lasted until the Saturday morning a tampon-seeking expedition brought me to a neighborhood drugstore. There in a glass case, tucked between some ginseng and a jar of dried sea horses, was a stack of soft-porn photos. Porn hardly warranted a second glance in Moscow, but those contorted bodies seemed bizarrely out of place in Beijing, especially in a family pharmacy. So I examined them more closely and saw they were condom covers. Though they appeared to have been packaged in China, they depicted voluptuous blondes and busty redheads—Westerners, naturally, instead of Chinese. After gaping at them a minute or two, I realized they were surrounded by dildos and vibrators in every imaginable color and an impressive assortment of sizes. And alongside those were a dozen boxes of strange hairy things. I bent down for a closer look: rubber vaginas!",
