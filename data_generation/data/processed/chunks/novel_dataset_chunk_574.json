I'm blowing my nose.\"\n\"I wish I could make it sound like that.\"\nThey stood on the Kendals' doorstep, in the dark, under the snow. Snow powdered the flagstone path swept ready for the New Year's party.\n\"Think,\" she said, \"their poor party. It would be awful of us.\"\nRoddy rang. As they waited they began to laugh again. Helpless, ruinous, agonising laughter.\n\"Oh—oh—I can hear Martha coming. Do something. You might be unbuckling my snow-shoes.\"\nThe party was waiting for them in the drawing-room. Dr. Charles. Miss Louisa Wright, stiff fragility. A child's face blurred and delicately weathered; features in innocent, low relief. Pale hair rolled into an insubstantial puff above each ear. Speedwell eyes, fading milkily. Hurt eyes, disappointed eyes. Dr. Charles had disappointed her.\nDorsy Heron, tall and straight. Shy hare's face trying to look austere.\nNorman Waugh, sulky and superior, in a corner.\nAs Roddy came in everybody but Norman Waugh turned round and stared at him with sudden, happy smiles. He was so beautiful that it made people happy to look at him. His very name, Rodney Olivier, sounded more beautiful than other people's names.\nDorsy Heron's shy hare's eyes tried to look away and couldn't. Her little high, red nose got redder.\nAnd every now and then Dr. Charles looked at Rodney, a grave, considering look, as if he knew something about him that Rodney didn't know.",

Suddenly, he saw that his life had been channelled by a series of accidents: a mad Rebel singing of Armageddon, the sound of a bugle on the road, the mule-hoofs of the army, the silly white face of an angel in a dusty shop, a slut’s pert wiggle of her hams as she passed by. He had reeled out of warmth and plenty into this barren land: as he stared out the window and saw the fallow unworked earth, the great raw lift of the Piedmont, the muddy red clay roads, and the slattern people gaping at the stations – a lean farmer gangling above his reins, a dawdling negro, a gap-toothed yokel, a hard sallow woman with a grimy baby – the strangeness of destiny stabbed him with fear. How came he here from the clean Dutch thrift of his youth into this vast lost earth of rickets?",

I was hoping for a little more action on this drive. It was late winter, and the air was crisp and still carried the nighttime scent of damp grass. The flood season was just ending in the Okavango, so the entire landscape was lush with greenery, dotted with small pools of water fed by dwindling channels.",

A clinic doctor gave me prescriptions for Cipro antibiotic and said I should buy other medications also for intestinal ailments. He warned against tickborne encephalitis, a danger east of the Urals; he said there’s no vaccine against it and no cure. Fortunately, the ticks that have it are infectious only in the spring.

The view out the tent door is gorgeous, especially because a cloud of midges is not trying to get in. The grass is cut, so no ticks. Downtown calls, all two stores of it. The first is Outdoor House and Filling Station. The Outdoor House part is closed. Filling Station part is a twenty-four hour affair, the importance of which cannot be overstated. I expect you have grasped the very long distances between services in the Highlands. Towns with stores and post offices may not have filling stations. In this part of the world, petrol stops are paramount which may explain why downtown appears to be thriving. Walking past the Scourie Hotel, I see the very tidy store/post office ahead. Fresh vegetables, fresh milk, and a creditable stock of items. That’s not the surprise, though. The surprise is that it is open on Sundays. I have evidently travelled far enough from the grasp of the Presbyterians that this hedonistic grocery shop is open seven days a week. No singing and dancing allowed inside, though.",

Some quarter-of-a-mile upstream – where the river was about 100 yards wide and ten feet deep – a little dam had been built, and though the current was still strong here it seemed that by swimming diagonally above the dam I could just about make it to the other side. Fortunately my self-confidence when in water equals my lack of self-confidence when over water; I always enjoy a challenge from this element and poor Mingmar, who had anxiously followed me upstream on the opposite bank, was suffering most from tension as I dived into the icy, clear green pool. By the half-way stage I had the measure of the current and knew that there was not the slightest danger; yet I didn’t dare ease off for long enough to yell reassuringly to Mingmar and until I stepped onto the rock beside him he remained convinced that I must drown.",

She watched, indeed, not a face, but a procession, not of people, but of life itself; the good and bad; the meaning; the past, the present, and the future. All this seemed apparent to her, and she was not ashamed of her extravagance so much as exalted to one of the pinnacles of existence, where it behoved the world to do her homage. No one but she herself knew what it meant to miss Ralph Denham on that particular night; into this inadequate event crowded feelings that the great crises of life might have failed to call forth. She had missed him, and knew the bitterness of all failure; she desired him, and knew the torment of all passion. It did not matter what trivial accidents led to this culmination. Nor did she care how extravagant she appeared, nor how openly she showed her feelings.",

He didn’t think Couzens was worth it and essentially drove him to leave. Couzens sold out in 1915 and went into politics, eventually becoming a U.S. senator for Michigan, where he made himself famous by attacking Andrew Mellon for favoring the rich (an irony appreciated by many since Couzens was believed to be the richest man in Congress).",

Another opening gave me a glimpse back down into the Basin. It would have been, I thought, somewhere just like this bealach that the first of the Skye glaciers would have formed - the glaciers that had ground out the great valley space of the Basin itself, during the Pleistocene period: from two and a half million years ago, until the last glaciers receded from Skye around 14,700 years ago.",

They look alike: small-boned and large-eyed, with elaborately made-up triangular faces framed in crudely-permed raven-black hair. Isabel, however, seems interested only in male customers: it was Katie who laid down her hand of cards for long enough to pour me a beer. She arrived here yesterday to visit her mother, one of two teachers at the local (unequipped) school which has 120 pupils, many of whom walk five hours a day in pursuit of learning.",

It conceals awkwardness, and befits grace of movement; it is fit for the climate, is equally adapted for walking and riding, and has that general appropriateness which is desirable in costume. The women have a most peculiar walk, with a swinging motion from the hip at each step, in which the shoulder sympathises. I never saw anything at all like it. It has neither the delicate shuffle of the Frenchwoman, the robust, decided jerk of the Englishwoman, the stately glide of the Spaniard, or the stealthiness of the squaw; and I should know a Hawaiian woman by it in any part of the world. A majestic wahine with small, bare feet, a grand, swinging, deliberate gait, hibiscus blossoms in her flowing hair, and a le of yellow flowers falling over her holoku, marching through these streets, has a tragic grandeur of appearance, which makes the diminutive, fair-skinned haole, tottering along hesitatingly in high-heeled shoes, look grotesque by comparison.",

Obeying an impulse which sprang from some desire to interrupt this methodical marching, Mary stepped on to the grass walk and put her hand on his arm.",

The neighbouring Sheikh of Mazahit, near Rostaq, had joined him, causing a defection from the Sultan of 500 to 1,000 men. Towards the end of July, Hamad ibn Ibrahim, a cousin and friend of the Sultan?in more or less independent possession of the forts of Rostaq and Hazam?surrendered to the Imam. Some discussion concerning him had arisen between the Imam and Sheikh Isa, the former wishing to remove him from Rostaq, while the latter was in favour of his being allowed to remain. Ramadan, of course, helped to delay any active revival of the rebellion, but current reports seem to indicate that Muscat affairs may come into prominence again during the coming winter.",

So in the middle of 1861 a substantial minority of the white miners—somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000, it appears—got together and staged a riot. It was a curiously organized affair. To begin with, the rioters brought in a brass band, which played “Rule, Britannia” and the “Marseillaise” among other rousing tunes deemed suitable for a civil disturbance. They also made and carried a large banner, which has since become something of an icon in Australian history. So, as the band played the kind of tunes normally heard at a Sunday afternoon park concert, the miners moved through the Chinese area beating people up with pickax handles or worse, robbing them, and setting their tents alight. Then, just to make a day of it, they went on to burn down the courthouse. Afterward eleven of the rioters were tried but none were convicted. Obviously not Australia’s proudest moment.",

He joined us in a long room, many-windowed with cheerful primrose walls, where coarse grey blankets had been spread on rows of hard benches for the visitors’ comfort. Here prisoners can embrace their relatives and cuddle their small children, a four-day-old baby the smallest. His father wept for joy and sadness on taking the little bundle into his arms.",

Perhaps those old beams had been here since Kennan. From a hempen rope tied around one of the beams, some village boys in shorts or underpants were swinging and dropping into a deep part of the river. The water was clear and tannin tinted, and it had a visible current, a rarity in Siberia. I thought of going out onto the bridge but decided the planks looked risky.

But hotels meant cities, so Sergei would never agree.

(In the new South Africa, on the educational scene, people seem to move from crisis to crisis with little routine activity in between.) The college is now being overwhelmed by demands for admission that ignore all financial and physical constraints. A new residential block has recently been built and is visible from the road, therefore extra space is assumed to be available. But it isn’t. Already 230 students have been admitted though there are adequate (more or less) resources for only 180. At first ‘crisis’ seemed too strong a word for this situation. Then I heard about the Registrar of Nongoma TTC: since my visit he has been shot dead for refusing to admit 200 more students than his college could accommodate. And last month, in Mokopane College of Education, a youth was killed in a fierce battle between student teachers and a crowd of young men whose applications had been rejected. Soon after, SAPS had to rescue these same students when Mokopane residents stormed the campus, accusing them of having deprived ‘locals’ of their ‘rightful’ places.",

(The property abutted the estate of the Tiffany family of jewelry renown.) The first director was Charles Davenport, a Harvard-trained biologist. Davenport believed eugenic explanations could be found for every aspect of the human condition?obesity, criminality, propensity to lie or cheat, even love of the sea. Under Davenport, the ERO also made several studies of the deleterious effects of racial interbreeding. As Davenport explained: “One often finds in mulattoes ambition and drive combined with low intelligence, so that the hybrid is unhappy, dissatisfied with his fate and rebellious.… A hybridized people are a badly put together people and a dissatisfied, restless, ineffective people.” Davenport argued not just for the sterilization of the inferior and faulty, but for their castration, in order to remove desire as well as reproductive ability, just to be on the safe side.",

At 1.15, as we approached the Plaza de Armas – in Inca days the great Square of Aucaypata, larger than St Mark’s Square in Venice and the very heart of the Empire – Rachel did a quick sum and announced that the conquistadores had beaten us by a week. They left Cajamarca on 11 August and arrived in Cuzco on 15 November. We left Cajamarca on 9 September and have arrived in Cuzco on 20 December. The Spaniards’ progress was of course slightly slowed by their having to fight four major battles en route. But we had no Indian guides and one member of our expedition was aged nine/ten. I looked past Juana to Rachel in the lead, her short legs covering the last stage of (for her) a 900-mile walk. And then – why deny it? – I felt very proud of her. Especially because there was never once, through hunger, thirst, heat, cold or exhaustion, a whimper of complaint. Rachel would not wish me to say so, but as mini-conquistadores go she’s done pretty well.",

In all the terrain that is more or less focussed on the post office at Eagle, he is the most experienced, the best person to be sought out by anyone determined to live much beyond the outermost tip of the set society. He knows the woods, the animals, sleds, traps, furs, dogs, frozen rivers, and swift water. He is the sachem figure. And he had long since achieved this status when a day arrived in which a tooth began to give him great pain. He lay down in his cabin and waited for the nuisance to pass. But the pain increased and was apparently not going to go away. It became so intense he could barely stand it. He was a couple of hundred miles from the most accessible dentist. So he took a pair of channel-lock pliers and wrapped them with tape, put the pliers into his mouth, and clamped them over the hostile tooth. He levered it, worked it awhile, and passed out. When he came to, he picked up the pliers and went back to work on the tooth. It wouldn’t give. He passed out again. Each time he attacked the tooth with the pliers, he passed out. Finally, his hand would not move. He could not make his arm lift the pliers toward his mouth. So he set them down, left the cabin, and—by dogsled and mail plane—headed for the dentist, in Fairbanks.",

One could argue – I have to try to make excuses – that a bicycle is not, after all, ‘just a machine’ as is a motor car. The cyclist and the bicycle form a team; they work together as the motorist and motor car do not. Perhaps other cyclists exist, somewhere out there, who can understand this. Or perhaps not. Maybe I’m uniquely dotty.",

The great high hallway was cool and shadowy. The heifer and the barley alike had vanished. We climbed upon the balcony as if upon a cloud to watch a flock of white pigeons take off from the roof below and fan out in perfect formation on the blue, the flicker of their wings twinkling frostily like the early Pleiades. We drank a glass of wine up there in the crisp air while Andreas Menas told the trees, with the sort of loving comprehension that comes to those who have planted them and watched them bear. ‘A vine here and a vine there,’ he said stroking his moustache with a brown hand, ‘and in a year you could give this whole balcony shade. Why bother with con­crete?’ He pronounced the word after the village fashion, ‘gon-gree’. Meanwhile Michaelis explored the two fine cellars and pronounced them large enough to house anything up to two camels. Andreas Kallergis sat drawing in the dust with his finger, waiting to see what ideas I had for the place.",
