The evening before, in my favourite draught beer bar, Bertie could be heard loudly explaining that a publisher had commissioned him to find hill tribes as yet unknown to tourists who could be photographically processed for an ‘original’ coffee-table book. Meanwhile Bessie had been photographing tribal children’s skin diseases on behalf of a new NGO in search of an ‘original’ fund-raising gimmick. (‘An easy one to fiddle!’ thought I cynically.) The pair were just back from Yunnan and their German companions yawned more than once during Bertie’s bite-by-bite account of Chinese meals. When Bessie heard my brogue she screeched, ‘I adore the Irish, my favourite people!’ Then she sat on my lap and tried to hug and kiss me – whereupon Bertie shouted, ‘Come on, my girl! Time for bed, we’ve an early start!’ As Bessie hiccuped and reached for the nearest jug of beer (mine) her husband dragged her off my lap and steered her towards the door. These were not the sort of companions one would hand-pick for a long journey in a confined space.",

The ripples of the sea made little gurgling noises at their feet. They screwed up their eyes to be able to look into the blaze of light beyond the shade of their tree. The hot smell from the pine-needles and from the cushions of wild thyme that padded the spaces between the rocks, and sometimes a smell of pure honey from a clump of warm irises up behind them in the sun, puffed across their faces. Very soon Mrs. Wilkins took her shoes and stockings off, and let her feet hang in the water. After watching her a minute Mrs. Arbuthnot did the same. Their happiness was then complete. Their husbands would not have known them. They left off talking. They ceased to mention heaven. They were just cups of acceptance.",

I had always been opposed to tipoyes, because Stewart was, and I often quoted him to the effect that anyone not crippled ought to walk in the forest, especially on a hunting safari. But the official, naturally, objected to riding while I walked, and as he also objected to walking, I had to ride. It was a bumpy business. Clearly, tipoye-riding was not only wrong in principle but uncomfortable. By the time Monsieur, aided by a local chief and any number of trackers, had got his elephant, I was heartily sorry I had ever gone along. The thought of Tange seemed good once more, and my liverish dislike of Stewart was sweated out. I left the Belgian official before the next leg of his trip and went home to Tange by pirogue.",

There, too, I saw pilgrims with enormous, weighty backpacks, sacrificing their comfort, enduring hardship and stress, pushing their limits for a higher or more important personal goal. I had already decided I was not going to walk the walk, but maybe honoring the sites was an indirect way to be of service. I had no backpack, but I had expended effort to get there: booking air travel, securing accommodations, renting a car, paying money, standing in line.",

Roz was not built to move at the pace of meandering cattle, and on her slim tyres one has to dismount repeatedly or fall off; but one can sit on Leo when he’s almost stationary, while waiting for the sacred cow and her sacred calf to deign to move out of the way – it’s the difference between taking a cart-horse and a thoroughbred through city streets. Naturally I wouldn’t exchange Roz for half-a-dozen Leos, but in his way he’s sound enough and will keep me happy in Pokhara.",

Her neighbors knew she worked at the port, and many asked her what really had happened down there that miserable summer of 1994. And when she attended mass across the street at Los Escolapios, she’d see one of her classmates from La Milagrosa, Caridad Guerra, folded into one of the old pews, her hands clasped in prayer. Mari knew that Caridad’s daughter, her granddaughter, her brother, and her son-in-law Felo, the stepson of Jorge García’s uncle Gustavo, all had drowned on the 13 de Marzo. But Mari never felt it was right to reopen her friend’s wounds by asking her about the tragedy. If she ever wanted to talk about what happened, Mari would be there to listen. Until then, she just prayed for her.",

Blind whitewashed arcades, in two tiers, enclose a space a quarter of a mile long by 150 yards wide. At the near end, by me, stands the ruin of the Bazaar Gate; at the far, facing it, the blue portal of the Masjid-i-Shah, with dome, ivan, and minarets clumped obliquely behind it in the direction of Mecca; in front of each, a pair of marble goal-posts for polo. On the right rises that brick boot-box the Ali Gapu; opposite, the flowered saucer-dome of the Mosque of Sheikh Lutfullah, skewed sideways over a blue recess. Symmetry; but not too much. The beauty lies in the contrast between a formal space and a romantic diversity of buildings. To spoil this effect, and to show that Bakhtiari gentlemen are no longer allowed to play polo or exercise their horses here, Progress has constructed a sheet of ornamental water in the middle. This is surrounded by a Gothic iron railing and incipient petunia-beds.",

The Grand Hotel, the biggest and oldest resort hotel in America, was built and the country’s wealthiest industrialists constructed ornate summer houses on the bluffs overlooking Mackinac village and Lake Huron. I walked up there now. The views across the lake were fantastic, but the houses were simply breathtaking. They are some of the grandest, most elaborate houses ever built of wood, twenty-bedroomed places with every embellishment known to the Victorian mind – cupolas, towers, domes, gables, turrets, and front porches you could ride a bike around. Some of the cupolas had cupolas. They are just incredibly splendid and there are scores of them, standing side by side on the bluffs flanking Fort Mackinac. What it must be to be a child and play hide-and-seek in those houses, to have a bedroom in a tower and be able to lie in bed and gaze out on such a lake, to go bicycling on carless roads to little beaches and hidden coves, and above all to explore the woodland of beech and birch that cover the back three quarters of the island.",

We sidestepped garbage and excrement and ignored the cries of a thousand taxi drivers (TAX…!) till we found the ticket agency, on the ground floor of a commercial building a few blocks away. The lobby was dark and hot and humid. The air reeked of diesel exhaust and ammonia, and cat feces littered the floor. The Go Bus office looked abandoned. Its lights were off and the door closed. There was nobody inside. We left, empty-handed, and walked back to the hotel. I cursed life in Cairo all the way.",

The Austrians, it seemed, were mocking us. Unaware that two of our party could understand every word they said, they were talking freely ? every one of them: the men, the women, the landlord, the landlord’s wife, the whole fucking village ? about taking us out back and, as Gerhard translated, ‘of giving us a hair-cut and running us through with zer pitchforks’.",

We could see brightly coloured, flashing lights in the distance and hear music playing above the buzz of generators, so headed in that direction, with no obvious point of reference in the otherwise dark streets. Kirsty was walking on my right, and her tight grip on my arm told me she was still on edge following the earlier rhino encounter.

For hours the road bordered the non-independent homeland of Gazankulu – population almost a million, the land stony and thornbushy, in contrast to the irrigated farms on my right with their orange-groves and flourishing fields of maize, groundnuts, sunflowers. In South Africa, a naturally arid country, access to water is a privilege in most regions. Since the first settlers arrived major droughts (always described as ‘the worst’) have been mentioned at irregular but frequent intervals. For the past century, by far the greater share of the water supply has been allocated by law to whites – who in the 1930s received subsidies to encourage private irrigation. Considerable capital is required to install and run the sort of pumps watering those fields I passed this morning.",

It rarely snows here and only a few white summits are visible above the walls of the cage. But one splendid, sharp, triangular peak shone to the north-east like a silver torch against the cold blue sky. It was catching the sunlight that already, when we landed at 2.25, had been cut off from the valley.",

All this would make the dull, blonde, fat Mathilda very angry. Sometimes she would get so angry that she would, in her thick, slow way, and with jealous anger blazing in her light blue eyes, tell her mother that she did not see how she could like that nasty Lena; and then her mother would scold Mathilda, and tell her that she knew her cousin Lena was poor and Mathilda must be good to poor people.",

On Kodiak Island, the harsh winter minimized the summer’s wild berry crop, but Harry and Brigid Dodge reported that a strong salmon run had resulted in favorable conditions for both hungry bears and those who love to watch them. Sitting at my desk beneath my enormous map of Alaska, I felt a pang of bruin envy. Then someone forwarded a video of a massive brown bear bursting out of the woods to chase an automobile along the same two-lane Yakutat road I’d blithely bicycled down a year earlier, and I got over it.",

Boulders the size of large cars and small houses were strewn about. At the far end of the gorge a blinding white glacier seemed to seal off any exit at the spot where John had said Choquetacarpo Pass would be. A shaggy wild mule wandered out of a cave, looking for food. Finding none, he disappeared into another cave. Where he’d come from originally I couldn’t begin to guess. There were no homes here, no farms, not even a rooster, just us and the rocks and Pachacutec’s trail. Two hours earlier we’d been sweating through Southern California; now we were freezing in northern Scotland.",

An enormous filthy covered market, reeking of rotten fish and neglected latrines, offered few goods but proved past prosperity. Two- or three-storeyed colonnaded shops-cum-dwellings, with fine wrought-iron balconies and Asian family names proudly moulded on plaster façades, lined wide streets now almost impassable to wheeled traffic. Many unemployed young men loitered about looking hungry and, like jobless youths everywhere, exuded the musk of latent aggression. Amin’s planes bombed Bukoba in 1978 but fourteen years later, in a town so beat-up, it was hard to distinguish between bomb damage and economic collapse. At least half the shops and merchants’ residences have been boarded up and abandoned; Asians still run the other half but trading is limited – I couldn’t find a pair of shoes. Pale-faced, delicately featured, large-eyed children – dressed as though for a party – gazed down from their balconies or walked decorously beside grown-ups along the dusty streets. I also noticed an unusual number of mixed-race young adults, allegedly the consequence of failing businesses during the Nyerere era. Then the traditional Asian aloofness became impractical and the unthinkable had to happen – marriage into Black families whose political affiliations allowed them to thrive when all around was an economic wasteland. The Asians, too, speak Swahili rather than English, which illogically surprised me; they have, after all, been settled in Tanzania for three or four generations.",

Its modest ‘effects’, compact of enamel paint and ingenuity, spoke to him in the language just then sweetest to his ear. It is surprising how little narrow walls and a low ceiling matter, when the roof of the soul has suddenly been raised. Gerty sparkled too; or at least shone with a tempered radiance. He had never before noticed that she had ‘points’ – really, some good fellow might do worse … Over the little dinner (and here, again, the effects were wonderful) he told her she ought to marry – he was in a mood to pair off the whole world. She had made the caramel custard with her own hands. It was sinful to keep such gifts to herself. He reflected with a throb of pride that Lily could trim her own hats – she had told him so the day of their walk at Bellomont.",

McKinlay had been too wet and cold to sleep, so he went aboard and found Bartlett there in the galley with Hadley, the gramophone blaring as loud as it could go. Bartlett had all 150 records stacked in a pile, and he’d put on a record, play it through, then lift it and toss it into the galley fire and put on another. He did this over and over, one record after the next. After every dozen records or so, the captain walked to the starboard deck and checked the ship’s position.

Miss Wincher simply didn’t know how she got through the days; though no doubt it was as good as a rest-cure after the rush of the winter. Of course they would have preferred to hire a house, but the “hole,” if one could believe it, didn’t offer one; so they had simply shut themselves off as best they could from the “hotel crew”—had her friend, Miss Wincher parenthetically asked, happened to notice the Sunday young men? They were queerer even than the “belles” they came for—and had escaped the promiscuity of the dinner-hour by turning one of their rooms into a dining-room, and picnicking there—with the Persimmon House standards, one couldn’t describe it in any other way!

Peter Walsh sat there. One might fancy that day, the London day, was just beginning. Like a woman who had slipped off her print dress and white apron to array herself in blue and pearls, the day changed, put off stuff, took gauze, changed to evening, and with the same sigh of exhilaration that a woman breathes, tumbling petticoats on the floor, it too shed dust, heat, colour; the traffic thinned; motor cars, tinkling, darting, succeeded the lumber of vans; and here and there among the thick foliage of the squares an intense light hung. I resign, the evening seemed to say, as it paled and faded above the battlements and prominences, moulded, pointed, of hotel, flat, and block of shops, I fade, she was beginning, I disappear, but London would have none of it, and rushed her bayonets into the sky, pinioned her, constrained her to partnership in her revelry.",

After breakfast Ghulam Nabi begged me to inspect the hospital and as we had been invited to lunch by the Tahsildar there was time then for only a short wander around muddy fields. We saw the first ploughing of the season, on an exceptionally sunny terrace that had been spread with manure by women. Two yak-cow cross-breds were pulling the crudest possible wooden plough, without even an iron tip; leather thongs held it to the bamboo yoke and the ploughman had to exert considerable force to make any impression on the new-thawed earth. As each strip was ploughed, four men, wielding wide, clumsily-made wooden rakes, broke up the large lumps. Then the women reappeared and used bare hands to blend the manure with the rich brown soil, as though kneading some gigantic cake. Meanwhile the rakers had joined a small group of men at the edge of the field and were enjoying a few drags on a hookah and keeping their hands warm over a tiny fire of twigs and grassroots.",

But later that night, when I went to the local casino (not far from the bingo hall and just down the street from the office where they were announcing lottery winners), I suddenly heard an all-too-familiar voice behind me. “Good morning,” it piped (it was 10:30 p.m.). I turned around to see the frisky young guide adjusting a bow tie above his tuxedo. “Jujuy is the capital of the province of Jujuy,” I reminded him. He looked exultant. “Tomorrow you go to Cafayate?” “Yes.” “We meet at six forty-five! I am your guide! Good morning!” Preparing himself now for a moonlighting spell as a croupier, the poor man was apparently going to be working for thirty-six hours without stop.",

It was, he saw, a Northern city: the bases of its form were vertical. Even the night here, the quality of darkness, had a structural framework, an architecture of its own. Here, compared with the qualities of night in London or in Paris, which were rounder, softer, of more drowsy hue, the night was vertical, lean, immensely clifflike, steep and clear. Here everything was sharp. It burned so brightly, yet it burned sweetly, too. For what was so incredible and so lovely about this high, cool night was that it could be so harsh and clear, so arrogantly formidable, and yet so tender, too. There were always in these nights, somehow, even in nights of clear and bitter cold, not only the structure of lean steel, but a touch of April, too: they could be insolent and cruel, and yet there was always in them the suggestion of light feet, of lilac darkness, of something swift and fleeting, almost captured, ever gone, a maiden virginal as April.",

The concierge was standing outside Jamie’s door, and with her was a young man, one of the tenants. The concierge had tried the door; it was locked and no one made any response to her knocking. She had brought Jamie up a cup of hot coffee—Stephen saw it, the coffee had slopped into the saucer. Either pity or the memory of Mary’s large tips, had apparently touched the heart of this woman.\nStephen hammered loudly: ‘Jamie!’ she called, and then again and again: ‘Jamie! Jamie!’\nThe young man set his shoulder to a panel, and all the while he pushed he was talking. He lived just underneath, but last night he was out, not returning until nearly six this morning. He had heard that one of the girls had died—the little one—she had always looked fragile.\nStephen added her strength to his; the woodwork was damp and rotten with age, the lock suddenly gave and the door swung inwards.\nThen Stephen saw: ‘Don’t come here—go back, Mary!’ But Mary followed them into the studio.\nSo neat, so amazingly neat it was for Jamie, she who had always been so untidy, she who had always littered up the place with her large, awkward person and shabby possessions, she who had always been Barbara’s despair…Just a drop or two of blood on the floor, just a neat little hole low down in her left side. She must have fired upwards with great foresight and skill—and they had not even known that she owned a revolver!\nAnd so Jamie who dared not go home to Beedles for fear of shaming the woman she loved, Jamie who dared not openly mourn lest Barbara’s name be defiled through her mourning, Jamie had dared to go home to God—to trust herself to His more perfect mercy, even as Barbara had gone home before her.",

The dangerous thing is to meet one face to face on a winding mountain path; then they are terrified and attack, but if they hear your approach they will always run away. So you are advised to sing loudly when walking alone on such paths and, should the worst happen while you are briefly resting the larynx, you are recommended to lie down at once and remain quite still; apparently an upright human has a most deleterious effect on a bear’s nervous system. Personally I should have thought that lying quite still in the shadow of a jittery bear would have an even more deleterious effect on a human’s nervous system. But the point has been noted.",
