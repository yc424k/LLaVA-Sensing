After leaving the summit, fifteen minutes of cautious shuffling over a 7,000-foot abyss brought me to the notorious Hillary Step, a pronounced notch in the ridge that demands some technical maneuvering.

To an extent unusual among cities, Anchorage has certain absolute boundaries, and in that sense its growth has been a confined explosion. To the north, a pair of military bases establish, in effect, a Roman wall. To the west and south, fjordlike arms of the Pacific—Knik Arm, Turnagain Arm—frame the city. Behind Anchorage, east, stand the Chugach Mountains, stunning against the morning and in the evening light—Mount Magnificent, Mount Gordon Lyon, Temptation Peak, Tanaina Peak, Wolverine Peak, the Suicide Peaks. Development has gone to some extent upward there. Houses are pushpinned to the mountainsides—a Los Angelized setting, particularly at night, above the starry lights of town. But the mountains are essentially a full stop to Anchorage, and Anchorage has nowhere else to go.",

The hills stretched away as far as the eye could reach into the wintry haze, like a vast heaving sea frozen to stillness. The valleys were filled with blue shadow, and all the sunward slopes were the colour of rusty gold. At our feet the ground fell away into an immense blue gulf.

Then unexpectedly to north and east the highest summits briefly reflected a pink-orange-copper glow; and for a few unforgettable moments those peaks seemed detached from their own massive shadowy bulks – islands of radiance, floating far above the twilit world.",

He was working by starlight only and occasionally violet sparks ran to and fro along the wires causing the spectators to gasp fearfully or giggle nervously.

Retracing my steps I heard, now and then, a faint and mournful wail, not human, which seemed to come from abysmal depths far back in the bowels of the plateau, from the underworld, from subterranean passageways better left forever unseen and unknown. I hurried on, the cries faded away. I was glad to be getting out of there. Then they came again, louder and as it seemed from all sides, out of the rock itself, surrounding me. A terrifying caterwauling it was, multiplied and amplified by echoes piled on echoes, overlapping and reinforcing one another. I looked back to see what was hunting me but there was only the naked canyon in the dim, bluish light that filtered down from far above. I thought of the Minotaur. Then I thought of Newcomb and began to run.",

The goldsmiths were closed, their gates pulled tight against the day. Teresa snapped a few photos to capture the morning’s solitude. In one shot, a minaret climbs high above the street, like a Saturn V rocket ready for launch. In another shot, a sliver of sunlight pierces through a crack in the makeshift roof overhead and casts a warm glow in an empty square. Once again, in a city of seventeen million people, we had the street to ourselves. To this day, I remember the alley, though I can’t remember how we found it. We stopped to enjoy the peace and quiet there, if only for a minute. Then, as we crossed through the next square, I can’t remember which one, an older fellow with a round face joined us on our walk. He told us about the goldsmiths and the spices and the essences. He knew where to find them all, he said, for the best price, of course. We ignored his pitch, but he wasn’t done. The khan, he informed us, was founded by so-and-so for such-and-such. I can’t remember exactly what he said because I wasn’t listening. “Please, sir, don’t follow us,” I said firmly, but politely. Our would-be tour guide mumbled something under his breath and threw a crumpled, dirty napkin at me. For the only time in my life, I was glad not to understand Arabic.",

We feel very fortunate indeed that, when we drive by, the ramp is clear of other vehicles. That there’s a mound of garbage in the gap between the two slanted slabs of concrete, where street dogs are nosing around for breakfast, is only a momentary deterrence.",

That day it would feel like a blessing if Julie simply performed her role and let me perform mine. But sadly, that was not to be the case. I received the dispatch slip from Julie and paused at a nearby tabletop where drivers can fill out paperwork. While I checked my logbook I happened to hear Julie in conversation with someone else. She turned to one of the typically, seldom-seen dispatch managers, who walked in and stood nearby in a white shirt and tie. She asked him a question. He answered. Julie said, “I concur.” She turned to another dispatch clerk. “Do you concur?” After confirming I hadn’t fallen into a time warp and stepped onto the set of a self-righteously scripted television drama, I marveled at the two-faced nature of clerks who abuse innocent drivers one minute then portray themselves in an exaggeratedly serious way to the managers the next.",

    "target_paragraph": "In Long Tien, Vang Pao built himself a large heroin laboratory supervised by a Chinese chemist. For a few years raw opium was flown to this ‘facility’ from all over northern Laos by Air America planes and helicopters. Then, in 1967, the CIA and USAID helped the ‘General’ – financially and otherwise – to buy two C-47s and form his own private airline, Xieng Khouang Air Transport. On the Long Tien–Vientiane run, opium and heroin were the main cargoes. Air America helicopters, piloted by Americans, dropped Vang Pao’s agents – uniformed Secret Army majors and captains – at certain bans where they spent a few days collecting the local harvest before radioing for the ’copter to return and take them and their merchandise to the ‘General’s’ laboratory. In 1971 Hmong farmers received US$500 for ten kilos of raw opium. After processing, that became one kilo of No. 4 heroin worth $2,500 in Bangkok and about $23,000 in the US when sold in bulk to a dealer. Adulterated and packaged, the $500 worth of opium bought in a Lao ban was worth $225,000 on the streets of New York or San Francisco.",

Among its songs were “My One and Only” and “ ’S Wonderful.” Jimmied into it in a burst of topical exuberance was a role featuring a “Lindbergh-esque aviator.” (The 1957 film version was completely different and cut the aviator. It also preserved just four of the original songs.)",

I must have slept, and with some soundness; for there stood Edelgard, holding back the curtain that concealed me when in bed from the gaze of any curious should the caravan door happen to burst open, already fully dressed and urging me to get up. It is true that I had been dreaming I was still between Flushing and Queenboro’, so that in my sleep I was no doubt aware of the heavings of the caravan while she dressed; for a caravan gives, so to speak, to every movement of the body, and I can only hope that if any of you ever go in one the other person in the bed above you may be a motionless sleeper. Indeed, I discovered that after all it was not an advantage to occupy the lower bed. While the rain was striking the roof with the deafening noise of unlimited and large stones I heard nothing of Edelgard, though I felt every time she moved. When, however, it left oft, the creakings and crunchings of her bed and bedding (removed only a few inches from my face) every time she turned round were so alarming that disagreeable visions crossed my mind of the bed, unable longer to sustain a weight greater perhaps than what it was meant to carry, descending in toto in one of these paroxysms upon the helpless form (my own) stretched beneath. Clearly if it did I should be very much hurt, and would quite likely suffocate before assistance could be procured. These visions however, in spite of my strong impression of unclosed eyes, must ultimately and mercifully have been drowned in sleep, and my bed being very comfortable and I at the end of my forces after the previous day when I did sleep I did it soundly and I also apparently did it long; for the sun was coming through the open window accompanied by appetising smells of hot coffee when Edelgard roused me by the information that breakfast was ready, and that as everybody seemed hungry if I did not come soon I might as well not come at all.",

I have been chilly and dejected all day, shut up behind the streaming window-panes, and not liking to have a fire because of its dissipated appearance in the scorching intervals of sunshine. Once or twice my hand was on the bell and I was going to order one, when out came the sun and it was June again, and I ran joyfully into the dripping, gleaming garden, only to be driven in five minutes later by a yet fiercer squall. I wandered disconsolately round my pillar of books, looking for the one that would lend itself best to the task of entertaining me under the prevailing conditions, but they all looked gloomy, and reserved, and forbidding. So I sat down in a very big chair, and reflected that if there were to be many days like this it might be as well to ask somebody cheerful to come and sit opposite me in all those other big chairs that were looking so unusually gigantic and empty. When the Man of Wrath came in to tea there were such heavy clouds that the room was quite dark, and he peered about for a moment before he saw me. I suppose in the gloom of the big room I must have looked rather lonely, and smaller than usual buried in the capacious chair, for when he finally discovered me his face widened into an inappropriately cheerful smile.",

When the wind blew, the pastures became a massive green sea of languorous waves.

She went to Miss Ford’s School For Girls; it was a red brick residence on the corner at the top of the steep hill: he watched her join Eleanor Duncan just below. Her hair was braided in two long hanks down her back: she was demure, shy, maidenly, a timid and blushing girl; but he feared her attentions to him, for she bathed him furiously, wreaking whatever was explosive and violent beneath her placidity upon his hide. She really scrubbed him almost raw. He howled piteously. As she climbed the hill, he remembered her. He saw she was the same person.",

Every projection in each was worn down to obtuseness, partly by weather, more by friction from generations of loungers, whose toes and heels had from year to year made restless movements against these parapets, as they had stood there meditating on the aspect of affairs. In the case of the more friable bricks and stones even the flat faces were worn into hollows by the same mixed mechanism. The masonry of the top was clamped with iron at each joint; since it had been no uncommon thing for desperate men to wrench the coping off and throw it down the river, in reckless defiance of the magistrates.",

When he went on, she began to run after him. “Mink!” she said. He walked steadily on. She was at his shoulder, running, though he continued to walk. “For God’s sake,” she said. “For God’s sake.” Then she caught his shoulder and swung him to face her. This time he slashed free and sprang into the weeds, stooping, and rose with a stick lifted in his hand and walked toward her again with that patient and implacable weariness, until she turned. He lowered the stick, but he continued to stand there until he could no longer distinguish her, even against the pale dust of the road. Then he tossed the stick into the weeds and turned. The cousin was standing behind him. If the other had been smaller or he larger he would have stepped on him, walked him down. The other stepped aside and turned with him, the faint rasp of the repressed breathing at his shoulder.",

Somewhere, clouds move across a blinding sky. Where are you, princess? My heart beats in time with the forest and its oceanic pulse. Wayra is out there somewhere. I turn and then I’m walking. My hands are very still as I take the path out behind the baños. The jungle noises, the common everyday speech, quietens until all that is left is the beating of my heart. And the beating of her heart, somewhere. I step carefully over a little bridge, its rotten planks sagging at the core, and round a corner. I’m at a junction, swathes of bamboo clouding out the sky. I know where I am. If I go left, I’ll get to the monkey park, where platforms and ropes in the trees teach the monkeys how to be monkeys. If I go right, I’ll get to the enclosure where Bambi and Rudolfo, two baby deer, live. Straight over will take me to quarantine. I take a moment, listening again to my heart, and I go straight.",

No one spoke to his neighbour, there was no drunken jollity, I was like an outsider at some religious ceremony of which I couldn’t interpret the symbols. Even my driver left me to put his arm round another man’s shoulder, and I drank more beer to drown my sense of being excluded. I was drunk, I knew that, for drunken tears stood in my eyes, and I wanted to throw my beer glass on the floor and join the dancing. But I was excluded, as I had always been excluded. Tooley had joined her young friends and Miss Keene had departed to cousins in Koffiefontein, leaving her tatting on a chair under the Van de Velde. I would always be protected, as I had been when a cashier, by a hygienic plastic screen. Even the breath of the dancers didn’t reach me as they circled my table. My aunt was probably talking about things which mattered to her with General Abdul. She had greeted her adopted son in Milan more freely than she had ever greeted me. She had said good-bye to Wordsworth in Paris with blown kisses and tears in her eyes. She had a world of her own to which I would never be admitted, and I would have done better, I told myself, if I had stayed with my dahlias and the ashes of my mother who was not—if my aunt were to be believed—my real one. So I sat in the West Berlin Hotel shedding beery tears of self-pity and envying the men who danced with their arms round strangers’ shoulders. ‘Take me away,’ I said to the driver when he returned, ‘finish your beer but take me away.’",

Looking-glasses confronted me in which I could see my pinioned body and people passing; stopping, looking, and going on indifferent. The hairdresser began to move his scissors to and fro. I felt myself powerless to stop the oscillations of the cold steel. So we are cut and laid in swaths, I said; so we lie side by side on the damp meadows, withered branches and flowering. We have no more to expose ourselves on the bare hedges to the wind and snow; no more to carry ourselves erect when the gale sweeps, to bear our burden upheld; or stay, unmurmuring, on those pallid noondays when the bird creeps close to the bough and the damp whitens the leaf. We are cut, we are fallen. We are become part of that unfeeling universe that sleeps when we are at our quickest and burns red when we lie asleep. We have renounced our station and lie now flat, withered and how soon forgotten! Upon which I saw an expression in the tail of the eye of the hairdresser as if something interested him in the street.",

All they could see was a milky and sourceless flick and glare of flashlights. They could hear shouts and commands, then the guards inside the car began to shout; they were herded to their feet and toward the exit, the ankle chains clashing and clanking. They descended into a fierce hissing of steam, through ragged wisps of it blowing past the car. Laid-to alongside the train and resembling a train itself was a thick blunt motor launch to which was attached a string of skiffs and flat boats. There were more soldiers; the flashlights played on the rifle barrels and bandolier buckles and flicked and glinted on the ankle chains of the convicts as they stepped gingerly down into knee-deep water and entered the boats; now car and engine both vanished completely in steam as the crew began dumping the fire from the firebox.",

Every turn in the path brought up some exotic surprise – Skull Cave, where, according to a sign beside it, an English fur trader hid from the Indians in 1763; Fort Holmes, an old British redoubt on the highest point on the island, 325 feet above Lake Huron; and two mossy old cemeteries out in the middle of nowhere, one Catholic and one Protestant. Both seemed impossibly big for such a small island, and they consisted mostly of the same few names going back generations – the Truscotts, Gables, Sawyers. I happily wandered for three hours without seeing a soul or hearing a sound made by man, and only barely sampled the island. I could easily have stayed for days. I returned to the village by way of the Grand Hotel, quite the most splendid and obnoxiously hoity-toity such institution I have ever come across. A rambling white wooden building with the biggest porch in the world (660 feet), it is indubitably swish and expensive. A single room at the time I was there cost $135 a night. A sign in the street leading down to the hotel said GRAND HOTEL – PROPER DRESS REQUIRED AT THE HOTEL AND HOTELOWNED STREET. GENTLEMEN AFTER 6 P.M. MUST BE ATTIRED IN A COAT AND TIE. LADIES MAY NOT BE ATTIRED IN SLACKS. This is possibly the only place in the world where you are told how to dress just to walk down the street. Another sign said a charge would be levied on anyone coming in to the hotel just to gawp. Honestly. I suppose they have a lot of trouble with day trippers. I walked stealthily down the road towards the hotel, half expecting to see a sign saying ‘Anyone Passing Beyond This Point Wearing Plaid Trousers or White Shoes Will Be Arrested.’ But there wasn’t anything. I had it in my mind to put my head in the front door, just to see what life is like for really rich people, but there was a liveried doorman standing guard, so I had to beat a retreat.",

There were long, dusty roads and shops with curious window displays of plant pots and paint brushes.

The hedgerows, the fields and the little woods that I had once been so avid to leave behind for the far west and north, had come slowly to seem different to me - filled with a wildness I had not previously perceived or understood. Strange things had begun to occur in this landscape. Once, emerging from a high-hedged lane, I put up a flock of white doves from a brown field, and watched as they rose applauding into the sky. On a spring day, I had gone to Nine Wells Wood, and found numberless threads of white gossamer hanging from the leaves and twigs of the spindle trees, and drifting languidly out in the wind like prayer-lines. It was a nursery of thousands of white micro-moths, with each pupa making a single thread of silk. Those trailing silks, some of them five or six feet long, cross-hatched the path at every height, so that it was impossible to move along the wood’s narrow tracks without getting snagged and wrapped by the silk, and by the time I reached the far end of the wood I had been part-cocooned. On a sultry August evening, when the air was still and ripe with humidity, I had run up to the beechwood, passing through hedges thick with bindweed, whose snowy-white trumpets were making their anti-clockwise revolutions. Everything that evening seemed slowed by the heat, and I had the illusion that the air had assumed the consistency of water. I watched from the observatory as a crow took flight from a branch, then moved away with languorous manta-ray wing beats.",
