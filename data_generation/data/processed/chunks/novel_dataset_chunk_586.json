Eventually there was a click, and soon I heard the tap-tapping as he wound his way up the stairs.",

    "target_paragraph": "In her own room Lily turned up the gas-jet and glanced toward the grate. It was as brilliantly polished as the one below, but here at least she could burn a few papers with less risk of incurring her aunt’s disapproval. She made no immediate motion to do so, however, but dropping into a chair looked wearily about her. Her room was large and comfortably-furnished – it was the envy and admiration of poor Grace Stepney, who boarded; but, contrasted with the light tints and luxurious appointments of the guest-rooms where so many weeks of Lily’s existence were spent, it seemed as dreary as a prison. The monumental wardrobe and bedstead of black walnut had migrated from Mr Peniston’s bedroom, and the magenta ‘flock’ wallpaper, of a pattern dear to the early ’sixties, was hung with large steel engravings of an anecdotic character. Lily had tried to mitigate this charmless background by a few frivolous touches, in the shape of a lace-decked toilet table and a little painted desk surmounted by photographs; but the futility of the attempt struck her as she looked about the room. What a contrast to the subtle elegance of the setting she had pictured for herself – an apartment which should surpass the complicated luxury of her friends’ surroundings by the whole extent of that artistic sensibility which made her feel herself their superior; in which every tint and line should combine to enhance her beauty and give distinction to her leisure. Once more the haunting sense of physical ugliness was intensified by her mental depression, so that each piece of the offending furniture seemed to thrust forth its most aggressive angle.",

It is a tiny cemetery, Alps looming over a few dozen tenderly cared-for graves. The same half-dozen names appear over and over, the pictures inset on tombstones show a resemblance of features; this is an island of relatives. The first hyacinths of the season bloom on the grave of Felice Zaccheria, 1892—1976. Felice means “happy.” On the tombstone of someone named Ugo there is a picture of a young man sweet and sober in a turtleneck sweater; 1935—1972—a cutoff life. On his grave is a simple bronze sculpture over which grows wandering Jew. Sometimes one is moved to grieve for someone one does not know. Who is the real object of this cleansing grief? Is it he, Ugo? Or is the griever grieving for herself? In a cemetery on a sunny day, grief is almost indistinguishable from happiness.",

In the early morning I used to climb the high stone stairway in the midst of a swarm of women carrying pails of whitewash up from the village of Shö. It takes a hundred coolies fourteen days to give the walls their new coat of colour. That gave me plenty of time for my shots and opportunities to experiment from every possible direction so as to get the most effective pictures. I took a special pleasure in filming the workmen swinging on their ropes between heaven and earth. For the purposes of my work I was allowed to enter any room in the palace. Many of them were pitch dark with their windows blocked by piles of lumber accumulated during the centuries, through which I had to fight my way to the light. The effort was worth while. I found old, forgotten statues of the Buddha before which no butter-lamps now burned and, hidden beneath thick layers of dust, numbers of splendid thankas. The museums of the world would account themselves lucky to receive a fraction of the treasures mouldering there. In the basement of the Palace my guide showed me still another remarkable feature of this unique building. Wedges had been driven under the pillars which support the roof. The lofty building had subsided in the course of centuries, but the skilled craftsmen of Lhasa had succeeded in restoring it to its original level—a brilliant performance for a people with no modern technique. I succeeded in making a good picture of the painting of the Potala, and sent the film to India to be developed.",

For now they must come, and Lily Briscoe, trying to analyse the cause of the sudden exhilaration, compared it with that moment on the tennis lawn, when solidity suddenly vanished, and such vast spaces lay between them; and now the same effect was got by the many candles in the sparely furnished room, and the uncurtained windows, and the bright mask-like look of faces seen by candlelight. Some weight was taken off them; anything might happen, she felt. They must come now, Mrs Ramsay thought, looking at the door, and at that instant, Minta Doyle, Paul Rayley, and a maid carrying a great dish in her hands came in together. They were awfully late; they were horribly late, Minta said, as they found their way to different ends of the table.",

Though now it would because the sun was well up now and, once more smooth of face, the sidcott stinking peacefully under his arm, he could see movement about the mess, remembering suddenly that he had not eaten since lunch yesterday. But then there was the sidcott, when suddenly he realised that the sidcott would serve that too, turning and already walking. They—someone—had brought his bus back and rolled it in so he trod his long shadow toward only the petrol tin and put the sidcott into it and stood peaceful and empty while the day incremented, the infinitesimal ineluctable shortening of the shadows. It was going to rain probably, but then it always was anyway; that is, it always did on days-off from patrols, he didn’t know why yet, he was too new. ‘You will though,’ Monaghan told him. ‘Just wait till after the first time you’ve been good and scared’—pronouncing it ‘skeered’.",

Lindbergh leaned into the microphone, for it was set a little low for him, expressed pleasure at being present, said a very few words of thanks, and stepped back. A moment of eerie stillness followed as it dawned on the watching throngs, most of whom had been standing in the hot sun for hours, that they were in the presence of two of the most taciturn men in America and that this ceremony was over. But then, recovering their sense of occasion, the people burst into riotous applause and “clapped until their hands were numb.” Many wept here, too.",

I say Victorian, but that was only from the outside, where gables and a roughcast front made it look like the kind of building I knew. Indoors was very different. It was bare, as one could see at a glance because the doors stood open between rooms—no carpets, no wallpaper, very little furniture. Such chairs and sofas and tables as stood around the bare floor seemed as impersonal as lost articles in a vacant shop. Yet the house wasn't deserted. A few people were there in the rooms—a man who lounged, as if defiantly, on the unyielding curve of a sofa, four or five children scampering and giggling in whispers, an old woman in the blue blouse and trousers of a servant, and a young woman in a plain dark dress.",

As long as we hold Cayta nothing can reach us. In all our troubles no army has marched over those mountains. A revolution in the central provinces isolates us at once. Look how complete it is now! The news of Barrios’ movement will be cabled to the United States, and only in that way will it reach Sta. Marta by the cable from the other seaboard. We have the greatest riches, the greatest fertility, the purest blood in our great families, the most laborious population. The Occidental Province should stand alone. The early Federalism was not bad for us. Then came this union which Don Henrique Gould resisted. It opened the road to tyranny; and, ever since, the rest of Costaguana hangs like a millstone round our necks. The Occidental territory is large enough to make any man’s country. Look at the mountains! Nature itself seems to cry to us, ‘Separate!’”",

There was a marvellously melodramatic beauty about those cloud formations and movements, as different layers drifted among or stood poised over different peaks and ridges, the wind sometimes briskly shifting them to reveal vistas of blue and golden valleys far below – or still higher and wilder ranges in the near distance, some snowy. Again I marked the difference between Himalayan and Andean trekking. In the Himalayas one usually treks between the mountains, worshipping the unattainable. In the Andes one treks between, around and over them (as often as not over, in this area), which is wonderfully gratifying to the mountaineer manqué! Also there is here an incomparable sense of space as the smooth puna sweeps from mountain to mountain for many miles, like a great expanse of golden velvet suspended between rock peaks black or red or grey – and of every conceivable (and inconceivable) distorted shape.",

He sometimes had seizures at Cold Spring Harbor, which his colleagues overlooked or covered up even as they were condemning sufferers elsewhere.",

Next comes the bitter sea-squill, known as ‘cipollana’, from its immense onion-shaped bulb. In winter a bunch of juicy green leaves crowns the root and nothing would be easier than to extirpate it at this season. But the peasant has other things to do just then; besides, he is waiting for the flower to appear in spring. Spring comes, but no flower; on the contrary, the leaves die away and the ‘cipollana’ sinks into the earth and is forgotten. But in the heat of summer, when every other plant is withered and mankind walks as little as possible about the parched fields, detached spires of silvery blossom start in breathless haste from the ground. These are the flowers of the squill, beloved of Egyptian she-mummies as symbols of generation; the seeds are scattered broadcast in the nick of time to catch the first rain and the mischief is done. A sly plant. By the time the tell-tale leaves again sprout forth, the flowers have vanished; the peasant once more waits for the spring; and so on, ‘in saecula saeculorum’. Unscrupulous Neapolitans import cart-loads of the leafless bulbs into the city, where the plant is unknown, and hawk them about the streets as “Californian lilies.”",

Whether because of its symbolic sense, the image it presents of a life linked with the soil, and enclosing in itself the chief sources of warmth and nourishment, or whether merely because of the consolatory thought that it enables the dwellers in that harsh climate to get to their morning’s work without facing the weather, it is certain that the “L” rather than the house itself seems to be the centre, the actual hearth-stone, of the New England farm. Perhaps this connection of ideas, which had often occurred to me in my rambles about Starkfield, caused me to hear a wistful note in Frome’s words, and to see in the diminished dwelling the image of his own shrunken body.",

Paro International Airport is known as one of the most dangerous airports in the world. Its tiny airstrip is 2,200 metres above sea level and surrounded by jagged, mountainous peaks. Pilots have to manoeuvre past dozens of houses scattered across the ridges, while often battling strong winds that whip through the valley, resulting in severe turbulence. So treacherous is the airport that ‘only about twelve or thirteen pilots in the world are qualified to land here,’ confirmed our charming and ever-smiling Druk Air steward as we made our way towards the rear of the plane to disembark.",

Friends told him that for around eight thousand dollars, there were people who could get them safely through Mexico to the U.S. border. Once they reached the other side, they could ask for asylum. They sold the house, but the end of the wet foot, dry foot law early in 2017 scuttled their plans. Jorgito and Isbel saw it as a sign they were not meant to leave, at least not yet. They took some of the money from the sale of the house and bought an apartment in Villa Panamericana, near Cojímar. It was much farther from the church in Guanabacoa than the San Sebastián house, but a free bus would take them to Sunday services. And if they ever decided to try again to leave Cuba, they trusted that it would be easier to sell an apartment there than one in Guanabacoa.",

Although these lines were composed in 1777, Swinburne’s conclusion regarding the state of Calabria could have been written yesterday. Certainly, great strides have been made over the past two hundred years, particularly for the masses, and contrary to prevailing stereotypical views, the situation is, as Swinburne assessed, salvageable. Nonetheless, southerners have been subjected to the lamentations of their northern compatriots since unification, as if they themselves have done cartwheels over the historical union or are jumping for joy over their current state of affairs.",

He was thinking as he watched the rain how, after the interview between his father and his tutor – when old Harbottle had said ‘Your son has a chance’ – the old boy had insisted upon looking up the rooms that his own father had had when his father was at college. They had burst in and found a chap called Thompson on his knees blowing up the fire with a bellows.",

Kolya was of a comic-foil rotundity, almost oval, and wore a blue suit and shades. The luggage took about an hour to appear, and as we waited, Katya and Kolya and Sasha discussed our flight and the weather. Katya mentioned the heat, and Kolya said, “Yesterday was even hotter, and that was difficult for me, because I’m fat.” Finally the luggage came and we put it into Kolya’s English-made car and drove into Ulan-Ude.",

I couldn’t afford it, since I was still paying for that big house in the suburbs which nobody was living in anymore and which my husband was forbidding me to sell, and I was still trying to stay on top of all my legal and counseling fees…but it was vital to my survival to have a One Bedroom of my own. I saw the apartment almost as a sanatorium, a hospice clinic for my own recovery. I painted the walls in the warmest colors I could find and bought myself flowers every week, as if I were visiting myself in the hospital. My sister gave me a hot water bottle as a housewarming gift (so I wouldn’t have to be all alone in a cold bed) and I slept with the thing laid against my heart every night, as though nursing a sports injury.",

Bare-headed he set off for the town. He knew that he was drunk and that he staggered; but he believed that with care and control he could hide his state from any one who saw him. He straddled the line that ran down the middle of the concrete sidewalk, keeping his eyes fixed on it and coming back to it quickly when he lurched away from it. When he got into the town the streets were thronged with late shoppers. An air of completion was on everything. The people were streaming home to Christmas. He plunged down from the Square into the narrow avenue, going in among the staring passers-by. He kept his eye hotly on the line before him. He did not know where to go. He did not know what to buy.",
