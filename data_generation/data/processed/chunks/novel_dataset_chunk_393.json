Now, among the trees, it was the thrush trilling out into the warm air a flutter of jubilation, but fear seemed to spur him, Fanny thought; as if he too were anxious with such joy at his heart—as if he were watched as he sang, and pressed by tumult to sing. There! Restless, he flew to the next tree. She heard his song more faintly. Beyond it was the humming of the wheels and the wind rushing.",

In the train Julia had moaned a little at the mosquitoes of the previous night, and at the heat and dirt of the second-class compartment; then, always conscious of the ill-breeding of fretfulness, she had bent her lovely head above her Tauchnitz. And it was then that Campton, looking out of the window to avoid her fatally familiar profile, had suddenly discovered another. It was that of a peasant girl in front of a small whitewashed house, under a white pergola hung with bunches of big red peppers. The house, which was close to the railway, was propped against an orange-coloured rock, and in the glare cast up from the red earth its walls looked as blue as snow in shadow. The girl was all blue-white too, from her cotton skirt to the kerchief knotted turbanwise above two folds of blue-black hair. Her round forehead and merry nose were relieved like a bronze medallion against the wall; and she stood with her hands on her hips, laughing at a little pig asleep under a cork-tree, who lay on his side like a dog.",

It died for drowsiness.\nIn the extreme immobility and stillness of the three the still house stirred and became audible to them, as if it breathed. They heard the delicate fall of the ashes on the hearth, and the flame of the lamp jerking as the oil sputtered in the burnt wick. Their nerves shook to the creeping, crackling sounds that came from the wainscot, infinitely minute. A tongue of fire shot hissing from the coal. It seemed to them a violent and terrifying thing. The breath of the house passed over them in thick smells of earth and must, as the fire's heat sucked at its damp.\nThe church clock struck the half hour. Once, twice; two dolorous notes that beat on the still house and died.\nSomewhere out at the back a door opened and shut, and it was as if the house drew in its breath at the shock of the sound.\nPresently a tremor crept through Gwenda's young body as her heart shook it.\nShe rose and went to the window.",

The history lesson she gave me, about the arrival of Christianity in Buganda, recalled Paisleyite history lessons about the role of the Vatican in world affairs. Having made all allowances for the Zeitgeist, it is hard to forgive Christianity’s contribution to Ugandan faction-fighting. The pioneering British and French missionaries (manipulated by their respective governments when that suited the politicians, ignored by them when it didn’t) poured the petrol of White sectarianism on to an area already smouldering with tribal animosities. Then the politicians found it expedient to strike a match and a century later the embers are still warm.",

The mine had got hold of Charles Gould with a grip as deadly as ever it had laid upon his father. But this extreme resolution had seemed to Don Pépé the most natural thing in the world. His measures had been taken with judgment. Everything was prepared with a careful completeness. And Don Pépé folded his hands pacifically on his sword hilt, and nodded at the priest. In his excitement, Father Roman had flung snuff in handfuls at his face, and, all besmeared with tobacco, round-eyed, and beside himself, had got out of the hammock to walk about, uttering exclamations.",

Every night, the dolphins came a-squeaking, torpedoing past Varuna like comets of light. I spent many an hour reading for fifteen minutes, then dashing out into the cockpit to pinpoint the feeble glow of Akka’s lanterns in the distance. As a rule I kept Varuna as upwind as possible so that once the distance between us grew too much, I could speedily bear back down on her. Although there were the obvious disadvantages of lost speed and an additional burden of fatigue, the advantage of occasional contact with Olivier was well worth it to me, although we did feel quite ridiculous to be separately carrying on with life on two boats when we’d much rather be together on one.",

In fact, nobody really knows what happened there that day in June 1876 because the Indians gave such conflicting accounts and none of the white participants lived to tell the tale.

He is present in the perforation on bench-backs, in the stretchers of the tables, and in the wood and plaster coffering overhead; the tiered tops, the hinges and handles of the stone tankards, the coiling lead that honeycombs the circular windowpanes together, the tiles of the stoves looted from the Spanish Netherlands, the very lids of the painted china pipe-bowls – all are his.

It was a plain vanilla board, stiff but versatile, a good wave-catcher, stable and fast. I had an old custom-made wetsuit, now fraying and leaky, a relic from my prosperous brakeman days. I found a few sandbars that produced fine peaks, for a few days at least, on certain tides and swell angles, before the sand moved on. I was getting to know the board. It was well suited to the big open faces, knifing through the offshores, responsive at speed. But it was difficult to duck-dive—it was thick, and therefore hard to sink deep enough to escape incoming whitewater. Paddling out at Ocean Beach was nearly always an ordeal—yet another reason so few people surfed it—and my board’s extra volume did not make it easier. I tried to keep my go-outs short. I worked better after surfing, though. The icy water, the exertion, then thawing under a hot shower, left me physically quiet, able to sit without fidgeting at my desk. I slept better too. This was before the first big winter swells.",

The time moved by in spasmodic jumps like a school clock. David was glad of her absorption at the studio. It made them less inclined to use up their leisure on parties. Alabama’s leisure was a creaky muscle-sore affair and better spent at home. David could work more freely when she was occupied and making fewer demands on his time.",

I drain most of the foul water off on the kite and let the clean water drain from the tube into the Tupperware box. It’s a gigantic success. I collect two and a half pints of water, still a bit tainted, but drinkable. If my last solar still blows completely, I’m not necessarily done for. I envision the dorado struggling for life on the end of my spear, twisting this way and that, this way and that.

    "target_paragraph": "The Old Kent Road* was very crowded on Thursday, the eleventh of October 1928. People spilt off the pavement. There were women with shopping bags. Children ran out. There were sales at drapers’ shops. Streets widened and narrowed. Long vistas steadily shrunk together. Here was a market. Here a funeral. Here a procession with banners upon which was written ‘Ra—Un’,* but what else? Meat was very red. Butchers stood at the door. Women almost had their heels sliced off. Amor Vin*—that was over a porch. A woman looked out of a bedroom window, profoundly contemplative, and very still. Applejohn and Applebed, Undert—. Nothing could be seen whole or read from start to finish. What was seen begun—like two friends starting to meet each other across the street—was never seen ended. After twenty minutes the body and mind were like scraps of torn paper tumbling from a sack and, indeed, the process of motoring fast out of London so much resembles the chopping up small of identity which precedes unconsciousness and perhaps death itself that it is an open question in what sense Orlando can be said to have existed at the present moment. Indeed we should have given her over for a person entirely disassembled were it not that here, at last, one green screen was held out on the right, against which the little bits of paper fell more slowly; and then another was held out on the left so that one could see the separate scraps now turning over by themselves in the air; and then green screens were held continuously on either side, so that her mind regained the illusion of holding things within itself and she saw a cottage, a farmyard and four cows, all precisely life-size.",

One afternoon in June I squatted there for an hour – two hours? three? – filling my canteen. No other water within miles, the local gnat population fought me for every drop. To keep them out of the canteen I had to place a handkerchief over the opening as I filled it. Then they attacked my eyes, drawn irresistibly by the liquid shine of the human eyeball.

    "target_paragraph": "Rachel was too far gone to get out of her wet clothes. Somehow I unzipped a Diana-bag and helped her to change. Meanwhile several kids – human and animal, the latter in the arms of the former – had collected to stare. And our host was sitting on sheep-skins in the opposite corner, still saying nothing but looking kind. By now it was dark, intensely cold and steadily sleeting; the edge of the grass carpet merged into a morass of mud. While Rachel held the torch I slowly and painfully stripped to the skin, an astonishingly difficult task when every garment is sodden and one’s hands are numb. Rachel – now thawing – had to undo my bootlaces and pull off my boots. At last I stood naked but for my briefs in the searing cold; yet once free of wet clothes I began to feel warmer. (Inhibitions about naked breasts are unnecessary hereabouts: and even if they were necessary I wouldn’t have had them this evening.) Wife then called the family to supper and a few moments later husband returned with a heaped plate of boiled potatoes and two plates of watery soup. We fell on the hot food and I was aware of eating like an animal – devouring potatoes in their earthy jackets – yet the last few mouthfuls of soup were cold. I cannot recall ever, anywhere, feeling so frantic a need for food. By half-thawing me the meal made it easier to dress and I had just pulled on my Husky bootees when the family, having finished supper, assembled in the drawing-room, as it were. I wonder why? Although fuel is so scarce here, the kitchen must be warmer than the verandah. Elsewhere one might deduce curiosity, but not among the campesinos. Nobody tried to speak to us, or took any interest in our possessions. Also, why not add an outer stone wall to this verandah, thus making it into a small room? All building materials could be collected nearby. And why don’t the family sleep in the inner room instead of in the open air at 12,500 feet (approx.) with blizzards blowing in their faces? Again, why were we not invited into the warm kitchen on arrival? Was there simply no room for us? Or is there some ancient taboo against this?",

I noticed Jill first, a Western-dressed, copper-skinned woman in her thirties: tall, well-built, handsome, with an oval face, Nilotic features and great poise. She was reclining in a low chair by the doorway, drinking beer and smoking. This was sensational; most respectable Ugandan women don’t publicly drink alcohol (at least in rural areas) and even Ugandan prostitutes don’t smoke. Jill greeted me warmly in perfect English and I sat on a high stool beside her. As we talked she puzzled me increasingly; her sophisticated conversation and air of natural authority didn’t match her humble job in the local post office. I scented a mystery and was curious. But, although she and I spent much time together over the next few days, my curiosity was only satisfied, by an odd little coincidence, after I had left Bushenyi.",

They were a sect of Unitarians which had sprung up in this part of the world and were named after a Sienese family of theologians, the Sozzini; they took their name, in these particular regions, from one Fausto Sossini, an adventurous nephew of the founder, who wandered to Transylvania from the court of Isabella dei Medici and settled at Kolozsvár in 1578, where his doctrines sank deep heterodox roots.

The door was apparently designed to attract people from both intersecting streets, although the store has no competition for a ten-mile sweep in all directions. When I first stopped in there, I noticed on its shelves the usual run of cold cuts, canned foods, soft drinks, crackers, cookies, cereals, and sardines, and also Remington twelve-gauge shotgun shells, Slipknot friction tape, Varsity gasket cement, Railroad Mills sweet snuff, and StateWide well restorer. Wrapping string unwound from a spool on a wall shelf and ran through eyelets across the ceiling and down to a wooden counter. A glass counter top next to the wooden one had been rubbed cloudy by hundreds of thousands of coins and pop bottles, and in the case beneath it were twenty-two rectangular glass dishes, each holding a different kind of penny candy. Beside the candy case was a radiator covered with an oak plank. Chatsworth loafers sat there. There were no particular loafers. Almost everyone who came into the store spent a little time on the oak plank. There were three Esso pumps on the sidewalk outside. Esso had been sold there since 1921. Just inside the door, a red kerosene pump was set in the floor. I was told that as many as four hundred gallons of kerosene had been sold through it in a week. Kerosene is widely used in the pines, both for heat and for light.",

A very slight relaxing of her face, beginning with the widening of her eyes, the colour lightening ever so slightly to a soft shade of gold. It’s the sign I’ve come to recognise. The sign that it’s OK. I let out a breath and move my arm closer. She starts to lick, and the sound of her tongue against my skin is the most beautiful sound in the world. I am light-headed, blinking back tears, leaning forwards to touch my face to her neck. Relief squashes my ribs, then expands. The pull of her tongue is sharp and painful and wonderful. She smells of soil and a velvety wind, when it blows the branches of a tree at the lagoon. She’s leaning closer, pressing against me with disbelief and joy. I can feel the fast pounding of her heart. My heart. Our chests touch, our bones, our breath. When I scratch the fluffy white patch behind her ear, she pushes her cheekbone into my hand and looks silently up into my face. Her nose is pushed against my palm, cold and wet. She’s got her front paws on my boot, pulling me closer, and her head is cocked to one side.",

Near the Waliahad hundreds of flat-roofed stone and mud hovels cover the steep hillsides and between them run narrow alleyways or flights of steps. Purdah is strictly observed in Swat and because I looked male to local eyes our progress was marked by the scurrying indoors of numerous veiled figures, some of whom abandoned heavy water-jars in their flight. Even little giggling girls of eight or nine completely covered their faces while peeping at us around corners.",

But I’d lost it, perhaps while fiddling with shekel notes at the checkout. This almost qualified as a crisis. I hadn’t memorised the hotel’s name and if you don’t know where you are going you can’t ask the way or identify an appropriate bus or hire a taxi. ‘The beach’ was too vague: Ashkelon’s built-up seafront extends for miles. Now I urgently needed an English-speaker but in this rather run-down district all was Cyrillic – shop signs and advertisements, magazines and newspapers, even the bus-stop legends. Immigrant Russians are much criticised for ‘not bothering’ and obviously the ghettoised elders don’t need to make an effort. Of course their offspring must learn Hebrew, yet one of the three buses I took was packed with high-spirited schoolchildren all talking Russian on their way home for their Sabbath supper, a family gathering important to most Israelis, secular though they may otherwise be. On that crowded bus, two small boys stood up simultaneously to offer me their seats.",

We turned to the left, and after a few steps met a uniformed army officer in greatcoat and cap who wordlessly pointed us back the opposite way. Why they hadn’t simply used a sign pointing the exit to the right to begin with, thus obviating the need for the soldier, I could not grasp. We came down some stairs into a hall leading to Passport Control. On the floor at the foot of the stairs was a large, vividly red spill of liquid—possibly raspberry syrup, possibly transmission fluid. I tried without success to pick up its smell. Instead I was hit by the smell of Russia, one I’ve encountered often since, all over that country. The components of the smell are still a mystery. There’s a lot of diesel fuel in it, and cucumber peels, and old tea bags, and sour milk, and a sweetness—currant jam, or mulberries crushed into the waffle treads of heavy boots—and fresh wet mud, and a lot of wet cement. Every once in a while, in just the right damp basement in America, I find a cousin of the Russia-smell unexpectedly there.",
