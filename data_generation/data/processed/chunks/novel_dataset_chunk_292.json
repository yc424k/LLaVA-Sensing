Maybe the nigger was watching them through the front window. Anyway Ab tracked it right across the front porch and knocked and when the nigger told him to wipe it offen his feet, Ab shoved right past the nigger and the nigger said he wiped the rest of it off right on that ere hundred-dollar rug and stood there hollering ‘Hello. Hello, De Spain’ until Miz de Spain come and looked at the rug and at Ab and told him to please go away. And then De Spain come home at dinner time and I reckon maybe Miz de Spain got in behind him because about middle of the afternoon he rides up to Ab’s house with a nigger holding the rolled-up rug on a mule behind him and Ab setting in a chair against the door jamb and De Spain hollers ‘Why in hell aint you in the field?’ and Ab says, he dont get up or nothing, ‘I figger I’ll start tomorrow. I dont never move and start to work the same day’, only that aint neither here nor there; I reckon Miz de Spain had done got in behind him good because he just set on the horse a while saying ‘Confound you Snopes, confound you Snopes’ and Ab setting there saying ‘If I had thought that much of a rug I dont know as I would keep it where folks coming in would have to tromp on it.’ ” Still he was not laughing. He just sat there in the buckboard, easy and relaxed, with his shrewd intelligent eyes in his smooth brown face, well-shaved and clean in his perfectly clean faded shirt, his voice pleasant and drawling and anecdotal, while Varner’s suffused swollen face glared down at him.",

There was nothing to do except sit at the bar and watch the scenery float past, and as it was a free bar and the barman had a neat line in cocktails, this was very agreeable. He shook his cocktails with panache. His speciality was a kind of Chilean cuba libre; I quickly forgot the name, but it had the word Patagonia in it. The Argentinians sat down at tables in the dining area and the men produced enough photographic equipment to open a Dixons concession on board while the women read Good Housekeeping. The barman told me his name was Norman. He was wearing a white polyester shirt, and he looked remarkably like Douglas Hurd, even sporting the ice-cream cone quiff. The cocktails got stronger as we approached the glaciers, and in the lagoon itself, almost landlocked and one of only three places in the world where three plates meet, strangely sculpted blue icebergs appeared, and Norman added more ice to the cocktail jug in appreciation. The icebergs were as small as manhole covers and as big and pointy as the Matterhorn. The glacier San Rafael, the famous glacier, looked like a rough blue tide between the brown and green jagged mountains. It stretches over twenty miles back into the interior, is more than one-and-a-half miles wide, and it moves up to 200 feet a day. I had developed a passion for these glaciers. I believe Darwin did, too, in his understated, English way: ‘... they may be likened to great frozen Niagaras; and perhaps these cataracts of blue ice are to the full as beautiful as the moving ones of water.’",

Afterwards, the dead on both sides were reckoned in hundreds by the government; by their opponents, in thousands. After retreating from street-barriers, the Social Democrats, some of whom were in uniform, had taken up defensive positions in a block of workers’ flats in Heiligenstadt, the Neunzehnte Bezirk. Their chief defensive position was the Karl-Marx-Hof, a massive building over half a mile long; and the noise I had mistaken for thunder was the sound, muted by distance, of a battle settling down into a siege. The besiegers, unable to make a frontal attack across an open space under machine-gun fire from the besieged building, had brought up mortars, howitzers and field guns; but they were firing solid shot, as opposed to the normal and much more destructive high-explosive shells. The command of the besieging troops and the Heimwehr were much blamed afterwards for using artillery. By cutting off water and supplies, it was held, the besieged could finally have been induced to surrender with many less casualties. Before the surrender, the Social Democrat leaders fled to Czechoslovakia; and Vienna, except for bitterness and recrimination, returned, more or less, to normal. Or rather, to a resumption of the briefly interrupted Nazi subversion.",

I didn’t want to have to move the troublesome dolly yet again so I disconnected the empty front trailer and retrieved the loaded trailer from a dock door. In order to connect the front trailer I then had to back the trailer hitch precisely up to the tip of the dolly. Since the dolly was still connected to the back trailer, the dolly couldn’t be moved or adjusted, unless I could pick up the thousands of pounds of empty trailer manually. Therefore, if the tip of the dolly reached too high or too low to attach to the hitch of the front trailer, I would have to disconnect the dolly from the back trailer anyway, or essentially, start from scratch. Back and forth I worked the front trailer until everything lined up just so. Fortunately, the dolly’s looped tip wound up at about the right height to the hitch, and after some struggle the components fit securely into place.",

I wandered back inside the airport and found a smoky room with a row of plastic red phones stacked atop a counter. Transactions appeared to go through a sour-faced woman seated behind a desk, so I got in line behind three burly men with olive skin and five o’clock shadows.

On the street in New York one day I saw my first actual from-Russia Russian. My then landlord, a Romanian named Zvi, pointed him out to me. This Russian was stocky, broad, with big hands and wide fingers. He wore a light gray shirt, open at the neck. His pallid, unshaven face was almost the same colorless color as his eyes, and his thick, straight gray hair was combed up off his forehead. I nodded to him, and he nodded back. I considered this a very satisfactory first sighting. My landlord said that this man had been allowed to leave the Soviet Union because of the diplomacy of the great President Jimmy Carter and added with admiration that already the man had become a much-feared landlord himself in Brooklyn.",

Phu-Tsering gives me warm chapatis, and hot water for a wash in the cold sun. He is wearing his amulets outside his shirt, but tucks them away, embarrassed, when I ask about them; they were given him by his lama, he murmurs, feeling much better when I show him that I, too, wear an “amulet,” a talisman given to me by the Zen master Soen Roshi, “my lama in Japan.” He admires this smooth plum pit on which a whole ten-phrase sutra is inscribed in minute characters, and is awed when I tell him that the sutra honors the most revered of all those mythical embodiments of Buddhahood called Bodhisattvas, the one known to Phu-Tsering as “Chen-resigs” (literally, sPyan ras gzigs), who is the Divine Protector of Tibet and is invoked by OM MANI PADME HUM. In the Japanese sutra inscribed upon this plum pit, this Bodhisattva is Kanzeon, or Kannon (in China, Kuan Yin; in southeast Asia, Quon Am). To Hindus He is Padmapani, and in Sanskrit, He is Avalokita Ishvara, the Lord Who Looks Down (in compassion). Like all Bodhisattvas, Avalokita represents “the divine within” sought by mystics of all faiths, and has been called the Lord Who Is Seen Within.7",

He came across the remains of a campfire and what looked like a big rock next to it turned out to be the sun-bleached shell of a loggerhead turtle. Possession of one of those shells in the States was a criminal offense, but here it was a matter of survival.",

In one place heavy, white vapour blew off in powerful jets from the edge of the lake, and elsewhere there were frequent jets arid ebullitions of the same, but there was not a trace of vapour over the burning lake itself. The crusted large area, with its blowing cones, blotches and rifts of fire, was nearly all visible, and from the thickness and quietness of the crust it was obvious that the ocean of lava below was comparatively at rest, but a dark precipice concealed a part of the glowing and highly agitated lake, adding another mystery to its sublimity.",

Gee, I’d forgotten about them,” she said, drawing her stockings over her straightening legs. She sprang to her feet. “We’ll soon be out, though. David, stop looking at me that way. Look like you were having a good time, at least. Cheer up, David. A man would think you were losing your nerve already. Buck up: I think it’s grand, running off like this. Don’t you think it’s grand?” She turned her head and saw again that diffident still gesture of his hand touching her dress.

(Incredibly, his first draft of the article seems to have skipped over the details of the 1911 discovery; Bingham added them only after Grosvenor gently pointed out that “our readers will want to know how you found it.”) The photographs, however?250 in all?were astonishing. Bingham managed to capture the vastness of the Andes and the precision of Inca masonry; his black-and-white images of the new mule road through the Urubamba Valley have the spellbinding etched-mirror allure of Ansel Adams’s work. The before-and-after pictures of the ruins as they were transformed from an overgrown ghost town to the mystical city known today make clear, in a way that Bingham’s stiff prose never managed to, how it was possible for such a set of buildings to simply disappear into the jungle.",

Now it was almost sunset; he thought This will have to be at least a half a dollar. I got to have it. I got to get on.

Once this thing gets going the place warms up fast, in a dense unhealthy way, with a layer of heat under the ceiling where my head is and nothing but frigid air from the knees down. But we’ve got all the indispensable conveniences: gas cookstove, gas refrigerator, hot water heater, sink with running water (if the pipes aren’t frozen), storage cabinets and shelves, everything within arm’s reach of everything else. The gas comes from two steel bottles in a shed outside; the water comes by gravity flow from a tank buried in a hill close by. Quite luxurious for the wilds. There’s even a shower stall and a flush toilet with a dead rat in the bowl. Pretty soft. My poor mother raised five children without any of these luxuries and might be doing without them yet if it hadn’t been for Hitler, war and general prosperity.",

The carriers were aware of the moon with an intimacy from which we were excluded. At Galaye it was already moving in their blood, so that even Amedoo burst into the circle and danced with a sudden wild lapse from dignity. But the most grotesque of the dancers was a moron dwarf. They dropped him into the ring with a couple of piccaninnies of three years old who were as tall as he, and he swayed a great inflated head, like a blister a pin would burst, to the beat of the rattle, and then howled and wept to be released.",

And the light was bad; flat and diffuse, it provided no shadows to alert them to hummocks or snowdrifts, so that they tripped and fell frequently. Also, winds had drifted snow in places two to three feet deep, and they sank up their thighs as they broke trail, each hard-earned step exhausting them. Bartlett decided that lighter loads would allow them to move faster and help ensure that the sleds did not break, but this meant more relaying of loads, which doubled or even tripled the distance a person had to travel, depending on how many shifts one took.",

    "target_paragraph": "Many of these stone trails indicate peat paths (leading to and from the worked peat-banks), crofting paths, and particularly shieling paths (leading from townships to the areas of the moor where each family kept its shieling, the stone-built shelter which would be used as a home during the summer grazing months). The journey to the shieling would be made by different family members at different times, and a key coming-of-age moment for a child was when he or she made the journey to the shieling alone. But bad weather could make navigation out there difficult, and the moor itself held the perils of bog and deep water. So it was that these routes became cairned onto the moor as guide-lines, designed to avoid boglach (general boggy areas), blàr (flat areas of the moor that can be very boggy) or, most dangerously, breunlach (sucking bog disguised by the alluringly bright green grass that covers it), and lead the walker safely to tulach na h-àirigh – the site of the shieling. Hansel and Gretel again: the stones that will guide you safely home. Instructions would accompany the departure for the path, a manual for use, stories for safe navigation: Trust to the stones, keep them in sight, don’t be tempted to walk lower down where the ground seems greener and flatter, for there it is also boggy and treacherous. These practices have their parallels elsewhere in the country: in the line of white marker stones that used to run across Bodmin Moor from Watergate to Five Lanes, for instance, set there in the mid-1800s by a parson who wished to be able to traverse his trackless and often fog-bound parish without getting lost or enmired.",

The eastern sky brightens ever so slightly, promising the warmth of the sun, which hides just over the horizon. I dream of the warmth the sun will bring, but sunrise is a long slow process. An hour later it is still not up, but the sky is colored magenta and orange, and the clouds are outlined in vibrant yellow. Further west the sky is grey and black, but accented in purple.\n​I turn to 190 degrees and see Scripts Lighted Buoy on the chart, but I can’t see the buoy on the ocean. Windflower aims at the Diamond Shoals Lighted Buoy 12. I check my phone, and Navionics thinks I am at the York River Yacht Haven, which is disappointing and almost makes me angry.\n​Finally, the sun breaks free of the horizon and rises quickly, a giant ball of light and heat, too bright to look at. I can feel its warm rays on the skin of my face, the only skin I have exposed. But as soon as it is up, the sun hides behind a cloud and the warmth it brought is taken back.\n​At 6:36am, we are 7nm east of Rodanthe, NC. My stomach is now acclimated to sailing and I’ve the hunger of one who hasn’t eaten enough, so I make coffee and an omelet. While standing in the galley, the portlights are at eye level and I look outside while cooking. Suddenly a big ship nearly fills the view, passing to port going the other way. I quickly climb to the cockpit and check the AIS to find out why the alarm didn’t go off.\n​The instrument identifies Zin Vancouver as the ship, which is 4.5nm away, much further than it looks. It’s so hard to judge distance on the ocean, especially with big ships. Their size is so out of proportion to any other vessels that it is nearly impossible to tell how far away they are, or how fast they are moving, and when these ships are close, their size defies logic.\n​After breakfast, with the sun shining bright, I change out of the big orange suit, which has become slightly damp with perspiration. It feels positively liberating to get into more normal clothes. The suit is plenty warm, but it is also the biggest and bulkiest thing I have ever worn.\n​White birds sit in the water spaced far apart, covering a large area. This seems odd so far offshore, but what do I know about the ways of seabirds? When we get closer, I can tell they are northern gannets, sleek and bright white with long necks and black on the underside of their wingtips. They sit way out here as comfortably as someone might sit on their couch watching the television while a fire burns in the fireplace. Family is all around them, and the sun warms their white feathers. The birds that we sail close to take flight, while others remain unbothered by our presence.\n​I’ve seen northern gannets while surfing in Florida. They hunt like pelicans, but dive from higher up and further from the beach. The gannets fold back their wings and drop like missiles into the water. They can even swim further down if they need to in order to reach their prey, using their wings in the water much like they do in the air.\n​We sail very slowly in the early morning, peacefully and quietly. I thoroughly enjoy the sensation of my home slowly moving across the Atlantic Ocean as if she is meant to be here, and she is, but my patience comes to an end when the sails start slatting. I take them down and start the engine.\n​The breeze is only 6 knots, from behind. We motor at 6.5 knots at 187 degrees, I can see low clouds over the Gulf Stream to the east and I think of the warm water that must be causing the clouds to form above.\n​We’ve been sailing 24 hours now and I check the Garmin InReach, which tells me we have covered 130 miles.\n​At 9:11am, we are 10nm east of Avon, NC, and it is all of 52 degrees inside, which is positively warm compared to yesterday. I’m thankful for every one of these degrees, and that the clouds are clearing out and allowing more sun to spill through.\n​The wind is still less than 10 knots from behind. I see something brown in the water ahead and I swerve to starboard to avoid it. It dives when we get close, probably a sea turtle.\n​At 10:00am, I cut off the engine and we are sailing again, downwind with the main only. I can make out something on the horizon, a tower perhaps, at Diamond Shoals, 10nm ahead. The sun has made more progress in its war with the clouds, and the color of the water is changing from dark grey to dark blue. My mood follows suit and I feel a small sense of joy beating down the grimace of cold and grey.\n​At 11:00am, I make lunch courtesy of the Farmer’s Daughter: a bagel with jalapeno jelly, jalapeno cheese, diced fresh jalapenos, olives, and carrots. The chocolate pound cake is still making its rounds, and is as good as ever. I eat it with reckless abandon now. Apparently, I’ve been burning a lot of calories, and my body demands nourishment.\n​At 11:52am, we are sailing against a 2-knot current, as indicated by the difference between speed over ground and boat speed. We are 2nm from Diamond Shoals, and only making 3 knots. I start the engine again.\n​The tower comes into view and it looks like a mini oil rig, like a steel house on long and rusting steel legs, perched high above the blue water. As we get closer I can see the remnants of an old steel spiral staircase running up one of the legs. Only one section of the stairs remains. There is a lower level consisting of a catwalk around the outside, then a flat building on the main level, and a tower in one corner with a light on top. Two letters, “ON” remain on the side while others have obviously fallen into the ocean. It appears that the light has not been on for years.\n​At 12:45pm, I shut off the engine, turn into the wind, and round the shoal. On the other side of the lighthouse are the letters “A” and “N.” I take more pictures as it all fades into the background. I have now sailed around Cape Hatteras, and a feeling of accomplishment runs through me like a warm shiver.",

Sometimes she passed down avenues of sedate mansions, soberly numbered ‘one’, ‘two’, ‘three’, and so on right up to two or three hundred, each the copy of the other, with two pillars and six steps and a pair of curtains neatly drawn and family luncheons laid on tables, and a parrot looking out of one window and a man servant out of another, until her mind was dizzied with the monotony. Then she came to great open squares with black shiny, tightly buttoned statues of fat men in the middle, and war horses prancing, and columns rising and fountains falling and pigeons fluttering. So she walked and walked along pavements between houses until she felt very hungry, and something fluttering above her heart rebuked her with having forgotten all about it. It was her manuscript, ‘The Oak Tree’.",

Which was what Ratliff would have called tit for tat, since what Victorians would have called the claret from my nose had already stained the shoulder of her dress. So I could free one hand long enough to reach around and over her other shoulder to the handkerchief in my breast pocket and do a little emergency work with it until I could separate us long enough to reach the cold water tap.",

When they had gone she took courage to bathe her hot face in one of the marble basins, and to straighten her own hat-brim, which the parasols of the crowd had indented. The dresses in the shops had so impressed her that she scarcely dared look at her reflection; but when she did so, the glow of her race under her cherry-coloured hat, and the curve of her young shoulders through the transparent muslin, restored her courage; and when she had taken the blue brooch from its box and pinned it on her bosom she walked toward the restaurant with her head high, as if she had always strolled through tessellated halls beside young men in flannels.",

Ratliff would probably have objected, but nobody suggested it; they ate cold the tasteless food, too tired to taste it; removing only their shoes stained with the dampening earth from the deepening pits, they lay among the quilts and slept fitfully, too tired to sleep completely also, dreaming of gold. Toward noon jagged scraps and flecks of sun came through the broken roof and the two rotted floors overhead and crept eastward across the floor and the tumbled quilts and then the prone bodies and the slack-mouthed up-flung faces, whereupon they turned and shifted or covered their heads and faces with their arms, as though, still sleeping, they fled the weightless shadow of that for which, awake, they had betrayed themselves. They were awake at sunset without having rested. They moved stiffly about, not talking, while the coffee-pot boiled on the broken hearth; they ate again, wolfing the cold and tasteless food while the crimson glow from the dying west faded in the high ruined room. Armstid was the first one to finish. He put his cup down and rose, turning first onto his hands and knees as an infant gets up, dragging his stiff twice-broken leg painfully beneath him, and limped toward the door. “We ought to wait till full dark,” Ratliff said, to no one; certainly no one answered him. It was as if he spoke to himself and had answered himself. He rose too. Bookwright was already standing. When they reached the garden, Armstid was already in his pit, digging.",

Is it the storm-wild flight of furious days, the storm-swift passing of the million faces, all lost, forgotten, vanished as a dream? Is it the wind that howls above the earth, is it the wind that drives all things before its lash, is it the wind that drives all men like dead ghosts fleeing? Is it the one red leaf that strains there on the bough and that for ever will be fleeing? All things are lost and broken in the wind; the dry leaves scamper down the path before us, in their swift-winged dance of death the dead souls flee along before us driven with rusty scuffle before the fury of the demented wind. And October has come again, has come again.",

All their heads turn simultaneously at the corner by the laurel bushes. Now they are boasting. Larpent’s brother played football for Oxford; Smith’s father made a century at Lord’s. Archie and Hugh; Parker and Dalton; Larpent and Smith; then again Archie and Hugh; Parker and Dalton; Larpent and Smith—the names repeat themselves; the names are the same always. They are the volunteers; they are the cricketers; they are the officers of the Natural History Society. They are always forming into fours and marching in troops with badges on their caps; they salute simultaneously passing the figure of their general. How majestic is their order, how beautiful is their obedience! If I could follow, if I could be with them, I would sacrifice all I know. But they also leave butterflies trembling with their wings pinched off; they throw dirty pocket-handkerchiefs clotted with blood screwed up into corners. They make little boys sob in dark passages. They have big red ears that stand out under their caps. Yet that is what we wish to be, Neville and I. I watch them go with envy. Peeping from behind a curtain, I note the simultaneity of their movements with delight. If my legs were reinforced by theirs, how they would run! If I had been with them and won matches and rowed in great races, and galloped all day, how I should thunder out songs at midnight! In what a torrent the words would rush from my throat!’",

But why was Tokes not arrested early on the morning of 15 December, in accordance with the Court order, before his defenders gathered? And why did he encourage his congregation, on 10 December, to rally around him on the fifteenth? Was this not an imprudent – even irresponsible – gesture? Had he been forcibly evicted or arrested on that date, some of the original small group of parishioners would undoubtedly have confronted the Securitate and been dealt with ruthlessly – leaving Rumania’s status quo unchanged. Was he acting independently, intuiting that, given the public mood of desperation, a major uprising could be provoked by his resolute defiance of the authorities? Or was he acting in collusion with people who had decided to take advantage of the burning fuse? Already he had caused an unprecedented amount of media attention to be focused from outside on Timisoara; thus it was an ideal location for the eruption of what could be made to seem like yet another Eastern European ‘People’s Power’ victory.",

The hills were scored with dried-out water trenches and littered with piles of rubble from gold rush mining operations. “Watch your step if you get out of the truck,” Robert said. “There are hundred-foot-deep shafts all through here.” Herds of shaggy wild musk oxen, with enormous horns, stood along the roadside. On the top of Anvil Mountain stood four enormous white antennas, each like a weathered drive-in movie screen, Cold War remnants of the Distant Early Warning System pointed at the Soviet Union.",
