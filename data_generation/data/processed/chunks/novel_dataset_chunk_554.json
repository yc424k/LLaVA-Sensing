Besides the old bed of the river, there is also the cutting of a great canal, the Dujeil of the era of the khalifs, which has long been devoid of water except in its upper reaches.[105] Each of these dry channels is set thickly with the ruins of towns and villages belonging to Mohammadan as well as to earlier times. The northern reaches of the Dujeil still bring water from the Tigris, and here villages and cultivation continue to exist; but the canal is much smaller than it was originally, and it no longer rejoins the Tigris at the lower end of its course.",

Afterwards I wandered upstairs, meeting some of the first ladies of Sulaco, paler than I had ever seen them before, with bandages over their arms. Not all of them had fled to the ships. A good many had taken refuge for the day in the Casa Gould. On the landing a girl, with her hair half down, was kneeling against the wall under the niche where stands a Madonna in blue robes and a gilt crown on her head. I think it was the eldest Miss Lopez; I couldn’t see her face, but I remember looking at the high French heel of her little shoe. She did not make a sound, she did not stir, she was not sobbing; she remained there, perfectly still, all black against the white wall, a silent figure of passionate piety. I am sure she was no more frightened than the other white-faced ladies I met carrying bandages. One was sitting on the top step tearing a piece of linen hastily into strips—the young wife of an elderly man of fortune here. She interrupted herself to wave her hand to my bow, as though she were in her carriage on the Alameda. The women of our country are worth looking at during a revolution. The rouge and pearl powder fall off, together with that passive attitude towards the outer world which education, tradition, custom impose upon them from the earliest infancy. I thought of your face, which from your infancy had the stamp of intelligence instead of that patient and resigned cast which appears when some political commotion tears down the veil of cosmetics and usage.",

Living conditions in the poor quarters were fearful. An officially commissioned report in 1882 – in effect the first Hong Kong social survey – showed that Chinese houses were generally divided by partitions into many cabins, each a dwelling about ten feet square. In one row of eight such houses 428 people were living. Hardly any houses had running water (and water from public fountains was available only in the small hours of the morning). Many had no chimneys, the smoke from their fires issuing from the windows, and in many pigs lived among the humans upstairs as well as down.",

Windows and doors were wide open to the breeze, and the songs and fragrances blew lazily in and out. The walls were hung with tapa-cloths. Couches with grass-woven covers invited everywhere, and there was a grand piano, that played, I was sure, nothing more exciting than lullabies. Servants— Japanese maids in native costume—drifted around and about, noiselessly, like butterflies. Everything was preternaturally cool. Here was no blazing down of a tropic sun upon an unshrinking sea. It was too good to be true. But it was not real. It was a dream- dwelling. I knew, for I turned suddenly and caught the grand piano cavorting in a spacious corner of the room. I did not say anything, for just then we were being received by a gracious woman, a beautiful Madonna, clad in flowing white and shod with sandals, who greeted us as though she had known us always.",

As the thought crept through his brain, he grew pale with terror, and the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder. Oh! in what a wild hour of madness he had killed his friend! How ghastly the mere memory of the scene! He saw it all again. Each hideous detail came back to him with added horror.

    "target_paragraph": "The slats were dropping from the ceiling of Shushenskoe’s bus station, built for pilgrims who no longer came, and the floors were awash with rain. It trickled down the carved panels of Bolshevik heroes toppling the imperial eagle, and smeared the cheeks of the embossed Lenin. It dribbled between the windowpanes of my bus as it veered south-east, and erased the road a hundred yards ahead. Sometimes it would part like mist around a stack of dark hills, where pine forests stood bearded in parasitic lichen, or drift out of glades sodden with ferns and moss. We might have been underwater.\nOver the western Sayan we were pushing into a strange, isolated republic, enclosed by the mountains which give birth to the Yenisei. A century ago, as the grip of the enfeebled Manchu empire slackened, this unseen region of Tuva was sucked from the orbit of China into that of Russia, which annexed it in 1944 while the world was looking the other way. But its Turkic-speaking people–once an ethnic melange–had always looked to Mongolia. Mongolia had coloured their ancient shamanism with Buddhism, and had invested them with a shadowy history. Their remoteness, and their late entry into the Soviet empire, had left them a majority in their homeland, half-nomadic in many regions, clannish, poor.\nAs we breasted the frontier pass the rain turned to sleet. Then, as if winter had come suddenly, in the first days of autumn, the sky was thick with snow. It fell incongruously, like manna. It frosted the half-tropical undergrowth, the ferns, the fat-leaved vines, and gusted across the road in small, angry flakes. On one side of us the cliffs threw down icy waterfalls, on the other the road dropped into space. Then we were over the pass and descending cold-lit foothills. We seemed to be entering a deeper wilderness. Above the gleam of bronze and amber undergrowth, the pine forests were dying. Still wrapped in killer moss, the trees fell all of a piece, their roots wrenched up like old cog-wheels, and spread a ghostly litter over the hills. Whole mountainsides were ashen with them.\nBut beyond us other ranges were unfolding. Our road descended uncertainly. We were crossing into Tuva between stiffening control-posts. Police rolled out iron-spiked cables across the way, boarded the bus, idly opened our baggage. I was only notionally legal here, depending on official whim, and retreated into a sleepy Estonian version of myself. ‘What’s this?’ The policeman prodded my rucksack with a baton. ‘A rucksack,’ I revealed, and he moved on.\nThe land breathed out at last in treeless plateaux edged with clouds. We were crossing grasslands studded by kurgans, and the air was cold. Where the road roughened into craters, an articulated truck had jack-knifed and overturned. Beside it stood a police car and a crowd of men. The driver was spreadeagled dead over the tarmac. Our bus let out a wavering, collective sigh. Then our driver turned up his radio and we rolled on.\nAn hour later the little capital of Tuva–a Russian bridgehead named Kyzyl, founded in 1914–made a concrete blemish on the plain. But once we were inside the town the land which it defiled shone seductively at the end of every street. I walked it uneasily. The Tuvans were in the ascendant now. Their country might lie in economic thrall to Moscow, but since gaining nominal sovereignty in 1991 they had been gathering strength: a sturdy people with high, burnished cheeks–trim women and crop-haired men. Racial riots seven years before had driven several thousand Russian workers home, and a suppressed violence was in the air. The police patrolled in threes. Twice I saw men searched, then arrested. In the desolate main square, where flower-beds were going to seed, Lenin still flung out a shaky arm at the local parliament. But a monumental fountain was adorned with Tuva’s disparate animals–camel, reindeer, yak–and a white theatre hoisted a fly-tower strapped with Mongolian carvings.\nIf you take a bus down the long road two hundred miles towards Mongolia, you find it filled with men returning from market in thick felt boots, sometimes bruised, drunk, with matted hair; women visiting parental villages, their eyes widened by Russian make-up and their tresses drawn back in mother-of-pearl clasps. In between hamlets the grasslands are broken by knolls, where cairns are stuck with the rag-hung poles of an old worship, and herds of black and chestnut horses graze against infinity. A pair of Bactrian camels crosses the road, and somewhere to the east, out of sight, are the mountains of reindeer herders. Squashed beside a peasant woman who feeds the passengers her last sweet apples, I watch this land unfurl with bemused awe.\nOnly after a long time, the skyline crinkles and streams come slithering out of forested hills. Here and there the dome of a yurt hunches under a curl of smoke, while to the south the suspended snows of the Tannu Ola shine.",

What kind of city was this, where people had been reduced to the practice of helpless witchcraft?\nHaving no one else to call up on the phone, the man dialed Room Service. Asked to identify himself, at first he couldn’t remember who he was, then saw that his number was on his telephone. He read it off into the mouthpiece. It was way up in the 1800s; probably the date of some battle in the Crimean War. At least it gave him what the hotel no doubt regarded as a privileged view. From his window he could see six clogged freeways, a line of giant electricity pylons, and the bald, oily levee at the edge of the river. The blue-brick factories below had names in scabbed lettering which meant nothing to him: CRUNDEN MARTIN, NOOTER BOILERMAKERS, CORNELL SEED COMPANY, PEABODY COAL. On the flight that had brought him here, the words of an old Judy Garland song had been going around in his head like a repeating loop of tape. They contained more or less all he had ever known of the city.\nMeet me in St. Louis, Louie,",

    "target_paragraph": "Bolívar’s men performed miracles, on the march and in battle, in good measure due to the trust and faith he inspired. He was, above all, a soldier’s general. No detail escaped his concern. He never rested. After fifteen hours in the saddle, he would work deep into the night, gathering intelligence, seeing to the wounded and sick, orchestrating the flow of supplies: salt, flour, and cooking oil for the field kitchens, medicines and bandages for the surgeons, tobacco for the officers, ammunition and food for the men. Dawn would find him, lying in his hammock, still issuing directives to his staff: marching and battle orders but also instructions concerning logistics and supply—the number of cattle necessary to feed the army, the weight of corn required to keep those cattle alive. He worried about the well-being of the horses, the condition of the powder and shot, the thickness of a blanket, a soldier’s only comfort in the cold. More than once, Bolívar would be seen on the march, personally carrying a soldier too weak to stand. General Francisco Santander, his companion in battle, a close friend and later a nemesis, described Bolívar as “the anchor of our hopes; the essence of our vitality.” Daniel O’Leary, his aide-de-camp, wrote that Bolívar “could calm troubles by his very presence, [such was] the magic of his prestige.” Santander, who by the end of his life had every reason to disdain and even despise Bolívar, confessed: “His force of personality is such that on countless occasions when I have been filled with hatred and revenge, the mere sight of him, the instant he speaks, I am disarmed, and I come away filled with nothing so much as admiration.”",

    "target_paragraph": "The gangsas always play unison melodies in a structured way, according to the size of the matching pairs of instruments. The lower sounding ones with large keys carry the main melody, while the smaller-keyed instruments, still playing in unison, play complicated little patterns or variations based upon the notes of the melody, often at a frantic pace. The net result is a big, full sound. Scattered through the orchestra are men playing singly, perhaps tapping a stick on an inverted bronze pot or clashing together some small cymbals. But the richest sound comes from the magnificent bronze gongs. A gong player often appears to be taking a nap until, at a mysterious moment, he suddenly reaches up and taps a deep, mellow tone with his cloth-covered mallet. The gongs punctuate the melodies and divisions of the composition. This is far from simple music. Foreigners often spend years in Bali learning to follow it, much less play.",

The two grooves on each side of Renny’s nose were still wet. His face was all peaks and hollows; North’s face was round and snub-nosed and rather blueish about the lips. She gave her chair a little push so that she got the two heads in relation side by side. They were very different. And as they talked about Africa their faces changed, as if some twitch had been given to the fine network under the skin and the weights fell into different sockets. A thrill ran through her as if the weights in her own body had changed too. But there was something about the light that puzzled her. She looked round. A lamp must be flaring in the street outside. Its light, flickering up and down, mixed with the electric light under the greenish cone of mottled paper. It was that which… She started; a voice had reached her.",

I am of the baby-boom generation, who grew up during the Cold War. In our childhood, a new board game came out called Risk, which was played on a map representing the world. The object of Risk was to multiply your own armies, move them from one global region to the next while eliminating the armies of your opponents, and eventually take over the world. This required luck, ruthlessness, and intercontinental strategizing, Cold War–style. The armies were little plastic counters colored red, blue, yellow, brown, black, and green. Of the major global powers, you basically understood which color was supposed to stand for whom. The Kamchatka Peninsula controlled the only crossing of the game board’s narrow sea between Asia and North America, so gaining Kamchatka was key.",

This worthy, whose name was Sinker Jordan, was three years older than Eugene. He was a handsome, reckless boy, small in stature, and limping from an injury he had received in a football game.

    "target_paragraph": "Father and daughter rode home through the twilight, and now there were no dog-roses in the hedges, the hedges stood leafless and grey with frost rime, a network of delicate branches. The earth smelt as clean as a newly washed garment—it smelt of ‘God’s washing’, as Stephen called it—while away to the left, from a distant farm-house, came the sound of a yard-dog, barking. Small lights were glowing in cottage windows as yet uncurtained, as yet very friendly; and beyond, where the great hills of Malvern showed blue against the pale sky, many small lights were burning—lights of home newly lit on the altar of the hills to the God of both hills and homesteads. No birds were singing in the trees by the roadside, but a silence prevailed, more lovely than bird song; the thoughtful and holy silence of winter, the silence of trustfully waiting furrows. For the soil is the greatest saint of all ages, knowing neither impatience, nor fear, nor doubting; knowing only faith, from which spring all blessings that are needful to nurture man.\nSir Philip said: ‘Are you happy, my Stephen?’\nAnd she answered: ‘I’m dreadfully happy, Father. I’m so dreadfully happy that it makes me feel frightened, ‘cause I mayn’t always last happy—not this way.’\nHe did not ask why she might not last happy; he just nodded, as though he admitted a reason; but he laid his hand over hers on the bridle for a moment, a large, and comforting hand. Then the peace of the evening took possession of Stephen, that and the peace of a healthy body tired out with fresh air and much vigorous movement, so that she swayed a little in her saddle and came near to falling asleep. The pony, even more tired than his rider, jogged along with neck drooping and reins hanging slackly, too weary to shy at the ogreish shadows that were crouching ready to scare him. His small mind was doubtless concentrated on fodder; on the bucket of water nicely seasoned with gruel; on the groom’s soothing hiss as he rubbed down and bandaged; on the warm blanket clothing, so pleasant in winter, and above all on that golden bed of deep straw that was sure to be waiting in his stable.\nAnd now a great moon had swung up very slowly; and the moon seemed to pause, staring hard at Stephen, while the frost rime turned white with the whiteness of diamonds, and the shadows turned black and lay folded like velvet round the feet of the drowsy hedges. But the meadows beyond the hedges turned silver, and so did the road to Morton.\n* * *\nIt was late when they reached the stables at last, and old Williams was waiting in the yard with a lantern.\n‘Did you kill?’ he inquired, according to custom; then he saw Stephen’s trophy and chuckled.\nStephen tried to spring easily out of the saddle as her father had done, but her legs seemed to fail her. To her horror and chagrin her legs hung down stiffly as though made of wood; she could not control them; and to make matters worse, Collins now grew impatient and began to walk off to his loose-box. Then Sir Philip put two strong arms around Stephen, and he lifted her bodily as though she were a baby, and he carried her, only faintly protesting, right up to the door of the house and beyond it—right up indeed, to the warm pleasant nursery where a steaming hot bath was waiting. Her head fell back and lay on his shoulder, while her eyelids drooped, heavy with well-earned sleep; she had to blink very hard several times over in order to get the better of that sleep.\n‘Happy, darling?’ he whispered, and his grave face bent nearer. She could feel his cheek, rough at the end of the day, pressed against her forehead, and she loved that kind roughness, so that she put up her hand and stroked it.\nSo dreadfully, dreadfully happy, Father,’ she murmured, ‘so—dreadfully happy—’",

There was nothing he would have dreaded as much as her detecting the least trace of what he was feeling. His first care must be to hide the break in their perfect communion—the fact that for a moment she had been for him the woman she would some day be for another man, in a future he could never share.

To begin with it does not occupy a valley, but rather the thin strip of approximately horizontal ground that runs between the Pacific combers and the range of red rock mountains which rise steeply up behind the town. And it is positively not paradisal. The steady offshore breeze which scours the surface earth, the steepness of the ground and the salty soil mean that there is no vegetation to speak of. There is little other life to be found here save for the human inhabitants, who have made their homes in huddles of low white-washed houses with red-tiled roofs, which congregate in the stream-cuts and ravines. Near the shoreline, dories bob in rows, ready to service the big ships that come to anchor out in the deeper water – for Valparaíso, unlikely as it may seem, is Chile’s principal sea-port. Over the whole scene hangs the clear, dry air of the coastal summer.",

We were headed for the fabled summit of Bow Fell, at 2,960 feet the sixth highest of the Lakeland hills. Walkers ahead of us formed well-spaced dots of slow-moving color leading to a majestically remote summit, lost in cloud.

In them you’ll usually find a pair of patched and faded jeans, a sweater, a raincoat, a Coleman burner, The South American Handbook, which the mochileros call their bible, a sleeping bag, a few toilet articles, and a small first-aid kit. That’s it. They keep their money in a money belt inside their pants. Some, like Marcus, even more cautious, cut a slit across the inside hem of their pants leg and stick rolled bills inside.",

They open the doors and pull us from our seats; a young girl rubs orange powder into my hair, a brash boy paints my cheeks pink with his hands and his mate circles my breasts with red. Screaming blue murder, I run for safety, dodging streams of colored water fired from balconies. I’m not safe yet. Simi opens the door yelling, “Happy Holi,” and pours yellow powder down my top, while Vivek rubs purple into my forehead. Jonathan staggers in like a creature from the blue lagoon with his mouth laughing shocking white teeth. We gulp a sweet marijuana milk shake for courage and join in.",
