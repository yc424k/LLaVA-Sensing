If Katharine went, her only chance of speaking was lost; her only chance of saying something tremendously important was lost. Half a dozen words were sufficient to wake Katharine’s attention, and put flight and further silence beyond her power. But although the words came to her lips, her throat closed upon them and drove them back. After all, she considered, why should she speak? Because it is right, her instinct told her; right to expose oneself without reservations to other human beings. She flinched from the thought. It asked too much of one already stripped bare. Something she must keep of her own. But if she did keep something of her own? Immediately she figured an immured life, continuing for an immense period, the same feelings living for ever, neither dwindling nor changing within the ring of a thick stone wall. The imagination of this loneliness frightened her, and yet to speak—to lose her loneliness, for it had already become dear to her, was beyond her power.",

Running up the center of the boat, the bilge is a hollow space beneath the floor that collects runoff and overflow from multiple sources: shower water, engine spills, and salt water. If the boat sprang a leak, many gallons of seawater would collect in this space first, preventing the cabin from flooding straightaway. An automatic pump empties any collected fluid overboard, but there’s always an inch of greasy liquid that lines the bottom, which tends to putrefy into a thick, black funk. Four wooden panels along the floor of our living space cover the bilge, and when we lift them up to peer into The Dark Zone, the boat’s interior is defiled with an overbearing fart bomb of eggs, beans, and motor oil.",

She was too late, then – but the fact did not alarm her. A glimpse of Mr Gryce’s crestfallen face even suggested that she had done wisely in absenting herself, since the disappointment he so candidly betrayed would surely whet his appetite for the afternoon walk. That walk she did not mean to miss; one glance at the bills on her writing-table was enough to recall its necessity. But meanwhile she had the morning to herself, and could muse pleasantly on the disposal of its hours. She was familiar enough with the habits of Bellomont to know that she was likely to have a free field till luncheon. She had seen the Wetheralls, the Trenor girls and Lady Cressida packed safely into the omnibus; Judy Trenor was sure to be having her hair shampooed; Carry Fisher had doubtless carried off her host for a drive, Ned Silverton was probably smoking the cigarette of young despair in his bedroom; and Kate Corby was certain to be playing tennis with Jack Stepney and Miss Van Osburgh. Of the ladies, this left only Mrs Dorset unaccounted for, and Mrs Dorset never came down till luncheon: her doctors, she averred, had forbidden her to expose herself to the crude air of the morning.",

Instead of driving straight up the N2 we took a roundabout route, via Mitchells Plain and Nyanga; the buses’ collective health was poorly and they preferred to avoid traffic-cop attention. On the way we passed a district from which whites were moved under the Group Areas Act; an abandoned DRC church, derelict and vandalized, marked the spot. Comrade Noxolo was honoured by being put in the front seat and entrusted with our group’s huge SACP flag to be flown from the window. A trivial task, you might think, but considerable muscular effort is required to hold a large flag steady in a fast-moving vehicle. My companions sang loudly and the mood was euphoric on this last Soweto Day to be celebrated under white rule. A year hence, if all goes well, 16 June will be an official national holiday – not, as now, unofficial, with whites still trying to run the country normally in defiance of the fact that most blacks take the day off.",

    "target_paragraph": "Khan al-Khalili occupies a few dozen feddans in the heart of the ancient, walled city. The market is named for Jaharkas al-Khalili al-Yalbughawi, a fourteenth-century Mamluk, who, like most Mamluks, despised the Fatimid caliphate that founded Cairo and ruled Egypt for centuries. Al-Khalili, being especially bitter, decided to build his market on the very ground which held the turbet al-za'afran, the mausoleum in which generations of Fatimid caliphs and their families were laid to rest. The mausoleum and its contents would have to go. André Raymond, in Cairo, a remarkable biography of the city, described the desecration that followed. After the mausoleum was leveled, and its stones carted away, the skeletal remains therein, he wrote, were “loaded into baskets and thrown onto the mounds of rubble east of the city.” In its place, al-Khalili built a public inn, much like a modern motel, and a caravansary around which merchants displayed their products. This was a grand bazaar where Cairenes could buy, sell, and trade just about anything. The original caravansary was destroyed, in the fifteenth century, and replaced, in stages, over the next few centuries. Today, the khan’s narrow streets, paved in cobbled stones and handmade bricks, wind between five-story apartment blocks where every doorway leads to a shop or artisan or a bakery.",

Listen, Rhoda (for we are conspirators, with our hands on the cold urn), to the casual, quick, exciting voice of action, of hounds running on the scent. They speak now without troubling to finish their sentences. They talk a little language such as lovers use. An imperious brute possesses them. The nerves thrill in their thighs.

The Maine forest was thick, yet welcoming, and the humidity of the day eased as the light shifted from the sun’s incandescence to softer shades of pearl. A silent eruption of shadows surged from the marshy land in front of me. I stopped in my tracks—unafraid, but curious. My brain decoded the confusion of light and gray to see the sleek lines of a great blue heron skimming across my field of vision. When it had disappeared, I breathed a deep sigh of contentment and quietly thanked it.",

    "target_paragraph": "Indians had taught the settlers how to grow corn and brought them four wild turkeys.\nSo, with the rain streaking the galley windows, we dug into our mounds of deep-frozen turkey, brought out to us by the supply boat from Waterways Marine. Away from home, afloat in a real wilderness, we were closer than most, I thought, to the spirit of that original Thanksgiving. I doubted if Bradford and Miles Standish and William Brewster had gone in for a great deal of polite conversation over their turkey either.\nTwo miles above Vicksburg the tow slowed in midstream and my boat was lowered over the side. It was much like going back to school after the holidays. I said my goodbyes and headed out across a rough patch of shoal water through the stinging rain. The Louisiana shore was a jungly swamp of willows, cypresses, cane and kudzu vines. The bluff of Vicksburg, on the far side of the river, was like a smeared thumbprint. I hung back on the current, waiting for the Frank Stegbauer to round Vicksburg bend, then crossed over to the mouth of the Yazoo River, skidded on the slick of an eddy, and reached Vicksburg Harbor feeling cold, sodden and very out of sorts. I had been under the innocent illusion that the sun shone all year on the Deep South. This was a wet English winter day. I tied up to a slippery jetty, my fingers too numbed to make proper knots. The city was as quiet and dripping as the swamp. It rose steeply behind its concrete floodwall in a greasy cliff of banked roofs and rivery streets. The blurred taillights of a car disappeared over the top of the hill. It looked as if it might well be the last car in town.\nEven without people, though, Vicksburg spoke more loudly about itself than most places. I had to climb up steps past a Confederate cannon which was aimed at the river across Washington Mall. The first time I saw it, in the rain on Thanksgiving, I mistook it for an empty historical symbol, a curio set up to please the eye of the sentimental tourist. It was more complicated than that.\nIn 1863, General Grant’s campaign came to a dead stop at Vicksburg. Its bluff was too high to storm. It was a natural castle, defending the whole of the lower Mississippi. From Vicksburg to New Orleans, the Confederacy was safe as long as its army held the town. On a night in May, Union troopships ran south around Vicksburg bend and landed a few miles downstream, and Grant’s army marched on Vicksburg from behind. With their ships on the river and their gun emplacements at the back of the bluff, they had the town surrounded. When the Confederates refused to surrender, Grant ordered his army to starve the town out. The siege lasted for forty-seven days. On the Fourth of July, Vicksburg gave in; and until the 1960s, there was no public holiday in Vicksburg on Independence Day. The memory of that Civil War siege was still vital to the character of the town in the late twentieth century. Natchez, the next bluff city down the river, had surrendered to Grant without a fight, and that wasn’t forgotten either. In the 1970s, an effort had been made to patch up relations between the two towns by mounting a high school football game. It had ended with riot police, Mace and water cannon.\nOn the day after Thanksgiving, browsing in the library of the Corps of Engineers in Vicksburg, I found a memoir by a veteran of the siege which had been published by the Mississippi Historical Association in 1903. Colonel J. H. Jones had commanded a section of the 38th Mississippi Regiment. He quoted a song that his men used to sing to taunt the Union forces less than a hundred yards away across the trenches:\nSwear, boys, swear Vicksburg shall ne’er surrender,",

Yet assuming the value of taciturnity to a man among strangers, it is apt to express more than talkativeness when he dwells among friends. The countryman who is obliged to judge the time of day from changes in external nature sees a thousand successive tints and traits in the landscape which are never discerned by him who hears the regular chime of a clock, because they are never in request. In like manner do we use our eyes on our taciturn comrade. The infinitesimal movement of muscle, curve, hair, and wrinkle, which when accompanied by a voice goes unregarded, is watched and translated in the lack of it, till virtually the whole surrounding circle of familiars is charged with the reserved one’s moods and meanings.",

A south wind breathed over the Mediterranean waters, drawing up their moisture which lay couched in thick mists abut its flanks and uplands. The comely outlines were barely suggested through a veil of fog. An air of irreality hung about the place. Could this be an island? A veritable island of rocks and vineyards and houses—this pallid apparition? It looked like some snowy sea-bird resting upon the waves; a sea-bird or a cloud; one of those lonely clouds that stray from their fellows and drift about in wayward fashion at the bidding of every breeze.",

The double-decker carriage was uncrowded and I took a seat in the low-ceilinged upper floor, opposite a sturdy blonde woman doing what Dutch people usually did on trains: eating a homemade cheese sandwich from a small plastic bag. The train slid quickly through the open farmland, raindrops chasing one another across the windows. I noticed several small Catholic shrines hidden among the farmhouses and narrow lanes, brick chapels about the size of a garden shed, each with a cross above the door and a carefully tended garden. Consulting a map, I realised we were travelling roughly parallel to the Belgian border, which lay perhaps six miles to the south behind damp grassy fields filled with monochrome cows. As a Brit usually forced to board a flight or ferry to travel abroad, I still found it strange to think that another country lay just a short walk away.",

Didn’t they know people were suffering here? Thirty-three Samoans had been killed outright on Tutuila alone, and scores, at least, were injured and homeless. Stockpiles of food were running low. What were they waiting for? There was no help whatsoever forthcoming from the local government, which, with their limited resources, was not unexpected. Many of their offices had been damaged or destroyed. The Red Cross did start delivering sandwiches and water on the third day, which was a big help for anyone with bare cupboards, but many people needed more comprehensive help.",

I believe that Harry” The pen ceased, and still poised, he sought the words that so rarely eluded him, realizing as he did so that, though one can lie about others with ready and extemporaneous promptitude, to lie about oneself requires deliberation and a careful choice of expression. Then he glanced again at his watch and crossed that out and wrote: “Belle sends love, O Serene.” and blotted it and folded it swiftly into an envelope and addressed and stamped it, and rose and took his hat. By running he could get it on the four oclock train.",

Moonlight seeped into the room impalpably, refracted and sourceless; the night was without any sound. Beyond the window a cornice rose in a succession of shallow steps against the opaline and dimensionless sky. His head was clear and cold. The whisky he had drunk was completely dead. Or rather, it was as though his head were one Bayard who watched curiously and impersonally that other Bayard who lay in a strange bed and whose alcohol-dulled nerves radiated like threads of ice through that body which he must drag forever about a bleak and barren world with him. “Hell,” he said, lying on his back, staring out the window where nothing was to be seen, waiting for sleep, not knowing if it would come or not, not caring a particular damn either way. Nothing to be seen, and the long long span of a man’s natural life. Three score and ten years, to drag a stubborn body about the world and cozen its insistent demands. Three score and ten, the bible said. Seventy years. And he was only twenty-six. Not much more than a third through it. Hell.",

Inside the air was thick with unreality. The décor was supposed to be like a Roman temple or something. Statues of Roman gladiators and statesmen were scattered around the place and all the cigarette girls and ladies who gave change were dressed in skimpy togas, even if they were old and overweight, which most of them were, so their thighs wobbled as they walked. It was like watching moving Jell-O. I wandered through halls full of people intent on losing money – endlessly, single-mindedly feeding coins into slot machines or watching the clattering dance of a steel ball on a roulette wheel or playing games of blackjack that had no start or finish but were just continuous, like time. It all had a monotonous, yet anxious rhythm. There was no sense of pleasure or fun. I never saw anyone talking to anyone else, except to order a drink or cash some money. The noise was intense – the crank of one-armed bandits, the spinning of thousands of wheels, the din of clattering coins when a machine paid out.",

Picking their way through with empty sleds, Hadley told McKinlay that cutting the path through this frozen range had been harder than anything he’d experienced in over twenty years in the Arctic, which was saying something, since he’d once been marooned on an ice floe for fifty-three days with two weeks’ rations, and in the end had been forced to eat his sealskin coat and a pair of mukluks.",

We laugh together, sharing cigarettes and stale packets of chocolate, watching the stars shoot across the blackness, talking about the dorms Panchita and Teanji have broken into, the food they’ve stolen, the volunteers they’ve harassed, the infinite minutiae of what each of our cats has done that day. Once it gets late and the others go to bed, if we’re not too tired, Harry and I walk together. When we get far enough away, we kiss. His beard scratches my face and the sweaty, dark smell of him clogs my nostrils. I remember what he said about Wayra and I convince myself that I’ll never ask him to be anything more than this.",

I’ve been walking the streets of Melbourne and Vancouver and Macao and Buenos Aires, recording how each of them faces the challenge of trying to create a higher common factor collection of other places, rather than a lowest common denominator. I’ve been travelling and talking with the 14th Dalai Lama, one of the world’s most prominent (and practical) exiles, to see how losing one kind of home can offer an opportunity to create a fresher and more inclusive one; I even once spent two weeks living in and around Los Angeles International Airport, trying to take the measure of the global city of tomorrow.",

Looped electric cables festooned their low ceilings, dripping alarmingly with moisture. It was like a bunker. Sometimes you seemed to be all alone, every door locked around you. Sometimes the lane was suddenly bright with the lights of a laundry or a sweat-shop factory, and loud with Chinese music. In the one airy space of the labyrinth stood the old yamen, a low wooden building used as a school and community centre, and one got the impression even then of a close-knit, cohesive and homogeneous community, altogether separate from the colony outside. The Hong Kong sanitary laws were not applied. Fire risks were disregarded. The only planning restrictions ever enforced concerned the height of the buildings – as it was, aircraft landing at Kai Tak came screaming disconcertingly low over the rooftops.",

The oxen lift their noses to heaven, with a strange and beseeching snake-like movement, and taking tiny little steps with their frail feet, move slantingly across the slope-face, between the rocks and tree-roots. Little, frail, jerky steps the bullocks take, and again they put their horns back and lift their muzzles snakily to heaven, as the man pulls the line. And he skids his wooden plough round another scoop of earth. It is marvellous how they hang upon that steep, craggy slope. An English labourer's eyes would bolt out of his head at the sight.",

After dinner he tucked a cigar in a holder made of a cardboard cone and a quill, changed spectacles and, hunting through a pile of music on the piano, sat down and attacked the Waldstein Sonata with authority and verve. The pleasure was reinforced by the player’s enjoyment of his capacity to wrestle with it. His expression of delight, as he peered at the notes through a veil of cigar smoke and tumbling ash, was at odds with the gravity of the music. It was a surprise; so different was it from an evening spent with his putative English equivalent; and when the last chord had been struck, he leapt from the stool with a smile of youthful and almost ecstatic enjoyment amid the good-humoured applause of his family. A rush of appraisal broke out, and hot argument about possible alternative interpretations.",

Like many of the women, I had brought a water pack—a large, clear plastic contraption that looks like a hot-water bottle with a tube that threads through the top of your backpack and allows quick access to water while you walk. There are two downsides to the water pack: when filled, it instantly adds three pounds to the weight of your backpack, and the exposed tube near your mouth looks as if you’re receiving oxygen therapy.",
