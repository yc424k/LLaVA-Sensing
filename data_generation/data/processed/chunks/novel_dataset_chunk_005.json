Not all overpriced marine gear is perfect. The oven in our marine stove was no more than a shiny Stainless Steel Easy-Bake oven. On too many occasions I had tried to cook a proper calzone. The best our oven could muster was a burnt on the outside, raw on the inside inedible mess. Our oven was more suited as a space heater than a baking appliance. There had to be a way to cook a calzone. If there was a way it would have to be on the stove top not in the oven.",

    "target_paragraph": "During the cold weeks after Miriam’s arrival there were no expeditions; and very commonly uncertainty was prolonged by a provisional distribution of the ten girls between the kitchen and the five pianos. In this case neither she nor Mademoiselle received any instructions. Mademoiselle would go to the saal with needlework, generally the lighter household mending. The saal piano at practising time was allotted to the pupil to whom the next music lesson was due, and Mademoiselle spent the greater part of her time installed, either awaiting the possible arrival of Herr Bossenberger or presiding over his lessons when he came. Miriam, unprovided for, sitting in the schoolroom with a book, awaiting events, would watch her disappear unconcernedly through the folding doors, every time with fresh wonder. She did not want to take her place, though it would have meant listening to Herr Bossenberger’s teaching and a quiet alcove of freedom from the apprehensive uncertainty that hung over so many of her hours. It seemed to her odd, not quite the thing, to have a third person in the room at a music lesson. She tried to imagine a lesson being given to herself under these conditions. The thought was abhorrent. And Mademoiselle, of all people. Miriam could see her sitting in the saal, wrapped in all the coolness of her complete insensibility to music, her eyes bent on her work, the quick movements of her small, thin hands, the darting gleam of her thimble, the dry way she had of clearing her throat, a gesture that was an accentuation of the slightly metallic quality of her voice, and expressed, for Miriam, in sound, that curious sense of circumspect frugality she was growing to realise as characteristic of Mademoiselle’s face in repose.\nThe saal doors closed, the little door leading into the hall became the centre of Miriam’s attention. Before long, sometimes at the end of ten minutes, this door would open and the day become eventful. She had already taken Clara, with Emma, to make a third, three times to her masseuse, sitting for half an hour in a room above a chemist’s shop so stuffy beyond anything in her experience that she had carried away nothing but the sense of its closely-interwoven odours, a dim picture of Clara in a saffron-coloured wrapper and the shocked impression of the resounding thwackings undergone by her. Emma was paying a series of visits to the dentist and might appear at the schoolroom door with frightened eyes, holding it open—“Hendchen! Ich muss zum Zahnarzt.” Miriam dreaded these excursions. The first time Miriam had accompanied her Emma had had “gas.” Miriam, assailed by a loud scream followed by the peremptory voices of two white-coated, fiercely moustached operators, one of whom seemed to be holding Emma in the chair, had started from her sofa in the background. “Brutes!” she had declared and reached the chair-side voluble in unintelligible German to find Emma serenely emerging from unconsciousness. Once she had taken Gertrude to the dentist—another dentist, an elderly man, practising in a frock-coat in a heavily-furnished room with high sash windows, the lower sashes filled with stained glass. There had been a driving March wind and Gertrude with a shawl round her face had battled gallantly along shouting through her shawl. Miriam had made out nothing clearly, but the fact that the dentist’s wife had a title in her own right. Gertrude had gone through her trial, prolonged by some slight complication, without an anæsthetic, in alternations of tense silence and great gusts of her hacking laughter. Miriam, sitting strained in the far background near a screen covered with a mass of strange embroideries, wondered how she really felt. That, she realised with a vision of Gertrude going on through life in smart costumes, one would never know.",

    "target_paragraph": "When the foreman led me to the group at the table, they looked up apprehensively; almost with alarm. I was given a chair, but we were all overcome with diffidence. ‘Was sind Sie von Beruf?’ The foreman, anything but shy, looked at me in frank puzzlement. ‘Sind Sie Kaufmann?’ Was I a pedlar? I felt slightly put out by the question, but it was perfectly reasonable. Nobody else was wandering about like this and I suppose the only itinerant strangers in these parts, if they were not beggars or out-and-out bad hats, must have been pedlars, though I had never come across any. (But a stranger in such a place obviously needed explanation. The shepherds and Gypsies had both shown a touch of misgiving at first: unknown figures in the wilderness bode no good. In the past, they were bent on rounding up laggards for feudal corvées; nowadays, it would be tax-gathering, census-compiling, exaction of grazing dues, the search for malefactors, deserters, or runaway recruits overdue for their military service – a whole range of vexatious interference with the freedom of the woods.) My interlocutors looked bewildered when I tried to explain my reasons for not staying at home. Why was I travelling? To see the world, to study, to learn languages? I wasn’t quite clear myself. Yes, some of these things, but mostly – I couldn’t think of the word at first – and when I found it – ‘for fun’ – it didn’t sound right and their brows were still puckered. ‘Also, Sie treiben so herum aus Vergnügen?’ The foreman shrugged his shoulders and smiled and said something in Yiddish to the others; they all laughed and I asked what it was. ‘Es ist a goyim naches!’ they said. ‘A goyim naches’, they explained, is something that the goyim like but which leaves Jews unmoved; any irrational or outlandish craze, a goy’s delight or gentile’s relish. It seemed to hit the nail on the head.",

For most of the year, it is overrun with tourists from far and wide. Much of the village is given over to large but discreetly screened parking lots, and the tearoom even has a sign out front advertising its fare in Japanese, egads. But the approaches to the village—actually, it’s just a hamlet (and do you know the difference, by the way, between village and hamlet? It’s quite simple, really: One is a place where people live and the other is a play by Shakespeare)—from every direction are exquisite and unspoiled: a meadowy green Eden laced with wandering slate walls, woodland clumps, and low, white farms against a backdrop of blue, beckoning hills. Even Near Sawrey itself has a beguiling, well-concocted charm that belies the overwhelming hordes who come to shuffle through its most famous residence. Such indeed is Hilltop’s alarming popularity that the National Trust doesn’t even advertise it anymore. Yet still the visitors come.

Perhaps above that urn there hangs a picture salvaged from the broken camera – a picture of a great beast frozen forever in an attitude of bewildered agony by the magic of a lens. And, if this is so, then those who pause before these otherwise unmeaning trifles may consider that they speak a moral – not profound, but worthy of a thought; Death will have his moment of respect, however he comes along, and no matter upon what living thing he lays his hand.",

The day has passed in a blur, setting out traps in the nearby jungle for Wayra, and now it’s starting to get dark. Agustino is wearing a head torch and there’s a candle flickering on the rickety table. Faustino is gazing longingly at the hot flame, stroking his beard in anticipation. Shadows dance across his fur, the dirt floor, my arm. I can’t not look at it. The skin is turning purple now. There are six holes, each of them deep, two on my thumb and four on my arm. I can see tiny globules of yellow fat where the skin has torn. The whole side of my hand has gone numb. I wonder if her teeth hit a nerve, or a tendon.",

And yet the intensity, even the delirium, of Melville comes from our sense that his craziness is carrying him away, as strong waves might the sturdiest boat. What terrifies in Sebald is, if anything, the opposite: his almost posthumous calm, as of a frozen ship upon a frozen ocean.",

If Dick Cook or Charlie Edwards sees a goose, he doesn’t hesitate. Bang. But I stop and admire the goose, and then I think of the gun. When I shoot a moose, I walk up to it with profound reverence—this beautiful beast that I, a scrawny little thing, am destroying. The last time I shot my moose, I cried. I really sympathized with him. I don’t know how to put it. Having shot the animal—and seeing it lying there, dying—shakes me up.”",

Often we followed streams instead of paths, clear sparkling streams, their beds a treasure-trove of minuscule multicoloured pebbles. Once we came to a short waterfall, cascading into a deep pool where the Trio swam and competed to find the biggest of the umbrella-shaped leaves that decorated the banks. Rachel and I swigged Buccaneros while admiring those three lithe naked bodies being energetic. When I took photographs, as fond grandmothers are wont to do, Rachel issued a grim warning. ‘Don’t have those developed in London or you might end up in court.’",

These objects sat on a bed of what looked like sand and resin. I looked at Miguel and Elena for interpretation, but Miguel showed his palms, as if to say, Only you can know what this means.

Subsequently, he confirmed to the Americans that there was indeed a little wine on Saint-Pierre and Miquelon now, but it was all bound for the Bahamas, where drinking was legal.

These officers regularly visited work-places (in some areas monthly, in others quarterly) to do abortion-blocking pregnancy tests and ensure that all miscarriages were reported to them for checking. Also they saw to it that every woman under the age of forty-five had a monthly gynaecological test. As the Party daily newspaper announced in March 1984 (sic): ‘Nothing that happens in society can be excluded from the preoccupation of the party’. Soon after, Ceausescu ordered Party organisations everywhere ‘to understand that fulfilment of their leading role requires increasing the responsibility vis-à-vis the accomplishment of demographic policy which constitutes one of the fundamental problems in the activity of our party and state.’ (Even by Marxist standards, Ceausescu-speak was notoriously inimical to clarity of thought. Translated, the message here is, ‘Inform on demographic-law-breakers’.)",

In a roadside eat-drink shop, where four chairs stood around one unsteady table, I brunched – several glasses of herbal tea (free to all customers in Laos), two glasses of strong hot coffee with over-sweet condensed milk, a big bowl of noodle soup, lovage-flavoured and containing a few chicken bones. As I ate, future meals cruised around the floor seeking what they might peck – adolescent fowl at an unattractive half-naked stage. Several customers who work in the town came in for takeaway lunches: salads, soups, vegetables, all sold in small transparent plastic bags. The noon fill of sticky rice is taken from home in baskets slung over shoulders. A four-year-old girl sat on the chair beside me intently brushing the knee-length golden nylon hair of a revolting pink doll. When a large chunk fell off she burst into tears and her mother deserted four customers – who also rallied round, adding their condolences. Finally Grandad came on the scene with a tube of glue and ended the crisis. In Laos children’s needs are usually given priority.",

The belfry of the church towered over us, its bell banging aggressively for every service, the lazy blue-and-white ensign of Greece softly treading the wind above the blue harbour.",

As I recalled the extremes of the day, a glint of sunlight on the wing of a black caracara, the strange mysterious moods of the vast and otherworldly páramos, our awkward descent over stone tracks that had caused even the mules to stumble, I thought of what the early Spaniards had endured, not just in crossing the Macizo Colombiano but on journeys of conquest and discovery that had lasted months: men and horses dying by the day, the survivors plagued by disease, reduced to gnawing on boot leather and saddle bags for sustenance, under constant threat of attack as they moved through jungles and across mountain heights unlike anything any of them had ever experienced. To be sure, they had unleashed in the Americas untold horrors. They were all veterans of murderous religious wars, survivors that Europe, for all its depravity, could not kill. Arriving in a New World that defied all orthodoxy, leaving them disoriented, confused, fearful, and fraught, they had clung to the few certainties that endured: power, greed, conquest, and gold. One can celebrate or lament the consequences of the Spanish conquest, but it is surely impossible to deny the courage, grit, endurance, and zeal that ultimately drove these men to madness and fame, wealth and glory, triumph, humiliation, dishonor, and death.",

I walked there from my guesthouse through an old churchyard, where a pair of stone angels, their wings broken, stood atop both gatepost pillars. The angels were covered with an ephemeral lattice of cream and yellow frangipani blossoms. When I stopped to look, a wild hog appeared from nowhere and ran to hide behind a gravestone in the graveyard, his ferocious squealing giving away his location.",

Also I saw on a winding road in a dust dance the groups we had made, how they came together, how they ate together, how they met in this room or that. I saw my own indefatigable busyness—how I had rushed from one to the other, fetched and carried, travelled and returned, joined this group and that, here kissed, here withdrawn; always kept hard at it by some extraordinary purpose, with my nose to the ground like a dog on the scent; with an occasional toss of the head, an occasional cry of amazement, despair and then back again with my nose to the scent. What a litter—what a confusion; with here birth, here death; succulence and sweetness; effort and anguish; and myself always running hither and thither. Now it was done with. I had no more appetites to glut; no more stings in me with which to poison people; no more sharp teeth and clutching hands or desire to feel the pear and the grape and the sun beating down from the orchard wall.",

Even when the number of the miners alone rose to over six hundred he seemed to know each of them individually, all the innumerable Josés, Manuels, Ignacios, from the villages primero—segundo—or tercero (there were three mining villages) under his government. He could distinguish them not only by their flat, joyless faces, which to Mrs. Gould looked all alike, as if run into the same ancestral mould of suffering and patience, but apparently also by the infinitely graduated shades of reddish-brown, of blackish-brown, of coppery-brown backs, as the two shifts, stripped to linen drawers and leather skullcaps, mingled together with a confusion of naked limbs, of shouldered picks, swinging lamps, in a great shuffle of sandalled feet on the open plateau before the entrance of the main tunnel. It was a time of pause. The Indian boys leaned idly against the long line of little cradle wagons standing empty; the screeners and ore-breakers squatted on their heels smoking long cigars; the great wooden shoots slanting over the edge of the tunnel plateau were silent; and only the ceaseless, violent rush of water in the open flumes could be heard, murmuring fiercely, with the splash and rumble of revolving turbine-wheels, and the thudding march of the stamps pounding to powder the treasure rock on the plateau below. The heads of gangs, distinguished by brass medals hanging on their bare breasts, marshalled their squads; and at last the mountain would swallow one-half of the silent crowd, while the other half would move off in long files down the zigzag paths leading to the bottom of the gorge. It was deep; and, far below, a thread of vegetation winding between the blazing rock faces resembled a slender green cord, in which three lumpy knots of banana patches, palm-leaf roots, and shady trees marked the Village One, Village Two, Village Three, housing the miners of the Gould Concession.",

Basilio, in a livery of white linen and a red sash, had squatted for a moment behind his heels to unstrap the heavy, blunt spurs in the patio; and then the Señor Administrator would go up the staircase into the gallery. Rows of plants in pots, ranged on the balustrade between the pilasters of the arches, screened the corrédor with their leaves and flowers from the quadrangle below, whose paved space is the true hearthstone of a South American house, where the quiet hours of domestic life are marked by the shifting of light and shadow on the flagstones.",
