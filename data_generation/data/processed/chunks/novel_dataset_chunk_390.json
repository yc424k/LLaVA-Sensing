The rest is a net of greenery, creepers, brutally knotted trees, sharp dark edges darned with root systems, their legs and arms submerged in the reflective brown like golden spiders. The haze floats above the ripples, so thick that I can almost move my hand through it. I can feel the heavy push of the sun. It’s like we’re in a bowl, Wayra and I. The water warms. Wisps of white, like feathers, streak the sky. I remember how to breathe. The ripples spread in ever-greater circles and Wayra pulls me on. I let her.

Thick-railed and sharp-nosed, the 8'8\" gun floated me high out of the water, and I had no trouble keeping up with Mark as we started out through the channel. The water was brownish green and very cold; the channel, which ran clear from the shorebreak out to sea, with no inside bar to cross, was choppy and spooky nonetheless, with huge swells sweeping in from both sides, forming fat, unpleasant A-frames that half broke before they vanished. There was a shallow outside bar to the north, where enormous waves leaped up and disemboweled themselves with a horrible growl. To the south, the last section of the long, winding left at Outside VFW’s wasn’t much more inviting. It too looked shallow and extremely thick. Mark and I paused to watch a smooth-faced wave pitch heavily over the last section of the bar, barely twenty yards from where we lay. Into the great dark barrel it formed, Mark bellowed, “Death!” The idea seemed to please him.",

    "target_paragraph": "For Italian immigrants of the early twentieth century, America often came as a shock. As the historians Leonard Dinnerstein and David M. Reimer have noted, most “were unprepared for the coolness with which so many Americans received them.” Often they found themselves excluded from employment and educational opportunities because of their nationality. Restrictive covenants kept them from moving into certain neighborhoods. Italians who settled in the Deep South were sometimes made to attend black schools. At first, it was by no means clear that they would be allowed to use white drinking fountains and lavatories.",

He, too, is miniature, scarcely five feet tall, stout and dressed in overalls with a red kerchief around his neck. He rolls out and salutes us formally with an old word, “Salve, signori.” He looks like one of Santa’s workers, with gold-rimmed glasses, flyaway white hair, tall boots. “Permesso?” he asks before we go through the door. At each door he pauses and repeats, “Permesso?” as though he might surprise someone undressing. He holds his cap in his hand in a way I recognize from my father’s mill workers in the South; he’s used to being the “peasant” speaking to the “padrone.” He has, however, a confident sense of himself, a pride I often notice in waiters, mechanics, delivery people here. He tries the window latches and swings the doors. Pokes the tip of his knife in beams to check for rot, wiggles loose bricks.",

But we got the unmistakable message that they didn’t at all care for our type. The Prefect’s letter was indicated. They were squatting on the ground outside the tent, their ponchos spread around them like mini-tents, and Son read the letter aloud, haltingly and frowningly. But it worked. They stood up, handed it back, growled, ‘Buenos Noches!’ and disappeared into the blackness. Their house must be near, though invisible. I like the way we are addressed as ‘Gringa’ and ‘Gringita’ (as though these were titles) by the campesinos – and others. Rachel is now asleep and the rain continues, violently, as I write. But in here we are dry and warm, unlike poor Juana. I feel apprehensive about her tonight. Has she been injured? Will she lift her picket, despite the mini-boulder Rachel and I placed on it? Will those hard-faced campesinos come back to steal her? Perhaps illogically, I wouldn’t have this worry if they were Indians.",

They had planted their seedy civilization and then escaped from it as far as they could. Everything ugly in Freetown was European: the stores, the churches, the Government offices, the two hotels; if there was anything beautiful in the place it was native: the little stalls of the fruit-sellers which went up after dark at the street corners, lit by candles; the native women rolling home magnificently from church on a Sunday morning, the cheap European cottons, the deep coral or green flounces, the wide straw hats, dignified by the native bearing, the lovely roll of the thighs, the swing of the great shoulders. They were dressed for a garden party and they carried off cheap bright grandeur in the small back-yards among the vultures as nature couldn’t carry off Freetown.",

The air was still and hot at that time in the afternoon. I could see heat pulsing off the rocks in thick, gelatinous waves. The icebergs had stopped moving. The surface of the water was the colour of an anvil and as calm as steel. It seemed as though if I tried to dive into the lake, I would bounce and skitter across its surface, like a stone thrown on to ice. Only the ingots of sunlight lying on the clear floor of the lake expressed its depth; allowed the eye to get purchase on its dimensions. I sat up, hugged my knees to my chest, and stared into the water for what felt like hours. As I sat there, time seemed to pause. The sunlight seemed to petrify the landscape and the lake. Only the clouds chimerically forming and reforming miles above me kept up any sort of movement or rhythm by which time could be calibrated. Otherwise, I might have belonged to any aeon. Nothing, it seemed to me then, could be more permanent, nothing more fixed than this tableau of dazzling ice and dark rock – a scene which had lasted for perpetuity and could only continue to do so. The landscape existed above and beyond me; I only happened to be there, a bystander genuinely of no consequence. Nothing more.",

    "target_paragraph": "There are fourteen tall towers in San Gimignano; there were once seventy-two. They are surrounded, on the narrow city streets, by palazzi and modest houses, all higgledy-piggledy, with projecting Tuscan roofs. They stretch from earth to sky and are built on shifting soil; and they speak, as Georges Duby says, two languages: “on the one hand the unreal space of courtly myth, the vertical flight of mystic ascension, the linear curve carrying composition in to the scrolls of poetic reverie. And on the other, a rigorous marquetry offering the view of a compact universe, profound and solid.” They have one peculiar property: Their stones remain the same color—a gray-gold with a suggestion, a faint pentimento, of black—whether wet with rain or hot with sun. The little guidebook I bought in San Gimignano is quite lyrical and accurate about the walls and towers of San Gimignano, which embody, as its author says, the contradictions of the medieval mind, a mind “reserved and hospitable, bold and fearful. Fearful of enemies, of strangers, of night-time, of treasons.” The walls kept enemies out; they also kept people in; they imparted, to those within, a “sense of community, of common interests and ideals never denied.” San Gimignano is formidable in its beauty; every description of it I have ever read makes it sound both forbidding and delightful. Forbidding it once was, in the days of fratricidal warfare, when families threw collapsible wooden bridges from the window of one tower-fortress to that of another (the days when it traded with Egypt, Syria, and Tunisia and men vied for great wealth); now it is simply delightful. And sheltering. The walls cup and cradle (as, in Niccolò Gerini's painting of St. Fina, she cradles the walled city in her slender young arms). The towers exist not to keep enemies—the Other—out, but to house the soul warmly; one has a sense of great bodily integrity in these spaces; one feels safe. When St. Fina drove the Devil out of San Gimignano with a gesture of her long and lovely hand, she did it for us.",

There was a big fish called doncella, a kind of catfish, dipped whole in corn flour and beaten egg, then deep fried. With our fingers we pulled soft fragments of it from its sides to our plates, and ate; it was delicate fish-flesh, fresh and mild. Someone found the roe, and I ate of that too—it was fat and stronger, like egg yolk, naturally enough, and warm.\nThere was also a stew of meat in shreds with rice and pale brown gravy. I had asked what kind of deer it was tied to the tree; Pepe had answered in Spanish, “Gama.” Now they told us this was gama too, stewed. I suspect the word means merely game or venison. At any rate, I heard that the village dogs had cornered another deer just yesterday, and it was this deer which we were now eating in full sight of the whole article. It was good. I was surprised at its tenderness. But it is a fact that high levels of lactic acid, which builds up in muscle tissues during exertion, tenderizes.\nAfter the fish and meat we ate bananas fried in chunks and served on a tray; they were sweet and full of flavor. I felt terrific. My shirt was wet and cool from swimming; I had had a night’s sleep, two decent walks, three meals, and a swim—everything tasted good. From time to time each one of us, separately, would look beyond our shaded roof to the sunny spot where the deer was still convulsing in the dust. Our meal completed, we walked around the deer and back to the boats.",

A quick check over my shoulder to ensure the outside lane was clear, and I rammed my foot down on the accelerator. The Lada jerked forward, engine screaming and tyres spinning. I overtook a couple of trucks and a slow moving car, then ducked back into the inside lane in a classic evasion manoeuvre. Unfortunately, within seconds, the Mercedes had replicated my move, and was again tucked in right behind me, clearly demonstrating that this wasn't paranoia. We really were being 'tailed.'",

The planes are used more than the VW and the pickup. Flying is the talk of the table, when the talk is not about gold. Weather, parts, loads, structures—Stanley flips through aviation magazines and tells his father about stall-spin accident rates in various aircraft per thousand hours. Stanley was once cruising in the mountains looking for a place to fish, Ed has told me. He saw a gravel bar that looked negotiable, so he set the plane down, but the bar was rougher and shorter than he had thought. It was Mistake No. 1 to risk landing there. Now he made Mistake No. 2: he went fishing. The sun came out. The day warmed up. Warm air is less dense than cold air, and provides less lift. The warmer the air, the longer the run for takeoff. When Stanley tried to leave the gravel bar, he went off the end of it and almost into the river. The tail of the plane dragged in the water as he barely lifted away. “His legs were shaking,” said his father. “He learned judgment there.”",

They were really seeking to give me, their beloved only and adopted daughter, the best possible education. I was neither impressed by Wales nor the by fact that it was a “Christian” boarding school (I had visions of being locked up).

When I sat on the edge of the iron bed my host covered my bare knees with a length of cotton – but in such a charming way that this mark of disapproval seemed almost a compliment.

    "target_paragraph": "There was disagreement among Islamic scholars about when he lived. Sometimes he was called a contemporary of Abraham who left Babel alongside the Patriarch; at other times a friend of Moses who helped guide the tribes of Israel through the Red Sea. Some believed he was a cousin and contemporary of Alexander of Macedon and that he commanded the Greek rearguard at Issus. Other authorities were more specific: they said that Khizr was the greatgrandson of Shem son of Noah, that he was immortal and that his body was miraculously renewed every five hundred years. He wore a long white beard and one of his thumbs had no bone in it. He was always dressed in green and was called Khizr (Arabic for green) because wherever he knelt and prayed the soil instantly became covered with thick vegetation. He was still alive, maintained mediaeval Islamic writers, a wanderer over the earth. If three times appealed to he would protect the pure in heart against theft, drowning, burning, snakes and scorpions, kings and devils. He flew through the air, lived on a diet of water parsley and talked the languages of all peoples. Sometimes he travelled by river, balanced on a large fish. He lived on an island or a green carpet in the heart of the sea, but he had a house in Jerusalem and prayed once a week on the Mount of Olives. He could make himself invisible at will.",

She spoke sadly of the increasing number of pupils with serious behavioural problems and I admired her for sounding sad rather than angry. She was of the generation that did much of its studying in jail. The thousands imprisoned in the ’80s were usually being punished for belonging to specifically non-violent student groups, trades unions and Popular Committees. ‘We were arrested for being anti-terrorist,’ said Amneh with just a hint of bitterness. ‘I got five years for writing, printing and distributing a booklet about running a long-term transport strike. But how can we expect this generation to value non-violence?’ She gestured towards the yard, now a noisy mass of pupils enjoying their mid-morning break.",

He sliced delicate strips of meat from the skewer of beef and roasted them on a grill. While the meat sizzled on the flattop, the chef slit a roll and layered it with tahini sauce and tomato slices. In those few seconds, the strips of beef seared to perfection. The chef folded the meat onto the dressed bun and wrapped the sandwich in paper. He handed the sandwich to me with one hand and took another customer’s receipt with the other. Meanwhile, a delivery boy – he must have been around twelve years old – launched his scooter over the curb and onto the sidewalk. He rolled through the crowd, grabbed a bag of sandwiches from the chef, honked his horn a few times, and sped off to make his next delivery. The crowd barely moved as he drove down the sidewalk.",

Steam was rising from fumaroles in the lake and bubbling up through the mud by the roadside. I was in the area of the park called the caldera. Once there was a great mountain here. But 600,000 years ago it blew up in a colossal volcanic eruption that sent 240 cubic miles of débris into the atmosphere. The geysers, fumaroles and steaming mudpots for which Yellowstone is famous are the spluttering relics of that cataclysm.",

    "target_paragraph": "It looked easy on paper. Here was Hilo and there was our objective, 128 degrees west longitude. With the northeast trade blowing we could travel a straight line between the two points, and even slack our sheets off a goodly bit. But one of the chief troubles with the trades is that one never knows just where he will pick them up and just in what direction they will be blowing. We picked up the northeast trade right outside of Hilo harbour, but the miserable breeze was away around into the east. Then there was the north equatorial current setting westward like a mighty river. Furthermore, a small boat, by the wind and bucking into a big headsea, does not work to advantage. She jogs up and down and gets nowhere. Her sails are full and straining, every little while she presses her lee-rail under, she flounders, and bumps, and splashes, and that is all. Whenever she begins to gather way, she runs ker- chug into a big mountain of water and is brought to a standstill. So, with the Snark, the resultant of her smallness, of the trade around into the east, and of the strong equatorial current, was a long sag south. Oh, she did not go quite south. But the easting she made was distressing. On October 11, she made forty miles easting; October 12, fifteen miles; October 13, no easting; October 14, thirty miles; October 15, twenty-three miles; October 16, eleven miles; and on October 17, she actually went to the westward four miles. Thus, in a week she made one hundred and fifteen miles easting, which was equivalent to sixteen miles a day. But, between the longitude of Hilo and 128 degrees west longitude is a difference of twenty-seven degrees, or, roughly, sixteen hundred miles. At sixteen miles a day, one hundred days would be required to accomplish this distance. And even then, our objective, l28 degrees west longitude, was five degrees north of the Line, while Nuka-hiva, in the Marquesas, lay nine degrees south of the Line and twelve degrees to the west!",

The Notch, as it was known, commanded a lonely valley about a dozen miles from Ludlow, the nearest outlet to the wider world. “The scene was one of much natural beauty, of which I think the inhabitants had little realization,” Coolidge wrote in later life. His birthplace was the general store and post office that his father ran, though the family later moved to a larger house across the road?the house where Coolidge was sleeping on the night he learned he was president.",

    "target_paragraph": "The streets were empty enough on Sunday night, and if the Sabbath, and the domestic amusements proper to the Sabbath, had not kept people indoors, a high strong wind might very probably have done so. Ralph Denham was aware of a tumult in the street much in accordance with his own sensations. The gusts, sweeping along the Strand, seemed at the same time to blow a clear space across the sky in which stars appeared, and for a short time the quick-speeding silver moon riding through clouds, as if they were waves of water surging round her and over her. They swamped her, but she emerged; they broke over her and covered her again; she issued forth indomitable. In the country fields all the wreckage of winter was being dispersed; the dead leaves, the withered bracken, the dry and discoloured grass, but no bud would be broken, nor would the new stalks that showed above the earth take any harm, and perhaps tomorrow a line of blue or yellow would show through a slit in their green. But the whirl of the atmosphere alone was in Denham’s mood, and what of star or blossom appeared was only as a light gleaming for a second upon heaped waves fast following each other. He had not been able to speak to Mary, though for a moment he had come near enough to be tantalized by a wonderful possibility of understanding. But the desire to communicate something of the very greatest importance possessed him completely; he still wished to bestow this gift upon some other human being; he sought their company. More by instinct than by conscious choice, he took the direction which led to Rodney’s rooms. He knocked loudly upon his door; but no one answered. He rang the bell. It took him some time to accept the fact that Rodney was out. When he could no longer pretend that the sound of the wind in the old building was the sound of someone rising from his chair, he ran downstairs again, as if his goal had been altered and only just revealed to him. He walked in the direction of Chelsea.",

He, too, spotted signs of restlessness among the storks. Would they set off on their own? No, no, he said; they would join one of the large migrations coming from the north-west, probably from Poland. Some village girls passed, sorting out roses, zinnias, hollyhocks, tiger-lilies and marigolds; not for a wedding but for decorating altars. The Orthodox were celebrating the Dormition of the Virgin next day, the pilot said, and the Catholics her Assumption: two aspects of the same occasion; and to illustrate his own doctrine, the pilot’s forefinger, twirling in an ascending gyre, plotted the path of tomorrow’s star-crowned figure dwindling into the empyrean. My passport, soon to be stamped with its seventh frontier-crossing (‘Orsova, 13 August, 1934’) lay on the table with my stick and the rucksack next to it on a chair. Something, I couldn’t think what, was missing. The stag’s antler! I must have forgotten it among the grass and the brambles on the island when I rolled up my greatcoat. Relief soon followed disappointment; the trophy had become a bit of a nuisance; anyway, there was no time to go back. Perhaps some future palaeontologist might think the island had once teemed with deer.",

    "target_paragraph": "On our way to town, we attracted the attention of yet another hustler. This one leaned against a sign post, in the slim shade it offered, and sucked on a thistle. He was svelte and wore his hair greased back and his pose reminded me of James Dean. On the curb in front of him sat a boy, about eight years old, who was so small that we didn’t notice him at first. When we passed the pair, the knave leapt to action. He shadowed me, and the boy shadowed him. “Hello, remember me? From the hotel?” the hustler asked. I was disappointed by his conventional approach. The hustler was no James Dean after all. He was amateurish and obvious and would make a terrible mentor for the little boy who trailed him.",
