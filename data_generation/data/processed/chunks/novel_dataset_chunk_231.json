But then the wind changed direction, northerlies brought freezing temperatures, and spring stopped. Gritter lorries moved over the roads, whirring out fans of salt and stone. Children made an ice slide on a quiet road near my house, and queued up in jostling lines, polishing the ice to the consistency of milk-bottle glass. John, who had sailed me out to Enlli, wrote from his home in Hope Valley in the Peak District, to say he had spent two days out tracking hares. He spoke of big beluga drifts of snow, and of the hares, still in their white fur, moving unhurriedly between them.",

She walked out in her plain white bikini with the confidence of a Milan Fashion Week veteran, making burning eye contact with the judges, her angel wings folded discreetly behind her. Halfway up the stage, she spread the wings out. The two girls who shared the stage with her disappeared almost entirely. It was a brilliant move. The crowd went apeshit. Nadia’s gay mafia posse stomped the ground with their feet and howled like jackals. I found myself hollering and whooping at the stage too. There was something contagious and electric about what was happening. The noise was deafening and drowned out the electronic music. In response, the judges started laughing too, enjoying the racket.",

In the street he kept up a great pace with his smart hobbling walk, a case of instruments under his arm. He was known for being loco. Nobody interfered with him. From under the seaward gate, across the dusty, arid plain, interspersed with low bushes, he saw, more than a mile away, the ugly enormity of the Custom House, and the two or three other buildings which at that time constituted the seaport of Sulaco. Far away to the south groves of palm trees edged the curve of the harbour shore. The distant peaks of the Cordillera had lost their identity of clear cut shapes in the steadily deepening blue of the eastern sky. The doctor walked briskly. A darkling shadow seemed to fall upon him from the zenith. The sun had set. For a time the snows of Higuerota continued to glow with the reflected glory of the west. The doctor, holding a straight course for the Custom House, appeared lonely, hopping amongst the dark bushes like a tall bird with a broken wing.",

At Die Berg – the highest point in the Transvaal, marked by a monolithic boulder inscribed ‘6,904 feet’ – I dismounted to gaze back.

In the centre of Naples some 70,000 families live even now in cramped bassi ? tenements without baths or running water, sometimes without even a window, with up to fifteen members of an extended family living together in a single room. The worst of these districts, the Vicaria, where I was now, is said to have the highest population density in Europe, possibly in the world now that the Forbidden City in Hong Kong is being demolished. And it has crime to match ? especially the pettier crimes like car theft (29,000 in one year) and muggings. Yet I felt safe enough. No one paid any attention to me, except occasionally to give me a stray smile or, among the younger people, to shout some smart-ass but not especially hostile wisecrack. I was clearly a tourist with my rucksack, and I confess I clutched the straps tightly, but there was no sign of the scippatori, the famous bag snatchers on Vespas, who doubtless sensed that all they would get was some dirty underpants, half a bar of chocolate and a tattered copy of H.

Because most of the patients had been resident at the sanitorium for years and often decades, no matter how addled their thoughts or hesitant their gait, no matter how much they mumbled and muttered, adopted sudden postures of submission, or demonstrated any of a hundred other indications of someone comfortably out to lunch, most of them could be trusted to wander down to the village and find their way back again. Each day you could count on finding a refreshing sprinkling of lunatics buying fags or sweets, having a cup of tea, or just quietly remonstrating with thin air. The result was one of the most extraordinary communities in England, one in which wealthy people and lunatics mingled on equal terms. The shopkeepers and locals were quite wonderful about it, and didn’t act as if anything was odd because a man with wild hair wearing a pajama jacket was standing in a corner of the baker’s declaiming to a spot on the wall, or sitting at a corner table of the Tudor Rose with swiveling eyes and the makings of a smile, dropping sugar cubes into his minestrone soup. It was, and I’m still serious, a thoroughly heartwarming sight.",

    "target_paragraph": "Sihuas – sandwiched between high mountains on the banks of its Rio – is our biggest town by far since Huamachuco. It is devastatingly earthquake-ravaged; thousands were killed in the 1970 disaster and much of the older part of the town has now been abandoned. People feel safer on higher ground away from the river. (Nobody seems to know exactly how many were killed; in nearby Yungay, the death toll was over 20,000.) Our hotel was partially rebuilt after the ‘quake; it’s an oddly unwelcoming place, where we sense covert hostility. The restaurant is a long, highceilinged, mud-floored, crudely built structure with wide unglazed windows, a tin roof and rows of tiny tin tables and chairs. We were so hungry we ate two suppers; a) excellent potato and mutton soup, followed by boiled potatoes with chilli sauce and scraps of roast guinea-pig; b) chips with fried egg and chopped goat-meat. It was raining hard as we ate, sitting in a freezing draught between gaping windows. ‘We’d be better off in our tent’, observed Rachel, ‘except for the food.’ But Sihuas offers an abundance of Alf and Juana is now happily corralled, with four tethered ponies, in the back-yard. Happy the region where hotels need corrals, not car-parks!",

The shopgirls were looking like Marilyn Miller. College boys said Marilyn Miller where they had said Rosie Quinn. Moving picture actresses were famous. Paul Whiteman played the significance of amusement on his violin. They were having the bread line at the Ritz that year. Everybody was there. People met people they knew in hotel lobbies smelling of orchids and plush and detective stories, and asked each other where they’d been since last time. Charlie Chaplin wore a yellow polo coat. People were tired of the proletariat—everybody was famous. All the other people who weren’t well known had been killed in the war; there wasn’t much interest in private lives.",

This was an age that didn’t like practical concerns to get in the way of its musings. A writer in the popular Science and Invention magazine confidently forecast that people of all ages would soon be traveling?and briskly?on motorized roller skates, while Harvey W. Corbett, a prominent architect, predicted that skyscrapers would rise hundreds of stories into the clouds and that people living on the upper levels would get their meals by radio, without explaining exactly how he imagined that would work. Rodman Wanamaker, the department store magnate and financier of Richard Byrd’s flight, sponsored an exhibition in New York called the Titan City, which depicted a future world in which magnificent urban towers were connected by sleek aerial expressways while citizens were shot through glass tubes in pneumatic trains or glided regally from place to place on moving sidewalks. Whatever the future held, everyone agreed that it would be technologically advanced, American-led, and thrilling.",

The district looks much like Victorian London and fin de siècle Paris, which, given its heritage, was unsurprising. The land that would become Garden City abuts the Nile, and the neighboring sand dunes and swampland attracted few residents until the nineteenth century. Cairo was then a much smaller city centered a mile to the east, around the old Citadel, but the city was growing and modernizing. In 1905, the Nile Land & Agricultural Company, which owned much of the riverfront property, hired José Lamba, an Italian engineer and architect, to design a new residential and commercial district. Lamba filled the neighborhood with villas and gardens and squares and circles and all those things that would appeal to the European investors who would soon occupy Garden City. Our guidebook recommended a tour of the neighborhood, but we couldn’t get across the road. Cars and trucks and buses chased each other along the Corniche, bumper-to-bumper, at about ten miles an hour. Traffic moved just fast enough that we never found safe crossing. Teresa huffed and pouted, but there was nothing we could do. Defeated, we turned our backs on Garden City and marched on to Rhoda.",

En route, my brother pointed out the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor at Harrisburg, where a few years before some careless employees had very nearly irradiated the whole of the eastern seaboard, and then forty-five miles further on we passed the Peach Bottom nuclear power station, where seventeen employees had recently been dismissed after it had been revealed that they spent their working hours sleeping, taking drugs, having rubber band fights and playing video games. At some times every person in the plant was dozing, according to investigators. Allowing state utilities in Pennsylvania to run nuclear power stations is a bit like letting Prince Philip fly through London airspace. In any case, I made a mental note to bring an anti-radiation suit with me next time I came to Pennsylvania.",

Their voices provided the harmony, either leading, following, or arguing with the percussion. This was classic Cuban rumba—not the “rhumba” of Fred Astaire or the “son” of the Buena Vista Social Club, but the rumba born in slavery and raised on the streets of poor black neighborhoods by musicians possessing little more than a cardboard box, a bottle, and a stick. The kind that derives from the verb rumbear, which means to party and have a good time. The kind traceable to the religious and ceremonial dances of Africa. The kind that did to the soul what Salvador’s murals did to the mind.",

And she saw herself later, a kind of slavey at her mother’s boarding-house in St Louis during the World’s Fair, drudging from morn to night, a grain of human dust, an atom thrust by chance into the great roar of a distant city, or on an expedition as blind, capricious, and fatally mistaken as all life. Later, she saw herself as a girl in high school, she remembered her dreams and hopes, the pitiably mistaken innocence of her vision of the world; her grand ambitions to ‘study music’, to follow a ‘career in grand opera’; later still, a girl of eighteen or twenty, amorous of life, thirsting for the great cities and voyages of the world, playing popular songs of the period – ‘Love Me and the World Is Mine’, ‘I Wonder Who’s Kissing Her Now’, ‘Till the Sands of the Desert Grow Cold’, and so on – for her father, as he sat, on summer evenings, on his porch; a little later, ‘touring’ the little cities of the South, singing and playing the popular ‘rhythm’ and sentimental ballads of the period in vaudeville and moving-picture houses. She remembered how she had once been invited to a week-end house party with a dozen other young men and women of her acquaintance, and of how she had been afraid to go, and how desperately ashamed she was when she had ‘to go in swimming’ with the others, and to ‘show her figure’, her long skinny legs, even when they were concealed by the clumsy bathing dress and the black stockings of the period. She remembered her marriage then, the first years of her life with Barton, her tragic failure to have children, and the long horror of Gant’s last years of sickness – the years of sombre waiting, the everimpending terror of his death.",

You must know that everybody connected in any way with the sea was there, because the affair had been notorious for days, ever since that mysterious cable message came from Aden to start us all cackling. I say mysterious, because it was so in a sense though it contained a naked fact, about as naked and ugly as a fact can well be. The whole waterside talked of nothing else. First thing in the morning as I was dressing in my state-room, I would hear through the bulkhead my Parsee Dubash jabbering about the Patna with the steward, while he drank a cup of tea, by favour, in the pantry. No sooner on shore I would meet some acquaintance, and the first remark would be, “Did you ever hear of anything to beat this?” and according to his kind the man would smile cynically, or look sad, or let out a swear or two. Complete strangers would accost each other familiarly, just for the sake of easing their minds on the subject: every confounded loafer in the town came in for a harvest of drinks over this affair: you heard of it in the harbour office, at every ship-broker’s, at your agent’s, from whites, from natives, from half-castes, from the very boatmen squatting half naked on the stone steps as you went up — by Jove! There was some indignation, not a few jokes, and no end of discussions as to what had become of them, you know. This went on for a couple of weeks or more, and the opinion that whatever was mysterious in this affair would turn out to be tragic as well, began to prevail, when one fine morning, as I was standing in the shade by the steps of the harbour office, I perceived four men walking towards me along the quay. I wondered for a while where that queer lot had sprung from, and suddenly, I may say, I shouted to myself, “Here they are!”",

Generally sometime after 1 A.M., when a significant portion of the braying throngs had been beaten back or dragged off to jail or had just gotten cold and hungry and gone home, the gates would be thrown open and a great fleet of News International trucks would roar down a ramp and out onto the Highway, where they would be met by a barrage of bricks and crush barriers from whatever was left of the mob. The rest of us, meanwhile, were instructed to make haste in convoy through the back lanes of Wapping and to disperse when we were a safe distance from the plant.",

The stones have not been worked since Captain Cook's day; yet there is not a weather-stain upon them, and the air is so dry and rarified that meat will keep fresh for three months.

As with so many things, characteristics of dances and practices vary from village to village. Pendet is usually danced by a group of women — sometimes even elderly, gray-haired women. Anyone who wishes may join, and occasionally one sees a man participating in this stylized welcome to the visiting spirits. Dancers wear ordinary traditional clothes, and each carries an offering in his or her right hand. The dance is quite technically demanding, but almost every little girl in Bali learns the rudiments of pendet in school or from an older sibling. A gong always accompanies the dance, and any dancer can perform with any gong, since the movements are very controlled. In the last round of the dance, the offering may be replaced with a stick of incense.",

Even though the Beach Boys’ “Surfin’ USA” (“Let’s go surfin’ now, everybody’s learnin’ how”) was on the radio, I was the only kid at my backwater school who had a board. We spent most weekends in Ventura, so I got in the water regularly, but California Street was rocky and the water was painfully cold. I got a wetsuit, but it had short legs and no sleeves, and neoprene technology was still in its infancy. At best, the little wetsuit took some of the sharpest chill off the afternoon wind. My father liked to tell a story about a day when I got discouraged. From the warmth of the car, he had been watching me flounder—I imagine him smoking his pipe, wearing a big fluffy fisherman’s sweater. I came in, my feet and knees bleeding, stumbling across the rocks, dropping my board, humiliated and exhausted. He told me to go back out and catch three more waves. I refused. He insisted. I could ride them on my knees if necessary, he said. I was furious. But I went back out and caught the waves, and in his version of the story, that was when I became a surfer. If he hadn’t made me go back out that day, I would have quit. He was sure of that.",

He watched it for some time and without alarm, wanton and random and indecisive before it finally developed, concentrated, drooping in narrow unperpendicular bands in two or three different places at one time, about the horizon, like gauzy umbilical loops from the bellied cumulae, the sun-belled ewes of summer grazing up the wind from the south-west. It was as if the rain were actually seeking the two of them, hunting them out where they stood amid the shade, finding them finally in a bright intransigeant fury. The pine-snoring wind dropped, then gathered; in an anti-climax of complete vacuum the shaggy pelt of earth became overblown like that of a receptive mare for the rampant crash, the furious brief fecundation which, still rampant, seeded itself in flash and glare of noise and fury and then was gone, vanished; then the actual rain, from a sky already breaking as if of its own rich over-fertile weight, running in a wild lateral turmoil among the unrecovered leaves, not in drops but in needles of fiery ice which seemed to be not trying to fall but, immune to gravity, earthless, were merely trying to keep pace with the windy uproar which had begotten and foaled them, striking in thin brittle strokes through his hair and shirt and against his lifted face, each brief lance already filled with the glittering promise of its imminent cessation like the brief bright saltless tears of a young girl over a lost flower; then gone too, fled north and eastward beyond the chromatic arch of its own insubstantial armistice, leaving behind it the spent confetti of its carnival to gather and drip leaf by leaf and twig by twig then blade by blade of grass, to gather in murmurous runnels, releasing in mirrored repetition the sky which, glint by glint of fallen gold and blue, the falling drops had prisoned.",

Nearly all the heads in Australian bars are frothy, and tattooed bikers down 3.3-pint “stubbies” of Foster’s in dusty outposts like the Humpty Doo Bar, where a bulletin board advertises pigs and a sign warns customers tersely, “Don’t Ask for Credit as Refusal Often Offends.” Australian entertainment, in fact, is nothing if not straightforward: a slim tourist brochure in Melbourne includes twenty-two full ads for escort agencies.",

No signs of life and the road was empty, with not even a cliched rolling tumbleweed to keep us company. We'd been driving for nearly an hour and had only seen two cars. We'd passed a small settlement at Terlingua crossroads about six miles back, and I knew Lajitas was around the same distance ahead. A few hundred yards down the road, I spotted something looking out of place in the desert landscape. It seemed man-made. A sign! I walked towards the structure, squinting into the punishing Texan sun. It was a brown, wooden sign with yellow writing. Gas station ahead? Hotel? I wondered.",

And to his sick and desperate soul the cry of the great train now came with a sterner and more desperate hope than he had ever known as a boy. Suddenly he knew that now there was one road, and only one before him – flight from this defeat and failure which his life had come to, redemption by stern labour and grim loneliness, the stern challenge, the sharp peril and the grand reward – the magic and undying image of the city. And suddenly he knew that he would go.",

Suddenly the roads would be empty and the air clean. There was no dust, no heat: all was shaded, green and cool. Ahead, at the end of the avenue, rose the great chattri which once held the statue of George V. Arriving there at the end of the green tunnel, I would turn a right angle and see the cinnamon sky stretching out ahead, no longer veiled by a burqa of buildings or trees.
