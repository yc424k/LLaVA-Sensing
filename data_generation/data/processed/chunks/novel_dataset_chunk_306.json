Their guide kept easily ahead, weaving through thick stands of larch and birch. Bartlett could hardly believe the cold. Even in his new fur-lined reindeer mittens, his hands hurt with cold, and he had to constantly clap them together and pound them against his thighs to maintain blood flow and keep them from freezing, He reckoned it about −60ºF, and he felt colder than he ever had in his life, even when he’d been near the North Pole.* He was relieved when, that afternoon, they came to a yaranga where they stopped and were warmed with tea.",

    "target_paragraph": "BALANCING ONE DAUGHTER ON HER slim hip, Ghadah was scrambling eggs for my breakfast. I felt nurtured, a feeling I realized I had been missing for a very long time. She had invited me over for brunch at her villa, which was just adjacent to my apartment. Post-call from the ICU with the whole day ahead of me, I had dragged myself over. Being in her kitchen was soothing. Ignoring my sleep deprivation, I was already glad to have come. I soon forgot I was sleepy.\n“I want to make you something nutritious, Qanta. You seem to be losing weight! And you know as a dietician I like my guests to eat well!” Ghadah chortled at herself while she handed her child to her Filipina nanny and busied herself chopping spring onions and tomatoes to add to my omelet. I was growing hungrier by the minute.\nThough Ghadah was several years younger than I, she was evidently the consummate mother. She had been married for more than a decade, from the tender age of nineteen, was already mother to two young daughters, and now pregnant with a third child. She was lush in her beauty, a dead ringer for Jackie Onassis, with the same wide-set, beguiling eyes and long, curved brows that were the envy of every woman who knew her.\nHer hair was casually cut into medium length which tumbled onto her wide, sculpted shoulders rising out of a boat-necked Pucci shirt. The tunic stylishly encased her growing belly. As she heated the pan and melted some butter, I noticed how relaxed Ghadah was within herself. Her comfortable, faded jeans outlined long, athletic legs perfectly, lean and muscular, even in advanced pregnancy. On her feet she wore platform slides in white patent leather revealing a chipped, purple pedicure. There was something warm and casual about Ghadah. Though astonishingly gorgeous, Ghadah would never be a prisoner to her beauty; even with hair displaced by the grasping toddler in her arms, a trace of flour smudged over her button nose, and her fractured nail polish, Ghadah was one hot mamma.\n“Would you like toast, Qanta? And do you prefer coffee or tea? Tell me, I want to make you your favorite breakfast!” She was beaming, her lipstick (a pale sixties' pink applied too thickly) highlighted her crooked, rather uneven teeth, which nevertheless still dazzled in her fabulous smile. I was enchanted by Ghadah. Her beauty was so powerful I was constantly distracted. She looked at me for a moment waiting to hear my preference.\n“Toast, Ghadah, and coffee. That would be wonderful.”",

Yet he described himself as a novice farmer, brought up in Pretoria. His father, a heart surgeon, never showed any interest in farming though the family had been settled on these 30,000 hectares since the 1870s. Willem moved here three years ago and relishes every aspect of his new life; he hopes his city-bred wife will soon come to do likewise. Their first child, a son, has just been born in Pretoria and will in due course inherit the farm, or so Willem plans. It seems he doesn’t feel threatened by the new South Africa’s land-redistribution policy.",

There is no compelling reason, for example, why tourists need to drive their automobiles to the very brink of the Grand Canyon’s south rim. They could walk that last mile. Better yet, the Park Service should build an enormous parking lot about ten miles south of Grand Canyon Village and another east of Desert View. At those points, as at Yosemite, our people could emerge from their steaming shells of steel and glass and climb upon horses or bicycles for the final leg of the journey. On the rim, as at present, the hotels and restaurants will remain to serve the physical needs of the park visitors. Trips along the rim would also be made on foot, on horseback, or – utilizing the paved road which already exists – on bicycles. For those willing to go all the way from one parking lot to the other, a distance of some sixty or seventy miles, we might provide bus service back to their cars, a service which would at the same time effect a convenient exchange of bicycles and/or horses between the two terminals.",

Many trees had been flattened, with the slow pressing down that big wind effects on forests: the trees supporting each other in their mutual falls, their canopies tangled, their limbs interlocked. On North Rona, in the Western Isles, the gusts reached 124 miles per hour: quick enough to peel iron from the roofs of barns and sheds, to pick up people and livestock.

He said he worked on oil platforms and also gathered shellfish off the coast of Sakhalin Island, to which he was returning. He was wiry haired and ruddy and he wore a vest of black leather. With other people and by himself, he drank vodka night and day. Our first morning in the vagon, after I’d slept pretty well on the front seat of the van complicatedly propped between the door and the steering wheel, I sat up and rubbed my eyes. The scuba diver woke at the exact same moment and got out of his vehicle rubbing his eyes. He saw me, broke into a huge grin, and made the do-you-want-a-shot-of-vodka? gesture, tapping his throat below the jaw with a flip of his fingers. From his car he pulled a half-full bottle of vodka to show me. I shook my head politely; it was about eight in the morning.",

The global information networks which have been established during the past century – the internet foremost among them – mean that almost nothing remains unrepresented in some medium or other. At the click of a mouse we can summon up images, verbal or visual, of almost anything we wish for. There seems barely any room left for the unknown or the original. So we, like the Victorians before us, have taken steps to relocate the unknown. We have displaced our concept of it upwards and outwards, on to space – that notoriously final frontier – and inwards and downwards, to the innermost chambers of atom and gene, or the recesses of the human psyche: what George Eliot called ‘the unmapped country within us’.",

    "target_paragraph": "Fort Jefferson from the harbor\nI spent four days at Fort Jefferson, anchored about 200 yards from shore. I would paddle my board to shore twice daily and walk around the fort, check the weather forecast on the computer in the gift shop, and talk to whoever I ran into.\nThe fort covers almost the entire island, which is within a National Park. Park rangers stay on the island, but nobody lives here full-time, and there are no services available. The gift shop is the only store. Anyone visiting the island must bring all of their own supplies, including food, fuel, and water.\nOne of the highlights of my stay here was being served dinner aboard a Coast Guard ship which was tied off to the same dock that I didn’t want to use earlier.\nOn the bridge that led over the moat surrounding the fort I struck up a conversation with Chris, captain of the Coast Gard cutter Diamondback, and he invited me to join him for dinner on the Coast Guard ship. The hot meal was a fantastic and unexpected treat: shrimp, pasta with white sauce, greens, garlic toast, tomato and mozzarella, a Pepsi, and even an ice-cream bar for desert – all while seated at a proper table. Diamondback is an 87ft coastal patrol boat with a 12-person crew whose missions include search and rescue, maritime law enforcement, marine environmental protection, defense readiness, and port, waterway and coastal security.\nChris told me all about his duties as a Coast Guard Captain, most of which included looking for and picking up Cuban refugees in the Florida Straits. Apparently “wet-foot-dry-foot” is over, and he thinks now there will be less refugees trying to get to the USA from Cuba. However, Chris warned me to be on the lookout for refugees and to contact the Coast guard if I saw any. He said sometimes they were desperate and could be hostile. This is something that had never crossed my mind. Chris also confirmed what I had assumed from the weather forecasts – that the conditions in the Florida Straits were not favorable to small craft at the moment. He said the seas were 10-feet and that he had come here to give his crew a break, as some of them were seasick. The winds were blowing 20-25 knots from the east, counter to the Gulf-Stream current, and wind blowing counter to a current creates steep and menacing waves. I was happy to be safely at anchor. Every day I was there the wind blew hard across the small island and howled in Sobrius’ rigging, reminding me that I shouldn’t be out there sailing until the weather calmed down.",

Though feeling a certain distaste for the hatch cover mattress, I was thrilled by the beauty, the silence, the great sense of space, and excitement: we were in the real war zone, who knew what might not happen. Then the rain started and I cowered beneath my umbrella and it was surprisingly cold. The night took on the most unpleasant quality of nights which is to be long.

In half an hour the winding pathway from the foot of St Barlaam led us down to a shallow saddle, then up a steep hill opposite and under some plane trees to the foot of the Transfiguration. Three-quarters of the way up the rock of the monastery’s pedestal, the cliff curves slightly backwards from the perpendicular and a narrow bastion of masonry, growing in thickness as the mountainside recedes, climbs for a hundred feet so that its platform may overhang the pathway in a clear drop. The rotting remains of a ladder, jointed every few yards, hung from a hole under the jut of the monastery. Before the steps were cut, this precarious approach was an alternative to the net-ascent. It was withdrawn at nightfall up a channel of rock, and the foundation remained as immune as St Barlaam from the outside world. From below it looked just as forbidding and inaccessible. A flight of steps and a little doorway at the base now lead through a narrow cavern cut through the rock to the beginning of the stairs. They finally brought us, out of breath and with thumping hearts, into the entrance to the monastery—a vast arched and dusty place. It was traversed by mote-speckled sunbeams that fell on old windlasses and baskets and piles of winter firewood. Through the rickety floorboards, vertiginous vistas dropped to the dim vegetation that still flourished on the unhewn rock face enclosed by the tower’s three projecting walls. A slanting lane led away, through great pillars and high semicircular arches, over changing levels of flagstone and cobble into what might have been the purlieu of a town of immense age mysteriously poised here above the level of the clouds. But the narrow thoroughfares—except on one side, where the Platylithos, or the ‘Broad Rock’ of the monastic charters, swelled into a small hill—advanced into the sky. The monastery buildings, in spite of the four churches they contain, were crammed into a compass smaller than a village green.",

Hobnails grated, mugs clashed and the combined smell of beer and bodies and old clothes and farmyards sprang at the newcomer. I squeezed in at a table full of peasants, and was soon lifting one of those masskrugs to my lips. It was heavier than a brace of iron dumb-bells, but the blond beer inside was cool and marvellous, a brooding, cylindrical litre of Teutonic myth. This was the fuel that had turned the berserk feeders upstairs into Zeppelins and floated them so far from heart’s desire. The gunmetal-coloured cylinders were stamped with a blue HB conjoined under the Bavarian crown, like the foundry-mark on cannon. The tables, in my mind’s eye, were becoming batteries where each gunner served a silent and recoil-less piece of ordnance which, trained on himself, pounded away in steady siege. Mass-gunfire! Here and there on the tables, with their heads in puddles of beer, isolated bombardiers had been mown down in their emplacements. The vaults reverberated with the thunder of a creeping barrage. There must have been over a thousand pieces engaged! – Big Berthas, Krupp’s pale brood, battery on battery crashing at random or in salvoes as hands adjusted the elevation and traverse and then tightened on the stone trigger-guard. Supported by comrades, the walking wounded reeled through the battle smoke and a fresh gunner leaped into each place as it fell empty.",

No—it was useless to try to make Kitty understand; and foolish to risk her husband’s displeasure by staying in this icy room for such a purpose. She wrapped herself in sweetness as in her sables. “It’s something much more serious than that cinema nonsense. But I’m going to leave it to Dexter to explain. He will do it ever so much better than I could . . . Yes, Kitty dear, I remember there’s a step missing in the vestibule. Please don’t bother to see me out—you know Dexter’s minutes are precious.” She thrust Mrs. Landish softly back into the room, and made her way unattended across the hall. As she did so, the living-room door, the lock of which had responded reluctantly to her handling, swung open again, and she heard Manford ask, in his dry cross-examining voice: “Will you please tell me exactly when and for how long Lita was at Dawnside, Mrs. Landish?”",

In a lush paddock a dozen sleek ponies were grazing and their adjacent field of Alf tantalised us because we could find no one with whom to trade. Here we were back on the carretera and soon we came upon one of this region’s few dwellings, an adobe roadside shack with a shaggy cactus thatch. Outside it stood three young women – two of them looked half-witted – and a small boy with open sores all over his face and a minute skinny pup in his arms. As we approached everyone bolted into the casa and the door was slammed. I knocked and pleaded desperately for Alf, but the only response was a scuffling movement just inside the unglazed iron-barred window.",

A skinny little shepherd stared at me with mingled apprehension and hostility. On the motor road far above I counted 44 parked coaches; their contents were panting around the Mount of Olives which may fairly be described as a Biblical theme park. Higher still, a vast Jewish cemetery, dating from the first millennium BC, is too well protected to be vandalised. It had recently been made neat (Americanised) and the new road around its edges – of course closed to Palestinians – benefited nearby illegal settlements.",

Newspaper reporters were awaiting word of a victor in the Scott-versus-Amundsen race to the pole and had spent months whetting the public’s appetite for adventure stories. Bingham had cleverly churned the waters with the interviews he’d given prior to departing, promising lost cities. He had also telegraphed news of the Coropuna triumph at the first possible moment. His peers in the Royal Geographical Society received a sneak preview of his discoveries, with photographs, which Clements Markham published in the society’s December Geographical Journal, along with the encouraging comment, “I trust that [this] is the forerunner of a fuller topographical description of the Vilcabamba region.”",

He walked into Robert’s room without knocking: the room was a wreck, a negro maid was mournfully and sullenly gathering up from the floor the charred and blackened remnants of a pile of bed-linen and blankets; the mirror had been smashed by a drinking-glass which Robert had hurled at it, he said, when he saw his image reflected in it, the remnants of a chair lay on the floor, the heavy glass plate upon a writing table had been broken, there was a large brownish stain upon one of the walls where he had hurled a whisky bottle, and one end of his bed lay tilted on the floor were he had stamped or kicked the slats and boards to splinters. Robert was standing in the midst of all the ruin he had made, with a nervous and rueful expression on his face: when his friend came in he looked at him uneasily and laughed in a feeble and foolish manner, without conviction.",

The rain had ceased, cool breezes rustled through the palm-groves and sighed through the funereal foliage of the pandanus. Under thick canopies of the glossy breadfruit and banana, groups of natives were twining garlands of roses and ohia blossoms. The lights of happy foreign homes flashed from under verandahs festooned with passion-flowers, and the low chant, to me nearly intolerable, but which the natives love, mingled with the ceaseless moaning of the surf and the sighing of the breeze through the trees, and a heavy fragrance, unlike the faint, sweet odours of the north, filled the evening air.
