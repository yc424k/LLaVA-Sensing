Mrs Marders was among the group of Belle’s more intimate familiars in this room, affable and brightly cold, a little detached and volubly easy; she admired little Belle’s gifts one by one with impeccable patience. Belle’s voice came from the adjoining room where the piano was bowered for the occasion by potted palms and banked pots and jars of bloom, and where yet more ladies were sibilantly crescendic with an occasional soberly clad male on the outer fringe of their colorful chattering like rocks dumbly imponderable about the cauldron where seethed an hysterical tideflux. These men spoke to one another from the sides of their mouths and, when addressed by the ladies, with bleak and swift affability, from the teeth outward. Harry’s bald bullet head moved among his guests, borne hither and yon upon the harsh uproar of his voice; presently, when the recital would have gotten underway and the ladies engaged, he would begin to lead the men one by one and on tiptoe from the room and up the back stairs to his apartments.",

He was debating whether to turn back when he ran into a shepherd who told him of a pass next to Mount Ruskin through which he could reach the South Fork of the Kings. Elated at not having to backtrack, Brown dragged poor Jack up the slope. Leaving him at the pass, he made a harrowing ascent of Mount Ruskin, making more sketches from the summit. He recorded some twenty-six sparkling lakes and named Split Mountain. Then he descended with Jack to the South Fork of the Kings.”",

But you have this advantage over us: yours will remain inviolate without your having to shut your eyes to its goings-on. You don’t have to make any effort to keep yours from being otherwise. Very satisfactory. And very unusual. The greatest part of man’s immolation of virginity is, I think, composed of an alarm and a suspicion that some one else may be, as the term is, getting it.”",

It was often blocked and frequently left me abandoned, helpless, in the jungle. The little streams were brimming over and difficult to cross. Scaling the walls of the wadis and climbing steep hills was treacherous. My shoes were caked with mud, and I slipped often. I was exhausted. I leaned heavily on my walking stick. I was weak and famished but afraid to take another amphetamine. Fate mocked me: I came upon a fruit tree whose inaccessible branches were laden with manzanas de monte. The rain and wind had knocked a few of them down into the mud. I picked out and ate the best of them. Most already had fat worms crawling through them. If only I could climb the tree or chop it down, I would have enough food for two days.",

The burgeoning middle class have built some fine new bungalows – even a few two-storey ‘villas’ – and many of these have lavatory bowls propped outside the front door, awaiting the arrival of piped water, as promised by GNU. But the majority occupy mud-brick shacks or flimsy hovels, the latter known as ‘informal housing’ in bureaucratese. Several outwardly imposing schools dwarf all other buildings. The abundance of litter must be deeply demoralizing – or do township residents accept it, as city dwellers everywhere accept air pollution?",

The local papers are full of shinty game reports, inevitably with one or more photos of a player whose head is covered in blood, getting patched up to re-join the fray. What is so hilarious about the kids is that, as you would find in any small town, they come in a wide range of ages, eleven down to two. There is a long line of them that their coach sends off to run in a circle. Watching the determination of the youngest ones to keep up with the older ones is fascinating, as is the two year old who would rather be with his Da, to whom he keeps running back every time the circle loops back in that vicinity. Also fun is watching the circle slowly implode until there are fourteen kids running around their coach with a circle radius of three metres. The best entertainment of the day. Nice to know kids everywhere are the same.",

They remained imprisoned by ice, trapped within an old floe over a mile wide, but the current was taking them backward over those hard-gained miles. Initially, they were moving just a mile an hour, but when strong winds started blowing from the east, they moved even faster. Bartlett climbed up to the barrel, and his pulse quickened for a moment. He spied “water sky” not far to the east—light glinting off the ocean, confirming open water there. And to the south, between them and the land, lay dark slicks of ice-free sea. Yet there was no way to get there, icebound as they were. He contemplated the distance from the ship to the edge of the floe, and thought of using dynamite to blow lanes ahead of the bow so they might move. He well knew the story of the tragic Greely expedition (1881–84), and how naval commander Winfield Schley had used dynamite to free the rescue ships Thetis and Bear in a heroic last-ditch effort to save Greely’s starving men. But after doing some calculations, Bartlett figured that they’d use all their dynamite to gain even a quarter mile through this ice, so he decided against it.",

Dan, in his clean white shirt sleeves, crouched on Ned's milking stool, his head pressed to the cow's curly red and white flank. His fingers worked rhythmically down the teat and the milk squirted and hissed and pinged against the pail. Sometimes the cow swung round her white face and looked at Dan, sometimes she lashed him gently with her tail. Ned leaned against the stall post and watched.\n\"Thot's t' road, thot's t' road. Yo're the foorst straanger she a' let milk 'er. She's a narvous cow. 'Er teats is tander.\"\nWhen the milking was done Dan put on his well-fitting coat and they went home over Karva to the schoolhouse lane.\nDan loved the things that Roddy hated: the crying of the peewits, the bleating of the sheep, the shouts of the village children when they saw him and came running to his coat pockets for sweets. He liked to tramp over the moors with the shepherds; he helped them with the dipping and shearing and the lambing.\n\"Dan, you ought to be a farmer.\"\n\"I know,\" he said, \"that's why they stuck me in an office.\"",

Although I had observed that all countries freight their cultures down there, the harsh conditions limit their application. Antarctica is a leveller; they’re all in it together. The Pole’s Spanish was ropey, and I asked him how he communicated with his colleagues at the other bases. He laughed and said in Spanish, ‘We speak antártico.

Then the hymn began to wind down, until just the boy was singing in his soft, high voice accompanied only by the barest of bass drones from the harmonium. The singing stopped. There was a fraction of a second of complete silence. Then with a great battering of tablas, the singers built up to the final verse.

I split open my right middle finger while working on a retaining wall nine miles in the backcountry. The rock hammer lay just out of reach, so I used a small rock to pound in a larger wedge, and wham. Three miles above the cabin, it was nearly quitting time anyway, so I didn’t have to suck it up and finish the day. Cassie packed a bandana with snow from a nearby drift and I held the finger above my head, wrapped tight, blood running down my arm. Good thing the hike was downhill, because I was unsteady on my feet, my face pale and clammy. Hikers parted for me and turned to watch as I stumbled down, trailing bloody splotches on the rocks behind me. Outside the cabin, I retched. Inside, humming nonsense to keep from screaming, I cleaned the pulp of skin and flesh in a bowl of warm water, then splinted it, took four Advil with chocolate milk for the throbbing, and passed out on my bunk. The next morning the grape had swelled to an unripe plum, the kind you pick from a backyard tree, skin taut, and I could feel my pulse in it for the rest of the hitch. I cut the middle finger out of my glove for the bandaged digit; my grip on the rock hammer was loose and awkward. It hurt longer than I’d have guessed it would, the nail obliterated, sore to the touch for months, and years down the road still prone to frost nip.",

Every movement I made provoked a brilliant swirl, and everywhere it lapped against a floating body it was struck into colour, so that the few boats moored in the bay were outlined with luminescence, gleaming off their wet sloped sides. Glancing back, the cove, the cliffs and the caves all appeared trimmed with light. I found that I could fling long streaks of fire from my fingertips, sorcerer-style, so I stood in the shallows for a few happy minutes, pretending to be Merlin, dispensing magic to right and left.",

Soon the evening star would be there above the poplar tip, perplexing it, immaculate and ineffable, and the poplar was vain as a girl darkly in an arrested passionate ecstasy. Half of the moon was a coin broken palely near the zenith and at the end of the lawn the first fireflies were like lazily blown sparks from cool fires.

In the faded hotel, full, one felt, of memories of the Raj, there was a foreshadowing of the caste system. The old French waiter only served; he had his runners, sad-eyed silent Negroes in fezzes and cummerbunds, who fetched and cleared away. In the lobby there were innumerable Negro pages, picturesquely attired. And in the streets there was the East one had expected: the children, the dirt, the disease, the undernourishment, the cries of bakshish, the hawkers, the touts, the glimpses of minarets. There were the reminders of imperialisms that had withdrawn in the dark, glass-cased European-style shops, wilting for lack of patronage; in the sad whispering of the French hairdresser that French perfumes could no longer be obtained and that one had to make do with heavy Egyptian scents; in the disparaging references of the Lebanese businessman to ‘natives’, all of whom he distrusted except for his assistant, who, quietly to me, spoke of the day when all the Lebanese and Europeans would be driven out of the country.",
