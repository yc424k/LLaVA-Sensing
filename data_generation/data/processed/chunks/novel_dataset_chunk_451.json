At a hole in a rotten weir they executed a recitative; where a tributary brook fell over a stone breastwork they trilled cheerily; under an arch they performed a metallic cymballing; and at Durnover Hole they hissed. The spot at which their instrumentation rose loudest was a place called Ten Hatches, whence during high springs there proceeded a very fugue of sounds.",

Tess would fain not have conversed with Marian of the man who was legally, if not obviously, her husband; but the irresistible fascination of the subject betrayed her into reciprocating Marian’s remarks. And thus, as has been said, though the damp curtains of their bonnets flapped smartly into their faces, and their wrappers clung about them to wearisomeness, they lived all this afternoon in memories of green, sunny, romantic Talbothays.",

    "target_paragraph": "His predecessors, intent only upon their pleasures, had given no thought to the possibility of a hostile invasion of their fair domain. But the Good Duke, despite his popularity, was frequently heard to quote with approval that wise old adage which runs \"In peace, prepare for war.\" Convinced of the instability of all mundane affairs and being, moreover, a man of original notions as well as something of an artist in costumery, he was led to create that picturesque body of men, the local Militia, which survives to this day and would alone entitle him to the grateful notice of posterity. These elegant warriors, he calculated, would serve both for the purpose of infusing terror into the minds of potential enemies, and of acting as a decorative body-guard to enhance his own public appearances on gala days. He threw his whole soul into the enterprise. After the corps had been duly established, he amused himself by drilling them on Sunday afternoons and modelling new buttons for their uniforms; to give them the requisite military stamina he over-fed and starved them by turns, wrapped them in sheepskin overcoats for long route-marches in July, exercised them in sham fights with live grapeshot and unblunted stilettos and otherwise thinned their ranks of undesirables, and hardened their physique, by forcing them to escalade horrible precipices at midnight on horseback. He was a martinet; he knew it; he gloried on the distinction. \"All the world loves a disciplinarian,\" he was wont to say.",

I thought about a time in my teens when Dad’s talent for terrifying the shit out of people grew stronger, after he discovered the omnipotence of Photoshop. On the wall outside my bedroom were three framed oil paintings of women, all prints of classic portraits that had hung there for as long as I could remember. One day, while walking into my room, I noticed something in my peripheral vision. One of the portraits seemed different. When I turned to look, I noticed one of the women had fangs! This wasn’t a movie; this was real life, and I must’ve cleared at least two feet of air before running teary-eyed and breathless to my dad, crying, “Something’s wrong with the painting!” He chuckled with satisfaction as he explained how he’d taken the picture down; removed it from the frame; scanned it; Photoshopped in fangs, curled lips, and evil eyes; reframed and rehung it; and then—perhaps most masterly of all—stayed silent for months until somebody noticed his prank. It was all meant in good fun; Dad just didn’t quite grasp where entertainment ended and trauma began.",

And in the great and noble region where I come from –’ the note of weary bitterness in his tone grew deeper – ‘out where the tall caw-r-n grows we have Keokuk and Cairo and Peoria.’ He paused, his grave eyes fixed in a serious and reflective stare: for a moment his pleasant ruddy face was contorted by the old bestial grimace of anguish and confusion. When he spoke again, his voice was weary with a quiet bitterness of scorn. ‘I was born,’ he said, ‘in the great and noble town of Bloomington, but –’ the note of savage irony deepened – ‘at a very tender age I was taken to Moline. And now, thank God, I am in Paris’; he was silent a moment longer, and then continued in a quiet and almost lifeless tone: ‘Paris, Dijon, Provence, Arles … Yancey, Brant’s Mill, Bloomington.’ He turned his quiet eyes upon the other boy. ‘You see what I mean, don’t you? The whole thing’s there.’",

The Candacraig sits at the top of a long driveway which sweeps past a lawn of manicured flower-beds. It is an impressive mock-Tudor-style mansion, with turret rooms on the first floor and deep-green vines growing up the front wall. The six-bedroom hotel is run by the regime’s Ministry of Hotels and Tourism, and the staff, as might be expected, are somewhat strict. The sanitized feeling of a British boarding school lurks in its corridors and swills around in the weak tea served in stainless-steel pots. In the high-ceilinged bedrooms the disused fireplaces are stained with pigeon dropping. I had stayed here a few times on previous visits, and remember the first time, when the front-desk manager asked me what time I would like my supper.",

    "target_paragraph": "Today’s ride is a fair piece over hilly terrain. The first bit is on a road running high over Loch Ewe and the Isle of Ewe. The landscape is unassuming but pretty. I am surprised to find the Loch was a naval anchorage in WWII. Because this does not look like a military area, I am more surprised to find that, today, the Mellon Charles Royal Navy Depot and Pier services NATO nuclear-powered subs. It’s another one of those schizophrenic moments where the real pastoral scenery is distorted by the surreal knowledge that the jetty I see is designed for things that can destroy mankind. Off-put, I head to Laide with its lovely store and front bench in the sun. In a graveyard and next to a caravan park, I finally manage to find another chapel attributed to St Columba. It’s fairly nondescript but the view over Gruinard Bay is quite stunning. I head west on an elevated road that has spectacular views but some horrendous ups and downs. I pass a small cemetery with an interesting gate and decide to sit down, have lunch, and take in the view in the warmth generated by the solar heated gravestones. Down the road is Gruinard House, largish for this part of the world, well maintained, tidy, in the middle of nowhere and exactly what you would expect it to be…the house of a laird who was doing OK in a landscape devoid of anyone else. Guess where the crofters went? If you said “cleared,” you would be correct. In this case, though, it was probably a good thing.",

At the ditch under the first line of trees our men entrenched themselves; the artillery had withdrawn to the second line of trees—a mile back; and under the grateful shade the men threw themselves heavily down and slept. The strain had snapped. As the sun rose toward noon the desert, hill and town throbbed silently in the intense heat. Sometimes an exchange of shots far to the right or left told where the outposts were exchanging compliments. But even that soon stopped. In the cotton and cornfields to the north, among the sprouting green things, insects chirped. The birds sang no more because of the heat. It was breathless. The leaves stirred in no wind.",

He figured that whatever we didn’t learn from Pathfinder’s previous owner, we’d learn as we went along. Those three days were a blur of sailing practice and man-overboard drills, where we learned the basic workings of the boat, how to raise and lower the sails with all the different spaghettis of lines, how the wheel or tiller is used to steer. The hardest concept to grasp was how the boat uses the wind to move forward. No matter how many times and ways it was explained to us, it wasn’t until later on, as we crossed the Atlantic, that it all began to sink in. Only my little brother Tony, with his mathematician’s mind, managed to grasp immediately the aerodynamic principles. With just a tiny glimmer of understanding, this lone hyperactive adult and three of his children sailed past the heads of Cornwall and out to sea.",

One of them was raising a little bag, like a drowned animal, from his cup at the end of a cord. At that distressing sight I felt very far away from England, and it was with a pang that I realized how much I was likely to miss Southwood and the dahlias in the company of Aunt Augusta. I walked up to the Place Vendôme and then by the Rue Daunou to the Boulevard des Capucines. Outside",

And while shows fail 99.9 percent of the time, and so you go into this business expecting it, my show failed at a point in the process that was very unusual. Usually, the network doesn’t let you shoot the pilot at all, or they do but then don’t pick up the pilot to series, or they air your show but the ratings are bad so you get cancelled after a few episodes. But getting cancelled after the show’s been picked up, but before shooting or airing anything that could prove that we were indeed doing good work … that was a sucker punch.

First a new veil blew away, next my plaid was missing, then I passed my trunk on the ox-cart which should have been at the landing; but still, though the heat was fierce, and the glare from the black lava blinding, I dashed heedlessly down, and in twenty minutes had ridden three miles down a descent of 2000 feet, to find the Kilauea puffing and smoking with her anchor up; but I was in time, for her friendly clerk, knowing that I was coming, detained the scow.
