In the woods—anywhere, until I would have time to—God damn you! God damn you! If they would just let me do the hanging!” She shook him, her face bent to his, her hard, hot, panting breath on his face. “Not for killing him, but for doing it when you had no money to get away on if you ran, and nothing to eat if you stayed. If they’d just let me do it: hang you just enough to take you down and bring you to and hang you again just enough to cut you down and bring you to—” He slashed out again, viciously. But she had already released him, standing on one foot now, the other foot angled upward from the knee to meet her reaching hand. She took something from her shoe and put it into his hand. He knew at once what it was—a banknote, folded and refolded small and square and still warm with body-heat. And it was just one note. It’s one dollar, he thought, knowing it was not. It was I.O. and Eck, he told himself, knowing it was not, just as he knew there was but one man in the country who would have ten dollars in one bill—or at the most, two men; now he even heard what his cousin had said as he walked out of the store fifteen minutes ago. He didn’t even look toward his hand.",

But now seeing him sitting here, his legs crossed, his kindly face fixed on a forty-cent dinner, including dessert, his shawl wrapped around him as if to protect himself from the erratic air-cooling – now Prince Agge, who was in America at last, stared as a tourist at the mummy of Lenin in the Kremlin. This, then, was Lincoln. Stahr had walked on far ahead of him, turned waiting for him – but still Agge stared.",

They would arrive like clockwork just before dawn. Milk had to be delivered early, you see, because in the Midwest it spoiled quickly once the sun came up. You always knew when it was 5.30 because Mr Morrisey would arrive, whistling for all he was worth, waking all the dogs for blocks around, which would get Skipper very excited and set him to barking. Being deaf, Mr Morrisey tended not to notice his own voice and you could hear him clinking around on your back porch with his rack of milk bottles and saying to Skipper, ‘WELL, I WONDER WHAT THE BRYSONS WANT TODAY! LET’S SEE . . . FOUR QUARTS OF SKIMMED AND SOME COTTAGE CHEESE. WELL, SKIPPER, WOULD YOU FUCKING BELIEVE IT, I LEFT THE COTTAGE CHEESE ON THE GOD DAMN TRUCK!’ And then you would look out the window to see Skipper urinating on your bicycle and lights coming on in houses all over the neighbourhood. Nobody wanted to get Mr Morrisey fired, on account of his unfortunate disability, but when Flynn Dairies discontinued home deliveries in about 1960 on economic grounds ours was one of the few neighbourhoods in the city from which there was no outcry.",

I passed drab, newish two-storey residential blocks near an old Muslim cemetery where weeds half-smother broken and defaced gravestones. Two women, conversing from window to window, paused to stare at me uneasily and a few malnourished children looked scared and disappeared. A man repairing stakes in a small nearby vineyard didn’t return my greeting. Pre-settler, Palestinians cultivated grapes on much of the land around (and under) Kiryat Arba; for centuries Hebron was the main exporter of grapes to the Arab world.",

Hawked-up phlegm, streams of red betel-juice saliva, are shot about incessantly as they walk. It was one of the first things I noticed when I landed in Bombay, the patches everywhere of bright red spit. I thought it must be blood, until I was forced to the conclusion that, in that case, everyone was bleeding. And there the sweepers were in Delhi churning it about, whirling it all up in one’s face, the dried sputum in the dust, anonymous coughings; one could not help but have it in one’s nose, in one’s mouth. Give me the unhygienic customs of Europe! Give me the loving-cup! Give me the kiss!",

(These were filthy children, some with the concomitant skin diseases, but none looked underfed or had any of the obvious symptoms of vitamin deficiency.) For the self-invited guest this situation is tricky: how to explain that one has no objection to communal bedding but wishes not to deprive any family member of their quilt? But there was no problem here. Two sons were away working on the new road, sleeping in tents. While conveying this information Mrs A. used the space blanket to create a tent shape – more giggles.",

After pedalling in the heat for around half an hour, I began to regret leaving my sickbed. Sweat soaked my t-shirt and poured down my burning face, yet I'd began to shiver uncontrollably, and my whole body ached. The lack of suspension on the bike didn't help and as I bumped along into a wooded clearing, I was overcome by a terrible wave of nausea. I dropped the bike, sank to my knees and vomited spectacularly into the undergrowth. After ten minutes of prolonged retching, then dry-heaving, I was exhausted. I crawled a few feet to escape the colourful mound of puke I'd deposited, rolled onto my back and closed my eyes. My face was shaded by the forest canopy, but the dappled rays of early afternoon sun poured through the branches high above, to warm my fever-chilled body. The wind rustling the leaves and surround-sound of forest birdsong were better than any 'chill-out' relaxation apps. I was soon asleep.",

It had that special kind of grimy summer heat you used to get in big cities in America before air-conditioning came along. People spent every waking moment trying to alleviate it – wiping their necks with capacious handkerchiefs, swallowing cold glasses of lemonade, lingering by open refrigerators, sitting listlessly before electric fans. Even at night there was no relief. It was tolerable enough outside where you might catch a puff of breeze, but indoors the heat never dissipated. It just sat, thick and stifling. It was like being inside a vacuum cleaner bag. I can remember lying awake in a hotel in downtown Washington listening to the sounds of an August night wash in through the open window: sirens, car horns, the thrum of neon from the hotel sign, the swish of traffic, people laughing, people yelling, people being shot.",

I cannot testify concerning the mainmast, though it certainly does comport itself like no other mainmast I ever saw; but the other statements, and many more which might be added, are, I believe, substantially correct. That the caulking of the deck was in evil case we very soon had proof, for heavy rain on deck was a smart shower in the saloon and state rooms, keeping four stewards employed with buckets and swabs, and compelling us to dine in waterproofs and rubber shoes.",

Yet I travelled via Oradea; apparently fate had decreed that for me in Rumania nothing was to be straightforward. At 7 a.m., all seats on the night train to Iasi were already booked. Then I met Paula, who had been unsuccessfully trying to book a couchette to Oradea. She explained: ‘Since the revolution, half the population is travelling all over the country every day to visit families and friends. It’s one way of celebrating liberty. But it’s not very good for the economy – they just make a silly excuse and stop working, or go without saying anything. And their bosses feel they have no authority over them. That’s one bad result of not having a real government – this feeling “there’s no one in charge, we can do what we like, the police are afraid of us”. And of course now our trains are heated and comfortable. Before, they were so cold in midwinter a long journey could be dangerous. People often died of hypothermia in the carriages.’",

They even turned up at Honolua together, in his shit-brown van. She sat on the cliff while he paddled out. It was windy and big—one of those rip-roaring, high-amp days. I had been in a wave-catching, mindless groove. Now I sourly watched “Michael” paddle cautiously up the bay. A set rolled through and he headed for the horizon. He was, I realized, a kook. That improved my mood. I went back to work, battling the scrum in the main bowl, intent on center stage. Maybe, if Caryn saw me ripping on the board she gave me—or at least surfing competently—she’d come to her senses and take me back. After making a high-line screamer that no one in west Maui could possibly have missed seeing, I looked for her on the cliff. But the shit-brown van was gone.

As we drove out of Blagoveshchensk in its California evening light, Volodya said he didn’t mind losing teeth and was surprised to have so many of his own still remaining. His father and uncles had lost all their teeth long before they were Volodya’s age. He said losing teeth just ran in the family.",

Thus the receipt of it pleased her, and she afterwards walked about with a reflective air.",

When he woke it was nearly noon, and from his window he saw the well-known outline of the Ibis standing up dark against the glitter of the harbour. He had no fear of meeting her owners, who had doubtless long since landed and betaken themselves to cooler and more fashionable regions: oddly enough, the fact seemed to accentuate his loneliness, his sense of having no one on earth to turn to.

It was in 1890 that he executed his famous business coup: he brought up the suggestion that all nails used in nailing up the boxes in which nails are shipped are the property of the shippee, a proposal which became a statute, was approved by Chief Justice Fossile, and saved Roger Button and Company, Wholesale Hardware, more than six hundred nails every year.",

Given how continually dusty it’s been through Mongolia, I also try to clean it, but my grimy cloth only shifts dirt from one part of the car to another, and then onto me. Next comes the tricky and sometimes humiliating task of wrestling our self-erecting tent into submission. That marvel of French ingenuity on which I practiced so diligently at home, has become nearly as dear to me as Bernard. When we arrive at a camp after hours on the road, I am barely able to move my joints enough to turn my knees to the right and exit the car. The first time I stand up is a mix of divine pain, as my bones realign themselves from seated to upright. It is a great consolation to know that I need merely slip our tent from its sack, fling it in the air, and our room for the night will float back to earth fully formed. That I can stand fully upright in it after hours sitting in the car is an unmitigated pleasure.",

Rick’s rubber raft came in handy for shipping camera gear up the mile-long ravine while we swam through water that was black, crystal and freezing. This gorge was only a couple of feet wide in places, with red and black cliffs that rose sheer out of the water for a hundred feet or more. Then it would open out into a gloomy cavern or a fissure where the sun shot spears of yellow into the water. Rick was the only one who made it the whole mile, out to the sunny cliffs at the other entrance. We built him a driftwood fire half way on one of the tiny beaches of a cave-pool, so he would make it unfrozen on his way back. That night he drove back to Alice, to catch a plane that would take him to his next assignment somewhere out there in the wide world. We arranged to meet again at Ayers Rock, three weeks away, because Geographic had insisted on a full pictorial coverage of this well-known Australian landmark. I felt resentful about having to see him again so soon.",

He had not been going very fast for the last two or three hours, and he had gone even less fast since he left the compass and watch on the bush. So he went slower still now, since the tree could not be very far; in fact, he found it before he really expected to and turned and went to it. But there was no bush beneath it, no compass nor watch, so he did next as Sam had coached and drilled him: made this next circle in the opposite direction and much larger, so that the pattern of the two of them would bisect his track somewhere, but crossing no trace nor mark anywhere of his feet or any feet, and now he was going faster though still not panicked, his heart beating a little more rapidly but strong and steady enough, and this time it was not even the tree because there was a down log beside it which he had never seen before and beyond the log a little swamp, a seepage of moisture somewhere between earth and water, and he did what Sam had coached and drilled him as the next and the last, seeing as he sat down on the log the crooked print, the warped indentation in the wet ground which while he looked at it continued to fill with water until it was level full and the water began to overflow and the sides of the print began to dissolve away. Even as he looked up he saw the next one, and, moving, the one beyond it; moving, not hurrying, running, but merely keeping pace with them as they appeared before him as though they were being shaped out of thin air just one constant pace short of where he would lose them forever and be lost forever himself, tireless, eager, without doubt or dread, panting a little above the strong rapid little hammer of his heart, emerging suddenly into a little glade and the wilderness coalesced. It rushed, soundless, and solidified—the tree, the bush, the compass and the watch glinting where a ray of sunlight touched them. Then he saw the bear. It did not emerge, appear: it was just there, immobile, fixed in the green and windless noon’s hot dappling, not as big as he had dreamed it but as big as he had expected, bigger, dimensionless against the dappled obscurity, looking at him. Then it moved. It crossed the glade without haste, walking for an instant into the sun’s full glare and out of it, and stopped again and looked back at him across one shoulder. Then it was gone. It didn’t walk into the woods. It faded, sank back into the wilderness without motion as he had watched a fish, a huge old bass, sink back into the dark depths of its pool and vanish without even any movement of its fins.",

He had not seen her since his father’s death two years ago; she had written him a few days before asking him to come down, and now, driven more by a fury of flight and movement than by any other impulse, he wired her he was coming, and started out in one of the Public Service motor cars which at that time made the trip across the mountains.

Innumerable parallels to Eastern teachings among native American traditions might be cited, such as the Aztec concept of existence as a dream state, or the great awe of wind and sky that the Ojibwa of our northern prairies share with the vanished Aryans of the Asian steppes.19",
