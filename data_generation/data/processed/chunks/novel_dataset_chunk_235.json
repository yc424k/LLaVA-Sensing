Their establishment was shop-house-style, the two ground-floor rooms entered directly from the street; both ceilings were supported by concrete pillars, both bumpy concrete floors were permanently dusty though frequently swept with a grass broom. In the restaurant five metal camp tables were surrounded by plastic garden chairs; a garish Chinese curtain – puce cabbage roses with lime green leaves on a canary yellow background – could be used to partition this space. A few shelves at the back displayed Beerlao, Sprite, Coca-Cola, Lao whisky, mini-cartons of ersatz fruit juices, packets of too-sweet fairy cakes, tinned fish, Nestlé condensed milk, toothbrushes and toilet soap. The adjacent communal sitting-room was furnished with a TV set, a low table, a few chairs and a seven-foot-tall stuffed Asiatic black bear, standing in one corner. Mr Nguyen’s father had shot him a long time ago. Here Hare was stabled at the foot of the concrete stairs leading to the bedrooms. My windowless room was filled by an unclean but mosquito-netted double bed. Behind the restaurant were two filthy squat-over loos.",

There is nothing on this street but the derelict bowling alley, houses and my hotel. I rush down to hear them and watch “Jazz Pipe Band” in action. Someone keeps doing something, either a drummer taps out a rhythm for a while or a piper plays their pipes for a while and then, organically, everyone joins in and off they go with a rousing tune (and never the same one).

Not a silence so much as a great stillness – for there are a few sounds: the creak of some bird in a juniper tree, an eddy of wind which passes and fades like a sigh, the ticking of the watch on my wrist – slight noises which break the sensation of absolute silence but at the same time exaggerate my sense of the surrounding, overwhelming peace. A suspension of time, a continuous present. If I look at the small device strapped to my wrist the numbers, even the sweeping second hand, seem meaningless, almost ridiculous. No travelers, no campers, no wanderers have come to this part of the desert today and for a few moments I feel and realize that I am very much alone.",

There were always freaks like the Sadomasochist with safety pins pinning his nipples and bottles through his ears and the Candyman, an eerie giant on roller skates with bushy carrot-red hair and a black top hat, always surrounded by young girls receiving his free hallucinogenic candies. There was the Purple Man riding around on his old rusty purple bicycle, making his own personal statement against capitalism by handing out newsletters with the telephone credit card numbers of major corporations. There were the Hare Krishnas, floating by in an orange cloud, crashing their cymbals, jingling and chanting. Young Puerto Rican gangs, dressed to kill, prowled the streets. Pimps slapped their whores around and drunks lay in heaps across the street, snoring and clutching onto their ever-present bottles of Thunderbird. There were musicians crooning on one corner and jugglers on the next. On the remaining corners were junkies, hippies and dreads whispering: “Smokes, ’ludes, trips, anything you need,” and sometimes, “I’ll take checks and credit cards.”",

The two bulls had to be castrated as I would be travelling in winter and didn’t fancy another bout with either Dookie or Bub. I had decided to leave in March, the beginning of autumn. As it looked as if the Lands Council was at last getting Basso’s, and as Jenny and Toly had to get back to Utopia, we planned a trial run there with the camels and gear, for January, merely a month ahead. Sallay cut the bulls for me. It was done without anaesthetic and had me quivering and wringing my hands with sympathetic pain. The bulls were trussed up with ropes like plucked chickens, rolled over and then slash slash, scream scream, the gruesome job was done. Two weeks later it became apparent that Dookie was at the gates of death with an infection. I called on my friend the vet, and he came out to remove the huge lumps of stuff with emasculators. We drugged the camel, like Kate, until he was unconscious, then the vet showed me what to do. He pulled out the tubes, now swollen to the size of yams, and cut them off as high as he could. Dookie came immediately to consciousness with the pain. Then came the interminable terramycin shots. The vet agreed with me that a walk to Utopia would help the wounds to drain so preparations were now in earnest.",

Before me a nightcapped man, hopping about restlessly, and at the end of the garden a new wooden shed, his home, unpainted and warm against the gloom of low-hanging willows. He was a man skilled in his own way with hammer and other implements, anxious to please, magically improvising, providing everything.

Then, we turned on the light that is over the stoep and turned off all the other lights in the house. Finally, we opened the sliding door and screen that go out to the stoep and placed two chairs right beside the entrance. There we sat and waited.

Soon my host joined me and was informative. After the US retreat from Vietnam, many rich Vietnamese settled in Nong Khai and one such family built the Meeting Place. In 1980 they moved on to California (easily done as they came from a Catholic pro-US faction) where two generations are now prospering in the medical profession. Alan offered ‘more than a fair price’ for the house but they wouldn’t sell. ‘And weren’t they right!’ exclaimed Alan. ‘Look at the baht now!’ He was making ‘nice amounts’ by importing indigenous Australian palm trees – an unlikely commerce, there being no shortage of palm trees in Thailand. It seems nowadays you can start a fashion for pretty well anything. Sadly, he recalled losing to another Australian a 2 million baht contract for the ‘beautification’ of the Australian-funded Friendship Bridge.",

He suggests a weekend in Kesroli in the countryside away from the constantly ringing phone, fax and telex machine. Driving in a heat haze through fields as dry as a cracked heel, we pant and bake, too listless to scream at the near-miss head-on collisions with huge trucks, buses and farting Jeeps bursting with a cargo of cooked country folk. The roadside is littered with plastic, dead dogs, stiff cows and the twisted corpses of smashed-up metal. The relics of dead trees stand mutilated by villagers’ long blades. Their branches have been hacked for firewood and their knobbly limbs look like the truncated stumps of lepers. At the construction site for a giant concrete Krishna, sweating swamis jump in front of our car, forcing us to stop and take offerings of sugar. Highwaymen who call themselves “officials” hold a rope across the road and demand a “safety tax” or “land tax” or “road tax.” We give enough to buy us a blessing and permission to close the window. Our tempers are frayed and our faces bloated and blotched.",

She said that her mother was English and her father was Indian and they had come to Maymyo to work for the British. Dorothy had sun-roasted and crinkled skin, with mustard-coloured eyes and wavy white hair tied up in a loose bun. She wore a shabby blazer with leather elbow patches and a tamein, or sarong. When I met her, I was walking down Maymyo’s main street with a Western friend of mine who was visiting Burma. Dorothy grabbed my friend’s arm and asked in a perfect English accent, ‘Are you Connie? You look exactly like my cousin Connie. Are you her?’ My friend, Katherine, was very definitely not Connie and said so. Undeterred, Dorothy went on, ‘I thought you were Connie. Connie and the twins, they went back to England, you know. If you come across them, please say you met me here.’",

They jumped to the dock, raced to the taxi and jumped in. The taxi sped away out of sight. This little bit of excitement livened up the cloistered sanctuary of Running Mon Marina. This was Act One.",

At once the killings stopped and everyone began to salute wildly, like so many toy soldiers gone mad. Then twenty men who had been mingling with the crowd, clad in ordinary Nepalese costume, plus swords, agitatedly began to unsheath their weapons – and as these no-longer-bright swords were held aloft in a crooked row one could see that at some stage the dew had rusted them. The brass band now stopped playing and while the buglers blew a fanfare the VIP, looking faintly embarrassed, solemnly turned to salute the empty sofa and chairs. Then, as the fanfare blasted its uncertain way to its ragged end, the swords were lowered and the VIP lit himself a cigarette and sauntered over to talk to a group of men just below us.",

The child was not observing; he was at rest in the very center of the universe, a part of things, unaware of endings and beginnings, still in unison with the primordial nature of creation, letting all light and phenomena pour through. Ecstasy is identity with all existence, and ecstasy showed in his bright paintings; like the Aurignacian hunter, who became the deer he drew on the cave wall, there was no “self” to separate him from the bird or flower. The same spontaneous identity with the object is achieved in the bold sumi painting of Japan—a strong expression of Zen culture, since to become one with whatever one does is a true realization of the Way.",

The impacts only reached me when the beetles were lifted for the next blow; and soon, with a splitting and a crash, down the tree came, and they fell on it, lopping and trimming the prone trunk with saws, axes and billhooks. When enough stripped timber had accumulated, a team of horses with grapples and hauling gear would be summoned and the trunks dragged to the edge of the clearing and tipped down a steep ride: a chaos of timber choked the grass all the way down to a point where waggons could load them. It reminded me of the stripes of snow I had seen in the forests round the Austrian Danube and the pine-trunks tumbling down them like spilt matchboxes: all to be sawn into deal planks or put together in rafts and floated downstream.",

Lal the ral the ra, lal the ral the raddy.\n—That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press. Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.\nHe went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.\n—Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, the dictates of common sense. Just a moment.\nHe peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, some times blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.\nStephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ Repulse, the duke of Westminster’s Shotover, the duke of Beaufort’s Ceylon, prix de Paris, 1866. Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.\n—Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. But prompt ventilation of this important question …\nWhere Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush. Even money Fair Rebel: ten to one the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher’s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.\nShouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle.\nAgain: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spear spikes baited with men’s bloodied guts.\n—Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.\nHe came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.\n—I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It’s about the foot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two opinions on the matter.\nMay I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of laissez faire which so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old industries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme. European conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of agriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who was no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.\n—I don’t mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.\nFoot and mouth disease. Known as Koch’s preparation. Serum and virus. Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor’s horses at Mürzsteg, lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price. Courteous offer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant question. In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.\n—I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can be cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They offer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the department. Now I’m going to try publicity. I am surrounded by difficulties, by … intrigues, by … backstairs influence, by …\nHe raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.\n—Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are the signs of a nation’s decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nation’s vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction. Old England is dying.\nHe stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.\n—Dying, he said, if not dead by now.\nThe harlot’s cry from street to street\nShall weave old England’s winding sheet.",

Yet Parque Vidal seems scarcely changed since its creation in 1925: even the brass street lamps have survived, and the bust of Colonel Leoncio Vidal, marking the spot where this Independence War hero fell in 1896. Within the park guasima trees, poinciana and royal palms surround gay flower-beds and shapely miniature shrubs while sparrows drink from a gently splashing fountain. On every side neo-classical buildings recall Santa Clara’s nineteenth-century sugar-based prosperity. Only the 1950s Libre Hotel – lime-green, eleven storeys, on the south-west corner – offends the eye. One magnificent mansion (1810) now holds the Museum of Decorative Arts; the Provincial Governor’s palace has become a library; the Teatro de la Caridad (The Theatre of Charity, 1884, simple but stately) remains a theatre. It was presented to the city by an heiress celebrated for her munificence, Martha Abreu de Estavez, who also provided a hospital, a fire station, an astronomical",
