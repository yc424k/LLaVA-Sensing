The wind had died away, and there was the smell of grass and salt in the warm air.

On the terrace two musicians tuned a guitar and a harp. O’Toole was there, the Czech who had failed to sell two million plastic straws had brought his wife from the Hotel Guarani, and suddenly I saw moving inconspicuously through the crowd and disappearing again as though into some warren in the garden the export-import merchant who had shared our table on the boat, grey and thin, twitching his rabbit nose. On the lawn the ox steamed and crackled on its iron frame, and the smell of roasting meat chased away the perfume of orange and jasmine.",

The Park Service (why does this seem so inevitable?) imposes a host of petty, inflexible, exasperating rules on AT hikers, among them that you must move smartly forward at all times, never stray from the trail, and camp each night at a shelter. It means effectively not only that you must walk a prescribed distance each day but then spend the night penned up with strangers. We peeled off the worst of our wet clothes and rooted for dry ones in our packs, but even stuff from deep in the pack felt damp. There was a stone fireplace built into the shelter wall, and some kindly soul had left a pile of twigs and small logs by the side. Katz tried to light a fire, but everything was so wet that it wouldn’t burn. Even his matches wouldn’t strike. Katz exhaled in disgust and gave up. I decided to make some coffee, to warm us up, and the stove proved equally temperamental.",

In a cloudless, rainy, and humid climate, drying times are measured in months. Since there is only so much room to carry clean replacements, the continued challenge is to answer this question: how long can I wear this shirt, these knickers, or socks before it is going to cause a problem? The problem falls into two subcategories: smell or itching. For example, I thought I solved the problem of the t-shirt because I bought this terrific seventy-hour men’s antiperspirant that is activated by sweat. That sounds like three days per tee shirt to me. That plan crumbled when my armpits broke out in an itchy rash with festering sores.",

Russian collectors bought twenty-some of my friend Alex Melamid’s paintings for a bundle. In rural America, fur trappers found themselves with unexpected windfalls, as the Russians, always big fur consumers, bought more and more furs. Roman Abramovich, the wealthy entrepreneur and one-time governor of Chukotka, sold his oil and gas company, Sibneft, to Gazprom for $13 billion, thereby becoming Russia’s richest man.

Now we decide on another long row of roses on the other side of the walk and a pergola at the opposite end of that walk. This restores the impression of the original rose pergola that existed when we first saw the house, but now we want the open feeling to the wide walk instead of reconstructing the continuous pergola. Two roses we choose—one milky pink, one a velvet red—are Queen Elizabeth and Abe Lincoln (pronounced Eh-bay Lincónay at the nursery). Nice to think of those two forces side by side. My favorites start as one color and open to another. Gioia, Joy, is pearly as a bud and full blown turns straw yellow, with some petals still veined and edged with pink. We plant more of the apricot-dawn roses, one that’s traffic-light yellow, a Pompidou, and one named for Pope John XXIII. So many important people just blooming in our garden. I don’t resist a decadent, smoked lilac one that looks as if it belongs in the hand of someone in a coffin.",

One would have said, at sight of him, that he must have just come in from a long walk across the moors, and that now, pleasantly tired, he was looking forward with easeful contemplation to an evening spent with his dog, beside his fire, with a bottle of old port, and Beddoes. One would never have guessed the truth--that he was an eminent theatrical director whose life since childhood had been spent in the city, along Broadway and among the most highly polished groups of urban society.",

It was impossible to decide otherwise than he had done: he must see Madame Olenska himself rather than let her secrets be bared to other eyes.

Most of them are semi-rotten with green growing out of them, the effects of building in the jungle rather than in cool, sterile places, where termites and mould don’t thrive. The central tree, a wide dark-barked friend, spreads out overhead providing shade. Outside, the jungle tangles, curling up and around the tension wires. The fencing around the bottom has been made living with the tiny vines that constantly spread towards the light, despite the maintenance that we do. The whole thing gives it the effect, which of course is true, that the cage could be pulled down by the forest at any moment. It feels temporary and yet, like it’s been here forever.",

McKinlay was shaken by their helplessness, noting that “to be without steering in the middle of an ice pack was a serious business.” They managed to fix the steering and get under way again, but not for long. The ice closed in around them, bumping and battering them and halting their progress. Bartlett had a few unsavory things to say about the Karluk as they made fast to an ice floe. But by good fortune, they’d come to rest just a mile offshore from Cape Smyth, where they anchored to stable shore ice.",

But when peace returned the airport was very soon outgrown, and in 1956 French engineers began work on an audacious new runway protruding 8,000 feet into the harbour. This created an airport like no other, in the heart of the city as Berlin’s Tempelhof used to be, and as London’s City Airport would presently be, but forming an integral part of the seaport too. The work entailed demolishing a range of low hills, shifting eleven million tons of material to make the runway, and reconstituting the Song stone in a nearby park, where it remains.5",

The grandmother tells us that her ancestors have lived here for generations. She shows us the walls that are made from wooden posts filled in with mud and straw, and the stone floor in the dining room that has a natural drain out to the road for easy washing. She explains that this little town has a small primary school, where her four grandkids go, but next year the oldest will have to walk an hour to the nearest secondary school. The community tries to encourage kids to stay by helping them build their own house when they turn 18, but she says most of them prefer to move to Lima.",

The hedges were still heavy with fruit: plump blackberries, hard orange haws on the turn to red. The smell of ripe fruit and new earth was thick in the air. I ate handfuls of blackberries. A red admiral on a fence post let its wings fall open like a book. The hedgerows were slung with spider’s silk, and I recalled the webby corners of Roger’s house. Huge females sat in the centres of their webs: big tawny creatures, whose colours reminded me of Rannoch Moor.",

On prayed the pious husbands, bashing their foreheads on the cairns, lacerating their stockinged feet, heaving sighs and rolling eyes to heaven, in their resolve to postpone the inevitable reckoning. Round the bus danced the driver and his assistant, repulsed by the hooded harpies in their wire cage. One by one the husbands tried to dodge back to their places unseen. One by one the chauffeurs caught them. Each protested for a separate quarter of an hour. But only three refused to pay in the end, and these, snarling and cursing, were ejected from the company with blows and kicks. Led by a whining pharisee, the most active of the devotees, who had been my neighbour on the front seat of the bus, they started away down the hill at a lolloping trot.",

Beyond all was black, and the few people passing in that direction vanished at one stride beyond the glowing heaps of oranges and lemons. No footsteps echoed. They would never be heard of again. The adventurous head of the Special Crimes Department watched these disappearances from a distance with an interested eye. He felt light-hearted, as though he had been ambushed all alone in a jungle many thousands of miles away from departmental desks and official inkstands. This joyousness and dispersion of thought before a task of some importance seems to prove that this world of ours is not such a very serious affair after all.

    "target_paragraph": "Recently I have been negotiating for the employment of some of the Tibetans on the Indian Aid Hydro-Electric Project and today, on visiting the work-site, I made a wonderful discovery. This site is about 300 feet below the average level of Pokhara plain, in a very hot gorge through which a small river flows from the lake, and after my discussion with the Indian foreman I went hopefully to investigate the river. What I found far exceeded my hopes – a perfect swimming-pool, about 150 yards long, 10 yards wide and 20 feet deep. The pool is only five minutes’ walk from the work-site, where my duties will often take me during the weeks ahead, yet comparative privacy is ensured by a high, grey cliff on one side and a sheer, forested mountain on the other. The water is a clear green and less warm than the lake; also one can persuade oneself that it is less filthy, because of its movement – and certainly it feels much more refreshing. I spent the lunch-hour swimming happily up and down the length of the pool, since it is now far too hot to eat anything at midday; but unfortunately the very steep climb up from this gorge leaves one again pouring sweat by the time one reaches level ground.",

We own a complete Dakota now, for our partner was accidentally shot dead by a policeman because he couldn’t make himself understood in Guarani, and most of my spare time is spent in learning that language. Next year, when she is sixteen, I am to marry the daughter of the Chief of Customs, a union which has the approval of Mr Visconti and her parents.

One couldn’t afford everything, especially since the war, and she preferred veal for dinner every night to having to do her own mending and dress her hair: the unmanageable abundant hair which had so uncannily survived her youth, and sometimes, in her happier moods, made her feel that perhaps, after all, in the eyes of her friends, other of its attributes survived also. And besides, it looked better for a lone woman who, after having been thirty-nine for a number of years, had suddenly become forty-four, to have a respectable-looking servant in the background; to be able, for instance, when one arrived in new places, to say to supercilious hotel-clerks: “My maid is following with the luggage.”",
