This unfurnished apartment is in a fairly recently-built semi-detached house and it measures some twelve by fifteen feet – very nice too, apart from an excess of rats. Just now a glitter caught my eye, and looking up towards the crude wooden beams that support the flat corrugated-iron roof I thought at first that I was seeing fireflies or glowworms: but then I realised that three monster rats were peering speculatively down at me – no doubt wondering how securely the new tenant would lock away her food supplies.",

He led us up a grassy track which he insisted was the Camino Real, pointing to its width, and to the smooth stone slabs beneath the turf, as proof of his claim. Soon after we had left him, our track joined a dusty-white dirt-road that could be seen for miles ahead, running level through a village before vanishing around the shoulder of the massive mountain on which we stood. Scrutinising the barren way ahead, through binoculars, we realised that Juana would have no grazing tonight. So we set about securing a load of the Alf that grew on terraced ledges below the road. Its owner proved to be a cheerful, handsome, middle-aged Indian woman who sent three small nephews leaping down the terraces with bill-hooks to cut the second-tallest crop: different ledges were at different stages of development. The tallest, which was flowering, would be unsuitable mule-feed though it’s said to be best for cattle.",

Little loose dust rises from the wet land, and the winds blow prevailingly off the sea. Through such air, photons can proceed without obstacle. The light moves, unscattered, and falls upon the forms and objects of those regions with candour. Standing within such a light, you feel thankful for its openness. There is a sense of something having been freely given, without its store having been diminished.",

The envoys asked the city to give them a tenth of everything—one in ten princes, one in ten horses, a tenth of all citizens, a tenth of all products. The leaders of Ryazan answered that when none of them were left alive, what remained would belong to Batu. The Mongols enclosed Ryazan in a wall, reduced it with siege engines that shot burning projectiles, and took the city in December 1237. Cinders, stones, and dead bodies strewed the ground when they were through. From Ryazan, Batu continued to Moscow, where he killed 270,000. Ordinary people were just killed, while those of distinction were flayed alive, crucified, or burned. At the city of Vladimir, Batu’s next target, the Mongols overcame the defenses by building an earth mound higher than the walls and then crossing down into the city from it. When the Mongols finally departed Vladimir, there were no cries, because all were dead.",

Sea currents sped by the ice runway’s edge. In the narrow channel, a little over a mile across, ice floes jostled and slid onto one another as they hurried past at maybe seven knots, the wind and current pushing them hard. Above the lines of open water, wraiths of steam fifteen feet high whisked along next to the floes, leaning forward and rushing all in one direction like commuters. Beyond this fierce and wind-scoured zone, the lowering, black-gray rock of Big Diomede reared up immediately without beach or shoreline. This was what I had come to see, and I could barely face in that direction, with the wind belt-sanding the side of my nose and freezing the pen tip as soon as I took it out of my mouth.",

Out of the dust-cloud men came running back—singly, in pairs, in groups, a stampeding mob. They fell over us, around us—drowned us in a human flood, shouting \"To the alamos! To the trains! The Federation is coming!\" We struggled up among them and ran, too, straight up the railroad track.... Behind us roared the shells searching in the dust, and the tearing musketry. And then we noticed that all the wide roadway ahead was filled with galloping horsemen, yelling shrill Indian cries and waving their rifles—the main column! We stood to one side as they whirled past, about five hundred of them—watched them stoop in their saddles and begin to shoot. The drumming of their horses’ hoofs was like thunder.",

We looked at each other, smiling. Kollis was too wise to waste words on it, realizing perhaps how impossible it would be to do justice to the whole prospect. He told me nothing about it, and I wished to know nothing; we simply walked in quiet, bemused friendship among those slender chipped traceries and tall-shanked columns, among the armorial shields of forgotten knights and the blazing orange-trees, until we came into the shadow of the great refectory with its high roofs where the swallows were building, their soft agitations echoing in the silence like breathing, our own breathing, captured and magni­fied in the trembling silence with an unearthly fidelity. I found myself repeating in my mind, without conscious thought, but irresistibly – echoes in a sea-shell – some lines from Comus, built as this place had been built, as a testimony to the powers of contemplation which rule our inner lives. Bellapaix, even in ruins, was a testimony to those who had tried, however imperfectly, to grasp and retain their grip on the inner sub­stance of the imagination, which resides in thought, in contem­plation, in the Peace which had formed part of its original name, and which in my spelling I have always tried to retain. The Abbey de la Paix, corrupted by the Venetians into Bella Paise … It was to take me nearly a year to gain currency for the spelling Bellapaix, which is as near as one can get today to its original.",

Now the chief appeared, Père Sylvestre said he expected him. Whenever Père Sylvestre returns from a journey the chief shows up to hear the news. The passion of the blacks for talk, gossip is understandable; they live entirely by word of mouth, and my imagination cannot grasp a life which never, generation after generation, needs the printed page. The radio is unknown and there are few travellers and their own trips are made on foot and limited. They do not visualize the whole of their country; Yaoundé would be another world; and of course nothing at all really exists beyond their own tribal land.",

She made a mental note of these items, but resolved not to touch on them in her talk with Lita.

They appeared to be from all over—America, Britain, Holland, Scandinavia. Having come this far, I didn’t wish to share the experience with a hundred twittering strangers, and I set off in a brisk stroll for the beach along a chalky track. It was amazingly hot. A breeze was running in from the sea, but it seemed only to bring more heat. After about half a mile the track brought me to a sumptuously sunny bay, flat calm and of the deepest aquamarine. At some distance across the water a long sandbar ran in a lazy curve out to sea. This, I gathered, was the Fauré Sill—a thirty-mile-long dune barrier that nearly encloses the bay and gives it its special character, namely warm, shallow, very saline waters of the sort that once prevailed across the planet when stromatolites were king.",

He instantly made towards the latter object. The village was quite still, it being that motionless hour of rustic daily life which fills the interval between the departure of the field-labourers to their work, and the rising of their wives and daughters to prepare the breakfast for their return. Hence he reached the church without observation, and the door being only latched he entered. The hay-trusser deposited his basket by the font, went up the nave till he reached the altar-rails, and opening the gate entered the sacrarium, where he seemed to feel a sense of the strangeness for a moment; then he knelt upon the foot-pace.

A great many of them had such outcroppings projecting from their ridges, and they much resembled the cairns shepherds build on bald summits in Scotland. For that matter, they suggested the cairns—closer to the Kobuk—that forest Eskimos once used in methodical slaughter of caribou. The cairns were built on the high tundra in a great V, open end to the north, and they served as a funnel for the southbound herd. To the approaching caribou, the cairns were meant to suggest Eskimos, and to reinforce the impression Eskimos spaced themselves between cairns. At the point of the V, as many caribou as were needed were killed and the rest were let through.",

I went on it the following morning thinking a bit of a sit-down and a cruise on the water would be just the way to ease myself out of a killer hangover, but in fact the inescapable sound of “Ferry Cross the Mersey” only worsened my cranial plight. Apart from that, it must be said that the Mersey ferry is an agreeable, if decidedly breezy, way of passing a morning. It’s a bit like the Sydney Harbour cruise, but without Sydney.",

Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.",

A front from the south was making its way up the Australian east coast and was expected to reach their position by evening. It was one of those infamous Southerly Busters that he had heard about, and it was packing 45+ knots of wind and 20-30’ seas. Southerly Busters were large, powerful cold fronts from the Antarctic that pushed northward against prevailing high systems over Australia. In advance of the front, you had hot northerly winds. When those winds encountered the colder southerly winds, the temperature gradient, and with it, the winds could be enormous.",

He never raised it, yet on a still night we have heard it from our front porch. When he called the dogs in he sounded just like the horn he carried slung on his shoulder and never used, but clearer, mellower, as though his voice were a part of darkness and silence, coiling out of it, coiling into it again.

Our host provided us with flour, sugar, and dough nuts, and a hot breakfast, and our expedition, comprising two natives who knew not a word of English, Mr. G. who does not know very much more Hawaiian than I do, and myself, started at seven. We had four superb mules, and two good pack-horses, a large tent, and a plentiful supply of camping blankets. I put on all my own warm clothes, as well as most of those which had been lent to me, which gave me the squat, padded look of a puffin or Esquimaux, but all and more were needed long before we reached the top. The mules were beyond all praise. They went up the most severe ascent I have ever seen, climbing steadily for nine hours, without a touch of the spur, and after twenty-four hours of cold, thirst, and hunger, came down again as actively as cats. The pack-horses too were very good, but from the comparative clumsiness with which they move their feet they were severely cut.",

For it seemed vain and arrogant in the extreme to try to better that anonymous work of creation; the labours of those vanished hands. Better was it to go unknown and leave behind you an arch, a potting shed, a wall where peaches ripen, than to burn like a meteor and leave no dust. For after all, he said, kindling as he looked at the great house on the greensward below, the unknown lords and ladies who lived there never forgot to set aside something for those who come after; for the roof that will leak; for the tree that will fall. There was always a warm corner for the old shepherd in the kitchen; always food for the hungry; always their goblets were polished, though they lay sick; and their windows were lit though they lay dying. Lords though they were, they were content to go down into obscurity with the molecatcher and the stone-mason. Obscure noblemen, forgotten builders—thus he apostrophized them with a warmth that entirely gainsaid such critics as called him cold, indifferent, slothful (the truth being that a quality often lies just on the other side of the wall from where we seek it)—thus he apostrophized his house and race in terms of the most moving eloquence; but when it came to the peroration—and what is eloquence that lacks a peroration?—he fumbled. He would have liked to have ended with a flourish to the effect that he would follow in their footsteps and add another stone to their building. Since, however, the building already covered nine acres, to add even a single stone seemed superfluous. Could one mention furniture in a peroration? Could one speak of chairs and tables and mats to lie beside people’s beds? For whatever the peroration wanted, that was what the house stood in need of. Leaving his speech unfinished for the moment, he strode downhill again resolved henceforward to devote himself to the furnishing of the mansion. The news—that she was to attend him instantly—brought tears to the eyes of good old Mrs Grimsditch, now grown somewhat old. Together they perambulated the house.",

Looking back to the wake behind Varuna, I caught sight of his little head, a picture of terror bobbing up and down in the waves. Screaming with a burst of adrenaline, I leapt to the Monitor, disengaged it, rounded up into the wind and backwinded the sails. Trying to keep my eyes on him, I pushed the tiller over so that Varuna would back down on the spot. Tarzoon swam frantically toward the boat and as we drifted closer, I leaned over and scooped him up.",

Cary already knew from a friend who worked there that she was seen as an unprepared interloper—a young black woman with braids who was rising too fast. She recognized the code words, and she expected the same cold reception she’d received at Novalum. This time, though, instead of factory workers, she was confronting managers and directors who, like her, had college degrees and a level of experience in the professional world. Some were jealous because they had spent years in the business, hoping for promotions, only to be passed over. And here came Cary, with her degree in economic engineering, whatever that was, but without enough hands-on experience to put together a single pair of socks. She might understand the complexities of labor flow, and she could plot the production process for making an aluminum jug. But she had never set foot in a textile mill or run one, let alone twenty-six.",

Pure relief washed over me … The tension in the vehicle diffused in an instant and I heard some of my teammates laugh nervously. I regained control of my movements and stood up on wobbly legs to lean forward and peer out the window. I could see the cracked ice around our tires. I wanted to assess the situation. How bad was it? Were we out of immediate danger? My brain was still in a fog, trying to process what had just happened. I checked in with my teammates to ask if anyone was hurt; thankfully everyone was okay.",

They drove him forth on long solitary walks beyond the town, walks ending most often in the deserted grounds of Hopewood, beautiful now in the ruined gold of October. As he sat under the beech-limbs above the river, watching its brown current sweep the willow-roots of the banks, he thought how this same current, within its next short reach, passed from wooded seclusion to the noise and pollution of the mills. So his own life seemed to have passed once more from the tranced flow of the last weeks into its old channel of unillumined labour. But other thoughts came to him too: the vision of converting that melancholy pleasure-ground into an outlet for the cramped lives of the mill-workers; and he pictured the weed-grown lawns and paths thronged with holiday-makers, and the slopes nearer the factories dotted with houses and gardens.",

Small children are almost unbelievably durable. It was only 3 p.m. when we got back but we had to waste both kerosene and sunny hours drying her padded snow-suit trousers, flannel slacks, woollen tights, woollen stockings and fur-lined boots. The chowkidar, the semi-idiot and the blind man were all delighted to find our stove going and came to squat in a row against the wall while Rachel sat wrapped in our united bedding, morbidly drawing pictures of jeeps falling over precipices.",
