The handsome Hamiani, Abd el Djebbar, sees nothing in the music but a motive for yawning; lying full length on the carpet like a big Saluki hound, he stretches his lean horseman’s muscles, which are clearly unused to inactivity.",

Everybody we met was friendly and helpful to a fault, even more so after they realized we didn’t speak French and didn’t come from the country that they, in their love/hate relationship with their colonial overlords, sometimes think of as their oppressors. At least our government hadn’t obliterated any of their atolls with nuclear weapons tests, like the French had done. We only did that to the Marshall Islanders. The gendarmes, too, were friendly, accommodating and surprisingly relaxed about entry procedures, much like their counterparts in the French Caribbean islands. Our limited French and the near-total absence of English speakers made it difficult to interact with people, and that we regretted, but both parties were usually able to get their points across and the bright smiles were easy enough to understand. Every time we walked the shaded paths and roadways folks offered us breadfruit, bananas and (our favorite) pamplemousse, a luscious citrus delicacy that just might be the finest of the many great things these islands have to offer.",

You meet a man or a woman and, from tiny and intimate sounds, from the slightest of movements, you know at once whether you are concerned with good people or with those who won’t do. You know, this is to say, whether they will go rigidly through with the whole programme from the underdone beef to the Anglicanism. It won’t matter whether they be short or tall; whether the voice squeak like a marionette or rumble like a town bull’s; it won’t matter whether they are Germans, Austrians, French, Spanish, or even Brazilians—they will be the Germans or Brazilians who take a cold bath every morning and who move, roughly speaking, in diplomatic circles.",

On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains.

Then he pulled his nightgown over his head, looking for a moment in the dresser mirror at his great boned structure, the long stringy muscles of his arms, and his flat-meated hairy chest. His stomach sagged paunchily. He thrust his white flaccid calves quickly through the shrunken legs of a union suit, stretched it out elastically with a comfortable widening of his shoulders and buttoned it. Then he stepped into his roomy sculpturally heavy trousers and drew on his soft-leathered laceless shoes. Crossing his suspender braces over his shoulders, he strode into the kitchen and had a brisk fire of oil and pine snapping in the range within three minutes. He was stimulated and alive in all the fresh wakefulness of the Spring morning.",

He had joined the Agitator Corps; after work, they went into the interior to educate the people. She often imagined him standing in the middle of a gathering of rapt villagers, talking in that sonorous voice about the great nation that Biafra would be. His eyes saw the future. And so she did not tell him that she grieved for the past, different things on different days, her tablecloths with the silver embroidery, her car, Baby’s strawberry cream biscuits. She did not tell him that sometimes when she watched Baby running around with the neighborhood children, so helpless and happy, she wanted to gather Baby in her arms and apologize.

    "target_paragraph": "That lull that some say is an angel passing over, when everyone is sated with a good meal and all conversation suddenly ceases, happens now. In the hush, I watch musky cigar smoke swirl about my head, as intoxicating as any liqueur. Without preamble, one of James’ mates walks over and taps Hans on the shoulder. “Come,” he says. He starts to whistle, a lilting, poignant tune of such ineffable longing I can barely keep from crying. Hans smiles and joins him on the patio. The two men, one handsome, swarthy with a shock of black hair, the other with his trademark frizzy blond halo and beatific grin, each sling an arm around the other’s shoulder. Joined this way, they start to sway, then slowly, each raises his free arm to the side and snaps his fingers. They dip down on bent knee, rising on the other side with another rhythmic snap. It’s Zorba-like, but not so. It’s heartbreaking, passionate, joyous, and I know we all feel it. We band of brothers.",

Instead, it traded in lumps of medieval-smelling smoked cheese, chunks of pink rock salt, and candles that fizzled like sparklers when I lit them. One stall sold jars of something called Invisible Face Cream. Suzukis and jeeps tore up and down, streaked with the dust that got into everything.

Their stillness was as shocking as the color of their hair – until I drew abreast of them and saw that they were a couple of life-sized mannequins for use in seat-belt demonstrations. They stared straight ahead through the windscreen as though they had been paralyzed, and the complete absence of any living thing on the road made it seem that the inhabitants of all Hiroshima – frogs, blonds, schoolchildren and their teachers – had unwittingly crawled into some blind angle of the less-than-all-seeing thunder god’s eye.",

Then: peregrines and other falcons; rock-doves; the Mediterranean herring-gull with its jocular laughing-note, and the azure-tinted thrush, whose cunning brings tears to the eyes of the native sportsmen. It contributes little towards the general commotion, but its loud and tuneful song re-echoes among the clefts. In the breeding season it makes a long roundabout to approach its nest, with countermarches and stealthy diversions, a piece of ‘malizia’ which extorts the fisherman’s approbation. Sometimes, too, you may see the exotic wall-creeper hovering among the ledges with jerky butterfly-movements, or the kingfisher picking its way southward from rock to rock, when the streams in the north have begun to freeze over. They call it ‘uceello di San Martino’, because it generally appears on that saint’s day in November. It is strange to see this bird, which we associate with dim forest pools and reedy streamlets, darting like a blue meteor along the open salt-water beaches. Eagles and ravens, sea-fowl in Greece, have deserted Siren land; the latter used to be so common in Anacapri that one of the reproaches levelled in olden days at its inhabitants was to the effect that they had learnt their harsh dialect from the raven’s croak. No doubt an ornithologist would find much to interest him here during the spring and autumn migrations, for a number of rare birds alight at these seasons. But the country will wait long for its Gaedke, since every feathered thing is shot and eaten, irrespective of size or species.",

I felt the whole dream lurching and pulling to be gone. Just then the mysterious word of fear was repeated. It sounded like REPORTERS. I looked and saw three of them coming across the lawn. Oh, blessed reporters! Then the dream was indisputably real after all. I glanced out across the shining water and saw the Snark at anchor, and I remembered that I had sailed in her from San Francisco to Hawaii, and that this was Pearl Harbour, and that even then I was acknowledging introductions and saying, in reply to the first question, \"Yes, we had delightful weather all the way down.\"",

At just under 6 2, I was the shortest member of our trio. I felt like a Scots pine who had entered a grove of redwoods. Erik’s obvious potential for physical action contrasted appealingly with his air of languor and sweet temper. He was only twenty-four years old but already a well-known climber on rock and ice. He had grown up on the Canadian plains, and had cut his teeth putting new routes up frozen waterfalls near Lake Ontario. Some of his friends were into climbing the sides of icebergs floating in Baffin Bay. His dream was to summit an ultra-hard mountain such as Minya Konka.",

What do the pilgrims see? The trail climbs and winds past isolate pinyons and solitary junipers to a vale of stone where nothing has happened for a thousand years, to judge from the quietude of the place, the sense of waiting that seems to hover in the air. From this vale you climb a second ledge blasted across the face of a cliff, round a corner at the end of the trail and Delicate Arch stands before you, a fragile ring of stone on the far side of a natural amphitheatre, set on its edge at the brink of a five hundred foot drop-off. Looking through the ring you see the rim of Dry Mesa and far beyond that the peaks of the La Sal Mountains.",

The crowd consisted primarily of pensioners, impoverished conservatives, and workers who hadn’t received a paycheck in months. The bulk were either homely looking in their shabby clothing or maladjusted and kooky seeming, but for the first time since my arrival, my mud brown corduroys fit right in.

Now he knew he was understanding, now he knew he had a hot love in him, and he was good always to Melanctha Herbert who was the one had made him have it. Now he knew he could be good, and not cry out for help to her to teach him how to bear it. Every day Jeff felt himself more a strong man, the way he once had thought was his real self, the way he knew it. Now Jeff Campbell had real wisdom in him, and it did not make him bitter when it hurt him, for Jeff knew now all through him that he was really strong to bear it.",

Their eyes go travelling upwards slowly--up--up--up. The building seems to widen curiously, to be distorted, to flare out wedgelike till it threatens to annihilate the sky, overwhelm the will, and crush the spirit. (These optics, too, American, Admiral Drake.) The eyes continue on past storey after storey up the wall until they finally arrive and come to rest with focal concentration on that single open window twelve floors up. It is no jot different from all the other windows, but now the vision of the crowd is fastened on it with a fatal and united interest. And after staring at it fixedly, the eyes come travelling slowly down again--down--down--down--the faces strained a little, mouths all slightly puckered as if something set the teeth on edge--and slowly, with fascinated measurement--down--down--down--until the eyes reach sidewalk, lamp-post, and--the Thing again.",

It led from a side street onto the Square where Grover Cleveland could have cut across lots from his boarding house. Then he stepped out of it, already walking fast. He didn’t wear a uniform like Mr Connors, he wore ordinary clothes with usually his coat-tail hiked up over the handle of the pistol and the blackjack in his hip pocket, coming up the street fast, picking his feet up quick like a cat on a hot stove. And if you thought it would have been Mr Connors or even Mr Hampton, the sheriff, that did the investigating, you would have been wrong. It was Uncle Willy himself. At first Grover Cleveland tried to bluff. Then he fell back on lying. Then he just fell back.",

Taylor had promised that he would go down to Whitechapel on Wednesday afternoon and confer with ‘the Society’. Yet Wednesday afternoon, Wednesday evening passed and still Taylor did not come. This could only mean, she supposed, that the price was going to be raised – which was inconvenient enough at the moment. Still, of course, she would have to pay it. ‘I must have my Flush, you know’, she wrote to Mr Browning. ‘I can’t run any risk and bargain and haggle.’ So she lay on the sofa writing to Mr Browning and listening for a knock at the door. But Wilson came up with the letters; Wilson came up with the hot water. It was time for bed and Flush had not come.",

Alice Longworth, Roosevelt’s cousin, who was also present, reported that “it was difficult to avoid stepping on bloody chunks of human being.” One of the bomber’s legs was on a doorstep across the street. Another was fifty feet away. A big section of torso, with clothing still attached, was dangling from the cornice of a house on a neighboring street. Another indeterminate chunk of flesh and cartilage had crashed through a window of a house across the way and landed at the foot of the bed of Helmar Byru, minister plenipotentiary of Norway. Most of the scalp was found two blocks away on S Street. To reach that point?both distant and uphill?the top of the bomber’s head must have been launched on a trajectory 100 feet high and 250 feet long. It was a big bomb.",

A bird cawed from a tree above. Once in a while, a leaf would flutter down. She stood before a table with graying pieces of raw chicken and imagined grabbing them and running away as fast as she could. If she bought the chicken, it would be all she would buy. So she bought four medium-sized snails instead. The smaller spiral-shelled snails were cheaper, piled high in baskets, but she could not buy them, could not think of them as food; they had always been, to her, playthings for village children. She was leaving when she saw Alice.",
