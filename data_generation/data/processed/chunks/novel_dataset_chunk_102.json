Reuters syndicated dramatic photos of Bank – who came second – being hauled off-stage unconscious after fainting from dehydration, with Haruna Ai and Sorrawee Natee trailing in her wake. Costumes were packed away, hair extensions and wigs were sealed up and make-up poured down the drain. The girls retreated back to their hotel for a final night together, consoling each other and congratulating the winner, bracing themselves for the return to their regular lives and jobs. Besides Nalada’s, no one’s life would change. Not really. Back at the auditorium and across Thailand, all the lights on these women had been dimmed. They’d had their evening. It would be another year before the lights came back on or anyone even thought about them again.",

Dozens of people poked around happily, seemingly undisturbed by the thought that they had paid £6.90 for the privilege of looking at the sorts of items they could see for free at any garden center. As I left the gardens and walked back toward the palace, I took the opportunity to study the miniature steam train. It ran over a decidedly modest length of track across one corner of the grounds. The sight of fifty English people crouched on a little train in a cold gray drizzle waiting to be taken two hundred yards and thinking they were having fun is one that I shall not forget in a hurry.",

The castle fell to ruin which it remains today although helpful signs indicate the purpose of each foundation. The Finlaggan Trust came into being only in 1984 to protect the site, the importance of which the Trust celebrates with such unusual events as the “500th Anniversary of the Forfeiture of the Lordship.” The Trust also has licensed the site for weddings and displays on its “Weddings” site a picture of newlyweds, one of whom in full kilt (and in full wind) leaves no doubt as to what is worn underneath. Finlaggan is pretty but I find, like other sites I have visited, it has an aura. This one is resoundingly depressing. I watch fly fishing on Loch Finlaggan and a large flock of sheep clogging up the access road while I quietly pray that a B&B is in my future.",

He hesitated; he shuddered; he walked elaborately to the window and laid aside his coat. He balanced his stick most carefully against the folds of the curtain. Thus occupied with his own sensations and preparations, he had little time to observe what either of the other two was feeling. Such symptoms of agitation as he might perceive (and they had left their tokens in brightness of eye and pallor of cheeks) seemed to him well befitting the actors in so great a drama as that of Katharine Hilbery’s daily life. Beauty and passion were the breath of her being, he thought.",

This lake seems to be a volcanic crater, a mile wide and long, and it reflects all the snow-covered peaks that surround it on three sides. There was a cloudless blue sky above the green water when we arrived so the reflections were perfect. The surrounding glaciers are now melting but remain firm enough to be quite safe for walking so we went right round the shore; then a little breeze got up and a few clouds appeared and the beauty of the water colouring was beyond words. Just as we were leaving at 1 p.m. a party of young forestry students arrived with gallons of tea in flasks – very welcome – and I spent an hour talking with them and being photographed as one of the ‘strange sights’ they had encountered on their excursion. (If you could see me by this stage you’d appreciate the subtle humour of that description.)",

And one would have to say to her, It has all gone against your wishes. They’re happy like that; I’m happy like this. Life has changed completely. At that all her being, even her beauty, became for a moment, dusty and out of date. For a moment Lily, standing there, with the sun hot on her back, summing up the Rayleys, triumphed over Mrs Ramsay, who would never know how Paul went to coffee-houses and had a mistress; how he sat on the ground and Minta handed him his tools; how she stood here painting, had never married, not even William Bankes.",

Now he was alone at Rodger’s Harbor in a tent near the rough graves of two dead men, and already his mental state was tenuous. He’d been half-crazed with fright and famine when they arrived, and they’d promised to return as soon as they could. Though they’d moved the tent some distance from the bodies and reinforced it, it was hard to imagine the loneliness and terror he must be enduring. They’d need to return to offer him morale and physical support soon, for he could not hunt or fend for himself, and he was dangerously low on food.",

The petrel looks as out of place as I, fluttering like a sea chickadee, teetering on the edge of flight, heading straight for a clumsy crash. In reality he is having no trouble. I’ve seen petrels in shrieking winds, flapping from one gigantic wave canyon to another. They weigh only a few ounces and you’d think that they’d be blown off the face of the world. The tiny petrels, even the much larger shearwaters, will make a very meager meal, but I’ll still try to grab one if it ventures close enough. Neither has any need for my dangerous company. They are only curious enough to swoop by every now and then. Their minute black eyes flit over every detail of the raft as they pass. I can watch the flight of the shearwaters for hours. They rarely flap their wings, even when it is flat calm. Then they glide in a straight line close to the surface of the water in order to use the surface effect. In heavy airs they wheel about in large arcs and then dive down so close to the waves that you can’t see any space between their feather tips and the water. To me, they are the gods of grace. The shearwaters make me feel very clumsy and remind me how ill suited I am to this domain.",

As Reinhard had pointed out, the sites along the trail are so different, and so obviously oriented toward watching the sun and stars, that it seems impossible that they didn’t have some important ritual use. Magli believed that the trail likely prepared pilgrims for the most important part of the journey, which took place inside Machu Picchu. Curiously, the final leg of this pilgrimage roughly mimicked another famous journey, Hiram Bingham’s first visit to Machu Picchu in 1911. In both cases, one entered through the main gate, which faced due north to Huayna Picchu (and where Bingham found his rounded stones?which Magli thought had possibly been offerings), walked up past a quarry more symbolic than functional (representing the Pachamama and the journey underground), through the Sacred Plaza, where the Temple of the Three Windows was erected as a tribute to the cave at Tampu Tocco, and up to the Intihuatana, the end point of the pilgrimage, which Reinhard has demonstrated aligns with apus in the cardinal directions.",

His ancestors had been Persian tutors at the Red Fort; today, Dr Jaffery pursued exactly the same career in Zakir Hussain College on the margins of Old Delhi.

These escapades would be laughed off as good old-fashioned oat sowing were I not of the fairer sex, and so I’m going to plow ahead and tell the story of my two Brazilian boyfriends.",

It can be saved, given, or lost in every social situation and in varying degrees. One example is when a guest is ready to retire for the night. You’ll make them lose mianzi if you simply wave good-bye from your spot on the couch. A little mianzi can be given, though, by walking them to the door, more still to the elevator, and the optimal when you escort them to their taxi, bus, or bicycle. They’ll fight you every step of the way, insisting you turn back, but that’s just part of the ritual.",

About an hour later I saw my first herd of dzo – and was vaguely disappointed to find they look exactly like cows with very bushy tails. They were being guarded by a pair of enormous, ferocious-looking Tibetan mastiffs who almost foamed at the mouth as I wandered through the herd taking photographs. Mingmar says that these dogs are trained to kill intruding humans; during the day they are usually tied to wooden stakes with short, heavy chains and they wear large, clangorous iron bells around their necks. But at night they roam free and are far more dangerous than wild animals; I know several Tibetans whose faces have been horribly disfigured by their attacks. Today I felt decidedly apprehensive when we had to pass a herd in charge of an untied dog; but the enraged creature was restrained by two tiny children who flung their arms around his neck and told him to be quiet. I didn’t really expect him to obey – yet immediately he subsided and began to wag his tail at the children, ignoring us as we sidled past.",

They’re all broken. You can’t expect him to be at his best in a ballroom. He wants a cosy, smoky, masculine place, where he can stretch his legs out, and only speak when he’s got something to say.

It was as though I had driven into a pool of black and limitless space, and were passing through another, not altogether earthly, place. On the downslope of the Moor, I had to brake sharply and slow almost to a standstill, for deer were flowing across the road before me, making for their haunts in the Black Corries. In the brightness of the car’s headlights, I could see the deer crowded closely together as they crossed the road, each laying its nervous head against the back or flank of the one in front. In the cold air their breath clouded out from their nostrils, and the whites of their eyes caught and returned the car’s light, so that they glowed orbishly in the dark. As I drove down the waning slope of the Moor, towards the Bridge of Orchy, two or three more herds crossed the road before me, off to the corries of the Black Mount.",

It was a gorgeous morning—dewy and cool but with the kind of sunshine and sluggish air that promises a lot of heat later on—and I was early enough that I could get almost a full day’s walk in. I had to get the car home to New Hampshire by the following day, but I was determined to get at least one decent walk in, to salvage something from the catastrophe that was this trip, and luckily I seemed to have chosen well. I was in the midst of several thousand acres of exquisitely pretty woodlands shared jointly by Worthington State Forest and the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.

The other is Karntnerstrasse, which joins Graben at a right angle by the cathedral square. Between them, they provide Vienna with the finest pedestrian thoroughfare in Europe. Strøget may be a hair longer, others may have slightly more interesting buildings, and a few may be fractionally more elegant, but none is all of these things.

He imagined that no man had ever been so tired and that no man had ever been so alone!

Both families had run from the Pale pogroms, wandered a bit around Europe, sailed for the Cape in 1890. All our elders opposed my parents’ leaving. They’d prospered and settled happily on the Cape and didn’t believe in Zionism. Hitler had just taken power and childhood memories of Cossacks slaughtering relatives and friends never faded. No one foresaw death-camps but some feared he’d hunt down Jewish refugees in Palestine. My father admitted being impatient with his parents, laughing at their fears. He imagined the man who talked about Jews as Hitler did would never take action. He was only twenty-two and that was before the Nuremberg Laws. I remember his mistake when it’s argued Israel will never attack Iran because we’re so vocally paranoid about their bomb. Insane delusions can trigger insane actions.’",
