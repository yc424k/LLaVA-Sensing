If we needed to go ashore we were to coordinate with the marine director via VHF radio and they would pick us up and bring us back to our boats as the shooting schedule allowed.

The locals of the lesser islands were drawn to its capital, a tiny port called Achao, for everything they couldn’t produce themselves, and a flotilla of brightly painted boats in varying states of disrepair jostled around the sloping jetty, loaded and unloaded by dark-skinned islanders anxious to get home. They moved their goods however they could: heaped in wheelbarrows, stacked in metal carts attached to bicycles, piled on wooden-wheeled wagons drawn by nags, heaved on handcarts, loaded in the back of pickups and pressed down on overladen shoulders. They brought sacks of flour, crates of Coca-Cola, bundles of shiny fish held together by a reedy cord, brown smoked fish stiff and flattened like table-tennis bats, wicker-clad bottles of pungent local wine, sheets of corrugated iron and baskets of onions with diminutive baskets of garlic lashed to the handle. Children carried industrial-sized packets of sugar, and shifts of salmon workers loitered in their uniform white wellingtons and lifejackets. A man threaded among the crowd with a tray of popcorn balanced on his head, dispensing small bagfuls wherever he could find a taker. Along the beach, an old man was pitchforking bright green seaweed onto his oxcart, and his son was standing on the mound, stamping it down.",

As I ate, I thought about Pushkin and watched network TV stars compete in group sporting events. One of the groups competing was Team Baywatch.

Even an old American building, an old warehouse with its scaled and rusted brick, an old tenement with its curiously, pleasantly flat, blank planes (that always made him think somehow of the Riots of 1861 and of the illustrations in ancient numbers of Harper’s Weekly), seemed to have, compared to buildings such as these, a fragile, almost flimsy, insubstantiality. He could never come back home and wake at morning on the ship at Quarantine and look out of a porthole to see that so enormously moving and hauntingly evocative scene—the first view of American earth, the humid, coarse, and somewhat pallid green, the faded opacity of color, and, most strange, most moving, most immediate, recovered instantly with the full impact of recognition and of wonder, the shape of a white frame house, or a building of scaled, rusty brick—without feeling they were all so toylike and so tender that he could punch holes through the flat, blank walls with his toe, reach over to where the spires and ramparts of Manhattan lay sustained in mist and morning like something fragile, corklike, floating in the water, and reap the whole thing down with a single movement of his arm, gather them together in a single grip and pull them up as easily as if they had been a handful of quilled onions.",

Ahead on the right is a concentration of cairns, chambered cairns, hut circles, standing stone, and stone circles. I walk down the unrideable, rutted dirt road to see these things, visiting some of them. After a kilometre, I have no will to continue. I spy the stone circles in the distance, give up, and drag myself back to the main road. I soldier along for another thirteen kilometres, at every turn hoping for a B&B, a camp ground, or anything to get me out of this cold wind. My prayers are finally answered when I arrive at Catacol Bay and the Catacol Bay Hotel. It is in the middle of nowhere and my last hope. I crawl up the front stairs to the bar and ask if they have a room. They do. It is mine for two nights.",

This bright thing, the core of him, his Stranger, kept twisting its head about, unable to look at horror, until at length it gazed steadfastly, as if under a dreadful hypnosis, into the eyes of death and darkness. And his soul plunged downward, drowning in that deep pit: he felt that he could never again escape from this smothering flood of pain and ugliness, from the eclipsing horror and pity of it all. And as he walked, he twisted his own neck about, and beat the air with his arm like a wing, as if he had received a blow in his kidneys. He felt that he might be clean and free if he could only escape into a single burning passion – hard, and hot, and glittering – of love, hatred, terror, or disgust. But he was caught, he was strangling, in the web of futility there was no moment of hate that was not touched by a dozen shafts of pity: impotently, he wanted to seize them, cuff them, shake them, as one might a trying brat, and at the same time to caress them, love them, comfort them.",

I remember Ulitsa Gagarina, after the pioneer cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, and Ulitsa Tereshkovoi, after Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman cosmonaut. From a bridge over the river at the edge of town, we could see women and girls standing on a clothes-washing platform half submerged along the riverbank. They had their skirts up to their thighs and were splashing and treading barefoot on the clothes as the suds floated downstream. Lena showed me ruins of dairy barns and silos and said that agriculture in the region, which had flourished in her youth, had been disintegrating recently.",

I recall them chiefly as textures, sensations, resistances, planes and slopes: the tactile details of a landscape that often pass unnoticed. They are durably imprinted memories, these footnotes, born of the skin of the walker meeting the skin of the land. I remember a hot path across boulder clay: the earth smooth and star-cracked by sun, so that I walked with constellations and fault-lines underfoot. I remember crossing a freshly ploughed field, where the harrow had crushed the soil and the sun had warmed it, such that stepping into it was like treading ash from a fire several hours dead. Walking barefoot, you are freshly sensitive to the nap of a landscape. Grass suddenly feels wide and burnished: its blades flattened together to create a cool surface.",

Given our lack of interaction with the local populace, we might as well be. The jerky was a lastminute inspiration when I was scrounging around for something snacklike to pack in Roxanne’s trunk that wouldn’t melt, wouldn’t get stale, and yet would be appetizing to eat. I thank goodness for it every day, as it’s often the only bit of protein that passes my lips. The gorp I made myself, picking out every ingredient that I imagined I’d like to taste in the middle of a desert. It abounds with hazel nuts, almonds, salted pepitas, dried sour cherries and cranberries, sweet golden raisins, and bittersweet chocolate chips. The chocolate chips both amaze and disturb me, as despite the heat, they never change shape. Whenever I offer some to Bernard I can’t resist referencing other bizarre candy behavior, saying in a chirpy voice: “Melts in your mouth, not in your hands!”",

    "target_paragraph": "Towards the end of June there were frequent excursions.\nInto all the gatherings at Waldstrasse the outside world came like a presence. It removed the sense of pressure, of being confronted and challenged. Everything that was said seemed to be incidental to it, like remarks dropped in a low tone between individuals at a great conference.\nMiriam wondered again and again whether her companions shared this sense with her. Sometimes when they were all sitting together she longed to ask, to find out, to get some public acknowledgment of the magic that lay over everything. At times it seemed as if could they all be still for a moment—it must take shape. It was everywhere, in the food, in the fragrance rising from the opened lid of the tea-urn, in all the needful unquestioned movements, the requests, the handings and thanks, the going from room to room, the partings and assemblings. It hung about the fabrics and fittings of the house. Overwhelmingly it came in through oblongs of window giving on to stairways. Going upstairs in the light pouring in from some uncurtained window, she would cease for a moment to breathe.\nWhenever she found herself alone she began to sing, softly. When she was with others a head drooped or lifted, the movement of a hand, the light falling along the detail of a profile could fill her with happiness.\nIt made companionship a perpetual question. At rare moments there would come a tingling from head to foot, a faint buzzing at her lips and at the tip of each finger. At these moments she could raise her eyes calmly to those about her and drink in the fact of their presence, see them all with perfect distinctness, but without distinguishing one from the other. She wanted to say, “Isn’t it extraordinary? Do you realise?” She felt that if only she could make her meaning clear all difficulties must vanish. Outside in the open, going forward to some goal through sunny mornings, gathering at inns, wading through the scented undergrowth of the woods, she would dream of the secure return to Waldstrasse, their own beleaguered place. She saw it opening out warm and familiar back and back to the strange beginning in the winter. They would be there again to-night, singing.",

What I remembered of it was driving through endless miles of ghettos, one battered block after another, on a hot July Sunday, with black children playing in the spray of fire hydrants and older people lounging around on the street corners or sitting on the front stoops. It was the poorest place I had ever seen. Trash lay in the gutters and doorways, and whole buildings were derelict. It was like a foreign country, like Haiti or Panama. My dad whistled tunelessly through his teeth the whole time, as he always did when he was uneasy, and told us to keep the windows rolled up even though it was boiling in the car. At stop lights people would stare stonily at us and Dad would whistle in double time and drum the steering wheel with his fingers and smile apologetically at anyone who looked at him, as if to say, ‘Sorry, we’re from out of state.’",

Since there are no public bathrooms available on the streets of India, there’s no place to relieve oneself in an emergency—unless, of course, you’re cow, dog, or man, and in that case the toilet is everywhere, anytime. Walking all day, every day meant we had no bathroom handy, no hotel to dash back to, doing the Delhi belly toilet tango. Getting sick was not an option. Still, the man didn’t understand, and he kept pushing the tray at us, urging us to drink, because we’d walked such a long way and must be thirsty. To save us, Ajit downed all three cups of water in quick succession.",

They didn’t share our view that every moment’s delay must be to the thief’s advantage. The proper steps had to be taken, in the right order. Firstly, the Izcuchaca Superintendent had to wire a detailed report of the theft to his CO at Abancay. Secondly, the CO, having considered the report, had to wire back his authorisation for action to be taken. Thirdly, only a Seite policeman could go to the relevant village of Ocasacancpa, which is in the sub-district of Seite. (We’d passed Seite, a hamlet just off the carretera, a few minutes after being picked up.) Fourthly, before walking the three miles to Ocasacancpa the Seite policeman would have to travel twelve miles in the other direction, whenever he could squeeze onto one of the area’s infrequent truck-buses, to receive in person a search warrant from the Izcuchaca Superintendent. ‘A dull hopelessness’ is the appropriate cliché for my reaction to all this; by the time the search for Juana began, she could be half-way to Lake Titicaca where there is a keen demand for good mules. La Policia are hampered in rural Peru not only by their low average IQ but by the lack of telephones and motor transport. The Superintendent here has his own private Volkswagen but he won’t ever use it for official purposes.",

He is indeed an astute animal. Normally he never stops to shake himself more than once a day, but today he chanced to shake after I had bought the straw and a little of it fell off, so I foolishly paused to give him time to eat it. Cause and effect were not lost on our Jock. Soon he stopped to shake again, turned expectantly towards the few dislodged mouthfuls and looked cheated when I cruelly picked them up and stuffed them back with the rest.",

Islam was as much a product of the intellectual ferment of late antiquity as Gnosticism, Arianism and Monophysitism, and like those heresies it had its greatest success in areas disgruntled with Byzantine rule. Many Syrians expressed opposition to Byzantium and its ruthless attempt to impose its rigid imperial theology by converting en masse to the heterodox Christian doctrine of Monophysitism; later they greeted the conquering Arab armies as liberators and many converted again, this time to Islam. No doubt they regarded the Arabs’ new creed as a small step from Monophysitism; after all, the two faiths started from a similar position: that God could not become fully human without somehow compromising his divinity.",

Forgotten was its important history for Afro-Cubans. Local people came to see it as a building supply depot, stripping off whatever they needed for their own projects. When the grillwork around every window had been stolen, every bit of ornamentation stripped from the facade, and every reusable bit of stone and concrete hauled away, what remained of the building doubled as a dumping ground.",

She looked, as she crossed the lawn to the strains of the gramophone, goddess-like, buoyant, abundant, her cornucopia running over. Bartholomew, following, blessed the power of the human body to make the earth fruitful. Giles would keep his orbit so long as she weighted him to the earth. She stirred the stagnant pool of his old heart even – where bones lay buried, but the dragon-flies shot and the grass trembled as Mrs. Manresa advanced across the lawn to the strains of the gramophone.",

Most of these were now in what Melanie called “catastrophic retreat.” Unlike the glaciers that covered much of the American Midwest twenty thousand years ago and created the Bering Land Bridge, Glacier Bay’s ice is the product of a rather recent phenomenon, the Little Ice Age. This period of unusually cool temperatures lasted roughly from 1300 to 1850 and is known primarily for its effects in Europe. The River Thames frequently froze over solid enough that London winter carnivals were held atop its ice. In 1644, the French alpine village of Les Bois summoned the bishop of Geneva to combat an ice river that was advancing at a rate of “over a musket shot every day.”",

Clearly, this Calabrian was quite a capable individual, but I couldn’t help but think that five hundred years from now when the ‘Ndrangheta will hopefully be no more than a parenthesis in Calabrian history, there will be town councils erecting monuments to the thugs.",

His arrival was greeted with weary indifference. A wizened old woman squatting next to me stared resolutely out towards the mountains, fanning herself with a sports journal. A small crowd of men gathered around the conductor and driver as they worked on the repair. Eventually we filed back on board, shuffling over the debris that had spilled into the aisle—pips, orange peels, soggy plastic bags. By the time the driver turned his key in the ignition the windows had taken on the soft golden hue of late afternoon. The conductor played ‘Jambalaya’ again—‘Son of a gun, we’ll have good fun on the Bayou . . .’ But all the excitement had been squeezed out of us. The old man looked blankly ahead at the seat in front of him. I leaned against the sun-warmed window and watched as the bus wound its way slowly onward.",

The mill still worked on, food being a perennial necessity; the abbey had perished, creeds being transient. One continually sees the ministration of the temporary outlasting the ministration of the eternal. Their walk having been circuitous they were still not far from the house, and in obeying his direction she only had to reach the large stone bridge across the main river, and follow the road for a hundred yards. When she got back everything remained as she had left it, the fire being still burning. She did not stay downstairs for more than a few moments, but proceeded to her chamber, whither the luggage had been taken. Here she sat down on the edge of the bed, looking vacantly around, and presently began to undress. In removing the light towards the bedstead its rays fell upon the tester of white dimity; something was hanging beneath it, and she lighted the candle to see what it was. A bough of mistletoe. Angel had put it there; she knew that in an instant. This was the explanation of that mysterious parcel which it had been so difficult to pack and bring; whose contents he would not explain to her, saying that time would soon show her the purpose thereof. In his zest and his gaiety he had hung it there. How foolish and inopportune that mistletoe looked now.",

So I wedge the tape in as firmly as I can and grouchily reinflate the still every half hour. Each time, the still begins to slump as soon as I stop pumping. Water begins to collect in the distillate bag, but it is salty. At this pace, I already feel like I have a case of lockjaw, and my mouth is very dry. I must find an effective solution.

It was 1969, the summer of Woodstock, but the flyers for the festival plastered around Greenwich Village mentioned an admission charge. That sounded lame to us—some kind of artsy-craftsy weekend for old people—so we skipped it. (My newsman’s intuition, never great, was then unborn.) I kept uninteresting journals. Domenic, a nascent photographer, was in his Walker Evans period, shooting white street kids in South Philly, runaway girls asleep on the banks of the Mississippi. Years later, Domenic’s first wife, a worldly Frenchwoman, refused to believe that we slept chastely side by side all summer in that van. We did, though, and our friendship flourished in the daily onslaught of the unfamiliar. I felt less compelled to self-mock; Domenic seemed relieved to be rid of the popularity that defined him at school. We relied on each other completely; the perils and the laughs were shared. In Chicago we met a scary guy who we later decided must have been Charles Manson. I got served my first drink in a bar—it was a Tom Collins—in New Orleans. I read Edith Hamilton’s translation of The Odyssey propped on the steering wheel while driving across North Dakota. We got too close to grizzly bears in the Canadian Rockies. We surfed only twice that summer—once on borrowed boards in Mexico, and once in East Coast slop in Jacksonville Beach, Florida.",

    "target_paragraph": "My allotted time in Dordrecht almost up, I walked along the river bank to a floating metal pontoon, where the Waterbus ferry service to Rotterdam was already waiting. I’d seen the same boat pass through Rotterdam at the height of summer, overloaded with middle-aged Dutch couples with bicycles and picnic baskets. Today, on an overcast Tuesday morning, I had the boat almost to myself, shared only with three lost-looking Polish men in tracksuits. Pausing on the gangplank, I bought a ticket from a young crewman who was dressed in a smart sailor’s outfit, but apparently shared the common Dutch belief that there was no such thing as too much hair gel. When I asked for a ticket to Rotterdam, he requested I confirm my destination twice before obliging. ‘Yes,’ I said in Dutch and then in English, ‘all the way to Rotterdam.’ Fifteen minutes from Dordrecht by train but more than an hour away by boat, Rotterdam was an unusual destination at this time of year: a long haul on a vessel that was too slow for commuters and too cold for tourists.",
