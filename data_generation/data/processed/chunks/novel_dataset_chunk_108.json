Overcanvased even with three reefs in the main and no jib, Varuna began rounding up into the wind and getting slapped broadside by confused waves that filled the cockpit, as streaks of electric light crackled down to the water around us. Too tired to think straight, I couldn’t find another ounce of energy to change the sail configuration again, and decided to let Varuna lie ahull under bare poles for the duration of whatever was about to happen. Dousing the mainsail and lashing it along the boom?a sloppy, wet ordeal in all this wind?I crawled below for some relief, hoping it wouldn’t get much worse. Behind me, I pulled down a large piece of canvas attached to the spray hood to protect the open companionway from spray. A more alert mind would have made the decision to close the companionway altogether with the Plexiglas slats.",

And then, straight off the bow, he saw the masts of a schooner running fast before the wind. Bartlett reached for a pair of binoculars, peered through them—and immediately recognized the King and Winge. His pulse quickened and his mind raced with different scenarios. “I hoped … she had been to the island, or she would hardly be coming back so soon. Then I began to fear that perhaps she had broken a propeller and was now taking advantage of the favoring wind to put for Bering Strait and Alaska.”",

One descended to this place down a steep flight of stairs from the street, and on bitter nights he would find the place crowded with homeless men who had sought refuge there. Some were those shambling hulks that one sees everywhere, in Paris as well as New York, in good times as well as bad--old men, all rags and bags and long white hair and bushy beards stained dirty yellow, wearing tattered overcoats in the cavernous pockets of which they carefully stored away all the little rubbish they lived on and spent their days collecting in the streets--crusts of bread, old bones with rancid shreds of meat still clinging to them, and dozens of cigarette-butts. Some were the \"stumble bums\" from the Bowery, criminal, fumed with drink or drugs, or half insane with \"smoke\". But most of them were just flotsam of the general ruin of the time--honest, decent, middle-aged men with faces seamed by toil and want, and young men, many of them mere boys in their teens, with thick, unkempt hair. These were the wanderers from town to town, the riders of freight trains, the thumbers of rides on highways, the uprooted, unwanted male population of America. They drifted across the land and gathered in the big cities when winter came, hungry, defeated, empty, hopeless, restless, driven by they knew not what, always on the move, looking everywhere for work, for the bare crumbs to support their miserable lives, and finding neither work nor crumbs. Here in New York, to this obscene meeting-place, these derelicts came, drawn into a common stew of rest and warmth and a little surcease from their desperation.",

From this piazza, through the battlemented archway, I can reach the square of the cathedral with its seven towers. I like the feel of the herringbone-patterned bricks under my thin sandals. I wander up and down steep hills, arched alleys, passing old men and women with canes. I never want to leave. My terraced hilltop room looks out over roofs and towers and blessed hills to the Val d'Eisa. I am beginning to believe the Annunciation did take place here. Art plagiarizes nature. I want to fly, as Cellini wanted to fly, “on a pair of wings made of waxed linen.” And I want to stay here, rooted, forever.",

There was plenty to think about as I made my way through the snow-bound monastic orchards; and it occurred to me, in the silent fields that followed, and for the hundredth time since my landing in Holland, that so far one painter had presided over every stage of this Winterreise. When no buildings were in sight, I was back in the Dark Ages. But the moment a farmhouse or a village impinged, I was in the world of Peter Brueghel. The white flakes falling beside the Waal – or the Rhine or the Neckar or the Danube – and the zigzag gables and the muffled roofs, were all his. The icicles, too, and the trampled snow, the logs piled on the sledges and the peasants stooped double under loads of faggots. When children with woollen hoods and satchels burst out of a village school with a sudden scamper of miniature clogs, I knew in advance that in a moment they would be flapping their arms and blowing on mittened fingers and clearing a space to beat a top in, or galloping down a lane to slide on the nearest brook, with everyone – children, grown-ups, cattle and dogs – moving about in the wake of their own cloudy breath. When the wintry light crept dimly from slits close to the horizon or an orange sun was setting through the branches of a frozen osier-bed, the identity was complete.",

    "target_paragraph": "The blind priest, Hoichi lived in the Amida Temple. As he was too famous as a biwa priest, the ghosts of the Heike clan should like to listen to his biwa (lute) and came out secretly one night. The warriors sitting in a row waited on Hoichi in a dignified. Someone commanded, ‘Welcome. Please play and talk the state of the battle of Dannoura.’ When Hoichi did so, the warriors who assumed a grave air were shedding tears and the ladies were in a blubber. ‘We’ve been very satisfied with your performance this night. Please come and play tomorrow and the day after tomorrow for a week night.’ Hoichi was asked so, and bid farewell to them. Thus, as he kept going out every night, the priests in the temple noticed his suspicious action. The priests were keeping watch for Hoichi with bated breath from behind of a sliding door. They followed him at once but he disappeared. When they returned to the Temple inevitably, the sounds of biwa was heard loudly in the wood. They ran up to him in a great hurry pushing aside grass. Hoichi with a grim look seated alone in front of the graves in darkness and played the biwa with all his might. The friar’s lanterns flickered around him and the ghastly scene was too ugly to look at. They felt a shudder in spite of their social position of the priests. They woke up and brought back him. When they told everything to a Buddhist priest in the Amida Temple, he was very surprised. ‘The ghosts of the Heike clan having a grudge are about to take away to the beyond,’ he told Hoichi and wrote down the Hannyashin sutra on Hoichi’s whole body. On that night, when Hoichi seated alone as usual, he sensed the ghosts coming up at last night. The lukewarm wind blew and the steps stopped in front of him. While Hoichi wondered. He was called, ‘Hoichi!’ Though the ghosts called Hoichi in a loud voice again, they could listen to nothing. ‘We can’t listen to his voice and watch even his figure to night.’ When they saw casually they could see only his ears in the darkness. They hold his ears with their cold and iron hands, and pluck off them. Then they left somewhere. The Buddhist priest thought that Hoichi had been safe very today. But he was surprised. ‘Oh,’ he was petrified vacantly. He watched at Hoichi’s loosing his own ear and murmured, ‘Oh, I was under the impression that I had written the Buddhist scriptures on his whole body, but forgot writing on only his ear.’ Since then, this is called ‘Earless Hoichi’.",

Today Cairo has a large Coptic population, possibly numbering as many as three million out of the total of fifteen million, but the Copts lie scattered about the poorer suburbs – where, as fate would have it, the more aggressive fundamentalist factions can also be found.",

But verse was different. Murmuring on the highway caused raised eyebrows and a look of anxious pity. Passages, uttered with gestures and sometimes quite loud, provoked, if one was caught in the act, stares of alarm. Regulus brushing the delaying populace aside as he headed for the Carthaginian executioner, as though to Lacedaemonian Tarentum or the Venafrian fields, called for a fairly mild flourish; but urging the assault-party at Harfleur to close the wall up with English dead would automatically bring on a heightened pitch of voice and action and double one’s embarrassment if caught. When this happened I would try to taper off in a cough or weave the words into a tuneless hum and reduce all gestures to a feint at hair-tidying. But some passages demand an empty road as far as the eye can see before letting fly. The terrible boxing-match, for instance, at the funeral games of Anchises when Entellus sends Dares reeling and spitting blood and teeth across the Sicilian shore – ‘ore ejectantem mixtosque in sanguine dentes’! – and then, with his thonged fist, scatters a steer’s brains with one blow between the horns – this needs care. As for the sword-thrust at the bridge-head that brings the great lord of Luna crashing among the augurs like an oak-tree on Mount Alvernus – here the shouts, the walking-stick slashes, the staggering gait and the arms upflung should never be indulged if there is anyone within miles, if then. To a strange eye, one is drunk or a lunatic.",

A UHT carton of milk that had survived since Malta had exploded, spewing forth a vile lumpy white mixture that covered the bottles of oil and vinegar, wood splints, cans and the rest of its neighbors. As a result, I killed two good hours lugging buckets of water into the cabin, keeping them balanced with Varuna’s motions, shoving a curious Tarzoon out of the way and scrubbing and drying all the contaminated objects and the locker itself. Two days later, with the first inkling of the malodorous scent, I knew where to look when my last carton of milk expired in yet another glorious ascent to milk heaven.",

At last they reached the yoke of the hills, and before them opened another valley, green and wild, and beyond it more blue heights eddying away to the sky like the waves of a receding tide.",

He kept giving good advice and speaking the truth, often reviled or ignored, as events tumbled forward around him. He graduated from Princeton, joined the Foreign Service, observed the rise of Nazism from his posting in Berlin, and spent six months interned there after the United States and Germany went to war. When peace arrived, he helped design Allied policy for Europe and became deputy chief of the U.S. embassy in Moscow. A long memo he sent by telegram, later published anonymously in Foreign Affairs, provided the basis for NATO’s policy of containment, the anti-Soviet strategy pursued in various forms throughout the Cold War. As a State Department official in Washington, he saw the approach of the Korean War and offered sound suggestions (unheeded) for avoiding it.",

This time, in lieu of swashbuckling tales of lost cities and conquered mountain peaks, he came bearing excuses, grudges and thirteen-year-old Juan Leguia, the son of the former president, whose toxically unpopular father was shipping him off to military school in Virginia. According to the version of events that Bingham chose to tell reporters, Yale’s concession had been all but forced upon him by the elder Leguia. The sudden opposition to his expedition removing artifacts had been stoked by “men who were in the business of exporting and buying archaeological things.” The officials who handed down the decree allowing him to depart with his boxes had been “as insulting to us as they possibly could be.” The whole affair had left Bingham bitter. “I can now say freely that we don’t propose to go to Peru in the near future,” he said.",

This weird phenomenon is peculiar to the high puna; it has a lethal appearance but is safe to walk on though it sounds hollow underfoot (very disconcerting!) and is criss-crossed by icy rivulets. It looks like a discreetly patterned carpet, being almost completely covered by tiny round green stemless plants, of a fascinating design.",

Yet I myself saw no unloved child, however dire a family’s circumstances, and the joy children bring to people’s lives seems like a comforting glow, warming and illuminating shackland. When we visited Lucretia’s home her younger sister’s infant was having his nappy changed by a 15-year-old uncle who dotes extravagantly on his nephew. That lad is very much a Young Lion; but here it seems carrying a baby around, and playing with it in public, does not mar one’s leonine image.",

The atmosphere was perfectly pure, and suffused with rose-colour, not a cloud-fleece hung round the mountain tops, hoar-frost whitened the ground, the pure, white smoke of the volcano rose into the reddening sky, and the air was elixir. It has been said and written that there are no steam-cracks or similar traces of volcanic action on Mauna Kea, but in several fissures I noticed ferns growing belonging to an altitude 4000 feet lower, and on putting my arm down, found a heat which compelled me to withdraw it, and as the sun rose these cracks steamed in all directions. There are caves full of ferns, lava bubbles in reality, crust over crust, each from twelve to eighteen inches thick, rolls of lava cooled in coils, and hideous a-a streams on which it is impossible to walk two yards without the risk of breaking one's limbs or cutting one's boots to pieces.",

Even the Amur, whose general inclination is to the northeast and whose destination is the Pacific, empties into the stormy Sea of Okhotsk. In the spring, north-flowing rivers thaw upstream while they’re still frozen at their mouths. This causes them to back up. This creates swamps. Western Siberia has the largest swamps in the world. In much of Siberia, the land doesn’t do much of anything besides gradually sag northward to the Arctic. The rivers of western Siberia flow so slowly that they hardly seem to move at all. There, the rivers run muddy; in eastern Siberia, with its real mountains and sharper drop to the Pacific, many of the rivers run clear.",

Ed dedicates the morning to squeezing silicone around the windows. He runs into town to pick up tonight’s first course, crespelle, from the fresh pasta shop. The delicate crêpes are filled with truffles and cream. Our menu after the crespelle: a warm salad of porcini, roasted red peppers, and field lettuces, grilled veal chops, the local cardoons with béchamel and toasted hazelnuts. For dessert, a family cake I know by heart and castagnaccio, the classic Tuscan chestnut flour cake. My neighbor says not to try it. Her grandmother used to make it when they were very poor. “All it takes is chestnut flour, olive oil, and water,” she says, grimacing. “My grandmother said that they always had those. They flavored it with rosemary and some pine nuts, fennel seeds, and raisins if they had some.” I’ve never worked with chestnut flour, an ingredient I’d considered esoteric until I learned that it was a staple of la cucina povera. This recipe is decidedly weird. As my neighbor indicates, it must be one of those acquired tastes.",

I suppose there are few walks in the world more wholly beautiful from beginning to end. On no account, therefore, should the traveller, all unsuspecting of so much beauty so near at hand, be persuaded to go to Stubbenkammer by road. The road will give him merely a pretty country drive, taking him the shortest way, quite out of sight of the sea; the path keeps close to the edge of the cliffs, and is a series of exquisite surprises. But only the lusty and the spare must undertake it, for it is not to be done under three hours, and is an almost continual going down countless steps into deep ravines, and up countless steps out of them again. You are, however, in the shade of beeches the whole time; and who shall describe, as you climb higher and higher, the lovely sparkle and colour of the sea as it curls, far below you, in and out among the folds of the cliffs?",
