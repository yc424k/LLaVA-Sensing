Atlanta, by contrast, had a very global population, but still seemed locked in the black-and-white tensions, the North-South issues of Victoria’s time. Though home to many multinationals—from UPS to Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines to Home Depot—it reminded me in every breath that all the multinationals in the world don’t add up to real internationalism.",

The composition disintegrates, the stones are dead, you and a million lizards move in a sun-split devastation where once, you cannot remember how long ago, there had been the good green of memory and Rome; it is all over forever; it was finished a million years ago.

Before long, tourism would account for 10 per cent of Indonesia’s GDP and nearly half of all foreign visitors to the country would make their way through Bali’s international airport. Occupying only 5632 square kilometres, Bali had become a crucial economic hub, and the island’s standard of living far outstripped the rest of the archipelago’s. If you had a vision and a dream, you came to Bali to build your empire. And if you were building a gay empire, you were almost guaranteed a good return.",

All I could think was, Good Lord, here I am barefoot, so I called to you to throw me my shoes and then the machete. You yelled something like, “Don’t leave me,” and I thought, What the hell? Who’s leaving who? And then you went over the falls. I thanked God when I saw you bob up a long way downriver, still clinging to the raft. I quickly put my shoes on, picked up the machete, and started walking along the rocky shore. I was sure that I’d catch up with you that day or the day after.",

Aided by the treacherous Cacique Matambo, who betrayed his people for silver, they readily crushed the remnants of the revolt, then moved on to destroy every vestige of indigenous life in the entire upper Magdalena. The Páez would survive, hidden away along the high crests of the Cordillera Central, on the snow flanks of Huila, and in the valley of the river that today bears their name. The Andaquí, originally from Timaná, the hills of San Agustín, and the mountain valleys reaching to the source of the Magdalena, escaped to the east, following the Caquetá into the lowlands, where they were slowly consumed by the forest. By 1851 a mere 630 men, women, and children had survived, from a nation that had once scattered warriors by the hundreds across every flank of the Macizo Colombiano and beyond. Of all the other tribal nations mentioned in the early Spanish documents—the Chumepa, Cambi, Yacua, Otongo, and many others—we know very little, their only legacy being a few place-names appearing still on maps of the country.",

Yet this is done without affected gusto, gourmandising, sighs, or smackings and lickings of the lips.

    "target_paragraph": "It is from here that the work really begins. They are here, this year, to try to find the best way up Everest. To do this, they must unlock the mysteries of the mountain and its satellite peaks; must decipher its geography. Days and then weeks are spent mapping, probing, photographing, hurdling the ridges that radiate out from the hub of the massif. Each ounce of information about the mountain is gained through graft. On the good days they wake early – the sunlight at dawn moves across the campsite like a tide flowing in, inky on one side and gold on the other – and walk for ten or a dozen hours, often carrying heavy photographic equipment. It is not easy going. There is the altitude and the temperature, to begin with. And the Rongbuk glacier doesn’t provide the walkway to the base of the mountain that it promised from afar. As Mallory quickly discovers, the glaciers in this part of the world – nearer the equator – are not as pedestrian-friendly as Alpine glaciers. Here, the ice has been wrought by the overhead sun into densely clustered forests of ice pinnacles, some of them fifty feet high, the ice beneath them fissured into a labyrinth of crevasses and pressure ridges. ‘The White Rabbit himself would have been bewildered here,’ writes Mallory. He soon realizes that progress is best to be made away from this weird scape of icy stalactites, up on the lateral moraines of the glaciers; though these routes have their own dangers, threatened as they are by rock- and ice-fall from the cliffs above.",

As volatile oils, they start from the ground; afterwards, when the sun has warmed the withered plants, each one begins to breathe out its characteristic odour. It is rather hard to analyse this fragrant multi-herbal emanation: I suspect that the dried fennel-stalks are the ‘Leitmotif’ in the symphony. The cistus bushes, whose frail purple and white roses would enchant a Japanese artist, give forth a pungent aroma when the sun beats upon them; other spots are dominated by the honey-sweet savour of scorched thistles, of the wild juniper which, nowadays, can be seen to full perfection only on the inaccessible crags of Montalto, or the common fig. Those persons who are so curiously insensible to this last odour should go to a certain mossy court-yard overshadowed by gnarled fig trees and heavily permeated by their cloying scent: pleasant were the November hours spent here long years ago when nothing to the purpose was said, and every now and then a dry leaf, falling upon the pavement with a metallic clang, startled the tongue-tied ones into a full consciousness of their own thoughts...",

Although Aboriginal people could have directed me to the rockholes, there was nothing marked on the maps. But, and I felt stupid feeling this way, I didn’t want to see Rick’s fresh tyre-tracks all the way. I was more concerned for his safety than I was for my own. If that car broke down… I made sure he had enough water for himself, so that if that did occur, I could meet him along the track and take him with me. Glendle had also insisted that he drop two drums of water for me half way along the track. He had to drive a total of 800 wretched miles over spinifex and sand to do this – such is the quality of friends.",

Anyhow, a dog was there, weaving himself in and out amongst people’s legs in that mute stealthy way native dogs have, and my companion stumbled over him. The dog leaped away without a sound; the man, raising his voice a little, said with a slow laugh, “Look at that wretched cur,” and directly afterwards we became separated by a lot of people pushing in. I stood back for a moment against the wall while the stranger managed to get down the steps and disappeared. I saw Jim spin round. He made a step forward and barred my way. We were alone; he glared at me with an air of stubborn resolution. I became aware I was being held up, so to speak, as if in a wood. The verandah was empty by then, the noise and movement in court had ceased: a great silence fell upon the building, in which, somewhere far within, an oriental voice began to whine abjectly. The dog, in the very act of trying to sneak in at the door, sat down hurriedly to hunt for fleas.",

Apart from the workers, scores of men, women and children walk for miles every day just to watch, and they feel that this machine which moves mountains must be operated by some high-powered magic, lately discovered through the cleverness and virtue of their Prince. Frequently, during our picnic, Ras Mangasha leaped to his feet and yelled frantic warnings at open-mouthed onlookers who had chosen to stand and stare in the path of lethal boulders. As Leilt Aida remarked, these recurrent dramas were very bad for everyone’s digestion. Not to mention the fact that from our angle the bulldozer itself looked in imminent danger of following the rocks.",

    "target_paragraph": "CARYN DID FIND HER FATHER. It was the following year, in San Francisco. We had both fled Maui for the civilizing precincts of college. I was back in Santa Cruz, she was living nearby, and we were no longer a couple. My grief over our breakup felt bottomless. I was not always reasonable. Still, Caryn called me after she found Sam, and we went back to see him together. He was living in a hotel on Sixth Street—skid row. We talked our way upstairs. The halls stank of piss, dried sweat, mildew, curry. Caryn knocked on a door. No answer. She called to him. “Dad? It’s me. It’s Caryn.” After several minutes of silence, Sam opened the door. He looked bewildered and unwell. A short, wiry-haired, sad-eyed man. He didn’t smile or reach for his daughter. A homemade chessboard, drawn on the side of a grocery bag, was on the bed, set with pieces made from bottle caps and cigarette butts. He appeared to have been playing alone. I left them to it. I walked the tragic warehouse streets, past winos sleeping in alleys. The Jones Hotel, the Oak Tree Hotel, the Rose. This couldn’t be Sam’s world, after a monastery on Maui. Later, we all went out to a dank cafeteria. Sam and I played chess. Caryn watched, her face a mask of sorrow. I tried to think about the moves. Sam played carefully. His few comments were measured, well chosen. Nobody cried, or said anything barbed. There would be time, I assumed, for that. I wouldn’t be there. Still, I wondered what Sam, mental illness and all, might have to tell us about adulthood. Why, for example, did it seem to be always receding as a concept, even as we got older?",

The moon was waning then and would return only at monthly intervals, so that left only that single hour between sunset and full dark between its fulls, and weariness was an antidote for that. And weariness was cheap: he not only had the note he had given Will Varner for the loan, but there had been some trouble with the installment people who did not want to take the furniture back. So he farmed again, finding gradually how much he had forgotten about it. Thus, at times he would have actually forgotten that hour he dreaded until he would find himself entering it, walking into it, finding it suddenly upon him, drowning him with suffocation. Then that stubborn part of her and sometimes even of the son which perhaps next year they would have would be everywhere about the house he had built to please her even though it was empty now of all the objects she had touched and used and looked at except the stove and the kitchen table and the one garment—not a nightgown or an undergarment, but the gingham dress which resembled the one in which he had first seen her that day at the school—and the window itself, so that even on the hottest evenings of summer he would sit in the sweltering kitchen while the negro man cooked supper, drinking whiskey from a stone jug and tepid water from the cedar bucket and talking louder and louder, profane, intolerant, argumentative, with no challenge to be rebutted and no challenger to be vanquished and overcome.",

I remarked that since November the pace of demolition had quickened; nearby we could see a new open area, strewn with rubble and garbage and overlooked by high Baroque ruins (too ruinous for restoration) awaiting ‘the ball’. Recent changes troubled this mulatto couple, both born in Old Havana – Fabian three weeks early, in January 1959, his mother having been over-excited by the Revolution’s success.

    "target_paragraph": "Batna, 26 April 11 P.M.\nI am feeling depressed tonight in a way I cannot define. I feel lonely without Ouïha, and cannot stand the boredom. Yesterday’s storm has left Batna inundated, dark and freezing, and it is full of mud and filthy gutters. My poor Souf is very ill, so that I cannot even go for my strolls along the open road, or up to that desolate graveyard where damaged tombs, terrifying windows upon the spectacle of human dust, lie scattered among the fragrant tufts of grey chih near a green meadow full of purple flax, white anemones and scarlet poppies in full bloom.\nThe other day I wandered around among a crowd of Muslims brandishing the flags of ancient religious ceremonial occasions; to the accompaniment of tambours and flutes they prayed for rain, for an extension of their fleeting Algerian spring which already, in its haste to move on, is blending summer flowers with those of spring.\nAfter six long days of only seeing Rouh for brief and furtive moments by the gate of the hated barracks where he is quartered, he came to see me yesterday.… I held him in my arms and after the first wild, almost savage embrace, tears ran down our cheeks, and each of us felt a very mysterious fear, even though neither of us had said a word or knew why.\nI realised yesterday once again how honest and beautiful is my Slimène’s soul, because of his joy that Augustin was making up with me and was doing justice to us both. In spite of my past, present and future misfortunes I bless God and my destiny for having brought me to this desert and given me to this man, who is my only solace, my only reason for happiness in this whole world.\nI have often been hard on him and unfair, I have been impatient for no good reason, so insane as to hit him, although secretly ashamed because he did not strike back but merely smiled at my blind rage. Afterwards I always feel truly miserable and disgusted with myself for the injustice I might have committed.\nThis afternoon I went to see the police official who is without a doubt an enemy spy in charge of keeping an eye on me. He was the first to come out with the theory that P was the one who had wanted me killed, and that the murderer was bound to go scotfree. If so, that means I am doomed to die anywhere I go in the South, which is the only place where we can live.\nIf the crime committed at Behima is only slightly punished or not at all, that will amount to a clear signal to the Tidjanyas: “Go ahead and kill Si Mahmoud, you have nothing to fear.”\nYet God did stay the assassin’s hand once, and Abdallah’s sabre was deflected. If God wants me to die a martyr, God’s will is bound to find me wherever I am. If not, the plots of all those who conspire against me will be their undoing.\nI am not afraid of death, but would not want to die in some obscure or pointless way. Having seen death close up, and having felt the brush of its black and icy wings, I know that its proximity means instant renunciation of the things of this world. I also know that my nerves and willpower will hold out in times of great personal ordeals, and that I will never give my enemies the satisfaction of seeing me run in cowardice or fear.\nYet, as I think of the future, there is one thing that does frighten me: misfortunes that might befall Slimène or Augustin. Faced with those, I would have no strength whatsoever. It would be hard to imagine worse poverty than the kind I am up against right now: yet the only reason it worries me is that our debts stand to spell disaster for Slimène.\nFortunately, my enemies think I am rich. I was right to spend money the way I did two years ago, here and in Biskra, for a reputation of wealth is just as useful for our defence as actual wealth would have been. Oh, if those rascals were to know that I am utterly destitute and that the slightest humiliation could be my undoing, they would not hesitate for a moment!\nIt is obvious that they are afraid. Otherwise they would arrest me as a spy, or expel me.\nI was right to account for the wretched way I live down here as mere eccentricity: that way, it is not too obvious that I am in fact destitute.\nI have begun to make a point of going to people’s houses to eat, for the sole purpose of keeping fit, something that would have been anathema in the old days, like the other thing I have been doing lately, namely going to see marabouts, just to beg them for money.\nI must have an iron constitution, for my health is holding up contrary to all expectation: those frightening last days in El Oued, the injury, the shock to the nervous system and the haemorrhage in Behima, the hospital, the journey, half of which I made on foot, my poverty here, the cold and the poor diet, which mostly consists of bread, none of that has got me down. How long will I be able to hold out?\nHow can one explain the fact that at home, where I had warm clothes, an outstandingly healthy diet, and Mummy’s idolatrous care, the slightest chill I caught would degenerate into bronchitis; whereas here, having suffered freezing temperatures at El Oued, and at the hospital as well, having travelled in all kinds of weather, while literally always getting wet feet, going around in thin clothes and torn shoes, I don’t even catch a cold?\nThe human body is nothing, the human soul is all.\nWhy do I adore Rouh’s eyes so? Not for their shape or colour, but for the sweet and guileless radiance in their expression, which is what makes them beautiful.\nThe way I see it, there is no greater spiritual beauty than fanaticism, of a sort so sincere it can only end in martyrdom.",
