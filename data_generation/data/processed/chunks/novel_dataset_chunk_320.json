Dürer and Holbein, although they are from the near-Danubian towns of Nuremberg and Augsburg, are not included: the one is too universal, the other, perhaps, too sophisticated or a decade or so too late. Grünewald, geographically, is a fraction too far west and they probably need him for an equally arbitrary Rhenish School. Otherwise, he would fit in admirably. This leaves Cranach and Altdorfer: Danubian stars of the first magnitude among a swarm of lesser-known regional masters.",

Like Xandra, Jorge had gone abroad, while always remaining connected to his Latin roots. For a time he lived in London, working as a street performer, a busker playing for tips, honing his craft on the most unforgiving of musical stages, the cobblestones of Chelsea and Piccadilly. He then moved to Miami, where he formed Bacilos, a band that burst onto the scene in the late 1990s, known not only for a string of Grammy-winning hits—“Tabaco y Chanel,” “Caraluna,” “Mi primer millón”—but for creating a new sound, an inspired fusion of rock and pop with traditional music from the Caribbean coast of Colombia and the classic rhythms of salsa and merengue. With Jorge almost constantly on the road with the band, and Xandra mostly staying home, building a small greeting-card company, they remained together for eight years, until it became clear that their marriage had run its course. After an amicable divorce, Xandra went to work as a creative producer at Discovery, overseeing television productions and writing songs for Discovery Kids. A romance brought her to New York, where she became obsessed with Broadway musicals. The love affair faded, but not her passion for the theatrical genre.",

And he would search the furious streets until bone and brain and blood could stand no more – until every sinew of his life and spirit was wrung, trembling, and exhausted, and his heart sank down beneath its weight of desolation and despair.",

    "target_paragraph": "Less tangibly, the Netherlands also appeared to have little of the menace and petty aggression that plagued other countries. Living in various cities in Britain, I had become accustomed to a degree of petty crime and antisocial behaviour. Certain areas of many major cities were off-limits after dark, and wailing police sirens could be heard at all hours. Jogging home from work through London at night, I came to expect showers of abuse and hurled chips whenever I passed a group of teenagers. Dutch cities appeared to be everything British ones were not: safe, tolerant and rather quaint places where children could play in the street after dark, ride bicycles in the road, and take public transport to school on their own. In the Netherlands, bored teenagers were unfailingly polite and would never dream of wasting their chips by throwing them at strangers. There was no such thing as an area where it was foolish to walk alone at night, and the park near my house was filled with women jogging alone after dark. In several years of bar crawling, I never once saw a punch thrown. On occasions such as King’s Day and Carnival Dutch revellers would consume ungodly amounts of Heineken, but there was rarely a policeman in sight – they simply weren’t needed. Even in rougher parts of Rotterdam, retired couples would plant their small front yards with daffodils or tulips, knowing they would never be ripped up by a bored teenager or angry drunk. Serious crime was almost unheard of.",

Now, like the Eskimos, he was rolling cigarettes out of fresh tea leaves, wasting valuable tea by smoking rather than drinking it. This troubled McKinlay, but at present he mentioned it only in his diary, not wanting to fuel further discord. Malloch did not appear to be suffering physically, but, wrote McKinlay, “he lacked all vitality and had little interest in what went on around him.” Chafe and Williamson remained very ill, and with food running short already and tempers flaring, McKinlay knew that it would take all his efforts to keep Shore Camp at Icy Spit from descending into anarchy. He worried that he would not be up to the task: “A good leader might have brought out the best in everybody—Captain Bartlett had proved that. But on our own the misery and desperation of our situation multiplied every weakness, every quirk of personality, every flaw in character a thousandfold.”",

Her sentimental experience had shown her how often two people still in the act of exchanging tender or violent words are in reality at the opposite ends of the earth, and she reflected, ironically, how much success in human affairs depends on the power to detect such displacements. She herself had no such successes to her credit; hers was at best the doubtful gift of discerning, perhaps more quickly than most people, why she failed.

This immensity of arid red earth is criss-crossed with convoluted dry river-beds, and long ridges that would seem mountains almost anywhere else, and what look from a height like mere heat-cracks but are in fact deep fissures littered with jagged hunks of rosy-hued rock. An appropriately melodramatic redura took us down so fast that we could feel the air thickening as though the extra oxygen were a tangible substance. Then for miles our level path wound between clumps of young spear-cactus, their cool blue-green refreshing amidst this desiccated wilderness. The only other vegetation was a low, nasty-smelling dark green bush that not even goats will eat. Soon we were sweat-soaked and we paused often to gulp pints of sun-warmed water. The hot silence created a curiously tense atmosphere. No breeze stirred; no bird or insect flew or called; there was no movement but our own. Occasionally we glanced back in awe at the cordillera from which we had just descended, a blue, flat-topped mountain wall filling the northern sky and rising sheer from this barren ledge. For it was no more than a ledge, as we realised when without warning we were overlooking a turmoil of lesser mountains. Through a gap, we glimpsed the Mantaro canyon far below; seen from such a height, the broad brown river seemed unnaturally immobile and noiseless. Hereabouts it has carved a horseshoe loop through a phalanx of mountain massifs; from where we then stood, it was both in front of us and (though invisible to the east) behind us. To reach the little pueblo of Mayor, on its left bank, we had to descend another two thousand feet on a ladder-steep and perilously narrow path.",

It was a dusty place covered with excrement and squashed mulberries. There were flies by the million, fierce black ants and, when the sun went down, large blood-thirsty mosquitoes. The raffish youths who watched us as we slowly set up our camp, the dust and the general air of stickiness, made me think of Clapham Common and Bank Holidays.",

Flying Pigeon bicycles are everywhere, and vintage Plymouths, and hissing, rusted buses. Sometimes we stop to pick up hitchhikers, and Louis serenades them with passages from The Waste Land, ditties from the Grateful Dead, and—his latest attraction—manically pantomimed scenes from The Jerk. Bicycles, chickens, children swarm and swerve across the roads. I remember the time in Morocco when, on our way to the airport, he hit a dog.

I grab my spear and wait. Sometimes I have a little trouble focusing. During the last gale I jabbed my eye with a piece of the polypropylene line I’ve rigged to keep the still in place. After a couple of days of oozing and swelling, my eye cleared up, but I was left with a spot in my vision, which I often take to be a glimpse of an airplane or the first hint of a fish shooting out before the tip of my spear. Dorados are so fast that my shot must be instantaneous, without thought, like a bolt of lightning. A head, a microsecond of hesitation, a splash, a strike, a hard pull on my arm, and an escape. On other days I’ve hit two or three morning and evening but most of the time come up with nothing. This morning I’m lucky and catch a nice fat female. Squatting over her for two hours on the rolling floor of the raft is hard work for my matchstick legs. Finally the job is done and the fish hung up to dry. I begin to mop up the blood and scales, but my sponges have turned to useless little globs. Evidently the stomach juices that I swabbed up from the last dorado have digested them. Since my sleeping bag has proven its ability to soak up water, I take out some of the batting and bind this up with pieces of codline to use as sponges.",

Freud and Lacan dominate the bookshop windows, and, as everyone always mentions, there are three times more therapists and psychiatrists per capita in Buenos Aires than in New York State. Streetside kiosks sell magazines called “Real Problems in Psychoanalysis” and others whose covers say, simply, “Anguish”; the hot issue among the jet-setters is antidepressant drugs. What impressed me most about Argentina was not just that shrinks are as common as occultists but that both, like health clubs, are the kind of leisure-class accessory one usually associates with affluence. And as affluence grows more precarious, the need for miracles grows more intense. “We want even our politicians to be like magicians,” an Argentine told me, “just to wave a wand and make our problems disappear.”",

They give the place a fantastic outline, though not so fantastic as those of Hyderabad in Sind. The wind there always blows from the sea, and the towers project canopies to meet it. The towers of Yezd are square, and catch the wind from all four quarters by means of hollow grooves, which impel it down into chambers beneath.

We went out to a fourth little shed, which was a refreshment stall, and bought bread and sardines and chocolate and apples. Then we went on the upper deck to make our meal. In a sheltered place I lit the spirit lamp, and put on water to boil. The water we had taken from the cabin. Then we sat down alone in the darkness, on a seat which had its back against the deck cabins, now appropriated by the staff. A thin, cold wind was travelling. We wrapped the one plaid round us both and snugged together, waiting for the tea to boil. I could just see the point of the spirit-flame licking up, from where we sat.",

Roses, lilies, carnations in particular, looked over the rims of vases and surveyed the bright lives and swift dooms of their artificial relations. Mr Stuart Ormond made this very observation; and charming it was thought; and Kitty Craster married him on the strength of it six months later. But real flowers can never be dispensed with. If they could, human life would be a different affair altogether. For flowers fade; chrysanthemums are the worst; perfect over night; yellow and jaded next morning—not fit to be seen. On the whole, though the price is sinful, carnations pay best;—it’s a question, however, whether it’s wise to have them wired. Some shops advise it. Certainly it’s the only way to keep them at a dance; but whether it is necessary at dinner parties, unless the rooms are very hot, remains in dispute. Old Mrs Temple used to recommend an ivy leaf—just one—dropped in the bowl. She said it kept the water pure for days and days. But there is some reason to think that old Mrs Temple was mistaken.",

He places it face down on the table and a thin beam trickles out, falling across the wood and staining it yellow. Faustino settles in my lap. Darwin has finally gone quiet. Agustino has sat on the stool next to me and all three of us listen as the baby monkey suckles. He turns off his torch with a low click. It is so dark, I can barely make out their shapes. I feel Faustino reach out to take the milk bottle, but Agustino gives a grunt, which makes him pull his hand away miserably. My arm is really starting to throb now. I can just hear the low murmur of voices outside, the scratch of branches along the roof, the squeak of Darwin’s throat as he drinks. I try to imagine where Wayra is, but I can’t.",

It was always ‘Papa’s expecting me’ or some other excuse, she thought rather bitterly. They had gone such different ways, they had lived such different lives, since Oxford… The car slowed down. It had to take its place in the long line of cars that moved at a foot’s pace, now stopping dead, now jerking on, down the narrow street, blocked by market carts, that led to the Opera House. Men and women in full evening dress were walking along the pavement. They looked uncomfortable and self-conscious as they dodged between costers’ barrows, with their high-piled hair and their evening cloaks; with their button-holes and their white waistcoats, in the glare of the afternoon sun. The ladies tripped uncomfortably on their high-heeled shoes; now and then they put their hands to their heads. The gentlemen kept close beside them as though protecting them. It’s absurd, Kitty thought; it’s ridiculous to come out in full evening dress at this time of day. She leant back in her corner. Covent Garden porters, dingy little clerks in their ordinary working clothes, coarse-looking women in aprons stared in at her. The air smelt strongly of oranges and bananas. But the car was coming to a standstill. It drew up under the archway; she pushed through the glass doors and went in.",

    "target_paragraph": "In that oppressively gloomy hotel foyer, while writing my journal, I noticed a grey-faced, well-dressed elderly man sitting opposite, staring fixedly at a newspaper cutting. His hands were trembling and he looked so forlorn that I spoke to him. He beckoned me to his side; the cutting was a photograph of his twenty-five-year-old son – his only child – taken the day before in hospital. His mother was bending over him and he was giving the V-sign with his left hand. On 22 December his spine had been fractured and his right arm so badly smashed it had to be amputated. He was an architectural student, in his last year at university, and will never walk again – and perhaps, without adequate physiotherapy, will never draw again. Two small tears trickled down his father’s face as he said, ‘Mamma and Pappa cannot accept this, but Gheorghe can. He has a vision of what Rumania can be – and must be. Now we hope the future will not betray him. Mamma and Pappa must pray to God to give courage. We cannot have enough ourselves.’",

From the day of my arrival in Nairobi to now—writing in temporary furnished quarters in Ta’Xbiex on the island of Malta—I have spent and wasted and piled up and forgotten fifteen years and three months’ worth of time and memories.

Ulrica sat drooped on a low chair near her knees ... “sweet beautiful head” ... the weight of her soft curved mouth seemed too much for the delicate angles of her face and it drooped faintly, breaking their sharp lines. Miriam wished all the world could see her.... Presently Ulrica raised her head, as Elsa and Clara broke into words and laughter near her, and her drooping lips flattened gently back into their place in the curve of her face. She gazed out through the doorway of the summer-house with her great despairing eyes ... the housekeeper was rather like a Dutch doll ... but that was not it.",

(Though her husband was out of office and she had moved on to teach at Stanford, Karp-Toledo was still a favorite subject of wild rumors in Peru.
