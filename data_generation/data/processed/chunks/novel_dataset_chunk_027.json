A scout of two or three would lurk about the Varner fence to watch the buggy depart and find which road it would take. They would follow or precede it to whatever plank-trampling fiddle-impregnated destination, to wait there with the jug of raw whiskey and follow it back home or toward home—the long return through night-time roads across the mooned or unmooned sleeping land, the mare’s feet like slow silk in the dust as a horse moves when the reins are wrapped about the upright whip in its dashboard socket, the fords into which the unguided mare would step gingerly down and stop un-chidden and drink, nuzzling and blowing among the broken reflections of stars, raising its dripping muzzle and maybe drinking again or maybe just blowing into the water as a thirst-quenched horse will. There would be no voice, no touch of rein to make it move on; anyway, it would be standing there too long, too long, too long. One night they charged the moving buggy from the roadside shadows and were driven off by the whip because they had no concerted plan but were moved by a spontaneous combustion of rage and grief. A week after that, the horse and buggy tied to the Varner fence, they burst with yells and banging pans around the corner of the dark veranda, McCarron presently strolling composedly out, not from the porch but from the clump of trees where Varner’s wooden hammock hung, and called upon two or three of them by name and cursed them in a pleasant, drawling, conversational voice and dared any two of them to meet him down the road. They could see the pistol hanging in his hand against his flank.",

In Windham’s scoffing tones can be heard the growing cultural cynicism of the Enlightenment towards such credulousness. It was the spread of rationalism in Europe which routed the imaginary dragons from the mountains.",

She bucked in the ripping stream, at once rolling, pitching and yawing. Liz was tied bow and stern along her starboard side and the violence jerked the dinghy’s stern cleat cleanly out of its mount. Restrained only by her bow painter she shot forward, somehow propelled into the rushing water, then came up short on that line and surfed back toward us, stern first. Her up-tilted outboard slammed into Caribee’s topsides and shattered its aluminum mount, tearing it from the dinghy and shattering Caribee’s starboard caprail. I shot a glance aft and saw a full breaking wave a few boat-lengths behind us, a giant, curling, surfers’ wave, right in the middle of the anchorage. It rudely snapped up and tumbled the yachts that had been lying on the dry seabed. Fiberglass and aluminum cracked like breaking bones. We heard wails over the roar of the crashing wave; screaming sailors. Our friends.",

One lady crouched under the leathery flanks of a water buffalo, gently pulling at the beast’s udders, shooting warm jets of frothy milk into a battered tin pail. Nearby, a cart horse had just been released from its harness and was busy munching at its fodder; the up-ended cart stood to one side. I wound my way through this village scene, then quite suddenly I was no longer in an Indian village, but instead in a Mughal garden. The dusty carttrack had become a lawn; the village houses had given way to straight, symmetrical lines of bottle-palms; in the borders the lilies and irises were in full bloom—wonderful swathes of azure and magenta leading on into the char-bagh.",

The evocative smell of hot ski-wax drifted through many of the windows and swarms of people, little older than me and all bound for the mountains, were clumping the streets with skis over their shoulders. They filled the arcades and the cafés and shouted joyfully to each other as though they were already swooping about the high slopes; worse still, some were English. I loved ski-ing and all this made me feel lonely and out of things. So, early next morning, turning my back on the Salzkammergut and the lakes and the beckoning peaks of Styria and the Tyrol, I slipped away; and soon I was plodding north-west and ever further from temptation through the woods of Upper Austria. I slept in a barn near the village of Eigendorf – too small a hamlet for any map – and the next two nights in Frankenburg and Ried. One of them, spent in a loft where all the racks were filled with apples, was sweet-smelling almost to swooning point. Little has stuck from early Austrian days except the charm of these minor mountains.",

Not one head of the three budged. “Jump!” he thundered. The three splashes made one splash, a shower flew up, black heads bobbed convulsively, and disappeared; but a great blowing and spluttering went on, growing faint, for they were diving industriously, in great fear of a parting shot. Jim turned to the girl, who had been a silent and attentive observer. His heart seemed suddenly to grow too big for his breast and choke him in the hollow of his throat. This probably made him speechless for so long, and after returning his gaze she flung the burning torch with a wide sweep of the arm into the river. The ruddy fiery glare, taking a long flight through the night, sank with a vicious hiss, and the calm soft starlight descended upon them, unchecked.",

Each evening at 8:00 P.M., one of the Elder’s experts gave a talk. “One night it was Dall on the history or geography of Alaska,” Burroughs wrote, “then Gilbert upon the agency of glaciers in shaping the valleys and mountains, or upon the glaciers we had recently visited.” Daniel Elliott, who had launched the expedition by whetting Harriman’s appetite for bear, spoke on the fauna of Somaliland, in East Africa. Muir, who was an even better talker than he was a writer, took his turn with a story he had been polishing for almost twenty years but had only recently published, the tale of the little dog Stickeen.",

I found a good writing spot in a college library in Denpasar, the provincial capital, catching a bus there each morning. It was a cool, quiet refuge on a hot, noisy island. My novel was rocking along. A street vendor with a little turquoise cart would show up outside the library at midday, my signal to knock off. He served rice, soup, sweets, and satay through the opened windows of campus offices. I liked his nasi goreng—fried rice. In the afternoons, if there was swell, Bryan and I headed out the Bukit Peninsula, where a brace of great lefts broke off limestone cliffs. There were good waves around Kuta too, even on small swells, and, when the wind blew southwest, in a resort area on the east coast, Sanur.",

For some unknown reason, standing beside the officer’s desk in the hot and crowded room, with an armed sentry at the door, my mind went suddenly back to the morning of my stepmother’s funeral, the chapel full of distant relatives, and the voice of my aunt breaking the reverent whispers: ‘I was present once at a premature cremation.’ I had looked forward to the funeral as a break in the orderly routine of my retirement and what a break it had proved. I had been worried, I remembered, about the rain falling on my lawnmower. I began to laugh, and when I laughed all the enmity returned. I was again the insolent foreigner who had blown his nose on the flag of the Colorado party. My first assailant snatched away his handkerchief, and the officer, pushing aside those who stood in his way, strode to my side and gave me a severe cuff on my right ear which began to bleed in its turn. Desperately trying to find the name of anyone they might know, I let out Mr Visconti’s alias. ‘Señor Izquierdo,’ I said with no effect at all, and then, ‘Señor O’Toole.’ The officer paused with his hand raised to strike again and I tried, ‘Embassy—Americano.’",

    "target_paragraph": "Just about the time of my visit there was an interesting report in The Independent about a long-running dispute between the dean of Lincoln Cathedral and his treasurer. Six years earlier, it appears, the treasurer, along with his wife, their daughter, and a family friend, had taken the cathedral’s treasured copy of the Magna Carta off to Australia for a six-month fund-raising tour. The tour was a financial disaster. It lost over £500,000—a pretty hefty bill, when you think about it, for four people and a piece of parchment. Most of this the Australian government had graciously covered, but the cathedral was still left nursing a £56,000 loss. The upshot is that the dean leaked the story to the press, causing outrage and consternation among the cathedral chapter; the Bishop of Lincoln held an inquiry at which he commanded the chapter to resign; the chapter refused to resign; and now everybody was mad at pretty much everybody else. This had been going on for six years.",

    "target_paragraph": "And on the desk there was a stack of letters which had also been delivered to him the day before. The letters had been written to one of McGuire’s own colleagues by a certain very beautiful lady of the town, of whom it is only necessary to say that she was not McGuire’s wife and that he had known her for a long time. The huge man – curiously enough, not only a devoted father and a loyal husband, but a creature whose devotion to his family had been desperately intensified by the bitter sense of his one unfaith – had been for many years obsessed by one of those single, fatal and irremediable passions which great creatures of this sort feel only once in life, and for just one woman. Now the obsession of that mad fidelity was gone – exploded in an instant by a spidery scheme of words upon a page, a packet of torn letters in a woman’s hand. Hence, this sense now of a stolid, slow, and cureless anguish in the man, the brutal deliberation of his drunkenness. Since finding these letters upon his desk when he had returned at seven o’clock the night before from his visit to Gant, McGuire had not left his office or moved in his chair, except to bend with a painful grunt from time to time, feel between his legs with a fat hand until he found the jug, and then, holding it with a bear-like solemnity between his paws, drink long and deep of the raw, fiery, and colourless liquid in the jug. He had done this very often, and now the jug was two-thirds empty. As he read, his mouth was half open and a cigarette was stuck on the corner of one fat lip, a look that suggested a comical drunken stupefaction. The hospital had long since gone to sleep, and in the little office there was no sound save the ticking of a clock and McGuire’s short, thick, and stertorous breathing. Then when he had finished a letter, he would fold it carefully, put it back in its envelope, rub his thick fingers across the stubble of brown-reddish beard that covered his bloated and discoloured face, reach with a painful grunt for the glass jug, drink, and open up another letter.",

Geology says argillites are mud turned to stone, compacted silt, kin to shale, slate, schist. Art says the Rockies’ argillites are pink and green (iron oxidization, science interrupts), bright in rain, colored in Gauguin’s palette. Traildogs say argillite is plentiful along the trails that skirt the passes and ridges of the Lewis Range; unlike many sedimentary rocks, it doesn’t split easily, but when it does, leaves angling planes ideal for tight-jointed rockwork. Experience says at the top of the last rise before Comeau Pass, the trail winds across a bench where rocks look dropped from sky like huge dice—hulky blocks you can climb up on for lunch and look over the three miles of trail below, down to the tiny chalet, out past Lake McDonald to the Apgar Hills, to the North Fork. History says that Precambrian Belt sedimentary rocks were displaced during Tertiary time eastward onto Cretaceous rocks by the Lewis thrust fault. The rangers say the park has been the setting for at least ten periods of glaciation. Hazy late afternoon says it’s 90 degrees down in the valley, so sit a while longer on the rocks in the sun, let your hair get hot while the breeze dries sweat on skin. The wind says sun water dust rest stone.",

Soon a multitude of minuscule but painful black ants moved me on. A distinct path wound for half a mile through thin forest (many trees had been felled) and exuberant secondary growth. Then I was back on paddyland where newly flooded fields were being ploughed. A group of young people relaxing in a watch-hut, laughing and singing, abruptly fell silent on seeing the falang. Making an attempt to ask for directions, I gathered there was a choice of two routes to Luang Prabang; one led across the paddy, another along the wooded base of the mountain. I chose the latter and soon was fording a nameless (on the map) river, very wide but only ankle-deep. Ahead rose a grassy, hillocky slope where five squealing bonhams ran out of a blue-bush thicket towards their searching mother – so a ban was close.",

And everything stinks of sweat and good old night-soil!” The answer of course could be that spitting was due to endemic tuberculosis, and as for the stink, I had seen where and how the people lived. I knew I was being contemptible. To avoid more hysterics, U.C. moved us to a country hotel at Repulse Bay. We couldn’t go farther because we hadn’t yet received our papers and permissions for the journey to the interior. The hotel at Repulse Bay was as near English as possible, set in lovely gardens and done up in chintz. Soft-footed servitors bore pink gins around the place. No spitting and no smells, no visible poverty. U.C. teased me about my contentment in this clean non-Oriental enclave but was quite happy himself; he’d had enough company and was satisfied to read and walk over the hills.",
