Outside the wooden shutters is the Wilma Flintstone kitchen sink – in other words, a large flat tilted rock next to an external tap. There’s a big strong plastic tub for dishwater that then gets flung into the jungle. It’s a local custom for some kitchen scraps to get flung out there too.

Yet he would have to test it, spend one of his three cartridges simply to find out if it really would shoot and for a moment, a second something nudged at his memory. It’s got to shoot he thought. It’s jest got to. There aint nothing else for hit to do. Old Moster jest punishes; He dont play jokes.",

I know the forks in the pecan trees, the glut of water in the culverts, the hog pear in the alley. Often the Tuscan perched villages seem like large castles—extended homes with streets narrow as corridors, and the piazze, like public receptions rooms, teeming with visitors. The village churches have an attitude of privacy; the pressed linen and lace altar cloths and scarlet dahlias in a jar could be in family chapels; the individual houses, just suites in the big house. I expand, as when my grandparents’ house, my aunt’s, my friends’, the walls of home were as familiar to me as the lines in my own palm. I like the twisted streets up to the convent where I may leave a bit of lace to be mended on a Catherine wheel, spin it in to the invisible nun, whose sisters have tatted in this great arm of the castle for four hundred years. I do not glimpse even the half moons of her nails or the shadow of her habit. Outside two women who must have known each other all their lives sit in old wooden chairs between their doorways and knit. The stony street slopes abruptly down to the town wall. Beyond that stretches the broad valley floor. Here comes a miniature Fiat up this ridiculously steep street no car should climb. Crazy. My father would drive through swollen streams that flooded sudden dips in the dirt roads. I was thrilled. While he laughed and blew the horn, water rose around the car windows. Or was the water really that high?",

I also couldn’t help noticing that in a city where almost half the population were ethnic minorities, all but one of the people in the church were white.

The greatest hong in the city, Jardine-Matheson, had already moved its headquarters to Bermuda. The storied Repulse Bay Hotel, great bastion of old fogies and Old Hands, had been replaced by an eighteen-story megablock. The Peninsula, which still collected guests from the airport in a Rolls, was about to undergo a radical refurbishing. In 1985, for the first time in history, there were more Americans in Hong Kong than Brits.",

As far as the listeners could gather, the particular form of black art to be practised on this occasion was one connected with the sowing of hemp-seed, a handful of which was carried by each girl. At the moment of their advance they looked back, and discerned the figure of Miss Melbury who, alone of all the observers, stood in the full face of the moonlight, deeply engrossed in the proceedings. By contrast with her life of late years they made her feel as if she had receded a couple of centuries in the world’s history. She was rendered doubly conspicuous by her light dress, and after a few whispered words one of the girls—a bouncing maiden called Suke, plighted to young Timothy Tangs—asked her if she would join in. Grace with some excitement said that she would, and moved on a little in the rear of the rest.",

Inspired by the theories of Le Corbusier and his utopian ideals, Glasgow bulldozed tenements in favor of tower blocks, and packed off the young and the fit to experimental satellite “new towns.” All this, said the researchers, had ruptured the “social fabric” of the city: the matrix that supported the residents, held them steady. Morale fell. Health suffered. In came “diseases of despair.”",

And they would come at length to Cambridge, to find the moonlight dark upon the sleeping silence of the university and Harvard Square, and exultancy and joy welled up in them for ever; wild shouts and songs and laughter were torn from their throats and rang out through the sleeping streets of Cambridge, filling the moon-sweet air with jubilation, for they were drunken, young, and twenty – immortal confidence and victorious strength possessed them – and they knew that they could never die.",

It is perhaps the greatest caravan in human history.’ It was this steady stream of Punjabi refugees who, despite the great exodus of Muslims, still managed to swell the capital’s population from 918,000 in 1941 to 1,800,000 in 1951. The newspaper stories were illustrated with pictures showing the dead lying like a thick carpet on New Delhi Railway Station. Other photographs depicted the refugee camps on the ridge, the white tent cities in which Punjab Singh had stayed on his arrival. There were also shots of some fire-blackened and gutted houses standing in the rubble of the Subzi Mandi. It was in a house such as this that Mr and Mrs Puri had taken shelter for their first months in their new city.",

Fonck and his navigator, Lawrence Curtin, somehow managed to scramble free, but the other two crew members were incinerated in their seats. The incident horrified the flying fraternity.

In the garden the plants stood quite still, straight and unstirred by the smallest ruffle of air. Through the glass doors the dining-room, with its candle-lit table and brilliant flowers—nasturtiums and marigolds that night—glowed like some magic cave of colour, and the three men smoking round it looked strangely animated figures seen from the silence, the huge cool calm of outside.",

I felt certain that she wouldn’t hurt me. Then, when she was about five meters away, she came to a dead stop. She continued looking straight at me, just as she had done during the mock charge. Her ears were still extended but her trunk was now lowered into a normal position. I looked up with a glance meant to show resolve but not dominance. And although it is highly dangerous to anthropomorphize a wild animal, especially an elephant, I actually thought that those kind eyes were saying: “Okay, so we’ve been through this together. You didn’t move; that’s good.”",

It seemed like God was trying to tell me something, not just about overplanning, but maybe about money, too. I had tried to make this a much more opulent vacation than I ever had before, straying from my history as the girl who “didn’t need fancy hotels to have a good time.” But all of those opulent plans had blown up, and I had ended up a girl in a hostel who had to borrow money from a near stranger.",

Today, too, I saw for the first time a highland woman on a mule – riding astride, wearing tight, ankle-length, velvet trousers beneath her skirt, and carrying a white silk umbrella. She herself didn’t greet me, but ordered her servant to do so, whereupon he prostrated himself before the bedraggled faranj and touched my battered boots with his fingertips, which he then kissed. Here umbrellas are more common than rifles and presumably they too are status symbols, since at this season there is neither rain nor heat to justify them.",

There would be a dip, a slope, a glade in all this magic, a spring cupped in a cushion of green moss, the great bole of a rotted oak across the path, and over there was the crystal clarity of forest water falling over rock and in the pool a woman with bare legs and swelling thighs and kilted skirts, and all about her the strange lights of magic gold and depthless green, the rock, the fern, the springy carpet of the forest earth, and all the countless voices of high afternoon that, with dart and sudden thrum, or stitch and call or furious drummings in the wood, passed all about her to uncounted deaths and were lost and came again.",

Many have now been reclaimed by ‘illegal’ workers from the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) who find poorly paid jobs on building sites. In 1947, UN Resolution 181 specified that Jaffa was to remain ‘an Arab enclave’. Yet within weeks of the British withdrawal David Ben-Gurion noted in his diary: ‘Jaffa will be a Jewish city. War is war.’ Ten months later he boasted to the Knesset that 45,000 recent immigrants had been settled in Jaffa’s ‘abandoned’ houses. As M. LeVine has noted, ‘The city of Jaffa was then reimagined as a historically Jewish space, one that was “liberated from the Arab hands” as current tourist brochures put it.’ I soon realised that most Israelis don’t know how much the Nakba, the forcible emigration of Palestinians in 1947–8, altered the UN-approved Partition border. Not only Jaffa but Nazareth, Safed, Acre and Beersheba went to the victorious Zionists as a result of the 1949 Armistice Agreements.",

It was at their back, it wasn’t centuries away. If they had taken the wrong road, they had only to retrace their steps a very little distance in space and not in time. The little jetty moved jerkily backwards, the river came into sight, the silver mangrove branches straddling like the ribs of old umbrellas on either side. Two hundred and fifty miles up that stream still existed the exact spot, the broken tree-trunk, the swarm of red ants where I had waited for my lost companions. The half-built Customs house, the waterside squalor of Kru Town, the asphalt road up to grassy Broad Street, they slipped behind with the sweep of the oars, but they belonged to the same world as the huddled huts at Duogobmai, the devil’s servant fanning away the storm, the old woman who had made lightning trailing back to her prison with the rope round her waist. They were all gathered together behind the white line of the bar no European steamer ever crossed.",

Passepartout was sleeping off a few Kingfishers, so it was a perfect opportunity to experience a women-only carriage. Since our arrival in India I had been stared at continuously as though I had a fist growing out of my head. It did not bother me, as I knew it was out of curiosity, not rudeness, and Passepartout was always on standby as a deterrent to wandering hands.
