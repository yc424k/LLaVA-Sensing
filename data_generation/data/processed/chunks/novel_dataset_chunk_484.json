First to Berryfield Cottage, and then to a house called Wick Green, which is reached by an ancient, deeply worn track, thick with rotted leaves. The track winds through beeches and yews to reach the long, low house, which sits several hundred feet up at the plateau edge and looks across to Chanctonbury Ring and the ridge line of the South Downs, seven miles distant. The house has been recently constructed on Morrisian principles. The planks and beams have been taken from local oaks. The nails, hinges and hasps have been forged in the village, the bricks cast nearby. Native stone has been used for the thresholds. When mists fill the valleys, they feel as if they are in a wooden galleon at sea, creaking in the swell.",

Beyond the porch the salvia bed lay in an unbearable glare of white light, in clamorous splashes. Beyond it the drive shimmered with heat until, arched over with locust and oak, it descended in a cool green tunnel to the gates and the sultry ribbon of the highroad. Beyond the road fields spread away shimmering, broken here and there by motionless clumps of wood, on to the hills dissolving bluely in the July haze.",

In the all-trash encirclement, trash items had piled themselves together here and there in heaps three and four feet tall, as if making common cause. With a quick kicking and scuffing of nearby fragments, Sergei rendered a place beside a log bench relatively trash-free and then laid out our cold chicken lunch on pieces of cellophane on the ground.

The only thing I ever want to know about any place or any person is the story, this is the only thing I watch for—never for aesthetic details.

Bright pink, from floor to ceiling, bright pink tile everywhere—I honestly hadn’t seen it before.) But my sister’s trained eye picks up the Gothic, or Romanesque, or Byzantine features of a building, the pattern of the church floor, or the dim sketch of the unfinished fresco hidden behind the altar. She strides across Rome on her long legs (we used to call her “Catherine-of-the-Three-Foot-Long-Femurs”) and I hasten after her, as I have since toddlerhood, taking two eager steps to her every one.",

Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and there was a terrible consumption of nuts going on.’",

These glowing solitudes of Hertenstein, solitudes made so clearly only for love and kind words, these whispering woods, these romantic waters—what was he doing, wandering among them with a sister who wouldn’t speak? He had devoted himself unceasingly, he had left nothing undone to induce her to forgive him, and all his endeavours only led her to a deeper silence, and a more impenetrable gloom. Why, then, he asked himself, now gnawing rather than nibbling the blade of grass, should he not leave her, and go home?",

I felt that sort of rage one feels during a hard tussle. The spectre vas trying to slip out of my grasp. “Why?” she repeated louder; “tell me!” And as I remained confounded, she stamped with her foot like a spoilt child. “Why? Speak.” “You want to know?” I asked in a fury. “Yes!” she cried. “Because he is not good enough,” I said brutally. During the moment’s pause I noticed the fire on the other shore blaze up, dilating the circle of its glow like an amazed stare, and contract suddenly to a red pin-point. I only knew how close to me she had been when I felt the clutch of her fingers on my forearm. Without raising her voice, she threw into it an infinity of scathing contempt, bitterness, and despair.",

I learned this the Saturday afternoon my paper held a free screening of Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner for our readers. To give the event some authenticity, Lao Ye asked me (token American) to introduce the program’s hostess, a Chinese professor of American culture. Some 250 college students showed up that day, and— never having seen the movie—I lingered beyond my duty. The screening took nearly three hours, as the professor kept pushing the pause button to expound cultural insight. Her commentary made my blood run cold, though: Not only did she refer to African Americans as “Negroes,” she pronounced it like “Nig-gar-o”—and the students followed suit. Unease churned in my belly. Should I correct her, at the risk of her losing mianzi? Or let it slide?",

Our engine had broken down, decisively, and must be replaced. As this news spread other passengers laughed uproariously, tuned up their guitars and began a sing-song. Standing in the corridor, watching our engine being detached, I was joined by an effervescent mulatta teenager who offered me a swig from her half-bottle of rum. ‘Have a drink! Cuba transport bad for tourists, Cuba rum good!’ Accepting her offer, I was conscious of Raimundo’s disapproving stare. As the defunct engine passed us, on the next track, passengers crowded to the windows leaning out to cheer and clap ironically. Raimundo smiled at me and said, ‘That’s how we survived the Special Period.’",

Hence, an economic and political battle is being waged in Chile between a coalition of nationalist and left-wing groupings that advocate nationalizing the mines, and those who, in the cause of free enterprise, prefer a well-run mine (even in foreign hands) to possibly less efficient management by the state. Serious accusations have been made in congress against the companies currently exploiting the concessions, symptomatic of the climate of nationalist aspiration surrounding copper production.",

His backers in St. Louis sent out a young man named George Stumpf, who had no relevant experience, in the vague hope that he might run errands or otherwise make himself useful. The Wright Corporation provided two mechanics to assist him with preparations (it did this for all the teams using its engines, in its own interests) and also sent a PR man named Richard Blythe to help manage the press, but the company considered Lindbergh such a dark horse that it made the two of them share a room in the Garden City Hotel. Apart from this, Lindbergh was entirely on his own. Byrd’s preparations were conservatively estimated to have cost $500,000.† Lindbergh’s total expenses?plane, fuel, food, lodging, everything?came to just $13,500.",

The odor made me gag. The heels of my Tufs dragged through the scaly debris, separating chunks of flesh from the skeletons. I made it to the far bank, barely, slipping as I stepped off so one leg dropped into the river knee-deep and water filled my boot. This misstep is called “topping out,” and it means you owe the crew a six-pack. But no one had noticed. They were too busy cheering that I’d made it across without drowning. On dry ground, I jumped around and shook my freezing hands, shouting to bleed out the horror of the crossing. Worst, I still had to get back. It was late in the day and obvious by then that the crossing, which took me ten minutes unencumbered by tools, was neither efficient nor safe for a crew of five people with chainsaws and brushers. Not even possible for Bess, with very short legs and a low tolerance for risk.",

She walked on with the vague sense of confidence in the future which the first touch of spring gives. The worst of the way was past—how easily, how smoothly to the feet!

    "target_paragraph": "On the other side perched the castle of Vajdahunyad, chief stronghold of the great John Hunyadi, a building so fantastic and theatrical that, at a first glance, it looked totally unreal. Like many castles, it had once been damaged by fire and built up again in its former shape; but it was perfectly genuine. The bridge led to a sallyport in a tall barbican which ended high above in a colonnade supporting a vertiginous roof that soared in a wedge, like the great barbicans in Prague: spikes of metal or shingle erected for the laming of infernal cavalry flying low after dark. Towers, clustering at different heights, some square and some round and all of them frilled with machicolations, were embedded in the steep fabric. The light showing between the pillars holding up the great angular cowl of the barbican gave the pile an airy, lifted, slightly improbable look, and the closely spaced parade of the perpendicular buttresses made the upward thrust still more impetuous. Beginning deep in the abyss, these piers of masonry ascended the curtain wall and the donjon and the outside of the banqueting hall in unbroken flight and then burst out high above in a row of half-salient and half-engaged octagonal side-towers, all of them lighted by windows which carried on a dominating line of mullioned lancets, and an interweaving network of late gothic tracery branched and flourished and linked them together with all the impulse and elaboration of the French Flamboyant style.",

In his soiled and ragged uniform, he looked footsore, unkempt, dusty, and unutterably weary—“as if,” she said, “he had come a long, long ways”—as indeed, he must have done, since at that moment he was a private soldier in one of Jackson’s regiments in Virginia.",
