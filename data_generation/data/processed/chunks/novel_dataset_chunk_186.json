Mallory sweats as he does his exercises on the fore-deck, as he lies in his cabin, and as he writes in the smoking-room. The air is rank with water – it is an amphibious substance, half-gas half-liquid. Sitting in the bows, willing Calcutta to appear on the horizon, it feels to Mallory as though his body is being pushed forward through something gelatinous. The Malayan for water, Mallory remembers, is air, and here in the tropics that apparent mix-up seems to make perfect sense.",

At the edge of town someone had written ‘Perón=Gorilla’ in blue paint on an abandoned police post. Nearby was a pile of gin bottles, a memorial to a dead trucker; his friends chucked on a bottle whenever they passed. I walked two hours, five hours, ten hours, and no truck. My notebook conveys something of the mood:  Walked all day and the next day. The road straight, grey, dusty, and trafficless. The wind relentless, heading you off. Sometimes you heard a truck, you knew for certain it was a truck, but it was the wind. Or the noise of gears changing down, but that also was the wind. Sometimes the wind sounded like an unloaded truck banging over a bridge. Even if a truck had come up behind you wouldn’t have heard it. And even if you’d been downwind, the wind would have drowned the engine. The one noise you did hear was a guanaco. A noise like a baby trying to cry and sneeze at once. You saw him a hundred yards off, a single male, bigger and more graceful than a llama, with his orange coat and white upstanding tail. Guanacos are shy animals, you were told, but this one was mad for you. And when you could walk no more and laid out your sleeping bag, he was there gurgling and snivelling and keeping the same distance. In the morning he was right up close, but the shock of you getting out of your skin was too much for him. That was the end of a friendship and you watched him bounding away over a thorn bush like a galleon in a following sea.",

It was the cider country more especially, which met the woodland district some way off. There the air was blue as sapphire—such a blue as outside that apple-region was never seen. Under the blue the orchards were in a blaze of pink bloom, some of the richly flowered trees running almost up to where they drove along.

I cannot tell how the sight of the grass and bushes, heavy with frost, and wild—in their own primitive wildness charmed me. The slopes of the steep wild hills came down shaggy and bushy, with a few berries lingering, and the long grass-stalks sere with the frost. Again, the dark valley sank below like a ravine, but shaggy, bosky, unbroken. It came upon me how I loved the sight of the blue-shadowed, tawny-tangled winter with its frosty standstill. The young oaks keep their brown leaves. And doing so, surely they are best with a thin edge of rime.",

He looked at the dusky gray shadows in the corners of the room and at a raw place on a large leather chair in the corner where it had long been in use. He saw clothes, dishevelled, rumpled clothes on the floor and he smelt stale cigarette smoke and stale liquor. The windows were tight shut. Outside the bright sunlight had thrown a dust-filled beam across the sill—a beam broken by the head of the wide wooden bed in which he had slept. He lay very quiet—comatose, drugged, his eyes wide, his mind clicking wildly like an unoiled machine.\nIt must have been thirty seconds after he perceived the sunbeam with the dust on it and the rip on the large leather chair that he had the sense of life close beside him, and it was another thirty seconds after that before that he realized that he was irrevocably married to Jewel Hudson.\nHe went out half an hour later and bought a revolver at a sporting goods store. Then he took a taxi to the room where he had been living on East Twenty-seventh Street, and, leaning across the table that held his drawing materials, fired a cartridge into his head just behind the temple.",

People think they’re walking back to the Essex coast, when in fact they’re walking across towards Kent and so out into the tide.

His humour, although suave, was also quick and rich and gave an engaging warmth and humanity to a personality that sometimes needed them. Even in his display of humour, however, he never lost his urbane distinguished manner – for example, when someone told him that one of his women students had referred to another woman in the course, an immensely tall angular creature who dressed in rusty brown right up to the ears, as ‘the queen of the angle-worms’, Professor Hatcher shook all over with sudden laughter, removed his glasses with a distinguished movement, and then in a rich but controlled voice remarked:",

The pigs are still there. The pirates did not return for any number of pirate-themed reasons. Today the pigs run wild like a group of school children at recess. They swim on the beach and frolic in the waves. They luxuriate in the shade of the palms. Their status as marooned creatures has not dampened their zeal for living the good life in their tropical paradise. In addition to the island serving as a novel type of tourist attraction it is also a local dumping area. The pigs are most accommodating garbage eaters. The pig population is kept in check by the volume of edible trash dumped on the island and forays into the pig sanctuary by local poachers who thin the pig population for the tables of local restaurants under cover of darkness.

The dancing women were followed by two priests from Trujillo (who had celebrated the Mass), walking a few yards ahead of St Francis’s platform with open breviaries and bored expressions. The Holy Quartet were followed by a motley crowd of musicians, dancers and clowns, who have been roaming the town since yesterday. Included were mestizo men inexplicably attired as 18th-century hussars; campesinos wearing leather leggings, black masks of hide and goats-hair, and Napoleonic brass helmets; campesino sword dancers with bells on their ankles; groups of men wearing comical or savagely glaring masks and elaborate cloth helmets bedecked with coins, buttons, shells, religious medals – all surmounted by coloured plumes that swayed as they danced, like a field of exotic blooms in a gusty wind. Another group wore tight scarlet trousers and short royal blue jackets with red collars and cuffs, the ensemble being completed by a Homburg hat, a (real) sword held in the right hand and a cluster of bells tied to the left hand. These gentlemen danced indefatigably all day and all night, to the music of violins and tall portable harps. Another group, also equipped with Homburg hats, swords and finger-bells, wore impeccable lounge-suits, complete with collars and ties, and their faces were hidden by blue-eyed masks. When they paused to imbibe, one saw that they were mestizo youths. In the more prosperous streets, flower petals and confetti were thrown over the statues from the upstairs balconies by pious ladies too genteel to join in the rough and tumble; and bouquets of fresh flowers, wrapped in cellophane, were lowered on strings and received by acolytes for the further gratification of St Francis.",

Sometimes we would talk, but mostly we existed in a kind of companionable silence. By six o’clock, dark and cold and weariness would drive us to our tents. Katz went to sleep instantly, as far as I could tell. I would read for an hour or so with my curiously inefficient little miner’s lamp, its beam throwing quirky, concentric circles of light onto the page, like the light of a bicycle lamp, until my shoulders and arms grew chilly out of the bag and heavy from tilting the book at awkward angles to catch the nervous light. So I would put myself in darkness and lie there listening to the peculiarly clear, articulated noises of the forest at night, the sighs and fidgets of wind and leaves, the weary groan of boughs, the endless murmurings and stirrings, like the noises of a convalescent ward after lights out, until at last I fell heavily asleep. In the morning we would rise shivering and rubbing arms, wordlessly repeat our small chores, fill and hoist our packs, and venture into the great entangling forest again.",

Near the Gaza Strip I remember having to walk quite a way as it was Friday night and the buses had stopped running. I met an Italian chap who invited me to stay in his closer kibbutz. The lights were twinkling in the distance and as we approached the entrance the notes of a Chopin nocturne floated towards us on the warm breeze from the children’s block. So this was my ‘idealist’ introduction which was to be somewhat shaken a few days later when, during an evening socialising in the house of a kibbutznik who had lost a leg in the ’48 war, I was shown a map of Palestine and it was pointed out that much of the West Bank would eventually be part of Israel. Insights such as this convinced me that Israel wasn’t a country for me to settle in though I would have been assured a good career.",

The wind forces the sand into a curve, with hollowed centre; all these great waves of sand face the same way. I do not think it can be described, painted or photographed so that the impression of untouched, harmonious elegance would come across. Largeau is an oasis with hundreds and hundreds of royal palms, and whitewashed huts and houses clustered under them. Surrounded by the desert, it is the one splendour I have seen, finer than anything before in Africa. I am filled with regret that I did not stay here instead of in Fort Lamy—and no one in Fort Lamy has either seen or felt this wonder, since Largeau was spoken of disparagingly as nothing much.",

I fit a collar of foam around the primary and secondary plugs, and pump up. Air bubbles stream out from every wrinkle of the dentureless mouth. Sixty pumps each half hour, or my legs will poke down like sausages, free for the tasting. I’m getting angry. The beast comes in close. I wait for him, hatred screwing up my face. I rise as high as I can and ram the spear down with all my weight, making a dead-center hit on the lateral line that runs down the side of his head and back. This line is so sensitive it can pick up the vibrations of a struggling wounded fish over a quarter mile away.

Mount Washington is the most popular summit in the White Mountains, and the Tuckerman Ravine Trail, our chosen route, is the most popular trail up. Some 60,000 hikers a year take to the Tuckerman route, though a good many of them get a lift to the top of the mountain and walk down, so the figures are perhaps a trifle skewed. In any case, it was no more than moderately busy on a good, hot, blue-skied, gorgeously promising morning in late July.",

We sat there all night with no electricity, the coal fires dying in the corridor stoves, and the bathroom locked. I went out and made a few tentative explorations of the train yard in the dark; throbbing diesel engines hemmed us in like a sleeping elephant herd. In the lee of an engine I called my wife on the satellite phone. I had to take off my gloves to dial in the icy half-light; I found her running out to do errands on a balmy afternoon. The next morning another train came and hooked us to it and pulled us slowly north, although not all the way to Yakutsk, because the tracks don’t go that far. The last three-hundred-some miles to Yakutsk beyond the tracks’ end must be navigated by motor vehicle on a semiwilderness highway.",

I was only looking for something modest that didn’t have “Fayre,” “Vegan,” or “Copper Kettle” in the title, but all that happened was I kept wandering down restaurantless streets and coming up against monstrous relief roads with massive roundabouts and complicated pedestrian crossings that clearly weren’t designed to be negotiated on foot by anyone with less than six hours to spare. Finally, I happened on a hilly street with a few modest eateries and plunged randomly into a Chinese restaurant full of foreboding at the prospect of trying to feed myself with chopsticks. Am I alone in thinking it odd that a people ingenious enough to invent paper, gunpowder, kites, and any number of other useful objects, and who have a noble history extending back three thousand years, haven’t yet worked out that a pair of knitting needles is no way to capture food? I spent a perplexed hour stabbing at rice, dribbling sauce across the tablecloth, and lifting finely poised pieces of meat to my mouth only to discover that they had mysteriously vanished and weren’t to be found anywhere. By the time I finished, the table looked as if it had been at the center of a violent argument. I paid my bill and slunk out the door and back to the hotel, where I watched a little TV and snacked on the copious leftovers that I found in sweater folds and trouser cuffs.",
