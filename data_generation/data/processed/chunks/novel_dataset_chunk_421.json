Thirty-five million or so are merinos, descended from four ewes and two rams presented by the Spanish royal family to the Dutch royal family and shipped to Cape Town in 1789. Karoo mutton has a distinctive flavour, celebrated throughout South Africa, and many Karoo farmers are reputed to be extremely rich – though fleeces are now fetching little. It is not uncommon to run 5,000 sheep on 30,000 acres yet few shepherds are employed. Predators have long since become extinct, apart from the black-backed jackal, and meticulously secure fencing prevents straying. All this information I gathered this evening from Koos, a sheep-farmer who owns Vosburg’s hotel.",

If I close my eyes, maybe I’ll wake up in Sydney. She moves me forwards. With each step, I am not in Sydney. I’m closer to Wayra. Wayra looks back over her shoulder, shooting me a look of absolute disgust. My hands are shaking so I cover them with my sleeves. I focus on the mottled leaf litter, crunching too loudly. The leaves melt into the mulch of the roots, then up into the ocean colours of the canopy. Down again. I can smell flowers mixed with the acrid scent of cat pee. There’s tension on Wayra’s rope, she’s reached as far as she can get and her growl has got louder, an engine now, coming from inside her belly. It was an illusion before: her size, thinking she wasn’t big. She’s huge. Her back is as tall as my upper thigh and her paws are plates.",

The jocularity proper to an innocent card game for a few cigars or a bundle of yerba was replaced at once by the stern duty mood of an officer setting out to visit the outposts of an encamped army. One loud blast of the whistle that hung from his neck provoked instantly a great shrilling of responding whistles, mingled with the barking of dogs, that would calm down slowly at last, away up at the head of the gorge; and in the stillness two sereños, on guard by the bridge, would appear walking noiselessly towards him. On one side of the road a long frame building—the store—would be closed and barricaded from end to end; facing it another white frame house, still longer, and with a verandah—the hospital—would have lights in the two windows of Dr. Monygham’s quarters. Even the delicate foliage of a clump of pepper trees did not stir, so breathless would be the darkness warmed by the radiation of the over-heated rocks. Don Pépé would stand still for a moment with the two motionless sereños before him, and, abruptly, high up on the sheer face of the mountain, dotted with single torches, like drops of fire fallen from the two great blazing clusters of lights above, the ore shoots would begin to rattle. The great clattering, shuffling noise, gathering speed and weight, would be caught up by the walls of the gorge, and sent upon the plain in a growl of thunder. The pasadero in Rincon swore that on calm nights, by listening intently, he could catch the sound in his doorway as of a storm in the mountains.",

The road was bad and thick with dust; when passing the few cars, we rolled up the windows fast, so as not to choke on the floating red cloud. There were villages—a straggle of shacks—at the edge of the road, with jungle behind. The trees are immensely tall and skinny, like all jungle trees, and no one knows the names of any of them. I recognized only what I took to be ceiba. This pushing, twisting, grappling mass of vines, trunks, bushes is as ominous as prison walls. The blacks drifted around their villages and along the road, dressed in faded calico; bathed in stagnant jungle pools; chatted. One could not see how they lived. (C. has explained to me that I must not say nègre, which is an offensive word here; one speaks of les blancs and les noirs, the acceptable usage.)",

She sat up in bed, pushed her hair back from her damp forehead, and repeated the two names slowly, as if trying from those conjoined syllables to disentangle the clue to the mystery. For mystery there was; she was sure of it now! People like Lilla Gates and Chris did not wander aimlessly through Central Park at the secret hour when the winter dusk begins to blur its paths. Every moment of such purposeless lives was portioned out, packed with futilities. Kate had seen enough of that in her enforced association with the idlers of a dozen watering-places, her dreary participation in their idling.",

But Mr Seth realized that the moment had come to flee Pakistan. He jumped off the platform and ran down the line towards India.

These houses too had once been private, but now a cheap lunchroom filled the basement of one, while the other announced itself, above the knotty wisteria that clasped its central balcony, as the Mendoza Family Hotel. It was obvious from the chronic cluster of refuse barrels at its area-gate and the blurred surface of its curtainless windows, that the families frequenting the Mendoza Hotel were not exacting in their tastes; though they doubtless indulged in as much fastidiousness as they could afford to pay for, and rather more than their landlord thought they had a right to express.",

I noticed an electric gate click open to my left, and a mini-bus entered the car park. Assuming it to be the arriving German guests, I wondered why it was heading towards me, rather than the reception at the front of the hotel. The reason soon became apparent, as the rear door slid open and a hideous procession of heavily made-up, middle-aged women began to disembark. As they teetered towards me on cheap high heels, supporting muscular, fake-tanned legs, I realised that they were actually probably only in their late twenties, but a combination of cheap, local market make-up and their choice of profession had aged them prematurely. Clearly, these ladies were to provide the local entertainment at the eagerly awaited sauna party. Bizarrely, I hastily put on my t-shirt as they approached, feeling underdressed as they critically sized me up, assuming I was a fellow party-guest. Their sneers suggested they were unimpressed by my potential contribution to the evening's events, both financial and physical!",

After a game, he was often so sore that he couldn’t raise his arm to comb his own hair. In 1927, Pennock was the second-highest-paid player on the team, with a salary of $17,500.

The figures—those of a slight young man with stooping shoulders, and of a lady equally youthful but slenderly erect—moved forward in absorbed communion, as if unconscious of their surroundings and indefinite as to their direction, till, on the brink of the wide grass terrace just below their observer's parapet, they paused a moment and faced each other in closer speech. This interchange of words, though brief in measure of time, lasted long enough to add a vivid strand to Mrs. Ansell's thickening skein; then, on a gesture of the lady's, and without signs of formal leave-taking, the young man struck into a path which regained the entrance avenue, while his companion, quickening her pace, crossed the grass terrace and mounted the wide stone steps sweeping up to the house.",

Lonni, not yet recovered from his recent lapse, appeared once at the door, peered at us morosely for a moment, then vanished. The square, high-ceilinged room had rough, dirty, once-white-washed walls inexplicably decorated with faded framed photographs of long-since-dead members of the Swedish royal family. Two small candles, set on the long, wobbly table, provided the only illumination. (Jauja has an electricity supply of sorts but Teresa can’t afford it.) A rickety iron bed, now being used as a trampoline by the younger children, occupied one end wall. A small dresser held Teresa’s library, mainly Maoist; there was no other furniture. Torrential rain hammered on the tin roof, the earthen floor was uneven and the broken double-door blew open in the gale if not blocked by a large stone. All afternoon Ferdy (Lonni’s eldest) had been tinkering with a primeval record-player which he at last induced to work. A plastic bag of 45 rpm Andean songs and dances was then taken from the dresser cupboard and the boys danced in the cramped space available while the little girls sat po-faced on the bed and Vladimir thoughtfully rubbed segments of an orange into his hair. When we had all toasted the birthday boy in non-alcoholic chicha, flavoured with cinnamon, the feast was solemnly carried through the storm from the kitchen on the far side of the patio. First, stewed cuy with potatoes in a mild curry sauce; then The Cake, mixed by Teresa and baked, not entirely successfully, by a cousin of hers who lives nearby and has an oven. Rachel surrepticiously slipped her share to me: not hard in the gloom. Everyone’s helpings were meagre and Teresa herself hardly ate anything. Vladimir’s only presents were from the gringoes and his mother (a plastic train engine). I have grown very fond of Teresa and was saddened by her stricken face when she cut the soggy cake. So much love and thought and money had gone into it …",
