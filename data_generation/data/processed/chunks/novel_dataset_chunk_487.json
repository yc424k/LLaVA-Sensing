It is also why, before leaving Texas, we stocked up on supplies we thought hospitals and schools might need. They sat at the bottom of our backpacks until our final morning in Havana, when we ventured out to distribute them. Our first stop was the Prado, the tree-lined boulevard leading up to the Capitolio. With its galleried walkways and vaulted ceilings, this was Havana’s most prestigious address in the late 1700s. But when the Mafia bought it out in the twentieth century, the highborn moved out and the harlots checked in, transforming the strip into a red-light district of live sex shows and glitzy casinos. Soon after the Revolution, however, Fidel sent the call girls to training camp, replaced the blackjack tables with bookshelves, and turned the bordellos into classrooms, renaming the Prado “El Paseo de Martí.” Machi and I ambled down its crumbling walkway and selected an old schoolhouse at random. As we pushed through its towering double doors, a middle-aged man in a neatly pressed guayabera, or traditional dress shirt, appeared.",

The trishaw drivers parked by the corner of my hotel in Mandalay were always draped across the tattered seats of their vehicles, poring over magazines or books. Sometimes three of them would be hunched hungrily over a single volume. New and second-hand books are sold off tarpaulin mats spread across the pavements of Rangoon and at the night-time book bazaar in Mandalay. Magazines can be bought from fold-up wooden tables on every street or from vendors who carry large stacks under their arms, yelling out the titles as they wander through tea shops and train stations.",

Nor did she care, thinking again to try once more to communicate with him except that the French sergeant at Chalons had said that it was all arranged, and suddenly it was not that she could trust the American sergeant because he must know what he was doing since he had obviously come along with them under orders, but because she—they—could do little else.",

    "target_paragraph": "iii\nHe came back the first week in June, in time for the hay harvest. And it happened as she had foreseen.\nIt would have been dangerous for Jerrold to have left the house at night to go to the Manor Farm. At any moment he might have been betrayed by his own footsteps treading the passages and stairs, by the slipping of locks and bolts, the sound of the opening and shutting of doors. The servants might be awake and hear him; they might go to his room and find that he was not there.\nBut Colin's shelter stood in a recess on the lawn, open to the fields and hidden from the house by tall hedges of yew. Nobody could see him slip out into the moonlight or the darkness; nobody could hear the soft padding of his feet on the grass. He had only to run down the three fields and cross the belt of firs to come to Anne's shelter at the bottom. The blank, projecting wall of the mill hid it from the cottages and the Manor Farm house; the firs hid it from the field path; a high bank, topped by a stone wall, hid it from the road and Sutton's Farm. Its three wooden walls held them safe.\nNight after night, between eleven and midnight, he came to her. Night after night, she lay awake waiting till the light rustling of the meadow grass told her he was there: on moonlit nights a quick brushing sound; in the thick blackness a sound like a slow shearing as he felt his way. The moon would show him clear, as he stood in the open frame of the shelter, looking in at her; or she would see him grey, twilit and mysterious; or looming, darker than dark, on black nights without moon or stars.\nThey loved the clear nights when their bodies showed to each other white under the white moon; they loved the dark nights that brought them close, shutting them in, annihilating every sensation but that of his tense, hard muscles pressing down, of her body crushed and yielding, tightening and slackening in surrender; of their brains swimming in their dark ecstasy.\nThey loved the warmth of each other's bodies in the hot windless nights; they loved their smooth, clean coolness washed by the night wind. Nothing, not even the sweet, haunting ghost of Maisie, came between. They would fall asleep in each other's arms and lie there till dawn, till Anne woke in a sudden fright. Always she had this fear that some day they would sleep on into the morning, when the farm people would be up and about. Jerrold lay still, tired out with satisfaction, sunk under all the floors of sleep. She had to drag him up, with kisses first and light stroking, then with a strong undoing of their embrace, pushing back his heavy arms that fell again to her breast as she parted them. Then she would wrench herself loose and shake him by the shoulders till she woke him. He woke clean, with no ugly turning and yawning, but with a great stretching of his strong body and a short, sudden laugh, the laugh he had for danger. Then he would look at his wrist watch and show it her, laughing again as she saw that this time, again, they were safe. And they would lie a little while longer, looking into each other's faces for the sheer joy of looking, reckless with impunity. And he would start up suddenly with, \"I say, Anne, I must clear out or we shall be caught.\" And they would get up.\nOutside, the world looked young and unknown in the June dawn, in the still, clear, gold-crystal air, where green leaves and green grass shone with a strange, hard lustre like fresh paint, and yet unearthly, uncreated, fixed in their own space and time.\nAnd she would go with him, her naked feet shining white on the queer, bright, cold green of the grass, up the field to the belt of firs that stood up, strange and eternal, under the risen sun.\nThey parted there, holding each other for a last kiss, a last clinging, as if never in this world they would meet again.\nDawn after dawn. They belonged to the dawn and the dawn light; the dawn was their day; they knew it as they knew no other time.\nAnd Anne would go back to her shelter, and lie there, and live through their passion again in memory, till she fell asleep.\nAnd when she woke she would find the sweet, sad ghost of Maisie haunting her, coming between her and the memory of her dark ecstasy. Maisie, utterly innocent, utterly good, trusting her, sending Jerrold back to her because she trusted her. Only to think of Maisie gave her a fearful sense of insecurity. She thought: If I'd loved her I could never have done it. If I were to love her even now that would end it. We couldn't go on. She prayed God that she might not love her.\nBy day the hard work of the farm stopped her thinking. And the next night and the next dawn brought back her safety.",

This child’s whole person is ingrained with filth, her fair hair is hopelessly matted and her chin is covered with small, inflamed sores. I know that people inside glasshouses, and etc., but surely children’s faces and hands could be washed once a day, and their hair combed. Mamma is equally filthy and bedraggled. She is also very pregnant and has a ghastly yellow pallor and dreadfully bloodshot eyes; at twenty-one she could pass for forty. What a setting for another baby to be born into!

On the climb out of the valley the track was a mixture of frozen snow, running water and greasy mud; but on the level ‘highland’, as the locals call it, we only had to contend with deep dry snow.",

Her couch. You could see him putting the cushions at her back, tucking the wide Victorian skirt in close about the feet in the black velvet slippers. And she would lie there with her poor hands folded in the white cashmere shawl.\nRichard knew what you were thinking.\n\"You can't expect me,\" he was saying, \"to behave like my uncle…. Besides, it's a little too late, isn't it?… We said, whatever we did we wouldn't go back on it. If it wasn't wrong then, Mary, it isn't wrong now.\"\n\"It isn't that, Richard.\"\n(No. Not that. Pure and remorseless then. Pure and remorseless now.)\nShe wondered whether he had heard it. The crunching on the gravel walk under the windows, stopping suddenly when the feet stepped on to the grass. And the hushed growl of the men's voices. Baxter and the gardener. They had come to see whether the light would go out again behind the yellow blinds as it had gone out last night.\nIf you were a coward; if you had wanted to get off scot-free, it was too late.\nRichard knows I'm not a coward. Funk wouldn't keep me from him. It isn't that.\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\"Can't you see, can't you feel that it's no use coming again, just for this? It'll never be what it was then. It'll always be like last night, and you'll think I don't care. Something's holding me back from you. Something that's happened to me. I don't know yet what it is.\"\n\"Nerves. Nothing but nerves.\"\n\"No. I thought it was nerves last night. I thought it was this room.\nThose two poor ghosts, looking at us.

On the far side much higher mountains rose directly from the water. Trees concealed a nearby ban where the others sought food and lodgings; no one seemed keen to sleep on board or to camp. I had decided to pander to the Foot by resting it completely for these few days and here I was quite glad not to be among those invading an isolated ban in search of sustenance and shelter. Is this travel snobbery? Not really – the arrival of a lone trekker or cyclist sets up a different sort of chemistry. Sean and Shane soon returned; they thought it unfair to expect a meal in that twenty-house Hmong ban where only three had been able to find lodgings – three Australian girls.",

And you can see the darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day.\nOn the steps of the Paris Stock Exchange the gold-skinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabbles of geese. They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew the years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.\n—Who has not? Stephen said.\n—What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.\nHe came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.\n—History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.\nFrom the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal. What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?\n—The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.\nStephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:\n—That is God.\nHooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!\n—What? Mr Deasy asked.\n—A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.\nMr Deasy looked down and held for a while the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.\n—I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman O’Rourke, prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many failures but not the one sin. I am a straggler now at the end of my days. But I will fight for the right till the end.\nFor Ulster will fight\nAnd Ulster will be right.",

As long as the country could live on its own terms, and far from the world at large—and Bolivia seemed to sense this—some kind of rough peace was possible.

Shocker lived with a heart condition so severe that he had to sleep sitting up. (Some books say standing up, but that seems unlikely.) Photographs of him from 1927 show an ashen figure looking at least ten years more than his age. By the early fall, he would be too ill to keep his place in the starting rotation.

They seem miserable, fluffing themselves up into balls in an attempt to make down jackets of their own feathers. Dozens of Lapland longspurs are jumping, pecking, jumping, pecking in the dust near the robins, and looking immeasurably more at home.

    "target_paragraph": "Kreiz was a commodious beauty; Fred had designed the interior and, once inside, you almost forgot that you were on a boat. There were several sleeping cabins arranged around the main salon, with its dining table, galley and lounge. An immense freezer stored all sorts of goodies like steak, chicken and fish. Being able to store these things and consider them a part of provisioning was completely alien to me. Varuna only had an icebox, and providing I could even find ice, things could only be kept one step below warm for not more than a couple of days. After gourmet feasts, I would either cuddle up in Marie and Laurence’s cabin with Estelle for discussions on hand creams, foot massages and picture shows, or sit around with Fred in the main salon and discuss engine lubricants and water pumps. There was time for silliness with the girls and a time for seriousness between two captains.",

Christopher wanted us all to go to the village. I, knowing the village was five miles off, wanted us all to stay in the car, arguing that such a walk would be an indescribable bore, that the village in question was inhospitable and thievish enough when awake, that it would be more so if disturbed when asleep, and that in any case it would give us no help till morning. Christopher replied that it was nonsense to suppose the wolves would be deterred by headlights or the engine running, and that if we stayed in the car, they would raven their way through the side-curtains and pick our bones clean. To this I averred that whether it was nonsense or not, we should stand a better chance in the car than out of it, and that anyhow the dogs of the village were more savage than wolves. “For God’s sake,” I said, “get into the car, drink this whisky, and let us be cosy.”",

He dressed rapidly, shivering, not so much from the cold because a fresh fire already boomed and roared on the hearth, but in that dead winter hour when the blood and the heart are slow and sleep is incomplete. He crossed the gap between house and kitchen, the gap of iron earth beneath the brilliant and rigid night where dawn would not begin for three hours yet, tasting, tongue palate and to the very bottom of his lungs the searing dark, and entered the kitchen, the lamplit warmth where the stove glowed, fogging the windows, and where Boon already sat at the table at breakfast, hunched over his plate, almost in his plate, his working jaws blue with stubble and his face innocent of water and his coarse, horse-mane hair innocent of comb—the quarter Indian, grandson of a Chickasaw squaw, who on occasion resented with his hard and furious fists the intimation of one single drop of alien blood and on others, usually after whisky, affirmed with the same fists and the same fury that his father had been the full-blood Chickasaw and even a chief and that even his mother had been only half white. He was four inches over six feet; he had the mind of a child, the heart of a horse, and little hard shoe-button eyes without depth or meanness or generosity or viciousness or gentleness or anything else, in the ugliest face the boy had ever seen. It looked like somebody had found a walnut a little larger than a football and with a machinist’s hammer had shaped features into it and then painted it, mostly red; not Indian red but a fine bright ruddy color which whisky might have had something to do with but which was mostly just happy and violent out-of-doors, the wrinkles in it not the residue of the forty years it had survived but from squinting into the sun or into the gloom of cane-brakes where game had run, baked into it by the camp fires before which he had lain trying to sleep on the cold November or December ground while waiting for daylight so he could rise and hunt again, as though time were merely something he walked through as he did through air, aging him no more than air did. He was brave, faithful, improvident and unreliable; he had neither profession job nor trade and owned one vice and one virtue: whisky, and that absolute and unquestioning fidelity to Major de Spain and the boy’s cousin McCaslin. “Sometimes I’d call them both virtues,” Major de Spain said once. “Or both vices,” McCaslin said.",

It put both men in a false position, performing live in a TV duel that flatly contradicted GNU’s reconciliatory objective. President de Klerk, an experienced professional politician, was of course the more polished performer though his English is less fluent than Mr Mandela’s. (Both were using their second language.) The latter, aware that his hardline followers rage against this demeaning debate with a man they despise, too often attacked the President personally in an un-Mandela-like way. Much dirty linen was dragged out of both laundry baskets, a tactic not calculated to lower tension. But this is all part of the present muddle – seeing a TV confrontation as mandatory during a ‘democratic’ election campaign, however inappropriate it may be.",

It must have been some sort of convent. But it is eminently what they call a \"painter's bit\"—that pallid, big baroque face, at the top of the slow incline, and the very curious dark building at the side of it, with its several dark-tiled round roofs, like pointed hats, at varying altitudes. The whole space has a strange Spanish look, neglected, arid, yet with a bigness and a dilapidated dignity and a stoniness which carry one back to the Middle Ages, when life was violent and Orosei was no doubt a port and a considerable place.

They returned down the aisle, the old man erect beside her, looking to neither side, paced by that slow whisper of collars. Again the girl stopped. She began to cringe back, her body arching slowly, her arm tautening in the old man’s grasp. He bent toward her, speaking; she moved again, in that shrinking and rapt abasement. Four younger men were standing stiffly erect near the exit. They stood like soldiers, staring straight ahead until the old man and the girl reached them. Then they moved and surrounded the other two, and in a close body, the girl hidden among them, they moved toward the door. Here they stopped again; the girl could be seen shrunk against the wall just inside the door, her body arched again. She appeared to be clinging there, then the five bodies hid her again and again in a close body the group passed through the door and disappeared. The room breathed: a buzzing sound like a wind getting up. It moved forward with a slow increasing rush, on above the long table where the prisoner and the woman with the child and Horace and the District Attorney and the Memphis lawyer sat, and across the jury and against the Bench in a long sigh. The Memphis lawyer was sitting on his spine, gazing dreamily out the window. The child made a fretful sound, whimpering.",

Sitting in a restaurant overlooking the streets, we were pretty disappointed to see drunken tourists and locals stumble along to the blaring rhythm of reggae and disco, pumped full volume from old trucks. No colorful costumes lent an air of gaiety to the spectacle and, stuck there until we could catch the morning ferry back to St. Thomas, we reminisced about other July Fourths in other places, found a couple of unoccupied benches away from the fanfare and fell asleep under the tropical night sky.",

On the mantelpiece and window ledges were dozens of found objects: bird’s eggs, bones, antlers and pebbles. A swan’s wishbone with no central join. A skua’s egg from the Shiants. A pure-white golden plover’s egg, fragile as a bubble. Dark-brown sea beans, floated in from the Caribbean, like little leather kidneys.",

Mr Pepper with all his learning had been mistaken for a cormorant, and then, as unjustly, transformed into a cow. At night, indeed, when the waltzes were swinging in the saloon, and gifted passengers reciting, the little ship—shrunk to a few beads of light out among the dark waves, and one high in air upon the mast-head—seemed something mysterious and impressive to heated partners resting from the dance. She became a ship passing in the night—an emblem of the loneliness of human life, an occasion for queer confidences and sudden appeals for sympathy.",
