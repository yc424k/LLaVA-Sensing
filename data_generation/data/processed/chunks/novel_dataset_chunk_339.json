She begged for the old organdie skirts which would not meet across her back and gapped scandalously over her dingy tights. Alabama had them made with four ruffles on a broad band that bound her hips—five francs it cost to get them ironed in a French laundry. There was a red-and-white check for weather like Normandy, a chartreuse for decadent days, pink for her lessons at midday, and sky blue for late afternoon. In the mornings she liked white skirts best to match the colourless reflection on the skylight.",

Through these thread white cascades, tumbling in free fall into the waiting arms of a frothing river. Fat pigs roam the roadside; now and then a tethered cow mows the grass on a quiet side lane. Occasionally, we slow to share the road with a filigreed, painted cart. The jauntily trotting horse pulling it down the highway is decorated, too, with jangling harness bells and a crocheted cap to whisk flies from its eyes. At an eddy among the rapids, a housewife dips two buckets into the river, then walks up to her house, buckets suspended from a long pole bridging her shoulders. Petunias display their pinks and purples to the sun. Sheets flap dry in the breeze. It’s so lovely I can taste it.",

(To get to the candy-striped cabanas, the concrete bathing pier, the black-sand beach, one, if one has total faith in progress, takes a lift, or—more reliable and more thrilling—a flight of stairs carved out of rock by the Etruscans, whose chisel marks can still be seen. In the tunnels that punctuate the descent, Cocumella cooks make pasta; in those cool grottoes fishermen clean their fish. The view from the bottom of the sheer cliffs is as beautiful as the view from the top, satisfying the requirements of great sculpture.) Nello says his father owned part of this land but ceased to own it after the Fascists took power. The story is unclear to me. Nello, away from Ameriea, is more playful and effervescent, more the paterfamilias, but also more opaque, superficially sunny, in fact a nest of darkness in which something obscure seems always to lurk; he closes down. By way of explanation, “The law has no reason, the smart always win,” he says.",

We went to a café and drank pints of coffee; it was good to see him again. When we got to Los Lingues servants were marching along garden paths bearing tables and baskets of flowers, cars and vans were delivering amplifiers and oysters, small knots of singers and musicians were practising in corners, stableboys were brushing down horses and in the kitchens teams of cooks and assistants were rolling pastry for empanadas, basting suckling pigs and squeezing sacks of lemons for pisco sours. Besides feeling light-headed from lack of sleep, the abrupt contrast of this luxuriant excess with my experiences of the past two months had a curious effect. It made me feel as if I were standing outside of my body and watching myself walk through the hacienda.",

The past takes time to orient itself within a new environment, and so, if you move fast enough, for long enough—toward exotic places, distant horizons, toward anywhere but here—you might be able to escape that which you most fear.

For every liberal policy scrapped or tightened, another remained intact.

The salesperson is always a white-haired lady working in the men’s wear department.\n\n“Can I help you find anything?” she says.\n\n“No thank you, I’m just browsing,” you tell her.\n\n“OK,” she replies, and gives you a smarmy smile that says: “I don’t really like you; I’m just required to smile at everyone.”",

The shops in towns are still owned and run by whites, and there is always a white in the background, at the garages, hotels, in the government, tactfully holding together such civilization (oh that loose word) as exists. These people might be trades-men or civil servants, with their wives. Weirdly dressed, according to my preconceptions from movies and books; ladies in tiny shorts, gents in city shoes and bits and pieces of outdoor clothing—more like beachwear than animal-watching. They are well equipped with food, as for an extended picnic.",

There were very kind people there, and magical lights, and cathedral-like, glowing cliffs of translucent, turquoise ice, and I was shocked that this place that was so dark and cold and unexpected could be the most spectacular place I had ever been.

Best of all, the hotel was just over the river, about half a mile from the Hilton. Teresa nodded in agreement. The hotel sounded fine for a couple days, but she didn’t want to walk there. She was hot, and our bags – overstuffed with groceries for our aborted trip to Luxor – were heavy. Teresa finished her coffee and croissant and followed me to the curb. I tried to hail a taxi, but none would stop. Egyptian taxi drivers are fickle. One day they’ll follow you around town like puppies (TAX…!), the next day they’ll pass by you in a cloud of dust. I suppose there’s a method to their madness, but we never figured it out. When a driver finally did stop for us that afternoon, it was all for naught. He slammed on his brakes and stopped fifty feet down the block. We had to jog after him. “Where go?” he asked. “Novotel El Borg, on Gezirah,” I answered. The driver cursed me and pointed through his windshield. The hotel’s logo glowed like a sapphire on the far side of the river. The driver sped away, and Teresa laughed. “OK, we’ll walk,” she said.",

Nearly thirty years after his death, Colombians approach Pablo Escobar’s legacy with a host of conflicting emotions. There is, of course, horror, shame, anger, and hate. But there is also morbid curiosity, cloaked admiration, skepticism, and wonder, an almost pornographic attraction for a common man who rose to such heights, a simple bandido who defied the United States for over a decade, even while fighting his way to a fortune unlike anything that had been known in the annals of crime. With each passing year, as the crowds at Hacienda Nápoles attest, the greatest killer in the history of Colombia comes closer to slipping from history into the realm of myth.",

I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.",

As we banked sharply on approach to the small airstrip at Vieques, I half expected Phillipe to ask me if I wanted to land the plane. Again, our conversation seemed to take precedence over any communication with air traffic control, and I found myself anxiously scanning the surrounding skies as we approached, like a driving instructor with a nervous learner at a tricky roundabout.",

I hit the bottom with a bump and fall over. Dazed, disoriented and dusty, I sense a strange sight and sound emerging from the smog. A huge hurricane fence appears to be alive.

Then a nearby bird called twice. The hunter moved to spot his prey, crouched down to aim, fired, dropped his musket beside me and swiftly ascended a steep slope. Ten minutes later he returned, beaming and waving his starling-sized bag. Given the mistiness, how had he seen it, targeted it so accurately – then found it in thick undergrowth?

I come quite near, quite near, and they hold very quiet their hand with the crumbs in it. I see the other hand stealing round to close upon me – then there’s a flutter – un battement d’ailes – l’oiseau s’est de nouveau dérobé! They remain gazing after me, with their mouths wide open. They look so silly. And they haven’t robbed me of one plume – not a single plume.\n‘Julian! Why this mania for capture? this wanting to take from me my most treasured possession – liberty? When I want to give, I’ll give freely – largesse with both hands, showers of gold and flowers and precious stones – (don’t say I’m not conceited!) but I’ll never give my liberty, and I’ll never allow it to be forced away from me. I should feel a traitor. I couldn’t walk through a forest and hear the wind in the trees. I couldn’t listen to music. (Ah, Julian! This afternoon I steeped myself in music; Grieg, elf-like, mischievous, imaginative, romantic, so Latin sometimes in spite of his Northern blood. You would love Grieg, Julian. In the fairyland of music, Grieg plays gnome to Debussy’s magician … Then “Khovant-china”, of all music the most sublime, the most perverse, the most bariolé, the most abandoned, and the most desolate.) I could have no comradeship with a free and inspired company. I should have betrayed their secrets, bartered away their mysteries …’",

He genially invited us in from the freezing tea-house to the comparative warmth of the kitchen where his culinary feats are performed on a mud stove built up to waist-level and fuelled with bright yellow mulberry wood. Here the only light came from the leaping flames and our only fellow-guest was a wordless character with an Early Man brow and a rifle on the table by his tin plate. He ate squatting on his haunches on a wooden bench, wrapped in a thick brown blanket, and when he stood up to go out into the icy night I saw that his feet were bare.",

While the enemy was changing his magazine, I tossed a hand grenade behind his rock, ducked, slipped in a new magazine and waited for him to break cover. Out leaped a khaki figure with his tommy-gun blazing and shouting “Na! Scullion of the Glückbergs” in a peculiar high voice. I dropped just in time and fired a whole burst from the ground. The guerrilla let go his gun, stumbled downhill a few paces and lay still—just over there. And do you know’—Marko’s voice after a pause had dropped to a lower pitch—‘it was a woman! I had thought there was something odd about the voice. And a very good-looking one too, with her hair cut short. She’d stopped the whole burst. Phoveró itan! Phríki!! It was horrible, terrible.’",

(It is strange how these newspaper photographs call to mind the very peopled paintings of fifteenth-century Florentine artists—people of all classes minutely observed, craning and posturing.) By the summer of 1943 Germans were in full possession of Florence, and they had removed all the gold and silver from the shops on the Ponte Vecchio. In old photos pretty girls hand flowers to German soldiers. Short years later other pretty girls, who look like the same pretty girls, applaud British soldiers. (In pictures of those war years everybody looks exactly the same; my mother, a pretty girl, is interchangeable with thousands of other mothers, or so I always think.) Florentines who had welcomed Hitler greeted the liberators with equal enthusiasm; railing against the mystical languors and cynicism of Fascism, they marched toward the Duomo, singing songs of the Risorgimento.",

Fitted with painful tightness into an old wooden arm-chair, before a worm-eaten oak table in an upstairs room of a four-roomed cottage with a roof of moss-grown tiles, Michaelis was writing night and day in a shaky, slanting hand that “Autobiography of a Prisoner” which was to be like a book of Revelation in the history of mankind. The conditions of confined space, seclusion, and solitude in a small four-roomed cottage were favourable to his inspiration. It was like being in prison, except that one was never disturbed for the odious purpose of taking exercise according to the tyrannical regulations of his old home in the penitentiary. He could not tell whether the sun still shone on the earth or not. The perspiration of the literary labour dropped from his brow. A delightful enthusiasm urged him on. It was the liberation of his inner life, the letting out of his soul into the wide world. And the zeal of his guileless vanity (first awakened by the offer of five hundred pounds from a publisher) seemed something predestined and holy.",

He had scrambled to the summit of Scafell in the Lake District – at 973 metres England’s second highest mountain, and a threatening little rock peak when approached from the wrong angle. The weather was volatile that day: a lurid sky to the south suggested a storm was imminent. It was time to get down. By his own admission ‘too confident, and too indolent to look around’, Coleridge decided to gamble, and headed off to the north-east edge of the summit plateau. He couldn’t have chosen a worse direction. For that line took him towards what is known now as Broad Stand, a steep giant’s staircase of rock slabs and sloping ledges. Determined to keep to the rules of his own game (‘rely upon fortune for how far down this possibility will continue’), however, Coleridge started to make his way down.",
