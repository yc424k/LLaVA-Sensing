    "target_paragraph": "Ferragosto, at first, baffled us as a holiday until we began to understand it as a state of mind. We, gradually, have entered this state of mind ourselves. Simply put, ferragosto, August 15, marks the ascension of the corporeal body and soul of the Virgin Mary into heaven. Why August 15? Perhaps it was too hot to remain on earth another day. The domed ceiling of the cathedral in Parma depicts her glorious skyward rise, accompanied by many others. From the perspective below, you’re looking up their billowing skirts as they balloon above the cathedral floor. This is a triumph of art—no one’s underwear shows. But the day itself is only a marker in the month, for the broader meaning of the word is August holidays and a period of intense laissez-faire. We’re coming to understand that everyday work life is suspended for all of August. Even though throngs of tourists descend on a town, the best trattoria may have tacked up a chiuso per ferie sign, closed for vacation, and the owners have packed and taken off for Viareggio. American business logic does not bear up; they do not necessarily rake in money during tourist season and take their holiday during April or November when tourists are gone. Why not? Because it is August. The accident rates soar on the highways. The beach towns are mobbed. We have learned to forget all projects more complicated than putting up jam. Or to abandon even that—I fill my hat with plums then sit down under the tree, suck the juice, and toss skin and seed over the wall. All over Italy, the feast of the Assumption calls for a celebration. Cortona throws a grand party: the Sagra della bistecca, a festa for the great beefsteaks of the area.",

    "target_paragraph": "‘As I watch [the world],’ wrote Nan Shepherd in 1945, ‘it arches its back, and each layer of landscape bristles.’ It is a brilliant observation about observation. Shepherd knew that ‘landscape’ is not something to be viewed and appraised from a distance, as if it were a panel in a frieze or a canvas in a frame. It is not the passive object of our gaze, but rather a volatile participant – a fellow subject which arches and bristles at us, bristles into us. Landscape is still often understood as a noun connoting fixity, scenery, an immobile painterly decorum.* I prefer to think of the word as a noun containing a hidden verb: landscape scapes, it is dynamic and commotion causing, it sculpts and shapes us not only over the courses of our lives but also instant by instant, incident by incident. I prefer to take ‘landscape’ as a collective term for the temperature and pressure of the air, the fall of light and its rebounds, the textures and surfaces of rock, soil and building, the sounds (cricket screech, bird cry, wind through trees), the scents (pine resin, hot stone, crushed thyme) and the uncountable other transitory phenomena and atmospheres that together comprise the bristling presence of a particular place at a particular moment.",

Or, if details like these escaped her, she might have let her fancy play upon the gold tint of the sea at sunset, and thought how it lapped in coins of gold upon the shingle. Little pleasure boats shoved out into it; the black arm of the pier hoarded it up. The whole city was pink and gold; domed; mist-wreathed; resonant; strident. Banjoes strummed; the parade smelt of tar which stuck to the heels; goats suddenly cantered their carriages through crowds. It was observed how well the Corporation had laid out the flower-beds. Sometimes a straw hat was blown away. Tulips burnt in the sun. Numbers of sponge-bag trousers were stretched in rows. Purple bonnets fringed soft, pink, querulous faces on pillows in bath chairs. Triangular hoardings were wheeled along by men in white coats. Captain George Boase had caught a monster shark. One side of the triangular hoarding said so in red, blue, and yellow letters; each line ended with three differently coloured notes of exclamation.",

These spits are created by the action of tides, currents and seasonal storms. Like sand dunes, they are in continual slow migration, forming and reforming their shape as they shift. In their movement, they are as close to organism as anything only mineral can be. Their shingle is made mostly from flint, which lies about in its several forms: big chunks, white and bulbous like knuckle bones, or long translucent bars, shiny and nubbed as the skin on an alligator’s back.",

(How strange that such an innocent need, for fresh fruit and veg, should have brought such misery to all the indigenous peoples of South Africa!) Since the eighteenth century the Gardens have been an arboreal paradise where mighty trees – wondrously exotic, from every continent – shade smooth green lawns and vivid flower-beds. In this haven of coolness and calm doves coo, grey squirrels beg cheekily, feral cats and kittens live happily in the shrubberies – being fed by friends among the open-air restaurant’s customers – and tall fountains splash and sparkle, their source the underground springs that watered those first vegetables.",

Black and white kingfishers dived repeatedly as I swam, herons waded nearby and overhead a fish eagle hovered, high up. The sky had half clouded over and when I emerged a strong east wind soon dried me. I sat opposite a rocky islet, some thirty yards offshore, which supported an ancient tree, its roots coiling like serpents among black boulders, its cascading outer branches almost touching the waters, its dense foliage home to a colony of large, raucous ungainly birds.",

Although the mosquitoes are thick tonight and the bus would no doubt offer some refuge, I decide not to bed down inside Fairbanks 142.

    "target_paragraph": "Yet I saw Miss Stuart the first time I ever went to the Museum. I had stopped at the outer gate to ask where to go to apply for a reader's ticket. As I paused there, she rode past me on a bicycle, through the opening in the great iron railings, and on across the courtyard toward the steps that stretch imposingly across the building's face. Idly, I watched her set up her bicycle in a rack at one side of them. She had a jaunty manner—a sort of certainty that impressed me, because I was brand-new in England and very timid—but there was more than manner to be noticed about Miss Stuart. On a cold, raw, dark day in January, in an era when women never wore bifurcated clothing for anything but the most drastic activities, she was attired in very short running shorts, a cotton sweater without sleeves, and socks. I gawked as I went after her, but by the time I had followed her to the top of the steps and into the building she had vanished. I went into the office I had been directed to, and forgot all about her in the perplexity of filling in the required form. I learned that before I could get a ticket I must be vouched for by three individuals— a property owner, a bank manager, and a clergyman. It seemed too difficult to contemplate. I was near giving up the whole idea of England and retiring to New York in disgrace. It wasn't as if I had ever passionately wanted to be there, I reminded myself. Where I wanted to be was the Belgian Congo. Naturally, I had welcomed the chance of getting out of Depression America and having my first venture abroad, but now I regretted being so impulsive. I am a chilly type, whose hands and feet remain cold even in the tropics, and I was already half stupefied with the London wintertime damp, the cold, and the dark. It was impossible to feel the emotions I knew I should be experiencing. I saw no magic in London and possessed no mysterious conviction that I had been there before. The streets did not make me think of Dickens; they were just streets. The traffic reminded me more of Brooklyn than of anywhere else. People in dirty raincoats stumped along pavements that were apparently coated with machine oil, and I could not blame them for looking as bad-tempered as they did. Henry James, I decided, must have been out of his mind.",

It was a fortunate thing that he had been employed by the monks, for though the lay nobles play an important part in the administration of the country, a small group of monks has the last word in everything. For this reason I felt no little satisfaction when one day I was summoned to the garden of the Tsedrungs.",

The fog came down in the morning and stayed till night. It wasn’t a disagreeable fog; it lay heavy and black between the sun and the earth; there was no light but the air was clear. The municipal ‘tart’ paced up and down by the largest cinema, old and haggard and unused. Her trade was spoilt; there were too many girls about who hadn’t a proper sense of values, who would give you a good time in return for a fish tea. The trams creaked round the goose market, and day after day the one bookshop displayed a card in the window printed with Sassoon’s poem:",

It’s a distinguished dark green, and even though the gold lettering on it is obscured by dirt I know exactly what it is: an authentic bottle of The Glenlivet single malt Scotch whisky. What seems like a lifetime ago, Bernard and I wandered through a Beijing supermarket, refusing the Chinese-made whisky, searching out something that would lift our spirits down the road, wherever that might be. We stuffed the carton under the spare exhaust pipe to keep it safe, then forgot all about it. “Hey Bernard, want a shot?” I shout, waving the bottle in his direction. When he shakes his head ruefully, I’m not disappointed. The truth is, neither of us is much of a drinker, and besides, we’re both too fatigued. “I know someone who’d love this,” I say and set it aside for the dinner hour.",

Nowadays you get a color TV, a coffee-making tray with a little packet of modestly tasty biscuits, a private bath with fluffy towels, a little basket of cotton wool balls in rainbow colors, and an array of sachets or little plastic bottles of shampoo, bath gel, and moisturizing lotion. My room even had an adequate bedside light and two soft pillows. I was very happy. I ran a deep bath, emptied into it all the gels and moisturizing creams (don’t be alarmed; I’ve studied this closely and can assure you that they are all the same substance), and, as a fiesta of airy bubbles began their slow ascent toward a position some three feet above the top of the bath, returned to the room and slipped easily into the self-absorbed habits of the lone traveler, unpacking my knapsack with deliberative care, draping wet clothes over the radiator, laying out clean ones on the bed with as much fastidiousness as if I were about to go to my first high-school prom, arranging a travel clock and reading material with exacting precision on the bedside table, adjusting the lighting to a level of considered coziness, and finally retiring, in perky spirits and with a good book, for a long wallow in the sort of luxuriant foam seldom seen outside Jayne Mansfield movies.",

When Benjamin was eighteen he was erect as a man of fifty; he had more hair and it was of a dark gray; his step was firm, his voice had lost its cracked quaver and descended to a healthy baritone. So his father sent him up to Connecticut to take examinations for entrance to Yale College. Benjamin passed his examination and became a member of the freshman class.",

The thousands of amateur photographers were more mobile, darting from side to side of the road, eliciting blasts from policemen’s whistles, cracks on the head from violently flapped fans, shouts from irate taxi drivers, and long deep wails from the horns of buses that grew louder and more desperate as the disaster progressed, till eventually the scores of taiko drums were audible only if you were standing next to them.",

The town that night had been lively and gay, with families and children already looking ahead to Christmas. Ahmed and his brother, visiting from Barranquilla, set out around two a.m. and had just reached the fishing grounds when they heard the muffled roar of high-powered boats in the distance. Working the nets, Ahmed thought nothing of it until a loud explosion shattered the dawn. They then saw six boats coming their way—not police, as he had expected, but paramilitary, some sixty armed men, all outfitted in camouflage. If they fled, as his brother urged, the paras would take it as a sign of guilt. Instead, Ahmed knelt and prayed, asking God to protect them. One of the boats pulled alongside their canoe. Ahmed feared the worst as the paras hooded his brother. He could smell the guns, and knew that people had already died.",

Compared to the sharp excitement, the air of expectation and of hurried activity which he had observed in other parts of the theatre, the atmosphere of this room was quiet, subdued, and even, after so much electric tension, just vaguely melancholy. The room had in it the smell of goods and cloth; it had also the kind of gentle warmth that goes with women’s work—with the hum of sewing machines, the sound of the treadle, and the quiet play of busy hands—an atmosphere that is apparently a happy one for a woman, but that is likely to be a little depressing to a man. To the youth, the room, although a large one, and on the scale of ordered enterprise, nevertheless evoked somehow an instant memory of all these other more domestic things. Long rows of costumes were hung on hooks from the walls, and on two or three long tables, such as tailors use, were strewn other garments, dresses, jackets, bits of lace or trimming, the varied evidence of work and of repair.",

Friends and colleagues called him C.A. As a youth, C.A. became adroit at trapping muskrats, whose pelts furriers made into jackets and stoles that they marketed under the more appealing name of “Hudson seal.” C.A. made enough from the trade to put himself through the University of Michigan law school. Upon qualifying, he opened a law office in Little Falls, Minnesota, married, produced three daughters, and prospered sufficiently to build a large wooden house on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River about a mile and a half outside town. All was eminently well with his life until the spring of 1898, when his wife died suddenly from surgery to remove an abdominal growth.",

He likely had a lot on his mind. After graduating in the spring of 1898, Hiram III returned to Honolulu to join the family business, as superintendent of a mission devoted to aiding the down-and-out. But Bingham’s years at Yale had taught him to question his father’s fundamentalist faith, and he lasted only six months before tendering his resignation. He later explained that he had left “because I found it impossible to teach the very orthodox beliefs which those in charge of the Mission expected to be taught.”",

As the falcon flies, this place is not a mile from Yamarkhar, yet they might be in different lands, in different centuries. The stone houses of Yamarkhar are well separated, as in Tibet, while the dwellings here are all in one stepped pueblo on the hillside, so that the roof of one house is another’s terrace, the levels connected by crude ladders hewn in a single log. Yamarkhar people dress like Nepali peasants; here the men wear loincloths and a blanket across the shoulders, and the women wind their hair in gigantic buns, which they comb in the sunlight with stiff broomlike brushes. Several women and one man wear striking necklaces of the white tusks of musk deer, one of the many primitive animals that are found in this evolutionary backwater, cut off from the rest of Eurasia by high mountains; the long recurved canine tusks are replaced in modern deer by antlers. This little deer is killed mostly for its musk, used as a perfume base; because one musk pod (a large gland in the male’s belly skin) brings up to five hundred dollars in Kathmandu, the musk deer is disappearing from Nepal.",

For reasons I still don’t completely comprehend, people will line up before dawn to climb Huayna Picchu, but virtually no one who isn’t a professional photographer climbs Mount Machu Picchu, even though you’re allowed to do so whenever you feel like it. I suppose, for starters, it has something to do with its being more than twice as tall as Huayna Picchu, a steep sixteen hundred feet straight up. There are also no ruins to see along the route, save some granite steps and platforms. Personally, I had little interest in seeing some place that, as far as I could recall, had no special significance for Bingham. But it had turned out to be a beautiful day, and I was sitting in a place that I knew a million people dreamed of visiting but would never have the chance to.",

Ah” on a rising note about to become screaming again. “Come on,” Ratliff said. “We better get Varner.” They went up the road in a body, treading the moon-blanched dust in the tremulous April night murmurous with the moving of sap and the wet bursting of burgeoning leaf and bud and constant with the thin and urgent cries and the brief and fading bursts of galloping hooves. Varner’s house was dark, blank and without depth in the moonlight. They stood, clumped darkly in the silver yard and called up at the blank windows until suddenly someone was standing in one of them. It was Flem Snopes’ wife. She was in a white garment; the heavy braided club of her hair looked almost black against it. She did not lean out, she merely stood there, full in the moon, apparently blank-eyed or certainly not looking downward at them—the heavy gold hair, the mask not tragic and perhaps not even doomed: just damned, the strong faint lift of breasts beneath the marblelike fall of the garment; to those below what Brunhilde, what Rhinemaiden on what spurious river-rock of papier-mache, what Helen returned to what topless and shoddy Argos, waiting for no one. “Evening, Mrs Snopes,” Ratliff said. “We want Uncle Will. Henry Armstid is hurt at Mrs Littlejohn’s.” She vanished from the window. They waited in the moonlight, listening to the faint remote shouts and cries, until Varner emerged, sooner than they had actually expected, hunching into his coat and buttoning his trousers over the tail of his nightshirt, his suspenders still dangling in twin loops below the coat. He was carrying the battered bag which contained the plumber-like tools with which he drenched and wormed and blistered and floated or drew the teeth of horses and mules; he came down the steps, lean and loosejointed, his shrewd ruthless head cocked a little as he listened also to the faint bell-like cries and shouts with which the silver air was full.",

She was too tired to get up, but stretching out her arm she drew toward her the arm-chair which stood beside the hearth and rested her head against its cushions. Gradually the warmth of the fire stole into her veins and her heaviness of soul was replaced by a dreamy buoyancy. She seemed to be seated on the hearth in her sitting-room at Givré, and Darrow was beside her, in the chair against which she leaned. He put his arms about her shoulders and drawing her head back looked into her eyes. \"Of all the ways you do your hair, that's the way I like best,\" he said...",

However, between Cuba’s Wars of Independence the international sugar crisis shattered the social superstructure of old latifundista families; in 1958 not one mill was owned by the descendants of a Spanish grantee. A few aristocratic Camaguey clans, like the Betancourts and Agromontes, retained shrunken cattle ranches but the largest and richest estates belonged to US companies.",

By now the level land south of Pardi is grey, arid and harsh to the eyes – but half-a-mile north of the village one is in a new, cool green world where the narrow laneways are shaded by towering, leafy trees and where clumps of powerfully curving bamboos, more than one hundred feet tall, bend their feathered tops over fields of shoulder-high maize. At about 6.30 a strangely muted light began to come from the west and soon this suppressed sunshine, slanting through torn copper clouds, was casting a red-gold glow over the whole landscape until the circular, ochre farmsteads seemed like giant lanterns against their dark green background.",

The hotel clerk checked and found they were booked solid for the night. I returned to the passenger seat and Jack drove back onto the highway. The reality that I would remain onboard for the duration finally seeped through Jack’s thick skull. We headed eastward with Chan still in the sleeper resting up for his turn at the wheel while I wedged my little green bookbag between the cold window and the seat’s back so I could lay my head on it. I leaned against the bookbag listening to the winds whirling by outside and tried to doze. After a while, I noticed that the truck moved more slowly than usual. I wondered if the speed just felt slower because my eyes were closed until I glanced out the windshield. Flurries of snow danced around the truck, escaping into the night on either side of the rig as it cut gradually into mountain country. I looked at the speedometer that shone up from the dashboard into Jack’s bearded face, his brow furrowed with concentration. Fifty miles an hour. Turbo or no turbo, there would be slow going tonight.",

When I first saw the squall approaching, I pulled up the painter astern and let the precipitation wash the barnacles clean. With my knife I easily peeled three or four ounces of barnacles from the line. Mixed with rainwater, they made a slightly crunchy soup, which I drank from my Tupperware box. I couldn’t get the idea of a McDonald’s Quarter-Pounder McBarnacle Burger out of my mind. Soaked with salt water in a plastic bag, the remaining raisins had fermented until they bore little resemblance to the original fruit. But they made a final treat for my banquet—they were my last food from terra firma.",

None of it had gone according to plan, none of it had lived up to my expectations.

Water cascaded over the decks and ran down the hatches, and Bartlett knew it was finally time. He reached for a record—Chopin’s “Funeral March”—placed it on the Victrola, and wound it full, closing his eyes as the first notes rose above the surge of rushing water. Then he left the galley and went to the railing, holding on tight as the ship was sinking.",

It was not the spirit and the temper of that high-toned place. But he often suspected them of having secret sources of refreshment, victuals cunningly cached away in the privacy of their rooms, to which they could gluttonously resort in safe seclusion, faced only by the accusing eye of their own conscience and their God. He used to have his dark suspicions of them all. It seemed to him that sometimes when they got up, said “Mahlzeit,” and made their refined and dignified departures, he could detect in their manners traces of unclean eagerness and indecent haste, or observe in the expression of their eyes the awakened fires of a gluttonous and faintly obscene lust. Then he would follow them in his mind’s eye as they went from the dining room and down the corridor to their own room. In his mind’s eye he could see them, walking deliberately at first with dignified restraint, but quickening their footsteps perceptibly as they went on, until, as they turned the corner and went down the empty hallway towards their own door, they fairly broke into a run, frantically fumbled at the lock, opened the door and closed and bolted it behind them, and then, laughing hysterically, fairly hurled themselves upon a sausage, greedily crammed the dainties of their guilty pleasure in their mouths.",

    "target_paragraph": "“The Florentine,” says Marcella Hazan, author of indispensable Italian cook-books, is a “careful and calculating man who knows the measure of all things, and his cooking is an austerely composed play upon essential and unadorned themes. . . . Florence takes a T-bone steak of noble size and grills it quickly over a blazing fire, adding nothing but the aroma of freshly ground pepper and olive oil.” She goes on to observe, as does everyone who writes about Italian food, that Italian food doesn't exist: Italian cooking is regional. This is not absolutely true. In Florence, as in Milan and Rome, and to some extent in Venice, one can find food of many regions prepared with integrity, true to the region that gave it birth. It is possible to find such food, which makes no concessions to palates that have been corrupted by “Italian-American” restaurant food, in small, family-run trattorie as well as in large dining rooms. As one travels south of Rome, where the climate is warmer, as are the tempers (and the sauces), regional food predominates. Tastes become less subtle, more intense, even violent; you encounter more tomato; butter all but disappears, and red pepper comes on with a vengeance, and as food becomes spicier and more pungent, the onion gives way to garlic. I would be surprised if in the small villages of the Abruzzi and Calabria where my family lives, the kinds of food available, and the ways of preparing them, had changed very much in the last hundred years. (Some people speak of Italy as having two great civilizations: that of wine-and-olive-oil and that of milk-and-butter. In Tuscany, according to this view, the gastronomic civilizations meet.)",

The great man (whom they all addressed simply as “George” or “Frenny”) was evidently trying to be friendly, in his dry sardonic way; but he paid no heed to Mrs. Spear’s allusions to “our young poet,” and his remarks to Vance were merely perfunctory questions as to his life in the West, and his present sojourn at the Tracys’. Once indeed he asked, blinking absently at the boy through his glasses: “And what’s the next move to be?” but on Vance’s answering: “I want to get onto a newspaper,” his interest seemed to flag. “Oh, of course,” he merely said, as who should imply; “What’s the use of expecting anything different in a world of sameness?” and the blood which had rushed to Vance’s face ebbed back to his heart. A few hours earlier, as he talked of his poetry with Halo Spear by the mountain pool, everything had seemed possible; now he thought bitterly: “When it comes down to hardpan girls don’t know anything anyhow.” And it gave him a grim satisfaction to class his mountain nymph in the common category.",
