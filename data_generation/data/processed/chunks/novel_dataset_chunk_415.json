The big drum beat, the heels stamped and the gourds rattled, and the devil sank to the ground, his long faded yellow hair billowing in the dust. His two eyes were two painted rings and he had a flat black wooden snout a yard long fringed with fur; when it opened one saw great red wooden tusks. His black wooden nose stuck up at right angles between his eyes which were almost flat on his snout. His mouth opened and closed like a clapper and he spoke in a low monotonous sing-sing. He was like a portmanteau word; an animal, a bird and a man had all run together to form his image. All the women, except the musicians, had gone to their huts and watched Landow from a distance. His interpreter squatted beside him carrying a brush with which, when the devil moved, he kept his skirts carefully smoothed down lest a foot or arm should show.",

He was drugged in phantasy as they passed the East India tea-house, and as he saw tall turbaned men who walked about within and caught for the first time, so that he never forgot, the slow incense of the East. Once in a huge building roaring with sound, he was rooted before a mighty locomotive, the greatest monster he had ever seen, whose wheels spun terrifically in grooves, whose blazing furnaces, raining hot red coals into the pit beneath, were fed incessantly by two grimed fire-painted stokers.

I had brought with me among more ephemeral literature Palgrave’s Golden Treasury, the collected poems of Tennyson and Browning, and at the last minute I had added Rob Roy, perhaps because it contained the only photograph I possessed of my aunt. When I opened the book now the pages naturally divided at the photograph, and I found myself thinking not for the first time that the happy smile, the young breasts, the curve of her body in the old-fashioned bathing costume were like the suggestion of a budding maternity. The memory of Visconti’s son as he took her in his arms on the Milan platform hurt me a little, and I looked out of my porthole, to escape my thoughts, into the winter day, and saw a tall lean sad grey man gazing back at me. My window gave on to the bows and he turned quickly away to watch the ship’s wake, embarrassed at having been noticed. I finished my unpacking and went down to the bar.",

Soft-drink machines incorporated games of baseball roulette, magazines offered readers in Hiroshima the chance to “meet your Carp.” Half the little boys across the length of the country seemed to be sporting Giants caps, and every day brought seven different newspapers dealing with nothing—nothing—but sports. Earlier in the summer, a colleague told me, he had been on a photographic assignment in a Buddhist monastery outside Kyoto. Gradually, and patiently, he had won the trust of the head monk. Finally, once the sacred rituals were complete, the holy man had been moved to give his visitor, as a token of his appreciation, a poem. Oh, and one more thing, the monk had added: Were Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle still playing in the major leagues?",

Drifts of snow blew across the headland, and the five-mile-long line of eastern cliffs loomed craggy and forbidding above the lagoon. A thin line of smoke rose from the driftwood fire they’d left burning; then, caught by the Arctic wind, the smoke swirled into the air, merged with the storm clouds amassing over Wrangel Island, and disappeared. The clouds closed in fast, and it started to snow, until everything—the cliffs, the gravel strand, the tents, the ice-filled bay—was awash in wintry white, frozen in time.",

We agreed that arriving at a posh hotel for a conference with the heads of National Geographic dressed like that would be a bit too authentic. So I tizzed myself up in tight jeans and high-heeled suicide boots. It did nothing for my confidence. I gathered my maps together and tucked them impressively and efficiently under my arm, so as to appear capable and sure of what I was doing, then realized that I didn’t know very much about the country I was about to go over, should they ask me any embarrassing questions.

The monkeys are forty-one in all, including six infants that are carried, and they are knocking down in play the plants they are not eating. Gleeful, Tukten yells, “Ho, Diddi!” (“Hey, Sister!”) and a woman comes running from the garden, slinging stones. Curltailed, the langurs move into the rocks, in no great hurry, and there turn to observe man at their leisure. They are big handsome silver-brown creatures, one of the most beautiful of primates, with frosted faces and an expression so entirely detached as to seem disdainful—a very suitable expression, at least in the lead male, which upon taking control of a band customarily sets about the systematic killing of its infants, thereby bringing the females quickly into estrus, and preparing them for the perpetuation of his genes.",

Richard looked up and saw them, two planes flying low, with an ominously streamlined efficiency to their shape, trailing silver-white lines in the sky. Fear spread helplessness throughout his body. They lay under the orange trees, he and Kainene, side by side, silent. Harrison and Ikejide had run out of the house; Harrison threw himself flat on the ground while Ikejide kept running, his body arched slightly forward, his arms flying around, his head bobbing. Then came the cold whistle of a mortar in the air and the crash as it landed and the boom as it exploded. Richard pressed Kainene to him. A piece of shrapnel, the size of a fist, wheezed past. Ikejide was still running and, in the moment that Richard glanced away and back, Ikejide’s head was gone. The body was running, arched slightly forward, arms flying around, but there was no head. There was only a bloodied neck. Kainene screamed. The body crashed down near her long American car, the planes receded and disappeared into the distance, and they all lay still for long minutes, until Harrison got up and said, “I am getting bag.”",

The shelters were cleverly built: four sturdy trunks, on which a peaked roof rested, covered with palm fronds latticed in such a way that no rain could leak in. At the joints where the pilings of each hut met the roof there was a sort of ceiling and above it a kind of conical crawl space. A lot of equipment was stored up there in the first: panels of chonta wood and all kinds of poles, sticks, and large tins. I rummaged further, hoping to find more treasures, but the other huts contained nothing useful.",

The body of the late Señor Hirsch dwelt alone for a time in the dismal solitude of the unfinished building, resounding weirdly with sudden slams and clicks of doors and latches, with rustling scurries of torn papers, and the tremulous sighs that at each gust of wind passed under the high roof. The light of the two candles burning before the perpendicular and breathless immobility of the late Señor Hirsch threw a gleam afar over land and water, like a signal in the night. He remained to startle Nostromo by his presence, and to puzzle Dr. Monygham by the mystery of his atrocious end.",

Timi-soar-a!’ This last was the chant that brought tears even to the eyes of tough-looking young men. The atmosphere became strangely exalted. I sensed no ugly undercurrents of violence or hatred, despite the fervour with which thousands were passionately condemning Communism, and Iliescu as its agent. This felt like a pure celebration of freedom, a joyous exercise of the right to protest, rather than a demonstration channelling anger and hostility. Crowd-emotion always generates palpable energies and here all the energies were positive. When feeling depressed about Rumania’s immediate future, I reflect that throughout the country such minorities exist – a leaven which must surely, given time, transform the inert post-Ceausescu political mass.",

The thought of someday trying it had given me hope when my marriage dissolved, when other relationships ended, when I quit my job and wandered aimlessly for eight months. Always, the trail was there, as something I wanted to do, something I was terrified of, and yet something I was convinced I had to try. Always. Stepping away from the southern terminus at the start of the PCT had been the most terrifying moment of my life. Reaching the northern terminus—essentially rebirthed—had been the most visceral. Now, despite forswearing FKTs and, to some extent, long-distance hiking, the white blazes of the Appalachian Trail were inexplicably calling me.",

It had taken him days to prepare the specifications for his new sails, the canvas cockpit covers, and the cover for the dinghy. He arrived at the marina and saw Kevin’s car. As he walked down A Dock, he could see Kevin at work on the cockpit canvas and a pile of sail bags on the dock. He couldn’t wait to see Lone Eagle’s new sails up. There wasn’t any wind, so he was pleased that they could put them all up and see how they looked. Just then, his cell phone rang. It was the electrician, he’d be there in the morning to install the high-frequency single sideband Icom radio, do the wiring for the watermaker, the new inverter, a cockpit freshwater washdown pump and the taffrail generator. It would be a long day tomorrow, but it was coming together – thank God, he thought. Friday would be even bigger.",

It was the hand of God, he said. The Lord had shown her the way. So now, whenever the hot and painful feelings boiled within her, this hatred of Mrs Dalloway, this grudge against the world, she thought of God. She thought of Mr Whittaker. Rage was succeeded by calm.

These constitute — temporarily — a place for atman, the immortal soul. After the body's death, this soul, according to the principles of samsara (reincarnation), will find a home in another form. Before this it might go through a kind of hell, neraka, spend some time in heaven, suarga, or even ascend to a state of ultimate oneness with God, moksa.",

No sooner, however, had she extinguished her candle, than her momentary sleepiness took itself off, and she wished she had stayed up longer. She amused herself by listening to the old familiar noises that she could hear to be still going on downstairs, and by looking towards the window as she lay. The blind had been drawn up as she used to have it when a girl, and she could just discern the dim tree-tops against the sky on the neighbouring hill. Beneath this meeting-line of light and shade nothing was visible save one solitary point of light, which blinked as the tree-twigs waved to and fro before its beams. From its position it seemed to radiate from the window of a house on the hillside. The house had been empty when she was last at home, and she wondered who inhabited the place now.",

Hasbullah would ask all students – regardless of their problems – to undertake a questionnaire called the Bem Sexual Role Inventory, a checklist invented by the psychologist Dr Sandra Lipsitz Bem in the early 1970s, fifty questions that would apparently demonstrate whether the person was more male or female. If the child deviated from the normal range, homosexuality was a strong possibility.",

Some were painters and some tried to write when they weren’t flying their aeroplanes and all were amateurs of garrison life. For flying at night they got extra pay. The red and green lights of Jacques and Paulette swept over the sea front in aerial fete very often. Jacques hated David to pay for his drinks and Paulette needed the money—he and Madame had a baby in Algiers with his parents.",

It was impossible to find a hotel bed, hard enough to get a seat in a restaurant. Chartered trains streamed in from every point of the compass?from Akron, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, the distant West. In three days, more than a hundred extra trains arrived in the city. Scheduled trains were made longer?in some cases much longer. The Twentieth Century Limited that pulled in on fight day was three times its normal length. Among the arriving multitudes were Al Jolson, Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Harold Lloyd, Florenz Ziegfeld, Gloria Swanson, Walter Chrysler, Ty Cobb, nine U.S. senators, ten state governors, mayors beyond counting, and business potentates from all over. David Sarnoff was there to make sure the radio hookups were all in order. The Marquis of Douglas and Clydesdale, a British adventurer who would shortly become the first man to fly over Mount Everest, attended as the guest of Gene Tunney, as did the British writer Somerset Maugham.",

The sun lay in broad stripes across it. There were the cabs and the awnings and the book-shops; the old men in black gowns billowing; the young women in pink and blue dresses flowing; and the young men in straw hats carrying cushions under their arms. But for a moment all seemed to her obsolete, frivolous, inane. The usual undergraduate in cap and gown with books under his arm looked silly. And the portentous old men with their exaggerated features, looked like gargoyles, carved, medieval, unreal. They were all like people dressed up and acting parts, she thought. Now she stood at her own door and waited for Hiscock, the butler, to take his feet off the fender and waddle upstairs. Why can’t you talk like a human being? she thought, as he took her umbrella and mumbled his usual remark about the weather.",
