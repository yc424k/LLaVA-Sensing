It would have been grassless even in summer; he could imagine it, completely bare, no weed no sprig of anything, the dust each morning swept by some of Lucas’ womenfolks with a broom made of willow switches bound together, into an intricate series of whorls and overlapping loops which as the day advanced would be gradually and slowly defaced by the droppings and the cryptic three-toed prints of chickens like (remembering it now at sixteen) a terrain in miniature out of the age of the great lizards, the four of them walking in what was less than walk because its surface was dirt too yet more than path, the footpacked strip running plumbline straight between two borders of tin cans and empty bottles and shards of china and earthenware set into the ground, up to the paintless steps and the paintless gallery along whose edge sat more cans but larger—empty gallon buckets which had once contained molasses or perhaps paint and wornout water or milk pails and one five-gallon can for kerosene with its top cut off and half of what had once been somebody’s (Edmonds’ without doubt) kitchen hot water tank sliced longways like a banana—out of which flowers had grown last summer and from which the dead stalks and the dried and brittle tendrils still leaned and drooped, and beyond this the house itself, gray and weathered and not so much paintless as independent of and intractable to paint so that the house was not only the one possible continuation of the stern untended road but was its crown too as the carven ailanthus leaves are the Greek column’s capital.",

Inside, slow-moving ancients were ghosting their way through a daily tai chi ballet in the early light, while out from a small pavilion came the weird piping of ancient instruments played by a group of old-timers. Later, as the light came up, the rhythm for the city as a whole was set by the bicycles that wheeled along in leisurely brigades, pedaling, pedaling, pedaling with hasteless equanimity. Again the numbers were almost impossible to grasp: there were 5.6 million bicycles in Beijing and all of them seemed to be moving through the streets at once. But again, theirs seemed a casual motion, tranquil as the flight of swallows. Nothing smudged the grand serenity of the big city, neither cars nor airplanes nor horns; even in Tiananmen Square the vast quiet seemed scarcely dented by humanity.",

Where an earth-track leads off to Kilosa, I stopped for a cup of black tea and three nauseating maize buns, the flour adulterated with something unimaginable. Here I reluctantly started a course of antibiotics. I was beginning to wheeze; since infancy my common colds have always become fullblown bronchitis – a tiresome Achilles’ heel.

Though the “death strip” itself was plowed bare and spotlit (not to mention tripwired, booby-trapped, and patrolled by East German soldiers with a shoot-to-kill policy), a restricted area of between one hundred feet and several miles in width was maintained by the East Germans along the entire inner perimeter of the border, and thus given a reprieve from the otherwise intensive agriculture in the region. Black storks, nightjars, and red-backed shrikes nested in the branches between control towers. Lady’s slipper orchids blossomed along the forest edge. Moor frogs spawned and otters paddled in the anti-vehicle ditches. Ecologists often refer to “wildlife corridors,” strips of wild land that serve as links between habitats: here was a green highway 860 miles long, offering safe passage through an entire country. Over the forty-five years of its existence, this contested hinterlandmuch of which had previously been valuable farmlandwas colonized by more than a thousand species from Germany’s “red list” of endangered species.",

But whereas senior elephants willingly take on the task of educating and helping these elephants become productive members of another herd, we tend to allow our young to aimlessly wander and drift from place to place with little or no mentorship. They get advice not from senior leaders but from other adolescents who are in similar or perhaps even worse conditions. Couldn’t we learn from the elephants? Couldn’t we develop more ways for our senior elephants to advise and guide our lost youth? Are we guiding and mentoring our young as well as we should?

Sir Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was something in the animal’s grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he cried out at once, ‘Don’t shoot it, Geoffrey. Let it live.’",

    "target_paragraph": "WHEN my second Tibetan New Year in Lhasa came round I attended all the ceremonies of the festival from the beginning. Tens of thousands of people flocked into the town and Lhasa looked like a great encampment. This year they celebrated the beginning of the “Fire-Pig-Year.” The splendour of the ceremonies was no less than in the previous year, and I was of course particularly interested in the events I had missed the year before owing to my illness. The spectacle of which I have the liveliest recollection was the procession of a thousand soldiers in historic costumes. This custom commemorates an historical episode. Long ago a Moslem army marching on Lhasa was overtaken by heavy snowstorms at the foot of the Nyenchenthanglha mountains and completely snowed up. The Pönpos of the region brought the arms and armour of the frozen soldiers in triumph to Lhasa. Now they are brought out every year and displayed by a thousand men. The old standards are carried by; one hears the clink of chain-mail on men and horses; helmets bearing inscriptions in Urdu reflect the sunshine; the reports of the old muzzle-loaders are heard in the narrow streets; altogether a rare pageant of medieval pomp in this old-fashioned city. The parade was staged so beautifully that it gave an impression of absolute reality rather than of an accurate historical revival. The troops led by two generals marched across the Barkhor to an open space on the edge of the city. Tens of thousands of people awaited them there in the warmth of an enormous fire where flames were fanned by countless offerings of butter and grain. The crowd looked on entranced, while monks threw death’s-heads and the symbolic effigies of evil spirits into the fire. Cannons buried in the ground fired salutes towards the mountain peaks. The culminating moment was when the monk of the Oracle staggered towards the fire and after a short, wild dance collapsed on the ground. That was the moment for the people to burst out of their frozen immobility into ecstatic cries and gestures.",

One impromptu dump site sat next to the neatly groomed grounds of one of Wrangell’s nicest churches. “That’s what happens when you’ve got a car worth two hundred dollars and it’ll cost you a thousand to ship it out of here,” a Wrangellian told me. Mount Dewey, the four-hundred-foot-high hill where Muir lit his towering inferno, was just a few minutes’ walk from my hotel, via zigzagging residential streets and wooden stairs. Nailed to a tree at the top of the trail was a “no fires” pictogram, which I hoped was the work of a Muir fan with a sense of humor. Beyond the harbor, the view probably hadn’t changed much in centuries?green lumps of small islands clustered like a family of sea turtles.

He gave up so long ago that he doesn’t even remember now that he hasn’t even lost anything.—I heard the death of England he said quietly to himself, then aloud: ‘Think about what? That noise?

He had thought then that all his cause needed was a hearing; now he knew that the practical man's readiness to let the idealist talk corresponds with the busy parent's permission to destructive infancy to \"run out and play.\" They would let him state his case to the four corners of the earth—if only he did not expect them to act on it! It was their policy to let him exhaust himself in argument and exhortation, to listen to him so politely and patiently that if he failed to enforce his ideas it should not be for lack of opportunity to expound them.... And the alternative struck him as hardly less to be feared. Supposing that the incredible happened, that his reasons prevailed with his wife, and, through her, with the others—at what cost would the victory be won? Would Bessy ever forgive him for winning it? And what would his situation be, if it left him in control of Westmore but estranged from his wife?",

Reality was so far in excess of expectation that we were suddenly deprived of all desire to pick the flowers which dusted these quiet terraces to a starscape – thick as the Milky Way. One could not walk among them with­out doing them damage. Panos sighed deeply and puffed his cigarette, indulging the relish of his eyes as they travelled across the enchanted slopes whose familiarity had never once staled for him in fifteen years of repetition. ‘Embroidery,’ he said under his breath in Greek, and with his hand followed the soft contour of the hills, as one might run one’s hand affection­ately over the flanks of a favourite horse. ‘I knew that last thunderstorm would do the trick.’",

The previous club in the same building—Bottoms Up—was, Jesse tells us, “more geared toward males,” with “really provocative pictures on the wall” and a mirror over the row of urinals in the bathroom; Jesse has made it into a club where everyone—including Jackson’s burgeoning transgender community—feels welcome.

Trevor was a middle aged man with a penchant for tugging the unruly mops of fair-haired boys, made all the more intriguing to us by his numerous missing fingers. I recall the terror of becoming his victim, aged around seven, while sitting on a friend's garden wall, with his father working in the garden only feet away. Though I knew what was about to happen, I was frozen by either fear or fascination, and can still picture Trevor's face as he approached, tilting his head to one side like a puzzled dog, eyes flickering, excited at the sight of my ginger mane. Then with a lunge from a three fingered hand, he had me. Gripping my scalp tightly, he shook my head three times, whilst emitting a curious hum of pleasure. I shrank to the floor, next to my friend's wall, Trevor smiled at me, and ambled away. My friend's dad continued working on his herbaceous border, oblivious to the assault which had taken place just feet away.",

This deadly vapour seemed to rasp at one’s nose, throat and lungs but the habaneros consider such temporary (we hope) discomfort much preferable to haemorrhagic dengue fever – otherwise known as break-bone fever, so agonising are its symptoms.",

    "target_paragraph": "IN THE LATE SUMMER of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.\nThe plain was rich with crops; there were many orchards of fruit trees and beyond the plain the mountains were brown and bare. There was fighting in the mountains and at night we could see the flashes from the artillery. In the dark it was like summer lightning, but the nights were cool and there was not the feeling of a storm coming.\nSometimes in the dark we heard the troops marching under the window and guns going past pulled by motor-tractors. There was much traffic at night and many mules on the roads with boxes of ammunition on each side of their pack-saddles and gray motor trucks that carried men, and other trucks with loads covered with canvas that moved slower in the traffic. There were big guns too that passed in the day drawn by tractors, the long barrels of the guns covered with green branches and green leafy branches and vines laid over the tractors. To the north we could look across a valley and see a forest of chestnut trees and behind it another mountain on this side of the river. There was fighting for that mountain too, but it was not successful, and in the fall when the rains came the leaves all fell from the chestnut trees and the branches were bare and the trunks black with rain. The vineyards were thin and bare-branched too and all the country wet and brown and dead with the autumn. There were mists over the river and clouds on the mountain and the trucks splashed mud on the road and the troops were muddy and wet in their capes; their rifles were wet and under their capes the two leather cartridge-boxes on the front of the belts, gray leather boxes heavy with the packs of clips of thin, long 6.5 mm. cartridges, bulged forward under the capes so that the men, passing on the road, marched as though they were six months gone with child.\nThere were small gray motor cars that passed going very fast; usually there was an officer on the seat with the driver and more officers in the back seat. They splashed more mud than the camions even and if one of the officers in the back was very small and sitting between two generals, he himself so small that you could not see his face but only the top of his cap and his narrow back, and if the car went especially fast it was probably the King. He lived in Udine and came out in this way nearly every day to see how things were going, and things went very badly.\nAt the start of the winter came the permanent rain and with the rain came the cholera. But it was checked and in the end only seven thousand died of it in the army.",

Ah aint gonter have no—” and ceased, looking down at his plate, breathing the strong, deep pants, his chest arching and collapsing until he stopped it presently and held himself motionless for perhaps a half minute, and raised a spoonful of the cold and glutinous pease to his mouth. The congealed and lifeless mass seemed to bounce on contact with his lips. Not even warmed from mouth-heat, pease and spoon spattered and rang upon the plate; his chair crashed backward and he was standing, feeling the muscles of his jaw beginning to drag his mouth open, tugging upward the top half of his head. But he stopped that too before it became sound, holding himself again while he rapidly scraped the food from his plate onto the other and took it up and left the kitchen, crossed the other room and the gallery and set the plate on the bottom step and went on toward the gate.",

It was the fire bell of the City Hall, and it was beating an alarm—a hard, fast stroke that he had never heard before. Bronze with peril, clangorous through the snow-numbed silence of the air, it had a quality of instancy and menace he had never known before. He leaped up and ran to the window to look for the telltale glow against the sky. But it was no fire. Almost before he looked, those deadly strokes beat in upon his brain the message that this was no alarm for fire. It was a savage, brazen tongue calling the town to action, warning mankind against the menace of some peril—secret, dark, unknown, greater than fire or flood could ever be.",

It was an irritating document. It required me not only to explain in detail how I had been so reckless as to have lost the traveller’s cheques with which Visa had trustingly endowed me, and to give all manner of trifling detail including the number of the police report and the address of the police station at which the report was made, but also contained long sections of irrelevant questions concerning things like my height, weight and complexion. ‘What the fuck does my complexion have to do with traveller’s cheques?’ I said, a trifle wildly, causing a pleasant-looking matron sitting next to me to put some space between us. Finally it instructed me to give two financial references and one personal reference.",
