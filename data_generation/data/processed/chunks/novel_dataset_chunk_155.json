Some among them thought it was on account of her false hair, or the dread of getting the violets wet, while others attributed it to the natu ral aversion for water sometimes believed to accompany the artistic temperament. Ma de moi selle offered Edna some choco lates in a paper bag, which she took from her pocket, by way of showing that she bore no ill feeling. She habitually ate choco lates for their sustain-ing quality; they contained much nutriment in small compass, she said. They saved her from starvation, as Madame Lebrun’s table was utterly impossible; and no one save so impertinent a woman as Madame Lebrun could think of offering such food to people and requiring them to pay for it.",

They pointedly set up their administrative headquarters in the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank building (Isogai had the chairman’s flat on the ninth floor), and ship after ship of booty sailed home to Japan, taking most of Hong Kong’s cars with them – an American journalist,1 crossing the harbour that January, counted twenty-six ships with deck-loads of cars. But as it turned out Hong Kong brought few other benefits to the Co-Prosperity Zone. It was not much use to the Japanese militarily, either, and in the long run was probably far more a nuisance to them than an asset. On orders from Tokyo it was not incorporated into the administration of Japanese-occupied China, which held sway up the river in Guangzhou, and it was never offered to either of the two puppet Governments which now ruled so much of China under Japanese auspices. It remained a military governorate, ‘The Captured Territory of Hong Kong’.",

His coffin was banked with flowers, but in the centre there was a curious and arresting plainness, a simple wreath of laurel leaves. Attached to the wreath was a small card on which these words were written: ‘Hugh McGuire’.",

Whatever crops the English sowed would have failed, heightening pressure to extract food from Indians, whose own harvests had also suffered; Smith noted in 1608 that natives had little to trade, “their corne being that year bad.” The conflict between colonists and Indians was, at least in part, a desperate, Darwinian struggle.",

Taxi drivers, hotel managers, and fruit sellers were overcharging me at every possible opportunity. Being an experienced traveler, I was amazed at how I was being exploited like a novice every time I slightly dropped my guard. All the daily little robberies, exploitations, and occasional bullying by the Vietnamese are effective because the majority of tourists allow it. Visitors come to Vietnam to have a good time, and they don’t want to constantly argue about the price of everything. Most of the time, the points of contention and the amounts of money involved are insignificant—a visitor does not want to spoil his good mood over a dollar, so he easily gives in. However, big or small, these amounts and their related daily skirmishes have an additive effect that turns out to be quite annoying. After several cheating incidents, I was searching for an opportunity to get even. In reality, I could never truly get even, as I was losing on all fronts! But I could at least choose one instance in which I would put up fierce resistance and come out on top.",

The weekends he spent with his wife and family in the Rue de Miromesnil and the afternoons of Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, when I thought he was at work, he spent with this girl, who was called Louise Dupont, in the St James across the garden.

The main group was twenty meters from the mangled fence. Then, suddenly, we noticed movement thirty meters from the fence. The few reeds remaining in the area began bending and swaying as though a wind was pushing them in various directions. But there was no wind. We stared intently at the reeds and noticed that they were beginning to move in a coordinated manner. One set was going to the left; the other set was going to the right. It was similar to the way that a curtain opens on stage as a play begins. Then, suddenly, the star emerged: Our Elephant walked forth from the curtain of the reeds onto the open stage in front of our fence. I had an urge to applaud.",

The road leading out of Alice was narrow, twisted and perilous with huge lorries hurtling along it, and if there was one thing that camels hated it was anything bigger than them that moved. So I decided to cut through the back country and meet up with the road further along where it wasn’t so diabolically dangerous. Fine. Only to do that we had to penetrate dense scrub, scale rocky escarpments, stumble over huge boulders and sweat and struggle and panic. If Jenny and Toly remained infuriatingly calm and placid it was only because they didn’t fully understand how unlikely it was that we might make it. Nor how devoid of warning are most cataclysmic events. To my utter amazement, and to their gloating triumph, we made seventeen miles that day unscathed. This minor victory did nothing to alleviate my pessimism – we still had a long way to go.",

Only the 30 yuan that came from every member of a captive and otherwise unremunerative audience could explain the erection of a shiny new hotel in the midst of a windswept plateau three hours from the nearest town.",

A policeman, swinging past with rhythmical stride, cast his bull’s-eye from side to side. Odours of stew, odours of beef, odours of basting, odours of beef and cabbage rose from a thousand basements.

The air seemed to have different grades of warmth and chill in it; now sweet; now – they were passing a farmyard – strong-smelling, acrid from the sour smell of manure. She leant back, holding her hat to her head as they rushed a hill. ‘You won’t get her up this on top, Cole,’ she said. The pace slackened a little; they were climbing the familiar Crabbs hill, with the yellow streaks where carters had put on their brakes. In the old days, when she drove horses, they used to get out here and walk. Cole said nothing. He was going to show off his engine, she suspected. The car swept up finely. But the hill was long; there was a level stretch; then the road mounted again. The car faltered. Cole coaxed her on. Kitty saw him jerk his body slightly backwards and forwards as if he were encouraging horses. She felt the tension of his muscles. They slowed – they almost stopped. No, now they were on the crest of the hill. She had done it on top!",

Beyond the breakwater, the far side of the river was crowded with smoking chimneys, spinning wind turbines and tall cranes pecking at container ships like hungry birds. A gas flare glowed angrily in the gloom. Out at sea, perhaps a dozen top-heavy cargo ships queued to enter the port, hulking like tower blocks in a distant metropolis.

His wife had run this same house as a lodging house, her clientele being largely derived from actors, vaudeville performers, and somewhat down-at-the-heels theatrical people of all sorts. As time went on, the woman began to provide some of her guests with an occasional meal when they would ask for it, and Joe, whose skill as a chef was considerable, began himself, on his “off day,” to prepare a Sunday dinner, to which paying guests were invited. The idea, begun really as a kind of concession to the lodgers in the house, caught on: the meals were cheap, the food was excellent, people came and came again, returning often with their friends, until Joe’s Sunday dinners had achieved a kind of celebrity, and the man and his wife were sorely taxed to accommodate the numbers that now came.",

In some fields the same kind of horses, hippie-haired in the mane and equally shaggy on the sides and in their tails, grazed the snow-covered ground with their heads buried up to the ears.

These storehouses, which are to be found in all regions where crops are plentiful, are huge, windowless, stone buildings ventilated by holes in the walls. Here the grain can lie for decades without going bad, owing to the dryness of the air. But now they were quickly emptied, for provisions would have to be stored in the neighbourhood of the fighting line, if it came to war. Nevertheless the country was not threatened with a shortage of foodstuffs. If a wall were built round Tibet, no one would suffer from cold or starvation, as everything necessary for the needs of the three million inhabitants is found in the country in one form or another. The military kitchens supplied plentiful meals and the soldiers’ pay enabled them to buy cigarettes and chang. The troops were contented.",

As I approached the distant settlement on a ridge above a little town—the roads so jam-packed with scooters and bicycles and cows that often we could hardly move (the Dalai Lama has, for security reasons, to drive for ten hours along such roads every time he wishes to take a flight)— Dharamsala came into view, and then disappeared, like a promise of liberation, or some place that didn’t really exist. Most of the time—the car collapsing on a mountain road, a group of villagers assembling to push it hopefully forwards, night falling, and each turn seeming to take us farther from the string of lights far off—I felt sure we’d never get there.",

I ride along Loch á Chroisg taking a last look at the Achnasheen Terraces and am treated to a golden eagle sitting on a post at the side of the road. It’s a very long, gradual ascent and with the wind assist and sun, pleasant. The descent is exciting because I can fly down the road without fear of being killed. It’s Sunday. Most things in this part of the world shut up shop on Sunday. Including traffic. This as opposed to the Hebrides, especially Lewis, where everything shuts up shop, everyone is supposed to spend the day in church, and it probably is a sin to even drive your car. This is a good long ride, today, but I am laden with wonderful groceries. I stop for a breather in Kinlochewe where not a blessed thing is open, then head off to Gairloch.",

You know there’ve been times when you were bothered – damned bothered – and as a girl gets older, and things keep moving along, why, before she knows it, the things she wants are liable to move past her and not come back.

Fantastically convoluted masses of ice hung from roadside rocks and Rachel was so overcome by all this loveliness that she soon forgot her discomfort. The air was so cold when we left the Rest House that she could scarcely breathe.
