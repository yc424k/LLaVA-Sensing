    "target_paragraph": "George was the only young man who had ever kissed Her. George was the only person who had called her a “Greek goddess.” George, to be exact, had said ruminatively on more than one occasion, “You never manage to look decently like other people. You look like a Greek goddess or a coal scuttle.” George said she looked like a coal scuttle. He also said she looked like a Greek goddess. There was that about George, he wanted to incarnate Her, knew enough to know that this was not Her. There was just a chance that George might manage to draw her out half-drowned, a coal scuttle, or push Her back, drowned, a goddess. Regarding him, very hot on the woodpath, Hermione became almost collegiate of the period, almost a person with hair up and with long skirts. Her became almost Hermione as she looked at George with his collar torn open at the throat, turned-back Byronic collar, clean shirt, hot underarms in great symmetrical patches. There were clean wet patches under the arms of George, his coat was left somewhere. “Where did you leave your coat, George?” “I’ve forgotten, Bellissima. Now is this the forest of Arden?”",

    "target_paragraph": "Sarakatsáns have always filled me with awe. I first saw them years ago when I was walking across Bulgaria to Constantinople. A gathering of beehive huts was scattered over the wintry hills slanting to the Black Sea; brushwood folds ascended the green slopes and thousands of shaggy black goats and sheep grazed over the rainy landscape, their heavy bronze bells filling the air with a many-toned and harmonious jangle. Here and there like dark monoliths under the wheeling crows herdsmen leaned on their lance-long crooks, their faces almost lost in the deep hoods of high-shouldered goats’ hair capes reaching to the ground; capes of so coarse a weave and so stiff with rain that their incumbents could almost step forth and leave them standing like sentry-boxes. Riding across Greek Macedonia the next year, I saw them again and even stayed a night in one of their smoky wigwams. Later I met them often, all over northern Greece: in the plains in winter and in the mountains in summer; always on the skyline or in the middle distance. True nomads, these self-appointed Ishmaels hover on the outskirts of ordinary Greek life as fleetingly as a mirage; they manifest themselves to mortals in faraway glimpses. Suddenly, in the high midsummer Pindus and Rhodope and in the Roumeli sierras, a ravine’s twist lays bare their impermanent hamlets of cones. In winter, from the snows that have banished them, one can discern their clustering huts in the plains, the ascending smoke and the grazing flocks. In spring their beasts and their long caravans of horses, laden with all they possess, wind into the thawed mountains, halting at night in a brief village of sombre tents; autumn sends them streaming downhill to the withered plains which the rains will soon turn green. One discovers them binding lopped branches and osier twigs into the hemispherical huts which will house them for the season; shelters whose blackened and moulting thatch will later mark where they settled for a few months and then vanished. Sometimes a far-off barking and the murmur of bells hints at their presence deep in the ilex woods or along a dazzling canyon where nothing stirs but a pair of floating eagles. They are nearly always out of sight. Except for these rare apparitions, this fugitive community—about eighty thousand souls with flocks amounting to several million heads—has the gift of invisibility.",

The Buddha himself was a “wanderer,” we’re told, whose path took him into the “unsentimental embrace of all existence.” His first major awakening occurred when, slipping out of the golden palace where his father tried to keep him, he got his first glimpse of sickness, infirmity, and death.",

I had 27 gallons of water divided among five tanks, about three more gallons in small bottles, about three gallons of juice, and a 12-pack of coconut water. The fuel tank was topped off and I had another five gallons of diesel in a yellow jerrycan.\nWhen Sobrius was ready, I drove back to St Augustine. The morning of the 11th, I rented a car and drove back to St. Petersburg and returned the car to a small airport near the marina. At this point I was ready to go, but I relaxed for the rest of the day and planned to leave in the morning.",

A washing line ran from the final pillar on her colonnade to the handle of a massive Roman sarcophagus to one side; on it, children’s clothes were hanging out to dry in the afternoon sun. Nearby, hens were perching on another fallen pillar which had been hollowed out to make a drinking trough. But the villagers clearly disdained to live in the slightly less grand villas that lay on the lower ground, a little deeper into the groves; after all, these houses had only four or five main rooms, which did not leave enough space for the stabling of horses, asses, goats and sheep; nor, as I discovered when I made a closer inspection, did they have any baths with hypocaust systems, so useful for keeping bantams in.",

I sat down in the fresh air of the cockpit to pull myself together. I turned the instruments on. The wind was howling steady at around thirty knots coming straight through the entrance and carrying what seemed like half the Atlantic with it. I took another half a Scopace and went back to the job of building the Panzone. I finished the top crust, oiled the bottom pan and formed the dough to the top edge of the pan. I coated the dough with a wash of marinara sauce and layered all the ingredients one at a time.",

One might wander for half a day in the grounds without being challenged then; and the house itself with its warren of corridors seemed empty, tenantless, uninhabited even by servants. Today the scarlet-capped military police manned stout road-blocks. The barbed wire had been renewed; and in a pit outside the front door crouched a red beret with an automatic gun trained upon the house-gate.",

They originally lived in the north-eastern mountains beyond the margin of history in regions hard of access and impervious to change; it is hard to say whether the duration of their way of life must be reckoned in hundreds of years or in thousands.

Some ancient barns-cum-stables are as big as three-storey houses, with twelve-foot-high double doors and three different-sized wicket gates to fit horses, cattle and sheep. (Pigs always have separate accommodation.) The dwellings are more varied in design and the carved and painted homestead gates (many new) are spectacular examples of folk art triumphant. There are conspicuously more very old wooden houses, with splendidly carved pillars supporting narrow balconies under wide eaves. Some are in a state of disrepair rarely seen elsewhere in Transylvania, apart from those tragic, abandoned Saxon villages which have been taken over by Gypsies. Harghita’s delapidated dwellings also tend to be Gypsy-occupied; the Gypsies moved in when the owners fled to Hungary during the 1980s – illegally, which meant they couldn’t sell their homes. (Now, I was told, they cannot reclaim them; this, if true, is cruelly unjust.) Most houses are dated on the gable end facing the road and the numerous sturdy homes built during the 1930s and early 1940s are evidence that the Szekelys were not then being successfully discriminated against, pace present-day propaganda.",

As I began to venture out, I quickly learned many things about the local culture and customs. Prior to arriving in KSA, for example, all expatriates were required to pledge to be good guests and to honor the local customs—everything from not drinking alcohol to women keeping covered and fully clothed while in public. I distinctly remember walking to the gym wearing what I considered to be relatively tasteful exercise gear that I assumed would mollify the local Saudi population; but when a Saudi security guard followed me for five blocks in his car, I wasn’t sure whether to laugh or be dismayed. Perhaps it was because I was a new face in this small community, or did he feel that I needed protection?",

They all spoke English or German with varying degrees of fluency – including the Governor’s wife, who is a university graduate in economics – and conversation flowed easily. After about half an hour, by which time we had become the best of friends, first one and then another rose and disappeared for a few minutes, to return in Afghan dress and resettle themselves, comfortably cross-legged, on their chairs.

My head feels like it’s full of cotton wool soaked in oil, and I am as weak as Superman struggling with a necklace of Kryptonite. I drag myself around the house and flop onto the couch in a semicoma. Thoughts drift like light cloud—the moment I try to catch one it dissipates. I adopt the Indian blank-faced straight-ahead stare, as I can’t be bothered to shut my eyes or to focus them. At times it feels like my pupils have been sucked dry and collapsed into withered raisins. Arms too heavy to move, head too heavy to lift, I lie and watch the fan like a placid infant transfixed by a mobile. At times I’m so hot I cry, but the tears evaporate before they reach the corners of my eyes. My Sikh-inspired spiritual strength is melting away and my brain is too fried to meditate. I begin to worship the air-conditioner and pray for fewer power cuts. Outside the Biosphere, those not wealthy enough for coolers, fans or air-conditioning are asleep in hot heaps under snatches of shade. The city cooks us slowly.",

There was no beach at C Street, as we learned to call it, just rocks and a low, crumbling bluff, huge oil storage tanks, grimy fields, and, farther up the point, some abandoned fairgrounds. Even farther up the point, in a grove of trees, was a hobo jungle, which meant you had to keep an eye out for shabby characters coming down the shore from that direction, since our towels and lunches were stashed in the rocks while we surfed. The onshore sea breeze usually sprang up and ruined the waves by lunchtime. That made for long afternoons huddling around driftwood fires under the bluff, waiting for our ride. Once, when the wind was particularly biting and wet, we dragged old tires into a pile and lit those. The heat was magnificent, but the thick, stinking column of black smoke blowing into town brought a police car, and we ran with our boards—not easy—and hid in the fairgrounds. At the end of those days, finally back at the duplex, Rich and I, still in our wetsuits, would share a hot outdoor shower, thirty seconds a turn, the one in the cold counting off the time aloud, then knocking the other guy out of the stream, until the hot ran out.",

He could still leap, and lift and catch his partners, and perform as well as he ever had, he said. But younger faces, younger bodies, were preferred. He had a big role in a 2010 Twyla Tharp show built on Frank Sinatra songs. The best number in the production, I thought, was his solo dance set to “September of My Years.” It was restrained, almost meditative, elegant, and nobody could miss the symbolism. “I wanted to make the solo very John,” Tharp told the Times. After 188 performances on Broadway, Selya took the show on the road as resident director, while still dancing in it. He was choreographing, teaching, writing a screenplay. And yet things were winding down for him as a dancer. I overheard someone at a party ask him about his upcoming projects. Selya mentioned an asteroid that was in the news; it was alarming people by coming too close to Earth. He was hoping for a direct hit, he said. That was his best-case career scenario.",
