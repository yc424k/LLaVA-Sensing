His heart was breaking for her. His father’s death had been a lingering one. Her mom’s death was so sudden. He didn’t know which was worse, but he certainly knew what she was going through and what she would be going through in the days and weeks ahead. Just the thought of her alone on the flight back to the UK alone was almost too much for him to bear. He remembered his flight back to the States after dropping his mom off in Oz just after his father died. It made his blood run cold.",

Farther south in Peru and Bolivia, the plateaus and valleys above eleven thousand feet are arid, barren, windswept, and cold—a highland desert, or puna, useful only for the grazing of alpacas and vicuñas. Nearer the equator, the same elevation is equally forbidding, only it is constantly wet. The result is an otherworldly landscape that seems on first impression eerily like an English moor grafted onto the spine of the Andes. In the mist and blowing rain, there are only the espeletias, tall and whimsical relatives of the daisy, spreading in waves to remind you that you are still in South America. With bright yellow flowers that burst from a rosette crown of long, furry, silver leaves, espeletias look like plants that belong in a children’s book. The common name in Spanish is frailejón, the friar, because seen from a distance the plants can be mistaken for the silhouette of a man, a wandering monk lost in the swirling clouds and fog.",

Two hundred drab, dusty soldiers lay in it now, facing townward—the Constitutionalist infantry. They were sprawled on the ground, in all attitudes of weariness; some sleeping on their backs, facing up to the hot sun; others wearily transferring the dirt with their scooped hands from rear to front. Before them they had piled up irregular heaps of rocks. Now infantry, in the Constitutionalist army, is simply cavalry without horses; all Villa’s soldiers are mounted except the artillery, and those for whom horses cannot be procured.",

The following year another 30-plus people were killed in two accidents, both involving runaway trains, in the space of four days. The biggest disaster of all was in 1993 when a train bound for Mombasa from Nairobi plunged off a bridge and into the “crocodile-infested” Ngai Ndeithya River, killing 140 people. Ngai Ndeithya means “God help us” in Kiswahili, which would seem to be a not inappropriate motto for the railway itself. Almost since the beginning, however, the train has been known as the Lunatic Express. Can’t think why.",

I could sit for hours. Thanks, Dad! It was as though I was watching a movie. Better. The old truck with the horses tied up in the back. Why didn’t they fall out? Cows wandering into the parking lot. Impatient drivers sometimes honking their horns at cows, people, and cars. If the weather was good in late spring, the fountain across the street was spewing water in the air, and little kids enjoyed the water breeze. Parents took pictures with cellphones. Barbecues were smoking. People were walking. Sometimes I saw students I knew either from my class or from school, and they were always so cute when they saw me, coming up and saying, “Hi, Ms. Diane.” Looking surprised that I was anywhere but school. I miss that.",

She returned wearily to the thought of Percy Gryce, as a wayfarer picks up a heavy load and toils on after a brief rest. She was almost sure she had ‘landed’ him: a few days’ work and she would win her reward. But the reward itself seemed unpalatable just then: she could get no zest from the thought of victory. It would be a rest from worry, no more – and how little that would have seemed to her a few years earlier! Her ambitions had shrunk gradually in the desiccating air of failure. But why had she failed? Was it her own fault or that of destiny?",

One of the stars was a garuda-eagle, which was said to have flown into an open window voluntarily, and another was a small tiger, actually a Bengal cat. (Neither of these species is, by the way, native to the island.) The count eventually reached about 60 varieties of animals.",

Unfortunately, Siki forgot his commitment and instead knocked out the dumbfounded Frenchman in the sixth round. For Siki it was the high point of a mostly disappointing life. He never won another important match, and in 1925 was shot dead for no apparent reason on a Manhattan street. The murderer was never caught.",

    "target_paragraph": "Until fairly recently accounting for the presence of human beings in Australia was not such a problem. At the beginning of the century it was thought that Aborigines had been on the continent for no more than 400 years. As recently as the 1960s, the time frame was estimated to be perhaps 8,000 years. Then in 1969 a geologist named Jim Bowler from the Australian National University in Canberra was poking around on the shores of a long-dried lake bed called Mungo in a parched and lonely corner of western New South Wales when something caught his eye. It was the skeleton of a woman, obtruding slightly from a sandbank. The bones were collected and sent off for carbon dating. When the report came back, it showed that the woman had died 23,000 years ago, at a stroke almost tripling the known period of occupation in Australia. Since then, other finds have pushed the date back further. Today the evidence points to an arrival date of at least 45,000 years ago, but probably more like 60,000.",

He ran it because he was now going to keep the radar running and it sucked amps that would be replaced by the new, powerful 120-amp alternator. At a 40 mile sweep, there were dozens of contacts both coming and going from the canal. There were discernible inbound and outbound lanes. He switched to 20 miles and concentrated on the ones nearest. Many of them were doing 20+ knots versus his 5 so being overtaken was going to happen quite a lot.",

The Kliegs were off, the standards shoved away into a corner and only a single dome light burned, and there was another nurse—he had not remembered four of them—drying her hands at a sink. But she dropped the towel into a bin at that moment and passed him, that is, walked into then out of his vision, and was gone. There was a blower, a ventilator, going somewhere near the ceiling too, invisible or at least concealed, camouflaged, then he reached the table, the nurse’s hand came and folded back the sheet and after a moment he looked back past her, blinking his dry painful eyelids, to where the officer stood in the door. “It’s all right now,” he said. “He can smoke now, cant he?”",

Like all the others, this room too had been used apparently as a kind of factory: there was again a great tangle of electric wiring on the ceiling, and the fixtures for a great many electric lights. An old, roughly-made, dilapidated-looking table had been left in the room in a good deal of rubbish which she had already swept up into a pile. In the middle of the room there was a skylight opening from the roof, and the ceilings sloped at either end, so that although there was great space and ample standing room in the central portion, one had to stoop a little as he approached the ends. The old whitewashed walls were dirty and in places pieces of plaster had been knocked out, leaving visible strips of dry brown plastering and dry lathing—the body and bones of the old house. The walls also bulged outward in places, and the bare wooden floor sagged and creaked as one walked across it. The whole place had the sag and lean of a old house, the worn modeling of time from which all sharp new edges and all solid holds have been worn away.",

Argemiro cleared away the vegetation, made him a bed in the sand, and slipped away to the forest; he returned some hours later with a root, which he crushed and mixed with water. The concoction was impossibly bitter, but William’s fever broke within minutes. William would later identify the tree as Acacia farnesiana, a denizen of dry tropical forests whose leaves and roots are used throughout Colombia as a treatment for malaria.",

By this time Number 3 had delivered 142 of his papers: he had only to ascend the rickety wooden stairs of the Eagle Crescent bank to finish the eight houses of the Crescent. He looked anxiously across the hill-and-dale-sprawled negro settlement to the eastern rim: behind Birdseye Gap the sky was pearl-grey – the stars looked drowned. Not much time left, he thought. He had a blond meaty face, pale-coloured and covered thickly with young blond hair. His jaw was long and fleshy: it sloped backward. He ran his tongue along his full cracked underlip.",

A menacing canopy formed and I felt a drop on my neck; Malek quivered and his ears twitched inquisitively and the dark stars that sprang up all round in the dust soon spread and cohered in a wet pockmarked stippling as the rain swept down. It didn’t last long. The sun broke through and a rainbow hooped the middle distance. The clouds scattered again, Malek’s glistening coat and my shirt were soon dry, and a cool, damp breath of wind and fresh rainy hues transformed the fields and the trees. I wish I had seen the fatamorgana which haunts the Great Plain in the summer months; but beyond the thin wet-looking lines that bright sunlight sometimes lays across distant surfaces, there was no sign of it. I had read and heard of the Alföld dust-devils. Maelstroms of dust and straw and dead leaves twirl in the wind and climb to enormous heights and then revolve across the plain at great speed, seeming to mop and mow like rushing phantoms as they go; but autumn is the time for them and I only saw these portents much later, on the Baragan, that desolate expanse of steppe across the river from the Dobrudja in the Danube’s penultimate loop.",

At the time, there were fifteen families of habituated gorillas in Uganda which it was possible to track, with a total population of around four hundred animals. The gorilla groups are assimilated to tolerate humans, via a process which takes at least two years, and once habituated, the gorillas become used to the daily presence of tourists and generally display an aloof disinterest in their visitors. However, to protect these most endangered of mammals, stipulations around the issue of permits are strict. Each gorilla family can accept a single tracking group per day, for a maximum of an hour, with each group consisting of four paying guests plus researchers and local trackers. Any illness has to be declared, with even a runny nose likely to mean you are excluded from the trek, with no refund issued. Getting a permit felt akin to securing an audience with the Pope!",
