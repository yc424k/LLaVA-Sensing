Vendors spread tarpaulin sheets across their stalls, and passengers huddled beneath the leaking roof of the station platform. The electricity was not working, and the only light came from the dozens of candles which vendors had lit above their stalls. Crowds of people were moving in all directions, and the muggy air was thick with the smell of betel and engine oil. Candle wax dripped like cake icing on to a small mound of papayas. A basket full of plucked chicken carcasses glistened ghostly pink. A group of laughing monks, swathed in blood-red robes, loomed out of the darkness, their shaved heads luminous in the candlelight. I wandered blindly around the station, trying to find the exit. Suddenly, above the babble of the crowd, I heard a crisp English accent close to my ear: ‘Hello, dear.’ I turned round to find Beatrice standing calmly amid the mayhem. She wore a pearly-blue top and a matching tamein tucked tight around her bulging hips. Her silvery hair was tied on top of her head in a perfectly round bun. She smiled at me warmly and, in the gloomy light, I could just make out the pale blue of her eyes.",

The liveliest thing in town, in fact, seemed to be the posters of Phoebe Cates—Phoebe Cates pouting, Phoebe Cates smoldering, Phoebe Cates smiling. A local video store was advertising Paradise, starring Phoebe Cates. (If only, I thought, Phoebe Cates worked for Thai Air, how simple Bhutanese decoration would be!) And then, a little farther on, up a small rise, I saw an octagonal white cottage with a spotted red toadstool outside and cacti around its walls. Inside was a chuckling mechanical monkey that announced the time, a set of dollhouse chairs, a sign that said MODUS: CASH-DOWN, and a pink button with which one could summon the proprietor, a white-haired Swiss man who looked as if he were on his way to see the Brothers Grimm. Here at last was the most famous establishment in the “Land of Hidden Treasures”: its only Swiss bakery!",

Once, having picked up warning of an imminent blast on his scanner radio, he stopped at the side of the road and turned to face the volcano. It was raining. Visibility was poor. A rainbow arced cleanly from the clouds. Then came the explosion: so powerful that a plume of ash and steam shot upward in a column twenty-five thousand feet high, sucking with it both the rain clouds and the rainbow and leaving him standing, suddenly, in a bright, clear summer’s day. Mind blowing, he said later. After eruptions like that, ash would snow down again, tons of it, six inches at a time: a soft, dry snow that wouldn’t melt. Once, it blew so high into the atmosphere and the ash was carried so far out to sea, that they were spared even a mote of dust, as if the explosion had never happened.",

The swollen tides of public opinion in Greece and Cyprus were pressing upon the walls of the slender dam – the Archbishop’s personal prestige, which alone kept events cap­tive. He too had his difficulties; not merely from Balkan fanatics pressing for trouble, but also from a fair-sized Communist party. ‘He who rides a tiger fears to get down,’ says the Chinese proverb. There was almost a note of anguish in the Ethnarchy appeals for some issue to the problem.",

After the final march of death smearing midge bodies onto my clothes, I crawl into my sleeping bag and pull it over my head. This has absolutely no sound dampening effect. I pull out half my clothes and wrap them around my head. Then I worry about suffocating and nobody ever finding me. I think this in a moment of panicked insanity so my adrenaline starts to run wild. I am never going to get any sleep. And, no I am not because the jet engine noise gets louder as the water from the rain swells the stream. The jet engine sound gets louder, and louder. The ground shakes. I am thinking I should eat the bug dope and end it all. I decide to sing songs to myself just to keep from going crazy and in about eight hours, fall asleep.",

We pick out a table that overlooks the marina, and, to celebrate, we order gazpacho soup, fish tacos, and two frozen margaritas served in salted glasses that could comfortably accommodate goldfish. The sun combines with the tequila, filling me up with warm joy. I slip off into a high, drunk on my surroundings—the jabbering Spanish, the smell of spices, the garish colors. The sun embraces my body and begins to melt my apprehension. Accumulated anxiety puddles at my feet, leaving behind a thawed version of myself: a happy, hopeful optimist.",

Before the ceremony, my friend Rochelle knelt at my feet painting my toenails. A hasty ritual; as always, we were running late. The day before, I hiked out of an eight-day hitch in filthy clothes to a yard full of wedding guests in tents. Half an hour before, I was cruising the gravel road in my pickup, tending to the last details of a rural wedding—generator, weed whacker, extra fuel. I thought I was to be the only bride this century who didn’t bathe before her vows. But I squeezed in a quick shower in the one cabin with plumbing, the water pressure too weak to blast the larch sap from my forearms. I sat in my chair before Rochelle, trying not to fidget. The guests waited in a half circle down by the river in the cottonwood grove. My sister braided my damp hair with wildflowers from the meadow in front of the cabin—a daisy, a sprig of valerian. I twisted in my seat and Rochelle slapped my knee.",

    "target_paragraph": "A homestead on the highway system would be worth a great deal more than that. I had visited one, some miles south of Talkeetna, where a young couple, Don and Patty Bender, had moved onto the land in 1974 and had lived in a camper while they mixed concrete, poured a foundation, and, together, built a house. It was a small, handsome place, with a steel-drum wood stove and big windows of insulated glass. Mount McKinley was framed in one window. Sometimes bears were too. Don Bender had a .300 Magnum but had not yet used it on a bear. He used it for his annual moose, and through the winter he and his wife ate mooseburgers, moose sausage, moose steak. They had eggs, too, and bacon coming. Near the house was an A-frame combination coop and sty. A pig lived in one end, chickens in the other. On cold nights, the chickens found a way to get near the pig. The Benders were in favor of the capital move. “Juneau is too inaccessible,” he said. “Therefore, many of our politicians have hidden from their constituents.” They did not want to lose their homestead, though, no matter how much its value might appreciate. They said they hoped the new capital would “not destroy our personal place of life.” Their property, theirs for living on it, would probably be worth half a million dollars by the time it was proved up. If the capital came near, that sum could multiply, and the Benders would feel some pressure to change their minds.",

Sleepy talk floated on puffs of breath and a mist curled itself around the carriages. Three tank-like jeeps were parked nearby and the Bagshot Trio squeezed into the front row of the first. Everyone else scrambled towards the other two. Sweeping the pools of dew from the seats with his hand, Raju the driver jumped down and passed a mountain of rough blankets over the sides. He wrenched the gear stick, scraping metal on metal, and the jeep roared off to Ranthambore National Park. A steady blast of wind tugged the skin from our bones and dragged tears down the sides of our cheeks. At the gates to the park the jeep had a seizure, the engine cut out and Raju jumped out and disappeared for ‘something’. While we waited, a stack of bodywarmers rose up at the side of the jeep and a row of baseball caps bobbed past. Men in shawls stood around, hands behind backs, eyes shining in the light of their beedis. Each wore a pair of camouflage-coloured earmuffs that clipped around the backs of their heads.",

Clenching Syd, I felt like a blind tightrope walker balancing in a windstorm—only instead of wind, it was a driving wet icy current threatening to bring me down at any misstep. My legs became numb, but I was too preoccupied with balancing and pushing back images of death to notice. Step by icy step we edged deeper into the current, elbows locked. As we advanced, I could feel Syd struggling with his own footing and weak knees. We entered the center, the water pounding against my thighs and splashing up over my chest soaking my shirt. It was like a dance, leaning into the shifting flow, being pushed back, feet sliding over the rocks, sidestepping, and trying to keep my balance. All the while Syd led me slowly toward the far shore. My heart was pounding. Visions of waves and sand and ocean and Pop threatened to overtake me. I wanted to close my eyes. Holding my breath, I tightened my grip on Syd. Gradually the current eased, progress became swifter, and we reached a spot where we unlocked elbows. Springing from the water, I leapt to the solid ground of the far bank. We’d made it! Shivering and panting and just trying to stop my legs from shaking, I turned away from the water. Nausea swept over me. Dashing for the bushes, I heaved up my breakfast in wave upon wave. Eventually my breathing slowed, but my heart was still pounding.",

Because that’s what I was saying. You a writer who knows about these things—emotions—or a dumbo, or what? I’m happy because I have a woman at home that I love and trust. I have three children, two of hers, a gift to me, as it were, and one of ours—and I love her, and I like to think that she loves me, but Redmond, Mister Writer-Man, I’ll tell you for nothing: you take that love for granted, and you, as a whole man, you’re finished! And that’s a fact! Because you’ll get divorced—and after that, Worzel, all your memories, the places in your mind where you used to go, when the weather comes, you understand me, the places that you used to visit to get away and get happy, those safe places—and they never fail you, because they’re only there in your own mind—well, you get divorced, and I’ve talked to lots of my mates, friends, colleagues, whatever you’d say, you know, trawlermen who had to get divorced, because she’d deceived them when they were at the fishing, and that’s right, you think you’re OK, you’ll tough it out, and like as not you have this new young woman, so sexy—but guess what? Next time, next year, January, like this, when the weather comes—you find yourself trying to get back to those places, those memories that made you happy, but you can’t! You can’t get there! No! That’s what they say! And myself—I can imagine it—the worst thing in a man’s life, really: because what could be worse than that? You drown? Simple. You get cancer? Sure. But this—at least half of it: you must have done it to yourself! And aye, you’re away at the fishing, and you’re on your own out here really, and no one cares back home, apart from your new young wife (and who knows what she’s up to?)—aye, so you go where you always used to go to get your comfort and be a man, to your happiest memories, and—guess what? You can’t get there! Not at all! There’s a black knot that you can’t untie, no one could. Because, how can I put it to you, Worzel, an old man who knows sod all? I know! Aye! Of course! Aye—it’s like the trawl-doors, the otter-boards (what did Robbie say you called them? Search me. I’ve forgotten—and anyway, it wasn’t funny, not like the car tyres, the rock-hoppers …); it’s like they’re crossed, they’re locked, they’ve been flipped right across and over each other by the cold deep-sea, the currents up here that flow so fast and cold beneath the warm surface North Atlantic drift that keeps us all alive! So—your old love, it’s gone cold, and your memories have frozen under pressure, with it, and you, you’ll never get them back: they’re miles down, and cold and gone, but you, Worzel, of course, you’re doing your best, but from that moment, really, you know yourself, you’re half-a-man, you’re waiting, that’s all, you’re waiting for death.”",

Finally the key turned, and Lansing, broken-nailed and perspiring, extracted the cigars and stalked with them into the deserted drawing room. The great bunches of golden roses that he and Susy had gathered the day before were dropping their petals on the marble embroidery of the floor, pale camellias floated in the alabaster tazzas between the windows, haunting scents of the garden blew in on him with the breeze from the lake. Never had Streffy's little house seemed so like a nest of pleasures. Lansing laid the cigar boxes on a console and ran upstairs to collect his last possessions. When he came down again, his wife, her eyes brilliant with achievement, was seated in their borrowed chariot, the luggage cleverly stowed away, and Giulietta and the gardener kissing her hand and weeping out inconsolable farewells.",

I followed it as it built in volume, and soon discovered a series of small deep pools. I stripped and bathed, hoo-ing and hah-ing at the water’s coldness, then lay on a flat riverside rock and let the heat run into me from the sun and the stone.",

A table was rooted in the middle, and seats were stuck to the sides. Happily the tropical suns had bleached the tapestries to a faded blue-green colour, and the mirror with its frame of shells, the work of the steward’s love, when the time hung heavy in the southern seas, was quaint rather than ugly. Twisted shells with red lips like unicorn’s horns ornamented the mantelpiece, which was draped by a pall of purple plush from which depended a certain number of balls. Two windows opened on to the deck, and the light beating through them when the ship was roasted on the Amazons had turned the prints on the opposite wall to a faint yellow colour, so that ‘The Coliseum’ was scarcely to be distinguished from Queen Alexandra playing with her Spaniels. A pair of wicker armchairs by the fireside invited one to warm one’s hands at a grate full of gilt shavings; a great lamp swung above the table—the kind of lamp which makes the light of civilization across dark fields to one walking in the country.",

And then how well I get to know and love those gardens whose gradual development has been described by their owners, and how happily I wander in fancy down the paths of certain specially charming ones in Lancashire, Berkshire, Surrey, and Kent, and admire the beautiful arrangement of bed and border, and the charming bits in unexpected corners, and all the evidences of untiring love! Any book I see advertised that treats of gardens I immediately buy, and thus possess quite a collection of fascinating and instructive garden literature. A few are feeble, and get shunted off into the drawing-room; but the others stay with me winter and summer, and soon lose the gloss of their new coats, and put on the comfortable look of old friends in every-day clothes, under the frequent touch of affection. They are such special friends that I can hardly pass them without a nod and a smile at the well-known covers, each of which has some pleasant association of time and place to make it still more dear.",

And a moment later she stood there before him, incredibly slim and young-looking in her dark dress and close little hat. Slightly paler, perhaps, and thinner—but as she moved forward with her easy step the impression vanished. He felt only her mastery of life and of herself, and thought how much less she needed him than did the dishevelled child he had just left.

Diva, with her nails glistening in the sun, had to forego such a precaution. Diva waited while I operated the hand crank, lowering the small wheel to the pavement. With the front of the dolly supported by the wheel we rolled the dolly onto the hitch of our truck. Then I turned the hand crank in the opposite direction to lift the small support wheel off the pavement. It was still an effort to move the heavy piece of equipment, but there was no heaving the point of the dolly from a position on the ground to waist level, nor a struggle to prevent the point from rising or falling. What a fine suggestion this is, I thought. No more of the other dollies for me. If a crank wheel dolly was available, I’d use it instead.",

But as it was in one of these cheap red villas that Miss Craddock lived, Kitty saw them haloed with romance.

Lucy went up those steps and down them every day; that was her window; this was her bell. The bell came out with a jerk when she pulled it; but it did not go back again, for everything was ramshackle in Lucy’s house; but everything was romantic. There was Lucy’s umbrella in the stand; and it too was not like other umbrellas; it had a parrot’s head for a handle. But as she went up the steep shiny stairs excitement became mixed with fear: once more she had scamped her work; she had not ‘given her mind to it’ again this week.",

Where our serveece turned north, I winced to see their most obvious venture. The 181-room, five-star, three-swimming-pool Intercontinental Hotel opened in 1998 and overlooks the Aqabat Jaber refugee camp which has no reliable water supply. Often this development is used to illustrate what the Oslo Accords have done for the Palestinian masses. In Raja Shehada’s A Rift in Time we read that the Intercontinental’s Austrian-run Oasis casino admitted a profit of $54 million at the end of its first year in operation. Between September 1998 and its closing exactly two years later at the beginning of the second Intifada, it registered a daily average of 2,809 players of whom 99% were Israeli. Hitherto, Israel’s gamblers had had to fly to Istanbul – as many habitually did. When one of Raja’s clients had made a serious bid for the Intercontinental site this entrepreneur was imprisoned in Jericho until he changed his mind:",

The wind was out of the east, and the swell was just a couple of feet. He sat on the beach and stared out over the ocean. She was different now, not only the provider of waves to surf. No, now she was the medium to convey him to new worlds. He looked out to the horizon and knew that he would soon be out there. Out in what?

You are the cold ice, the radiant stream head, the very waters of Castilla.” “Yes, Fayne.” “He is beneath you, below you. He has part and parcel of some other fortune. He is not for you.” “Yes, yes Fayne.” Eyes glared across space, across chasms, across valleys and hills. Eyes stared at Her Gart and eyes caught eyes that lifted mist-blue above frozen waters. Waters were frozen in Her Gart. She was bored with what Fayne was saying. I want to take her hand, press it against my eyes. She will say the moment I let go, get away from this thing, “You are just like people. You are like everybody. You can’t follow me.”",

On the coast between Haifa and Acre we passed a line of luxury concrete hotels hung with fairy lights and giving onto private beaches occupied by fun fairs and nightclubs. The Israeli woman next to me pointed it out proudly. ‘Look,’ she said. ‘We have everything!’ Not wishing to give offence I nodded. But I thought: No. You’ve taken the oldest country in the world, one of the great centres of civilization, a kind of paradise – and you’ve turned it into suburbia.",
