With buildings painted pink for girls and blue for boys, it’s ringed with signs forbidding handbags, pagers, water bottles and mobile phones. Devotees are allowed to carry only fans, cushions and specially approved Sai Baba chairs. Most pilgrims wear Indian dress teamed with a Western scarf tied around their necks in a Boy Scout knot (swami likes group consciousness, so different colored scarves signify groups by nationality or spiritual association). I feel naked without a neckerchief and begin to have flashbacks to the childhood nightmare of not wearing knickers to school. What’s more, Jonathan is not up on ashram etiquette and walks in the girls’ gate. He is pulled up and lectured; he laughs. I feel upset, awkward and suddenly rather nauseous.",

The shapes and their leader passed on into the village, Troy entering the farm house. Not a single one of them had turned his face to the ricks, or apparently bestowed one thought upon their condition. Soon Oak too went homeward, by a different route from theirs. In front of him, against the wet glazed surface of the lane he saw a gentleman walking yet more slowly than himself under an umbrella. The man turned and apparently started: he was Boldwood.",

Because everyone walks at different rates and rests at different times, three or four times a day you bump into some or all of your fellow hikers, especially on mountaintops with panoramic views or beside streams with good water, and above all at the wooden shelters that stand at distant intervals, ostensibly but not always actually, a day’s hike apart in clearings just off the trail. In consequence you get to know your fellow hikers at least a little, quite well if you meet them nightly at the shelters. You become part of an informal clump, a loose and sympathetic affiliation of people from different age groups and walks of life but all experiencing the same weather, same discomforts, same landscapes, same eccentric impulse to hike to Maine.",

He poured it down the surgeon’s throat with such effect that he quickly revived. Melbury got him on his legs; but the question was what to do with him. He could not walk more than a few steps, and the other horse had gone away. With great exertion Melbury contrived to get him astride Darling, mounting himself behind and holding Fitzpiers round his waist with one arm.

I was able to see with my own eyes the reality of Japan’s traditional ways of life. When a family decided to leave their house for the big city, they would take practically nothing away with them. What good were straw raincoats, bamboo baskets and utensils for handling firewood going to be in Osaka? Everything that had been a feature of life in Iya for a thousand years had become irrelevant overnight. On entering one of these houses, it looked as though the residents had simply disappeared. The detritus of their daily life lay undisturbed, like a snapshot frozen in time. Everything was in place: the open newspaper, remains of fried eggs in the pan, discarded clothing and bedding, even the toothbrushes in the sink. The influences of modernization were already visible here and there – ceilings had been tacked up against the rafters to protect against the winter cold, and aluminum door and window frames had been installed – but one could still see much of the original condition of the houses. However, only a few years later, artificial materials were everywhere, covering not only ceilings, but floors, walls and pillars. The interiors disappeared under a layer of plastic and plywood.",

I’ll see what happens when spring comes around, because that’s when I tend to get really itchy feet.”",

In the daytime, I’m thrilled because of my childhood in the South, where they really know how to put on the sound and light. San Francisco rarely has thunderstorms and I miss them. “This heat has to break,” my mother would say, and it would, with immense cracks and bolts followed by sheet lightning when the whole sky flashes on a million kilowatts. Often the storms seem to arrive at night. I’m sitting up in bed, drawing kitchen and bathroom plans on graph paper; Ed is reading something I never expected to see him reading. Instead of the Roman poets, tonight it’s Plastering Skills. Beside him is The Home Water Supply. Rain starts to clatter in the palm trees. I go to the window and lean out, then quickly step back. Bolts spear into the ground—jagged like cartoon drawings of lightning—four, five, six at once, surrounding the house. Thunderheads swarm over the hills and the quiet rolling suddenly changes its tune and starts to explode so close it feels like my own backbone snapping. The house shakes; this is serious. The lights go out. We fasten the windows inside and still the wind whips rain through cracks we didn’t know were there. Spooky wind sucks in and out of the chimney. Wild night. Rain lashes the house and the two silly palms give and give in the wind. I smell ozone. I am certain the house has been struck. This storm has selected our house. It won’t move on; we’re the center and may be washed downhill to Lake Trasimeno. “Which would you prefer,” I ask, “landslide or direct hit by lightning?” We get under the covers like ten-year-olds, shouting “Stop!” and “No!” each time the sky lights up. Thunder enters the walls and rearranges the stones.",

Amherst's only clear feeling was that he must not speak again till he had beaten down the horrible sensation in his breast—the rage of hate which had him in its grip, and which made him almost afraid, while it lasted, to let his eyes rest on the fair weak creature before him. Bessy, too, was in the clutch of a mute anger which slowly poured its benumbing current around her heart. Strong waves of passion did not quicken her vitality: she grew inert and cold under their shock. Only one little pulse of self-pity continued to beat in her, trembling out at last on the cry: \"Ah, I know it's not because you care so much for Westmore—it's only because you want to get away from me!\"",

He began his artistic life as a poet, a student of mythology, a novelist. But over time he realized that he had less interest in words than in imagery, and so turned to photography, hoping to write with light. Like so many born to privilege, he initially found ways to insulate himself from the violence, keeping an apartment in New York, escaping to Europe, hiding away at home in La Candelaria. In the early years, he confessed, the violence was almost an abstraction, a few notes in the papers, television reports from the distant reaches of the country—Putumayo, Chocó, Caquetá. But by 1995, at least for him, everything had changed. The conflict had become an existential threat. Violence had indelibly stained the nation. The agonies of ordinary Colombians, as Juan Manuel saw it, demanded the attention of the artist. Armed only with his camera, he set out to create a portrait of a country and a people who were becoming, with each passing day, more and more accustomed to brutality.",

I had thought I might stroll out towards the famous Liseberg Gardens, but I got no more than a couple of hundred yards before I was turned back by the pitiless downpour. I trudged back to the city centre and tried to have a look around the main shopping district, sprinting squelchily from doorway to doorway and from one dripping awning to another, but it was hopeless. I wanted a restaurant, one simple, wholesome restaurant, but there seemed to be none. I was soaked and shivering, and was about to return in a desultory spirit to my hotel to take whatever food was offered there at whatever price, when I noticed an indoor shopping centre and darted in, shaking myself out like a dog. The shops were mostly dreary Woolworth’s-type places and they were all shut, but there was a surprising number of people wandering around, as if this were some kind of marvellous place to take an evening stroll. There were a lot of young drunks staggering about too, most of them at that noisy and unattractive stage where they might want to be your pal or pick a fight or just throw up on you, so I gave them a wide berth.",

We toured the grounds and roamed the halls where Howard Carter announced his discovery of Tutankhamen’s tomb (1922), and where Agathie Christie resided while she composed Death on the Nile (1937), then made our way to the Thomas Cook bureau on the ground floor. The office was dark but cool and comfortable. The agent was friendly, but unable to help. “To Dakhla is closed for the summer,” he said. “No trains, no buses, only private car or minibus. Normally, we can find a driver for six hundred pounds, one-way. Hotel is difficult for the summer. I can show you a list, but will make no promises. Ramadan comes soon, and it will be more difficult for you. Abu Simbel is not from here. You must go first to Aswan and from there take car or bus.” The agent offered a few pamphlets with pictures of hot air balloons and ancient temples and wished us luck on the rest of our trip.",

But suddenly he sprang up, slid down the hillock, and running along the beach came back with a big empty shell. “Here--our goddess sends you this! She sailed ashore in a shell, you know.” He flourished it before her, and then bade her hold it in both hands, while she laughed and laughed at his vain struggles with the corkscrew and the champagne bottle. Finally he gave up and knocked off the neck of the bottle, and the golden foam came spiring and splashing into the shell and over their hands. “Oh, Vance . . . oh, Vance . . .” She tilted her head back and put her lips to the fluted rim, and he thought he had never seen anything lovelier than the pulse beat in her throat when the wine ran down. “Ever taste anything like that?” he asked, licking his fingers; and she giggled: “No, nothing, only ginger ale,” and sat and watched while he refilled their chalice and drank from it, carefully putting his lips where hers had been. “It’s like a gale of wind and with the sun in it--that’s what it’s like,” he declared. He did not confess to her that it was also his first taste of champagne; unconsciously he had already decided that part of his duty as a husband was to be older and stronger than she was, and to know more than she did about everything. “Here’s our house,” Vance said, swinging her hand to cheer her up. He knew by her dragging step that the walk had seemed long to her. To him it had appeared, all the way from the beach to the cluster of deserted buildings they were approaching, as if the racing waves had carried him. But he forced himself to walk slowly, taking his first lesson in the duty of keeping step.",

The columns, each eight feet thick, were taller than any elsewhere in the classical world; each capital was larger than a fully-grown man, and covered with enough different leaf forms to fill a greenhouse at Kew. It was an exuberant, theatrical monument, designed more for ostentation than religiosity, and it undoubtedly achieved its aim. Flanked on either side by snow peaks, sheltered by a windbreak of cypress, it was a wonderfully flash piece of Roman showmanship, and showed that an unrestrained love of glitz is nothing new in this part of the world.",

    "target_paragraph": "We'd committed one of the cardinal sins for a two-week traveller on a strict time budget, when arranging our South and Central American trip, by booking connecting flights on the same day with different airlines. Booking multiple flights with one airline on a single reservation removes the potential impact of any flight delays or cancellations - the airline needs to 'own' the problem and get you on their next available flight. Making separate bookings with two airlines, places the problem squarely on the toes of the traveller, with a missed connection simply resulting in the cost of the ticket being forfeited and a new booking required.",

He vowed to use his local power and reach—and his considerable coffers—to advantage. He promised to spend his own funds to outfit the SS Corwin with a captain, crew, and supplies and dispatch it immediately to attempt a rescue. Bartlett was moved by the offer, and hopeful, too, since the Corwin had been the last ship to land on Wrangel Island—albeit over thirty years before. Still, it was finally a stroke of good fortune.",
