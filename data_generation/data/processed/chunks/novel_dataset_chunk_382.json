    "target_paragraph": "The lamps of London uphold the dark as upon the points of burning bayonets. The yellow canopy sinks and swells over the great four-poster. Passengers in the mail-coaches running into London in the eighteenth century looked through leafless branches and saw it flaring beneath them. The light burns behind yellow blinds and pink blinds, and above fanlights, and down in basement windows. The street market in Soho is fierce with light. Raw meat, china mugs, and silk stockings blaze in it. Raw voices wrap themselves round the flaring gas-jets. Arms akimbo, they stand on the pavement bawling—Messrs Kettle and Wilkinson; their wives sit in the shop, furs wrapped round their necks, arms folded, eyes contemptuous. Such faces as one sees. The little man fingering the meat must have squatted before the fire in innumerable lodging-houses, and heard and seen and known so much that it seems to utter itself even volubly from dark eyes, loose lips, as he fingers the meat silently, his face sad as a poet’s, and never a song sung. Shawled women carry babies with purple eyelids; boys stand at street corners; girls look across the road—rude illustrations, pictures in a book whose pages we turn over and over as if we should at last find what we look for. Every face, every shop, bedroom window, public-house, and dark square is a picture feverishly turned—in search of what? It is the same with books. What do we seek through millions of pages? Still hopefully turning the pages—oh, here is Jacob’s room.",

And they knew then that they had looked upon a king of the poets of the Gael, and a maker of the dreams of men.",

I had to tell the gendarmerie to let them come as their tendency was literally to beat the infants back lest the visitor be annoyed. Actually it did me good to be able to provide so much innocent amusement by merely arriving in the village and soon my photography expedition degenerated into games for all, with me pretending to be a sheep-dog and the children convulsed by giggles and then me being a donkey (not difficult!) crawling around the sand on all fours, braying loudly, with two or three toddlers on my back.",

In the one poem Bolívar wrote about the war, “Delirium on Chimborazo,” he presented the mountain as a metaphor, equating his ascent, which reached well beyond that of Humboldt, with the revolutionary struggle that had landed him at the head of the army. Only from such mystic heights, he claimed, an altitude achieved only by him, could the future of the nation be perceived from the perspective it deserved. He admitted to being just a “plaything of the revolutionary hurricane.” Still, as the last verse of the poem attests, destiny has chosen him alone for glory: “Here on the icy slopes of Chimborazo, the tremendous voice of Colombia cries out to me.”",

    "target_paragraph": "Miss Mandell had the habit of putting her questions that way, and she would even use the same form of oblique reference when she spoke of the more famous objects of her aesthetic interest. Thus she would inquire what one knew about \"a man named Proust\", or \"a woman named Virginia Woolf\". The phrase, accompanied as it always was by a dark and smouldering look, carried an air of \"There's more to this than meets the eye\". It made Miss Mandell appear to be a person of profound and subtle knowingness, and one whose deep and devious searchings had gone so far beyond the platitudes that might be found in the Encyclopadia Britannica and other standard works that there was really no way left for her to learn anything new except, possibly, through a quiet talk with Mr. T. S. Eliot--or, since he wasn't handy, through an occasional tentative yet not very optimistic question addressed to someone of superior intelligence like oneself. And after one had answered Miss Mandell and had poured forth whatever erudition one commanded on the subject of her interest, her usual comment would be a simple and non-committal \"Um\". This always produced a very telling effect. For as Miss Mandell murmured \"Um\" and wandered off, the victim was left flattened out, feeling that he had emptied himself dry and still had been found childishly superficial and pathetically wanting.",

On maps, it sits just south of the point where the tusk formed by the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands starts to jut out toward Asia; Kodiak looks like a puzzle piece that could be picked up and placed into the gap of Cook Inlet, to the north. I flew in from Anchorage and spent a day poking around the main town, Kodiak, which is fairly large by Alaska standards. (It has a McDonald’s and a Walmart, both of which appeared to be very popular with personnel from Kodiak’s enormous Coast Guard station.) The next morning I caught a propeller plane flight across the island to Larsen Bay, a small village near the mouth of Uyak Bay, on Kodiak’s northwest coast. The other passenger and I seemed to be afterthoughts on a cargo run; boxes filled virtually every inch of space not occupied by human flesh. The aerial view confirmed Burroughs’s verdurous raptures: Kodiak was wet and hilly, with few trees and, in late summer, little snow or ice except at the highest altitudes. Pools of water and rocky brown spots took the shapes of golf hazards; all else was fairways. This year was the third in a row on Kodiak that had qualified as warmest ever. Berries that usually appeared in late July had popped out in mid-June. Bears were gorging so much on fruit that some scientists wondered if they’d have any interest in salmon once the fish returned to spawn.",

Without a moment’s hesitation, they whisked me off to the nearby apothecary market and there began enthusiastically pointing out deer antlers, turtle-shell juice, starfish and tiger bone (“In Guangzhou,” said Joe, not very comfortingly, “people eat everything with four legs except a table. And anything that flies except a plane”). Some of these cures were mere superstition, he acknowledged: “the hair vegetable,” for example—he pointed to what looked like a Brillo pad—was regarded as a panacea only because the Chinese word for it sounded like the ideogram for “making a fortune.” But this, he went on—indicating some items in a jar and a drink—would make me healthy for life. Excellent. What did it contain? Oh, nothing much, said Joe: the edible part was bear’s penis and the beverage was tiger’s urine. It would cost me only 400 yuan for the former and 100 yuan for the latter. This, I thought bitterly, sounded very much like the English phrase for “making a fortune”; the miracle cure cost the equivalent of eighteen months’ wages for the average worker.",

In all the proclamations of general pardon which I have seen, my name, with a few others, is specially excepted.

So I would trill at cocktail parties how I loved romance abroad because I could abandon my tiresome Stateside need for quick-wittedness in a mate. In a non-English-speaking country, I might chirp, “I’m the one who can’t keep up with the conversation. Who knows if they’re smart or not?! And who cares?! I’m certainly not quick with the German or French or Israeli or Portuguese bon mot, so why should they be?” I’d observe that if I was actually in another English-speaking country, where I could, ostensibly, ascertain the smarts and humor of my companion, I’d be too distracted by those accents to give a hoot. Accents also, I would add, mysteriously make men seem older, which is a handy way of fooling oneself into warming one’s lonely hotel bed with an inappropriately young suitor, another no-no for me on home soil.",

I don’t know why cabins in the woods in Russia have a more enchanted quality than their counterparts in America, but they do. A full moon had risen and it hung just above the low, treeless, snow-white mountains. A few last streams had to be crossed—some of the creeks flowed so fast they hadn’t frozen, and Aleksandr felt his way through the shallow fords, the water thrusting against the wheels—and then the road carved a narrow, curving terrace along the higher hillsides with the valley of the Olchan River beside us on our left.",

    "target_paragraph": "The club had rented a London double-decker bus for the excursion, scheduled to lead a procession of vehicles from Piazza Castello (Castle Square) at 9 a.m. to Saline Joniche, a coastal town near Pentidattilo, for the first event in the “Tribute to Edward Lear.” Arriving at the piazza shortly before the appointed hour, I naturally was in search of a traditional red bus, looking forward to playing a part in the campy spectacle. But alas, the oversized vehicle had long since been transformed by a nondescript paint job, disguising the characteristic conveyance with an unremarkable neutrality. Oddly, the monstrous pullman, as buses are often called in Italian, didn’t actually have seating for more than eleven or twelve passengers in its circa 1972 party interior. With a quick glance at the organized transport, most of the group hurried off to drive their own cars, pulling away long before our little band of seven set forth forty-five minutes late—for no apparent reason other than habit. As the cumbersome behemoth negotiated its way through the narrow lanes, locals stopped in their tracks, mouths agape, dumbfounded despite our lackluster pigmentation. Illegal parking necessitated frequent, extended pauses, bringing to mind a trip to Disneyworld, although it wasn’t clear as to who had paid for the ride. When we finally reached the highway, I couldn’t help but notice my distinguished colleagues ever so discretely lifting their elbows, as the air finally started gusting through the open windows of the un-air conditioned, 1960s bus on that hot, humid June day. Anchored to our places only by means of the chemical reaction between our warm bodies and the Naugahyde seat coverings on the contraption’s low-slung couches, we careened toward the southernmost point of the peninsula in one of the least safe vehicles I’ve ever encountered, arriving extremely late to an event that obviously never had any intention of beginning at its scheduled hour.",

How long did it take you to come up with it?’ I asked the manager, but he just gave me that look of studied disdain that European hotel managers reserve for American tourists and other insects. I don’t know why he was so snooty because it wasn’t a great hotel. It didn’t even have a bellboy, so the manager had to show me to my room himself, though he left me to deal with my baggage. We went up a grand staircase, where two workmen were busy dribbling a nice shade of ochre on the marble steps and occasionally putting some of it on the wall, to a tiny room on the third floor. As he was the manager, I wasn’t sure whether to give him a tip, as I would a bellboy, or whether this would be an insult to his lofty position. In the event, I settled on what I thought was an intelligent compromise. I tipped him, but I made it a very small tip. He looked at it as if I had dropped a ball of lint into his palm, leading me to conclude that perhaps I had misjudged the situation. ‘Maybe you’ll laugh at my jokes next time,’ I remarked cheerfully, under my breath, as I shut the door on him.",

It was an almost odorless odor, touched always with a buoyant lightness of the Alpine energies. In Summer the sun would blaze down bright and hot from a shell-blue brilliance of shining sky. The hotter it became, the better he felt. He breathed in great breaths of the hot air and sunlight. He seemed to be drinking in enormous draughts of the solar energy. He was filled with lightness, exuberance, and vital strength—so different from the sweltering lassitude, the human misery, the heat-glazed skies and steaming blanket, the tainted and miasmic vapor of the New York heat.",

They are said to have infiltrated many schools, and young men join them as a demonstration of their manhood, or are trapped into complicity by their own dependence on drugs. The largest society of all, the Sun Yee On or 14K Triad, which moved to the colony from China after the Communist Revolution, is believed to have at least 25,000 members. Some Hong Kong Triads have become internationally powerful too, especially in the heroin business, with branches in the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada and the United States, and agents in every overseas Chinese community: one of the most active along the drug routes is said to be the Tai Huen Chai Triad, the ‘Big Circle People’, which was set up in Hong Kong by former Chinese Army soldiers disgraced during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s.",

The reek of the pipe, the lugubrious reiteration of the phonograph, filled the hall, and they mounted stairs carpeted also with linoleum fastened to each step by a treacherous sheet-iron strip treated to resemble brass and scuffed and scarred by heavy feet. The upper hall was lined by two identical rows of doors. They entered one of these. The room contained a bed, a chair, a dressing-table and a washstand with a slop-jar beside it. The floor was covered with straw matting frayed in places. The single light hung unshaded from a greenish-brown cord; upon the wall above the paper-filled fireplace a framed lithograph of an Indian maiden in immaculate buckskin leaned her naked bosom above a formal moonlit pool of Italian marble. She held a guitar and a rose, and dusty sparrows sat on the window ledge and watched them brightly through the dusty screen.",

It made a person think twice about going for a sightseeing jaunt on the BAM. You could understand why this railroad might need a sanitorium.",

The staff is Balinese, which means they automatically start adoring you and complimenting you on your beauty as soon as you walk in. The room has a view of the tropical treetops and there’s a breakfast included every morning with piles of fresh tropical fruit.

Doom had been averted, as the generals threw their caps in the air and shouted for joy. In a sense, that ending actually did occur. The United States and Russia are no longer aiming so many missiles at each other, and you almost never see those maps with dozens of missile arcs on them anymore. The apocalyptic tracks in the sky over Siberia have gone from being hypothetical to being practically nonexistent. Today, Siberia is an old battlefield in which the battle it is known for never took place; the big worries have moved elsewhere.",
