When surveyed, over 80 per cent of Chinese internet-using respondents said that they thought the internet should be managed or controlled in some way. Roughly the same number thought the government was the body that should be responsible for the task. When I spoke to university students and young translators, they thought that the current level of censorship was definitely too restrictive, but believed the internet had to be censored somehow. ‘If you live in a country without any censorship at all,’ one young woman told me, ‘it would be chaos. Or just lots of porn.’ Thinking about the internet back home, the logic was difficult to refute. Censorship in China might have been a problem, they said, but what would the internet be like without it? It would be wild and chaotic, overrun with smut, perversion and subversive ideas. When you let people do whatever they wanted, what did you get? Anarchy.",

Not so much in ways the Chamber of Commerce might promote, though the population did see a bump from 429 to 434 between 2000 and 2015. It’s the size of the landmass on which Gustavus sits, rather, that is increasing. Just as climate change has brought more rain to Southeast Alaska (because a warming ocean sends more moisture into the atmosphere through evaporation), the melting of billions of tons of ice in Glacier Bay is causing land that was depressed under the massive weight of glaciers to rise as much as two inches per year. This process is called isostatic rebound. One waterfront property owner in Gustavus unexpectedly found himself with so much bonus acreage that he built a rudimentary nine-hole golf course on land that had been underwater during the Harriman Expedition.",

Hardly had the bus driver turned off the ignition than the Tibetan passengers and Chinese soldiers began throwing themselves headlong out of the vehicle like Kurosawa warriors storming a castle. Exercising skills refined at every rest stop, they stampeded off in the general direction of the desk, pushing each other to the floor, throwing elbows as they cleared their path, shouting, squabbling, shoving, spitting. Safely protected on the far side of the barricade, the hotel authorities serenely extended forms into the air. These the racing hordes grabbed and began filling out with desperate speed. The minute they were finished, the enthusiastic guests fought their way to the next line, where they handed in their forms and received others in return. These too they filled in speedily, before rushing off to another queue where they were assigned their rooms. In a fourth line, they paid up.",

    "target_paragraph": "Why, seeing that it was pre-eminently an airy, accessible, and sequestered spot for interviews, the cheerfulest form of those occurrences never took kindly to the soil of the ruin, would be a curious inquiry. Perhaps it was because its associations had about them something sinister. Its history proved that. Apart from the sanguinary nature of the games originally played therein, such incidents attached to its past as these: that for scores of years the town-gallows had stood at one corner; that in 1705 a woman who had murdered her husband was half-strangled and then burnt there in the presence of ten thousand spectators. Tradition reports that at a certain stage of the burning her heart burst and leapt out of her body, to the terror of them all, and that not one of those ten thousand people ever cared particularly for hot roast after that. In addition to these old tragedies, pugilistic encounters almost to the death had come off down to recent dates in that secluded arena, entirely invisible to the outside world save by climbing to the top of the enclosure, which few townspeople in the daily round of their lives ever took the trouble to do. So that, though close to the turnpike road, crimes might be perpetrated there unseen at midday.",

You will want for nothing in the harem – gold, silk, perfumes, gardens, birds of paradise, a thousand latticed windows, slaves. You can even bring your parents!\n\n*\n\nThanks, she said, but I prefer it here. From my window I can see my garden with all my flowers in it, and I also have a sweetheart.\n\nOh, wretched girl, the vizier exclaimed, you know nothing of the world’s ways!

Of the fabricated tastes of good fashionable society she knew but little, and of the formulated self-indulgence of bad, nothing at all. Had her utmost thoughts in this direction been distinctly worded (and by herself they never were) they would only have amounted to such a matter as that she felt her impulses to be pleasanter guides than her discretion. Her love was entire as a child’s, and though warm as summer it was fresh as spring. Her culpability lay in her making no attempt to control feeling by subtle and careful enquiry into consequences. She could show others the steep and thorny way, but ‘reck’d not her own rede’.",

I set off hopefully down a broad thoroughfare called St. Andrew’s Drive and found myself adrift in a handsome district of houses of substance and privilege built around a beguiling park with a little lake. At length I passed the Scotland Street Public School, a wonderful building with distinctive stairwells that I presumed was one of Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s, and soon after found myself in a seamier but no less interesting district, which I eventually concluded must be the once-notorious Gorbals.

When further riding was impossible, we tethered our horses and proceeded on foot. We were then 1,500 feet above the sea by the aneroid barometer, and the increased coolness was perceptible. The mercury is about four degrees lower for each 1,000 feet of ascent-rather more than this indeed on the windward side of the islands. The forest would be quite impenetrable were it not for the remains of wood-hauling trails, which, though grown up to the height of my shoulders, are still passable.",

Each street corner had its skip to which householders on their way to work contributed bulging plastic bags and empty bottles. Cats crouched on the skip rims, cleverly reaching down to extract fish spines and other delicacies. Two dead rats in gutters proved that some cats had been busy overnight. Dogs swarmed, having been set free at dawn to do what we all do once a day, so one had to watch one’s step on the broken pavements. A jolly young woman was selling tiny cups of strong sweet coffee from her living-room window; later, she would do a brisk trade in takeaway homemade pizzas which became popular with the Trio. Further down the street, an older woman was selling ham rolls and over-sweet buns from a plank laid on two chairs in her doorway. She and a neighbour were talking money, the neighbour a grey-haired, ebony-skinned housewife hunkered beside her doorstep, cleaning piles of rice on sheets of Granma (Cuba’s only national daily, also the Communist Party newspaper).",

The bridge had only been open six months but the old highway below was already overgrown and completely unused. Incredibly, the builders had provided a set of steps for pedestrians which joined the two loops of road almost vertically and reduced my hike by a couple of kilometers. The wind in the exposed valley was strong, the clouds lower as I climbed toward them, and the metal girders of the bridge whistled softly with only me for miles to hear them. My last view of Kumamoto was an aerial one of crimson maples hiding the lowest approaches to the bridge, and then I plunged into the tunnel and emerged nineteen minutes later in Miyazaki Prefecture on a high terrace overlooking the Ebino valley.",

Almost from the moment it began lumbering down the runway things didn’t look right. Airfields in the 1920s were essentially just that?fields?and Roosevelt Field was no better than most. Because the plane needed an especially long run, it had to cross two dirt service roads, neither of which had been rolled smooth?a painful reminder of how imprudently over-hasty the entire operation was. As the Sikorsky jounced at speed over the second of the tracks, a section of landing gear fell off, damaging the left rudder, and a detached wheel went bouncing off into oblivion. Fonck pressed on nonetheless, opening the throttle and continually gaining speed until he was almost going fast enough to get airborne. Alas, almost was not good enough. Thousands of hands went to mouths as the plane reached the runway’s end, never having left the ground even fractionally, and tumbled clumsily over a twenty-foot embankment, vanishing from view.",

He also employed between four hundred and six hundred ex-convicts, and he hired black men, though he nearly always gave them the hottest, dirtiest, and most exhausting jobs. (Black women in 1927 were never hired.)",
