    "target_paragraph": "Bit by bit, the shoulders of bare rock began to grudge foothold to the taller trees and I was advancing through dwarf fir and a slag-like scree covered with a spectral confusion of thistles. A pale ridge of mineral had sprung up to the right; a much loftier upheaval soared to the left, with another far away beyond it, wrinkled, ashen and shadowless, like an emanation of the noon’s glare. I was moving along an empty valley of pale rocks and boulders, cheerlessly plumed here and there with little fir trees, and eventually these too died away. The warp of the mountains had led me astray. I was not sure that I was where I thought I was, or where I ought to be. It was a bleak place with the pallor of a bone-yard and a wind blowing up made it bleaker still. Damp mist was advancing along the trough, thin wisps at first, followed by denser whorls of vapour clammy to the touch, until it was hard to see more than a few yards. I must have been in the heart of one of those clouds that people gaze at from the plain as they come decoratively to anchor along the cordilleras. When the mist turned into fine rain, I fumbled my way up the flank of the ridge which had stealthily piled up between me and the slope I had been following for two days. I found a cleft in it at last, climbed steeply out of the mist and then down again through boulders and unstable cataracts of scree and plunged through the thistle-belt and the dwarf fir, putting the ascending process into reverse until I was back among the bracken and the sheltering hardwoods and pines. Scrambling about the planetary emptiness above, I had lost my bearings; and when I found the vestige of a sheep-track – unless it had been trodden there by deer – I followed its slight slant, hoping for a turn to the left, but in vain; until, late in the afternoon, I heard dogs barking far away and an occasional bell, and lastly, a clear liquid music that I couldn’t place. But when the trees opened there was something familiar about the sloping grass, the shingle roofs at the far end and the grazing sheep. It was Radu’s clearing; I had travelled in an enormous circle.",

This formidable lady was devoted to art and had not let her marriage to Mr. Stoat interfere with that devotion. Indeed she had not let marriage interfere even with her name, but had clung to her resounding maidenly title of Cornelia Fosdick Sprague. She and Mr. Stoat maintained a salon, to which a great many people who shared Cornelia Fosdick Sprague's devotion to art repaired at regular intervals, and it was to one of these meetings of the elect that George had been invited. He still remembered it vividly. Mr. Stoat had telephoned him a few days after their first casual meeting and had pressed the invitation upon him.",

With measured steps the Dalai Lama began his solemn circuit of the Barkhor. From time to time he stopped before the figures of butter and gazed at them. He was followed by a brilliant retinue of all the high dignitaries and nobles. After them followed the officials in order of precedence. In the procession we recognised our friend Tsarong, who followed close behind the Dalai Lama. Like all the nobles, he carried in his hand a smouldering stick of incense.",

After travelling over ‘wild, and houseless mountains’ and ‘among the well-heads of wild rivers’, the two fugitives come across a region of ‘low, broken, desert land’ that lies ‘as waste as the sea; only the moorfowl and the peewees crying upon it, and far over to the east, a herd of deer, moving like dots’. This is the Moor, and crossing it nearly kills Davey. And people have died there in winter, lost in its expanses, harassed to death by the cold that settles upon it, hardening its extensive waters and binding its few trees in ice.",

There are, to be sure, occasional spasms in her writings that savour more of the ferocious vindictiveness of the Old Testament than the unwholesome slave-morality of the New; yet, on the general score of tolerance, she may be held up as an example to Christians of all colours. Our intelligence, our humanity, turns with loathing from the unspeakable cult that thirsted for the blood of the noblest, and would gladly furbish anew its rusty engines of horror: had its adherents thought and felt as Serafina did, there would have been no burnings and thumb-screwings, no hagglings as to probabiliorism, ‘filioque’, or Gadarene pigs–unlovely phenomena, calculated to make the world-reformer despair of uplifting a race that can wallow in such abysses of criminality and absurdity.",

The lines they trace are as fast and straight as before but all in a criss-cross as of night projectiles over a battlefield. It is each not to the nearest cover but the predetermined one, which may be halfway round the ruin or all the way across the lawn, one way to some nook in the structure, another to the sheltering brown pantalettes of a pygmy palm, so for a few seconds the whole ground is a contradiction of flying cat-furs, which resolves itself in a moment without collision or argument or even a swerve of line unless a particular place were taken, when the late-comer shoots off by the same mystic geometry to the nearest alternative. Then there is no further move. Only nursing mothers have stayed where they were, having already chosen some fairly safe location, from which they view the sky’s performance with gentle sorrow as others will when all of it comes down.",

Are we mistaken in assuming that the whole vocabulary of abuse which is exhausted every week in the journals of our red and pink-complexioned comrades--the sneers against a man's talent, the bitter denials that his work has any substance, sincerity, truth, or reality whatever--is really what it seems to be? No doubt we are mistaken. It would be more charitable to believe that these pure spirits of the present day are what they say they are--collective, selfless, consecrated--and that the words they use do not mean what they seem to mean, and do not betray the romantic and deluded passions that seem to animate them, but are really words used coldly, without passion, for the purposes of collective propaganda--in operations completely surgical, whereby the language of the present day, with all its overtones of superstition, prejudice, and false knowledge, is employed clinically, scientifically, simply to further the Idea of the Future State!",

A Chinese poet many centuries ago noticed that to re-create something in words is like being alive twice. At the taproot, to seek change probably always is related to the desire to enlarge the psychic place one lives in. Under the Tuscan Sun maps such a place. My reader, I hope, is like a friend who comes to visit, learns to mound flour on the thick marble counter and work in the egg, a friend who wakes to the four calls of the cuckoo in the linden and walks down the terrace paths singing to the grapes; who picks jars of plums, drives with me to hill towns of round towers and spilling geraniums, who wants to see the olives the first day they are olives. A guest on holiday is intent on pleasure. Feel the breeze rushing around those hot marble statues? Like old peasants, we could sit by the fireplace, grilling slabs of bread and oil, pour a young Chianti. After rooms of Renaissance virgins and dusty back roads from Umbertide, I cook a pan of small eels fried with garlic and sage. Under the fig where two cats curl, we’re cool. I’ve counted: the dove coos sixty times per minute. The Etruscan wall above the house dates from the eighth century B.C. We can talk. We have time.",

And on a peg in the corner were a few canvas shopping bags also bearing Lennon’s image. He cared most about them because they represented his future, a future that suddenly had been thrown into doubt because of the illogical way that business was done in Cuba. After her first two years in Vedado, Cary had signed a lease extension for at least five more years. But here it was, just a few months later, and the women of the federation were demanding the space back because they said somebody else needed it more. They promised to find her new space for her business, and they even offered to help her and Pipo find an apartment closer to central Havana so they wouldn’t have to continue making the tortuous commute from Guanabacoa. Trust us, they said, we’ll take care of you. But we need you to move out right away.",

The mist condenses into water and all kinds of marvellous things happen, like snowstorms, rain, waterfalls, and lochs on the top of mountains. I tear myself away and ride up to 111 metres, then coast downhill through trees, a bubbling burn, and arrive at Kinlochewe. I have had a lovely ride and the tea stop in Kinlochewe is grand.

The stairs, all floors and the walls of the communal dip-and-pour bathroom were of shiny pale grey tiles. Half the bathroom’s floor space was taken up by a square tiled tank, five feet high – filled at intervals, through a pipe in the wall, with clear water from a nearby stream. One ascended two steps to the squat-over in the corner; failure to place one’s feet symmetrically on the footmarks could cause problems for falangs, their bodies being in general much larger than Lao bodies. Flushing was accomplished by pouring basins of water from on high.",

Blocks of flats and lines of warehouses gave way to allotments. The buildings were spaced further apart; gradually we came to farmsteads and high pitched roofs and thatched outhouses. There were maize fields and vines. In some of the strips peasants were ploughing with teams of blinkered ponies or pairs of long-horned cattle; at the edge of one strip you could see clusters of hives and a bee keeper shrouded in netting. Then, slowly, we began to rise. The hills had jagged peaks, cleft like a dragon’s back. It got colder and the Chinese girl shivered and pulled a jacket out of her bag. In the valleys the arable fields turned to hill pasture. The villages had water mills. The hills grew higher and a purple haze hung over the water meadows.

At the base of dripping cliffs, festooned with creepers, orchids flourished – the commonest an indefinable colour, neither blue nor purple. A swift wide unpolluted river, coming from places Ceausescu couldn’t reach, sparkled and was companionably noisy. All day the sun shone warm though a strong wind blew. At one point, as I approached a semicircle of high mountains, all beech-covered, the sinuous, rhythmic movement of those myriad trees was like a slow-motion dance, directed by the wind – a mesmerisingly beautiful sight. Mostly however the forest was mixed and bird-thronged. Then the valley became a chill, permanently shadowed gorge where a series of waterfalls leaped whitely down the rock-walls with a roaring rush.",

She had no umbrella and the moisture quickly penetrated her thin spring dress. She was still half a mile from her destination, and she decided to walk across to Madison Avenue and take the electric car. As she turned into the side street, a vague memory stirred in her. The row of budding trees, the new brick and limestone house-fronts, the Georgian flat-house with flower-boxes on its balconies, were merged together into the setting of a familiar scene. It was down this street that she had walked with Selden, that September day two years ago; a few yards ahead was the doorway they had entered together. The recollection loosened a throng of benumbed sensations – longings, regrets, imaginings, the throbbing brood of the only spring her heart had ever known. It was strange to find herself passing his house on such an errand. She seemed suddenly to see her action as he would see it – and the fact of his own connection with it, the fact that, to attain her end, she must trade on his name, and profit by a secret of his past, chilled her blood with shame. What a long way she had travelled since the day of their first talk together! Even then her feet had been set in the path she was now following – even then she had resisted the hand he had held out.",

They were plainly bent upon taking a short quick stroll before going indoors to lunch or dinner, to restore warmth to limbs chilled with sitting through a long service.",

In Burmese Days Orwell described it as ‘rather a disagreeable town’ that was ‘dusty and intolerably hot’. Though the description remains true today, little remains of the wooden houses and dirt streets of Orwell’s time. Fierce battles between Allied forces and Japanese soldiers during the Second World War destroyed large swathes of the city. And what wasn’t later consumed by fires has been demolished to make way for an influx of Chinese merchants. The city’s strategic position on the banks of the great Irrawaddy river makes it a key trading centre for commerce with China. As flashy Chinese buildings with mirrored windows and gilded Corinthian columns take over the city centre, Burmese families are forced into squatter towns outside the town. It is a common Burmese complaint that Mandalay is becoming little more than a satellite of China, and that the romance of old Mandalay is long gone. Mandalay’s streets are numerically ordered and run north-south and east-west in a mathematically precise grid. Though the massive walls of the Burmese king’s former palace are still standing, draped in bougainvillea, the regime has stationed a large military garrison inside the compound. From here the city fans out in an orderly maze of shop-houses, pagodas and tea shops.",

Her suit wasn’t right for second class; Yvonne Davidson had made it out of the reflections of an Armistice parade—the lines of the horizon-blue helmet and the sweep of the cape were too generous for the constraint of the scratchy lace-covered benches. Alabama went over her plans sympathetically to herself as a mother might soothe an unhappy child. She couldn’t see the maitresse de ballet till the day after she got there. It was nice of Mademoiselle to give her a bunch of maguey; she was sorry she had forgotten it on the mantelpiece at home. She had some dirty clothes in the laundry, too—Mademoiselle could pack them with the linen when they moved. She supposed David would leave the linen at the American Express. It wouldn’t be hard packing, they had so little junk: a broken tea-set, relic of a pilgrimage to Valence from St-Raphael, a few photographs—she was sorry she hadn’t brought the one of David taken on the porch in Connecticut—some books, and David’s crated paintings.",

If your dad drove a Chevy, chances are you will, too. I learned to cut on a Stihl, so it’s my default. Stihl-heads say proudly, “All these years and she’s Stihl running!” But older Stihls without a decompression button are notoriously hard to start. If a Husky fan comes upon you reefing on the pull cord, he’ll scoff, “Stihl yarding on that thing, huh?”",

Saint-Exupery was someone with a feverish passion for life although, at first glance, you wouldn’t guess it from his seemingly daredevil lifestyle. During the early twentieth century, he flew commercial planes over airmail routes in Europe, Africa and South America. These were dangerous journeys fraught with uncertainty as was demonstrated by the near death of him and his colleagues on a number of different occasions when their aircraft inadvertently went off course or when they were forced to crash land in remote places. Saint-Exupery’s message is clear, our human ego tends to make us think of Nature in terms of how useful it is to us, to test our own limits, or useless in general, if we have no need for it.",

She was looking hard at him, as if to make sure he was not dead, and she wiped away the blood that had grown dry on his face with a wet cloth, and after a while she partly helped him and partly lifted him into the cabin, and laid him down on what served her for a bed. She gave him a couple of potatoes from a pot on the fire, and, what served him better, a mug of spring water. He slept a little now and again, and sometimes he heard her singing to herself as she moved about the house, and so the night wore away. When the sky began to brighten with the dawn he felt for the bag; where his little store of money was, and held it out to her, and she took out a bit of copper and a bit of silver money, but she let it drop again as if it was nothing to her, maybe because it was not money she was used to beg for, but food and rags; or maybe because the rising of the dawn was filling her with pride and a new belief in her own great beauty. She went out and cut a few armfuls of heather, and brought it in and heaped it over Hanrahan, saying something about the cold of the morning, and while she did that he took notice of the wrinkles in her face, and the greyness of her hair, and the broken teeth that were black and full of gaps. And when he was well covered with the heather she went out of the door and away down the side of the mountain, and he could hear her cry, 'I am beautiful, I am beautiful,' getting less and less as she went, till at last it died away altogether.",
