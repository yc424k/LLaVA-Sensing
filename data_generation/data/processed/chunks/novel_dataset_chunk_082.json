I was told, “These eggs are from my chickens, they’re da bere (for drinking raw).” As I had no intention of drinking my eggs, in my new neighborhood at the north end of il Corso, I passed up the eggs in little wicker baskets next to the cash registers, having to settle for a variety not hand-fed by the mother-in-law of anyone I knew. However, the apartment was worth the sacrifice, a lot more money but with a million dollar view. In the words of Luisa’s husband, “Che meraVIGLia! CHE MERAVI-I-I-IGLIA!” (How marvelous!)",

And thus, our voyage culminated with a visit to the NCAV, or the Centre Against Violence back in Ulaanbaatar, where we conducted workshops around psychotherapy, social entrepreneurship and shared more about the work we do with the devoted social workers at the centre. The time spent sharing our experiences and connecting with women locally is incredibly uplifting and adds a meaningful dimension to our WOAM treks. It makes my teammates connect at a deeper level and allows them to contribute, not simply by fundraising, but by sharing their own life and career experiences. At the NCAV, we also met the women and children survivors of domestic violence, who were temporarily housed in their shelters. Understandably, they seemed shy and downcast. I could only imagine their trauma and despair at having to find shelter in a home.",

And the other children when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring. ‘It is your garden now, little children,’ said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall.

The streets were empty, dark, and full of slanting rain. I walked from the station through a concrete shopping precinct and out onto the blustery seafront. Most of the hotels along the front were dark and evidently shut for the winter, and the few that were open didn’t look particularly enticing. I walked a mile or so to a cluster of three brightly lit establishments at the far end of the promenade and randomly selected a place called the Birchfield. It was fairly basic, but clean and reasonably priced. You could do worse, and I have.",

That it holds the 400-mile-long Lake Baikal, the largest freshwater lake in the world. That the Trans-Siberian Railroad has transported cargo and migrants across Siberia’s immensity since the turn of the last century. That its emptiness made it the perfect place for Stalin to construct his network of inhuman prison camps known as gulags. Now, for this one short span of time, I also know that Siberia is heaven.",

Every one was gone, then; even Chris Fenno. With a breath of relief the mother pushed the door open. The room was empty. One of the tall vases was full of branching chrysanthemums and autumn berries. In a corner stood a tea-table with scattered cups and plates. The Airedale drowsed by the hearth. As she stood there, Kate Clephane saw the little Anne who used to sit by that same fire trying to coax the red birds through the fender. The vision melted the last spot of resistance in her heart. The door of Anne’s bedroom was also ajar, but no sound came from there either. Perhaps the girl had gone out with her last visitors, escaping for a starlit rush up the Riverside Drive before dinner.

She would look at me and open her mouth and out would roll a burp. It was amazing. Then she would take a drag on her cigarette and burp a large puff of smoke. That was amazing too. I glanced behind me. The Indian man was still there, looking miserable. Seeing me, he started to lean forward to ask a supplementary question, but I stopped him with a raised finger and he sank back. I stared out the window, feeling ill, and passed the time by trying to imagine circumstances less congenial than this.

She lit candles. She cleaned the cuts on my feet. I tried to explain what had happened. I didn’t get far. I said that I wanted to go back to New York with her. She washed my hair. I asked why she didn’t get angry about all the stupid risky things I did. She knew I was talking about war reporting as much as I was about surfing. She said she assumed I needed to do them.",

As the afternoon disappeared we arrived alongside the north Patagonian icecap, stretching for miles beyond the western mountains, and on the eastern side of the road a river became a lake, so blue it was vulgar. This lake got much bigger. It was called Lake General Carrera (though the part on the Argentinian side was called Like Buenos Aires; they couldn’t possibly share a name), and it was the second largest lake in South America. A small man appeared on the road next to it, wanting a lift, so we took him a few miles, and he told us he was a paramedic. He had walked for four hours to visit a sick man. Then the river Baker rushed at us, wild and emerald, flowing towards the south Pacific at over 300,000 gallons per second, curling through the rock, fizzing with white water, and we watched it for many miles in silence, until it turned black in the dark, and then, after all that, the moon was full.",

Everything that was dearest to him, the thought of George, the vision of the lad dying upstairs, was defiled by this monstrous coupling of their names with that of the supple middle-aged adventurer safe in his spotless uniform at the War Office. And beneath the boiling-up of Campton’s disgust a new fear lifted its head. How did Mme. de Dolmetsch know about George? And what did she know? Evidently there had been foolish talk somewhere. Perhaps it was Mrs. Brant—or perhaps Fortin himself. All these great doctors forgot the professional secret with some one woman, if not with many. Had not Fortin revealed to his own wife the reason of Campton’s precipitate visit? The painter escaped from Mme. de Dolmetsch’s scented lair, and from the sights and sounds of the hospital, in a state of such perturbation that for a while he stood in the street wondering where he had meant to go next.",

Calabrian weddings are no longer charming, home-cooked, country celebrations, but ornate, fully catered gatherings that often give rise to considerable debt as couples endeavor to emulate their smiling counterparts in brides’ magazines for their closest two- to five-hundred relatives and friends. On beautiful days, these young hopefuls are frequently seen posing for formal wedding photos along the seaside.",

In northern Dutch cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam the occasion passed almost entirely unnoticed, but in the south of the country, in the region known as onder de rivieren (‘below the rivers’), it was widely celebrated. In the days leading up to Ash Wednesday, southern cities like Maastricht would be flooded with costumed parades, marching bands and street parties. Many workplaces were closed, and the normally down-to-earth Dutch embarked on an orgy of dancing, cross-dressing and above all drinking. Maastricht was temporarily renamed in the local dialect, becoming Mestreech, and thousands defied the cold in order to hold their own chilly Mardi Gras, ignoring stuffier northerners’ traditional dismissal of the festivities as mere Paapse stoutigheden, or ‘Popish naughtiness’.",

I find myself always torn between two beliefs: the belief that life should be better than it is and the belief that when it appears better it is really worse. But in the huge lounge at Liverpool, like the lounge of a country inn fifty times magnified, one was at home on the vast expanse of deep dark carpet, only one business man asleep with his mouth open; at home as one would certainly not have been if the Hollywood imagination had run riot.

Given the logistical challenges of the trade, the array of forces that stood in his way, the financial and military assets of those who opposed his every move, Pablo’s achievement, judged purely as a commercial enterprise, was indeed nothing short of extraordinary.",

A farmhouse appeared about a quarter of a mile away.\nMiriam’s sense of her duties closed in on her. Trying not to see Elsa’s elaborate clothes and the profile in which she could find no meaning, no hope, no rest, she spoke to her.\n“Do you like milk, Elsa?” she said cheerfully.\nElsa began swinging her lace-covered parasol.\n“If I like milk?” she repeated presently, and flashed mocking eyes in Miriam’s direction.\nDespair touched Miriam’s heart.\n“Some people don’t,” she said.\nElsa hummed and swung her parasol.\n“Why should I like milk?” she stated.\nThe muddy farmyard, lying back from the roadway and below it, was steamy and choking with odours. Miriam who had imagined a cool dairy and cold milk frothing in pans, felt a loathing as warmth came to her fingers from the glass she held. Most of the girls were busily sipping. She raised her glass once towards her lips, snuffed a warm reek, and turned away towards the edge of the group, to pour out the contents of her glass, unseen, upon the filth-sodden earth.",

Once, it is true, a bright mindless beetle of machinery, which had no thought for fated men, had knocked him down and skinned and bruised him; again, an uninstructed wheel had passed across the soft toe-end of his shoe and held him prisoner, as if he were merely some average son of destiny – but he escaped. He escaped because he was a fated man and because the providence which guides the steps of children and the blind was kind to him; and because this same policeman whose simian upper lip had once been thick and twisted with its curses had long since run the scale from anger to wild fury, and thence to madness and despair and resignation, and had now come to have a motherly affection for this stray sheep, kept his eye peeled for its appearance every morning, or, failing this, at once shrilled hard upon his whistle when he heard the well-known howl of terror and surprise, plunged to the centre of the stalled traffic snarl, plucked Bascom out to safety under curse and shout and scream of brake, and marched him tenderly to the curb, gripping his brawny hand around the old man’s arm, feeling his joints, testing his bones, massaging anxiously his sinewy carcass, and calling him ‘bud’ – although Bascom was old enough to be his grandfather. ‘Are you all right, bud? You’re not hurt, are you, bud? Are you O.K.?’ – to which Bascom, if his shock and terror had been great, could make no answer for a moment save to pant hoarsely and to howl loudly and huskily from time to time, ‘Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!’",

Scanty sleep on two consecutive nights and a recently rather frugal diet – in relation to energy expended – have so diminished my stamina that I reached the top of the 14,400 foot escarpment feeling like death not warmed up. For a few moments I shared Jock’s disinterest in the panorama and simply sat beside him with my head on my knees. Then, having recovered enough breath to smoke, I began to appreciate a view that was more confined than yesterday’s but no less dramatic in its own way. This indeed was the heart of the Semiens – a jagged, dark, cold, cruel rock-world – and to have ‘won’ it was reward enough for any degree of painful fatigue.",

So preoccupied was she\nwith the thought of Brodrick that her trouble, travelling along secret\npaths of the nerves and brain, had subtly, insensibly communicated\nitself to him. He grew restless in that atmosphere of unrest. If\nGertrude could have kept, inwardly, her visible beautiful serenity,\nBrodrick, beguiled by the peace she wrapped him in, might have remained\nindefinitely quiescent. But he had become the centre of a hundred\ninfluences, wandering spirits of Gertrude's brain. Irresistibly urging,\nintangibly irritating, perpetually suggesting, they had prepared him for\nthe dominion of Jane Holland. But Gertrude was not aware of this. Her\nstate, which had begun within a few months of her arrival, remained for\nthree years a secret to herself. She was before all things a\nsentimentalist, and she had the sentimentalist's monstrous innocence and\nboundless capacity for illusion. She shuddered in the grip of mortal\nrenunciation, and called her state holy, when adoration and desire were\nfused in a burning beatitude at the approach of Brodrick. In her three\nyears' innocence she continued unaware that her emotions had any root in\nflesh and blood; and Brodrick was not the man to enlighten her. His\nattitude was such as to nourish and perpetuate her beautiful serenity.",

He joined the Artists’ Rifles - a large volunteer battalion for the London and Middlesex areas - and was posted first to Hare Hall Training Camp in Essex, where he worked as a map-reading instructor, using the skills of land knowledge he had learned as a walker. In January 1917, he was posted to the Western Front. He wrote to his wife Helen on 29 January, the day before he left England, to say that once he was ‘over there’, he would ‘say no more goodbyes’. From the letters and the journal he wrote while at the Front, it is clear that Thomas often recalled his walking days, and that the memories of those years of openness, and of freedom to move, were a steady consolation to him, until he was killed by a shell-blast on the first day of the Battle of Arras, just after dawn.",

The jungle’s warm breath fogs up eyeglasses and creeps underneath Gore-Tex jackets, creating portable steam rooms. Once everything is hecho una sopa?soaked like a soup?the temperature drops.",

It had the nice device of containing forty-five single takes and a central take that had forty-five parts. It was designed to be symmetrical—it began with the kids drinking beer and concluded with them smoking dope. It was performed by a group of nonprofessionals who improvised as they went along (not for nothing had its well-educated director dedicated his first movie to Brecht). And the whole picture was, I thought, a farrago of borrowed gestures and secondhand beliefs. It had all the blank anger of a punk movie with none of the bravado. It had all the brutality of a kung fu movie with none of the extraordinary stunts. It had much of the behaviorism of Lord of the Flies but none of the point. I did not mind that the movie was boring, repetitive and crude. But I did feel cheated by its unspoken assumption that it was addressing a serious problem with serious candor, bravely fighting despair with despair. More than anything, I recoiled from its air of self-importance; it seemed in more ways than one a sub-Continental kind of movie.",

Robin Forbes-Robertson Hale, the sister-in-law of an old friend, put me up in a large flat which was always teeming with guests. It was perched in a gaunt and fascinating rookery in a street of the Inner City called the Schreyvogelgasse, or Shriekbird Lane. Tall and striking, she was just back, with two Austrian friends, from a wintry stay in Capri: they belonged to a small half-native and half-expatriate Bohemian set which seemed perfect from the first moment I became involved in it. With the end of the political troubles, the last days of Carnival were given over to music and dancing and dressing up. Wildish nights and late mornings set in, and after a last climactic fancy dress party, I woke in an armchair with an exploding head still decked with a pirate’s eyepatch and a cut-out skull and crossbones. At the first strokes of noon from the tower of the nearby Schottenkirche, the shuttered penumbra began to stir with groans; a concerted croaking for Alka-Seltzer broke out. A pierrot, a Columbine, a lion and a sleeping lioness with her moulting tail over the back of a sofa were disposed about the drawing-room like damaged but still just articulate toys.",

Instantly one of the men broke from the line and ran to her. It was all unplanned, simple and instinctive. Presently the guard who was marching in front heard the commotion and looked around. He rushed back and dragged the man away with the help of two others. The woman stumbled back to a stool and drooped down in a sort of apathy.
