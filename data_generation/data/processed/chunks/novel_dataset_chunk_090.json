As a result of a petition signed by sixteen thousand, an initiative appeared on the 1974 primary ballot through which the voters could indicate a wish to move their capital. Similar initiatives in 1960 and 1962 had been defeated, perhaps in part because Alaskans elsewhere in the state did not want to see even more power concentrated in Anchorage. Anchorage, for its part, wished to yield nothing to Fairbanks. Their rivalry is intense to the point of unseemliness. So the 1974 initiative was written to exclude both cities—the new capital could not be within thirty miles of either one—and in strong majority (fifty-seven per cent) the voters went for it.",

He lit the stove and put the kettle on as Gillian stirred. “Morning baby,” he said as he unlocked the companionway hatch and slid it open. The foreboding feeling was gone. It was replaced by the usual mild trepidation he was feeling about going to some new, unfamiliar place. He was getting used to that feeling, he thought, as removed the weatherboards and climbed into the sunny cockpit and started rolling up the bimini’s canvas side curtains.

Its central feature was a vast and unsightly parking lot, which I had quite forgotten, and the shops, pubs, and guesthouses along the street to the cove looked dowdy and hard up. I went into a large pub and almost immediately regretted it. It had that sickly, stale smell of slopped beer and was full of flashing fruit machines. I was almost the only customer in the place, but nearly every table was covered with empty pint glasses and ashtrays overflowing with cigarette butts, crisp packets, and other disorderly detritus. My glass was sticky and the lager was warm. I drank up and tried another pub nearby, which was marginally less grubby but scarcely more congenial, with battered decor, loud music, and a more or less total lack of delight at the bestowal of my custom. It’s small wonder (and I speak as an enthusiast) that so many pubs are losing their trade.",

That meant that no matter what happened with the film, sound and image would always be perfectly aligned. Failing to find backers in America, he moved to Berlin in the early 1920s and there developed a system that he called Phonofilm. De Forest made his first Phonofilm movie in 1921 and by 1923 he was back in America giving public demonstrations. He filmed Calvin Coolidge making a speech, Eddie Cantor singing, George Bernard Shaw pontificating, and DeWolf Hopper reciting “Casey at the Bat.” By any measure, these were the first talking pictures. However, no Hollywood studio would invest in them. The sound quality still wasn’t ideal, and the recording system couldn’t quite cope with multiple voices and movement of a type necessary for any meaningful dramatic presentation.",

Currently, forests are declining in around a third of the world’s countries, stable in a third, and growing in the final third.

As soon as Jim, with Tamb’ Itam at his heels, had started upon his evening rounds, I went up to the house alone, and, unexpectedly, found myself waylaid by the girl, who had been clearly waiting for this opportunity.",

Every evening, the place looked like Duval Street in Key West on a Saturday night, or Santa Barbara’s lower State. For as soon as the sun went down, all the beautiful people came out of the woodwork to trawl—beefy men with sunglasses propped up in their hair, freshly turned blondes in halter tops and miniskirts. Here, it seemed, was the poor man’s Club Med. In one café, a tall sandy-haired guy was zeroing in on an English girl just off the bus, and telling her that he was an artist who lived in the hills, she might find it interesting to look at his canvases. In the snackbar of my losmen, two good-looking rogues just released from a British public school were agreeing to meet up with a pair of jeunes filles from Paris. Inside Madé’s Warung (today’s special: French pâté), a bearded hipster was saying to a girl from Santa Cruz, “You stay in Kuta? You know, if ever you have any problems, I’ve got a bungalow …”",

Not the execution. But they would not give his mother the body, or so they say. That is a terrible punishment, sir.

    "target_paragraph": "Before settling on a pipeline, various other modes of getting Alaska’s oil to market were considered, including flying it out on jumbo jets. In August and September of 1969, the thousand-foot-long supertanker SS Manhattan, retrofitted as a sort of mega-icebreaker, attempted to make a trial run via the Northwest Passage and nearly got trapped in the polar ice. The verdict was that commercial sea traffic through the Arctic wasn’t feasible. Less than half a century and more than ten billion barrels of burned Prudhoe Bay crude later, the Arctic ice had melted so much due to climate change that adventurous tourists were now able to transit the route that Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had pioneered between 1903 and 1906. As I walked around the new state museum in Juneau, the luxury Crystal Serenity was preparing to become the largest cruise ship to cross the Northwest Passage, departing from Anchorage in August and sailing through the once impassable Arctic en route to New York City. Nine hundred tickets, starting at twenty thousand dollars and rising to more than a hundred thousand, had sold out almost immediately.",

Next time I came, she wrote, please could I tell her my flight number, and she would meet me at the airport. Inside, she included a photo of herself, seated on a swing in some sunny northern village with a pixie’s shy smile—scarcely older, so it seemed, than her seven-year-old daughter.

Pushing for time and unroped, we half-jogged up over two steepening miles of glacier, trusting the lingering cold to keep the snow-bridges rigid.

I was warmly greeted by the owners of businesses I frequented, certainly not for the small quantity of merchandise purchased. Conversing with a proprietor or a sales clerk, I couldn’t help but notice the raised eyebrows of locals whose acquaintance I hadn’t yet made. Who could this foreigner on such good terms with Signora Valeria be? The young children seemed unusually innocent despite growing up in such a complicated social environment. I was surprised and moved by their reaction when I announced my leaving—tears lasting for over an hour. These children weren’t used to people coming into their lives from the outside, the casual visitor. I had been accepted and they had become attached. They had embraced me. I, too, was fond of them.",

Discussed over many a dinner table, storms in the enclosed basin bore reputations as hellions, first for popping up out of nowhere, then for stacking up steep chop with winds capable of raging at hurricane force until, as suddenly as they appeared, they dissipated. Although the sea has a surface of over a million square miles, its greatest depth is only 4,688 feet; the Pacific, in comparison, is almost three times as deep. The Mediterranean swells are much more susceptible to confusion than those in the open ocean, built up as they are by regional winds like the storied mistral, which flows down the Rhone Valley, and the sirocco, which blows up from the deserts of the Sahara.",

There it lay in charmed solitude, shut in by a tawny growth of larch and swamp-maple, its edges burnt out to smouldering shades of russet, ember-red and ashen-grey, while the quaking centre still preserved a jewel-like green, where hidden lanes of moisture wound between islets tufted with swamp-cranberry and with the charred browns of fern and wild rose and bay. Sodden earth and decaying branches gave forth a strange sweet odour, as of the aromatic essences embalming a dead summer; and the air charged with this scent was so still that the snapping of witch-hazel pods, the drop of a nut, the leap of a startled frog, pricked the silence with separate points of sound.",

I dodged just as it slammed into the wall behind me; I could even feel the wind in my hair. Then there was a sound like a nail jabbed into a big bicycle tire. It went whishhhhhhhhh and then the rest of that shiny fat black horse we had got from Pat Stamper vanished. I dont mean me and Ab was standing there with just the mule left. We had a horse too. Only it was the same horse we had left home with that morning and that we had swapped Beasley Kemp the sorghum mill and the straight stock for two weeks ago. We even got our fish hook back, with the barb still bent where Ab had bent it and the nigger had just moved it a little.

We were running before it under bare poles, yet the schooner fairly tore along. The seas were all of an eighth of a mile apart, and the wind snatched the whitecaps from their summits, filling. The air so thick with driving spray that it was impossible to see more than two waves at a time. The schooner was almost unmanageable, rolling her rail under to starboard and to port, veering and yawing anywhere between south-east and south-west, and threatening, when the huge seas lifted under her quarter, to broach to.

Thorny scrub reaches out over the path – which, understandably, is not much used – and I was too busy avoiding a lethal slip to avoid the thorns, so this evening my painfully sunburnt legs are badly torn. Yet these barbs give only surface scratches to the highlanders’ tough skins.",

In contrast to the Netherlands, it was almost impossible to walk a hundred yards without being tempted by an artisan sandwich, gluten-free cake, sushi platter or stone-baked pizza. Sugary snacks were on sale everywhere: flapjacks and cakes and chocolate bars and bags of sweets piled up next to every checkout. Perhaps as a result, people looked more unhealthy than they did in the Netherlands, sporting muffin tops to match the muffins they always seemed to be eating. In a busy Parliament Square, I found I could see easily over the crowd: at 6’2” I was taller than most people, rather than merely average. Waiting to cross the road, I did see one young woman who looked a little healthier and happier than everyone else, smiling to herself behind a curtain of long blonde hair. When she opened her handbag I saw a book inside, and realised she was Dutch.",

The noise grew incessant, sometimes sounding like a distant drumbeat, sometimes like weird shrieks and wails. The sounds were particularly unsettling to Beuchat, Murray, and Dr. Mackay. Each, in turn, went to Bartlett’s cabin and asked for a sleeping bag, which he gave them. The three worked together in the evenings, preparing for themselves, fabricating man-harnesses for pulling sleds, the technique Dr. Mackay and Murray had used in the Antarctic. They stuffed their rucksacks with personal valuables, food, and even tobacco. Beuchat, his eyes twitching and hands shaking, advised Mamen to “get ready to turn out and go to Wrangel Island any moment.” Mamen just went about his business, scraping furs with McKinlay. But he remarked after Beuchat left, “I’m sure of one thing: none of those three will reach land if left to their own resources.”",

From where she sat she saw the trail wandering across the bleached grass in the direction of Hamblin, and the granite wall of the Mountain falling away to infinite distances.

Two sat with her, in bright relief against the dark foliage of a crepe-myrtle not yet in flower. The other woman (the third member of the group was a young girl in white and with a grave molasses bang and a tennis racket across her knees) spoke to him, and Belle greeted him with a sort of languid possessive desolation. Her hand was warm, prehensile, like mercury in his palm exploring softly with delicate bones and petulant scented flesh. Her eyes were like hothouse grapes and her mouth was redly mobile, rich with discontent; but waked now from its rouged repose, this was temporarily lost. She had lost Meloney, she told him.",

    "target_paragraph": "But Gurney survived the war. He was injured - shot in the chest, and gassed - and invalided home. Shortly after the Armistice, he entered upon a period of frenzied creativity. Between 1919 and 1922, he wrote some nine hundred poems and two hundred and fifty songs. Walking and inspiration became intertwined for Gurney. He strode the countryside both day and night, often for hours. The letters he sent during these years speak of how much he ‘needed’ the night-walking in particular. At night, he was able to follow what he called ‘the white ways . . . unvisited by most’, which was, he said, a form of ‘discovery’. ’O that night!’, he wrote to a friend. ‘Meteors flashed like sudden inspirations of song down the sky. The air was too still to set firs or beeches sighing, but - O the depth of it!’ He spoke of ‘brambles beautiful in wind’, of the ‘black greenery of beech against the moon’, of how a low moon threw into relief the ‘still sky-rims . . . high above the valley’, and of ‘bronzed cloud-bars at cold dawn’. ‘Earth, air, and water,’ he wrote late in that period of his life, ‘are the true sources of song or speaking.’",

Travelers stay in a wooden ranch house, with rooms aligned dormitory-style, all of them opening onto a covered porch overlooking the river. There is a separate kitchen, where Jimmy and Parménides and our crew hung out, huddled by the fire, drinking coffee, perhaps a roncito for warmth and strength. William moved a table to the porch and, after a short rest, began to process his collections. He took notes, and pressed each specimen between numbered sheets of newsprint, ultimately preserving them in bundles soaked with alcohol and placed into plastic bags and burlap costales. The radio played constantly, all vallenatos. It was tuned to Radio Pitalito, “La Poderosa del Huila,” leaving no doubt that we had left the department of Cauca far behind.",

Her body was stiff with cold and fatigue, and she moved slowly lest her heavy steps should rouse them. She was faint with hunger, and had nothing left in her satchel; but on the table she saw the half of a stale loaf. No doubt it was to serve as the breakfast of old Mrs. Hyatt and the children; but Charity did not care; she had her own baby to think of. She broke off a piece of the bread and ate it greedily; then her glance fell on the thin faces of the sleeping children, and filled with compunction she rummaged in her satchel for something with which to pay for what she had taken. She found one of the pretty chemises that Ally had made for her, with a blue ribbon run through its edging. It was one of the dainty things on which she had squandered her savings, and as she looked at it the blood rushed to her forehead. She laid the chemise on the table, and stealing across the floor lifted the latch and went out….",

The waterfalls had hardened into complicated bulbs and fists. Between the rocks on the river’s banks, blue ice gleamed in webbed lines.

Both feet and legs were a paradoxical mix of numbness and shooting pain. Needing to observe myself remotely, I slipped into a floating state. Outside my own body, away from the pain, I could instruct. I observed the absurdity of my current state without amusement. It was 10:30 p.m. and I was searching the shoulder-high, eroded embankment of a roaring glacial river for anything resembling the resumption of trail. Finally, I found the familiar break in the trees and brush and clawed my way up it. I relied on my hands, digging my fingers into the loose dirt and using exposed roots to pull my struggling lower body over the brink.",

I keep looking for the Snack Van lady’s road. I lower my expectations to bicycle track. Then, just track. What I find is a sheep path. Through bog.

    "target_paragraph": "When we reached this compound it, too, was in darkness – apart from the flicker of a dying wood-fire in the smallest of the three stone huts – and it took me fifteen minutes to unload Jock. (It was the measure of today’s disorganisation that my torch lay at the bottom of a sack and could only be got at after the untying of countless complicated knots.) Marcos must be used to unloading mules, but he seemed to have been mentally numbed by astonishment – or else he believes that there is some special mystique connected with faranj-owned pack-animals. He made no attempt to help until I had somehow induced everything to come to pieces; then, while I fumbled through the sacks for food, torch, insecticide-powder and notebook, he led Jock to a shelter, before carrying my load into the smallest hut. This was round and solidly built, with a pointed grass roof and two-foot thick walls. A quarter of the floor space was taken up by a mud ‘stove’, some eighteen inches high, another quarter by two six-foot mud-and-wicker grain storage bins, and the rest by an uneven mud couch, covered with a stiff cow-hide and raised two feet above the floor. Marcos dumped my load on this bed, bent down to blow the embers and, when a handful of twigs had begun to blaze, gave me an uneasy, sideways glance. I grinned cheerfully in reply – without saying anything, since my earlier attempts at communication had seemed only to scare him. He was a handsome youth, with a broad brow, a straight nose, slightly prominent cheek-bones and fine eyes. Beneath his unease I sensed a nice nature and now he responded to my grin with a quick, shy smile, before adding more twigs to the fire and putting a rusty basin of water to heat. I wondered if some beverage would in due course be produced from the basin; but instead, when the water was hot, Marcos began to remove my boots and socks, keeping his head respectfully bent. For the next ten minutes he violently massaged my legs from knees to toes, pouring water over them before each attack. Even without today’s severe sunburn – just where he was concentrating on my calf-muscles – such treatment would have been trying enough; but now my legs feel comfortably relaxed.",
