This subsidiary, which is called the Protea Hotel Group, operates more than 100 hotels throughout 8 African countries. A distinguishing feature of the Protea group is that each hotel has a distinctive flavor that reflects its local setting. The Protea hotels in Cape Town and Johannesburg are cosmopolitan and trendy. The promotional literature calls these “Fire and Ice.” The Protea hotel beside Johannesburg’s O.R. Tambo International Airport has an industrial motif; it resembles an aircraft hangar with airplane wings, engines, and other equipment scattered throughout. This theme reflects the area’s industrial roots and its location as a transportation hub.",

When, with her arms folded tight under her ample bosom, she scolded the squat, thick-legged China girls handling linen, plucking fowls, pounding corn in wooden mortars amongst the mud outbuildings at the back of the house, she could bring out such an impassioned, vibrating, sepulchral note that the chained watchdog bolted into his kennel with a great rattle. Luis, a cinnamon-coloured mulatto with a sprouting moustache and thick, dark lips, would stop sweeping the café with a broom of palm leaves to let a gentle shudder run down his spine. His languishing almond eyes would remain closed for a long time.",

But it seemed as if she could hear in spite of her closed ears those horrible, blundering, utterly unnecessary sounds: the hushed scraping of timid footsteps, the muted thumping of wood against wood that, passing, left behind an unbearable unchastity of stale flowers—as though flowers themselves getting a rumour of death became corrupt—all the excruciating ceremony for disposing of human carrion. So she had not heard Mrs Mahon until the other touched her shoulder. (I would have cured him! If they had just let me marry him instead of her!) At the touch Emmy raised her swollen, blurred face, swollen because she couldn’t seem to cry. (If I could just cry. You are prettier than me, with your black hair and your painted mouth.

The house was ancient and elegant, a warren of narrow wooden hallways and staircases that led deeper into the recesses until finally reaching the inner sanctum, a small room of carpets and books and a glowing hearth, beside which sat our host, sunk back in a chair so welcoming he could scarcely reach his drink on the side table. The dark woodwork dated to the earliest days of Bogotá, as did the glass in the interior windows. The lamps cast a pale glow, as if products of the first experiments with electricity. The amber light, the candles, and a functioning fireplace, so unexpected in Bogotá, lent a timeless air to a room that no doubt had hosted some of the great figures in Colombian history.",

He had been a diplomat and a mountaineer who spent fifty years travelling the world, and in every posting he had sought out high ground, open space and paths. In Bulgaria in 1940, only a few weeks before the country joined the Axis and banished its British diplomats, he was busy exploring the Rila mountains. In 1943 he and a climber-friend called Robin Hodgkin reached the summit of Demirkazik (12,323 feet) in the Turkish Ala Dag. They thought themselves the first summiteers – but then found a tattered swastika flag left there by an Austrian party several years earlier (ever alert to propaganda opportunities, my grandfather carried it down to prove to local villagers that the Nazis had plans to annex their mountain). The posting he longed for but never got was to Tehran: the politics of Iran fascinated him, but its mountains, rearing snowbound over the city, fascinated him even more. Politics and wild landscape were the two strands of his unusual life. Now he had died, only a few months after my grandmother, in a house at the foot of the mountain range they had both come to know better than anywhere else, and having walked from north to south across the Isles of Lewis and Harris, I was now setting out to walk from south to north across the inland-island of the Cairngorm massif.",

After forty-six years at the hotel—working in every department from security to maintenance to food-and-beverage to the front office—Leslie can’t shake the habit of arriving every morning at 6.30, heating up some coffee and preparing himself for the day to come.

All day long I am giving out table linen, ordering meals, supporting the feeble knees of servants, making appropriate and amiable remarks to officers, presiding as gracefully as nature permits at meals, and trying to look as though I were happy; while out in the garden—oh, I know how it is looking out in the garden this golden weather, how the placid hours are slipping by in unchanged peace, how strong the scent of roses and ripe fruit is, how the sleepy bees drone round the flowers, how warmly the sun shines in that corner where the little Spanish chestnut is turning yellow—the first to turn, and never afterwards surpassed in autumn beauty; I know how still it is down there in my fir wood, where the insects hum undisturbed in the warm, quiet air; I know what the plain looks like from the seat under the oak, how beautiful, with its rolling green waves burning to gold under the afternoon sky; I know how the hawks circle over it, and how the larks sing above it, and I edge as near to the open window as I can, straining my ears to hear them, and forgetting the young men who are telling me of all the races their horses win as completely as though they did not exist. I want to be out there on that golden grass, and look up into that endless blue, and feel the ecstasy of that song through all my being, and there is a tearing at my heart when I remember that I cannot. Yet they are beautiful young men; all are touchingly amiable, and many of the older ones even charming—how is it, then, that I so passionately prefer larks?",

He declined to make a national radio broadcast appealing for private donations. He declined to provide the humorist Will Rogers with a message of hope and goodwill that he could read out as part of a national broadcast.

It also lacked humor and equability and perhaps intelligence too, which his father’s face had not lacked, but which that of the man who sat for ten days after his daughter’s elopement with a loaded shotgun on his lap, probably did. He grew up with a negro lad for his sole companion. They slept in the same room, the negro on a pallet on the floor, until he was ten years old. The negro was a year older. When they were six and seven, he conquered the negro with his fists in fair fight. Afterward he would pay the negro out of his pocket money at a standard rate fixed between them, for the privilege of whipping the negro, not severely, with a miniature riding crop.",

We looked for a ship to Kenya or Tanzania, but both countries required visas that weren’t available in Sri Lanka. We ended up flying to South Africa. In Johannesburg we bought an old station wagon and made our way to the coast at Durban. We car-camped down through Natal and the Transkei to Cape Town. I surfed. This was 1980, still the heyday of apartheid. I continued to do my informal interviews of randomly encountered people. Here those yielded great hauls of weirdness: inscrutable evasions from polite black workers and country folk; the most relaxed and profound racism from white fellow campers. Sharon and I were on a steep learning curve, reading Gordimer, Coetzee, Fugard, Breytenbach, Brinks—their unbanned work, anyway. Every surfer was white, which was no great surprise. For the next leg of our rambles, we had a bold idea: a huge tack to the north, “Cape to Cairo,” overland. But we were running out of money.",

She immigrated to America with her family in the late 1920s. If you have children, you might know her book Caps for Sale. It’s about a monkey who steals hats from a hat peddler and goes up a tree.

    "target_paragraph": "Beneath a surface layer of unbelief or Orthodox Christianity, Russia is an animist country. Ordinary physical objects are alive in Russia far more than they are in America, and however Russia’s religious or political currents flow, this native animism remains strong. Trees, streets, utensils, groves, machines—each has its own spirit and its own personality, like the cabin belonging to the witch Baba Yaga that could get up on its chicken legs and run around. A Russian telephone isn’t just a phone, it’s a being. Once at Alex Melamid’s mother’s apartment when I was having trouble dialing her phone, she showed me how, explaining, “He likes to be dialed slowly.” In Russia, alarm clocks don’t ring, they burst into rooster crowing or songbird calls. My friend Luda had a clock that announced the hours in an old-lady voice: “The time is one o’clock exactly!” Luda referred to the clock as moya tyotka, my auntie. When you pass the turnstiles on the St. Petersburg or Moscow metros without paying, there’s not a siren sound, as in New York, but a frantic chirping, as if you’d just trod on some creature’s nest. In Russia the windshield wiper on your car isn’t called a mechanical name—it’s a dvornik, a word whose more common meaning is “custodian.” What we call a speed bump in America the Russians call lezhashchii politseiskii, which means “lyingdown policeman.”",

Cognizant of my dwindling oxygen reserves, however, I left everything in my pack and stayed on top of the world just long enough to fire off four quick shots of Andy Harris and Anatoli Boukreev posing in front of the summit survey marker. Then I turned to descend. About twenty yards below the summit I passed Neal Beidleman and a client of Fischer’s named Martin Adams on their way up. After exchanging a high five with Neal, I grabbed a handful of small stones from a wind-scoured patch of exposed shale, zipped the souvenirs into the pocket of my down suit, and hastened down the ridge.",

Each on the opposing hemisphere of his own pole looked out across the spinning orbit of this vexed, tormented world, and at the other, and what each saw, the picture that each got, was very much the same. We not only saw the stupidity and the folly and the gullibility and the self-deception of man, but we saw his nobility, courage, and aspiration, too. We saw the wolves that preyed upon him and laid him waste--the wild scavangers of greed, of fear, of privilege, of power, of tyranny, of oppression, of poverty and disease, of injustice, cruelty, and wrong--Land in what we saw of this as well, dear Fox, we were agreed.",

    "target_paragraph": "Because historically there was little interconnection between the Dales—most of them are long winding dead ends between steep hills—they retain a snug air of self-containment, which I like very much. I remember when we first moved to our little valley, Malhamdale, a car overturned one morning in the road outside our gate with a frightful bang and a noise of scraping metal. The driver, it turned out, had clipped a grass bank and run up against a field wall, which had flipped the car onto its roof. I rushed out to find a neighboring farmer’s wife hanging upside down by her seatbelt, bleeding gently from a scalp wound, and muttering dazed sentiments along the lines of having to get to the dentist and that this wouldn’t do at all. While I was hopping around and making hyperventilating noises, two farmers arrived in Land Rovers and unhurriedly climbed out. As if they had been practicing for this moment for years, they gently hauled the lady from the car and sat her down on a rock. Then they righted the crumpled car and maneuvered it out of the way. Then, while one of them took the lady off to his house to have a cup of tea and get her head seen to by his missus, the other scattered sawdust on an oil slick, directed traffic for a minute till the road was clear, then winked at me and climbed into his Land Rover and drove off. The whole thing was over in less than five minutes and never involved the police or ambulance services or even a doctor. An hour or so later another farmer came along with a tractor and hauled the car away, and it was as if it had never happened. It’s another world, you see.",

He walked bare footed across the flagstones of the terrace to the room at the far end of the long house and went in and sat down at the table where he worked. The windows had been open overnight and the room was cool and full of early morning promise.\nHe was writing about the road from Madrid to Zaragossa and the rising and falling of the road as they came at speed into the country of the red buttes and the little car on the then dusty road picked up the Express train and Catherine passed it gently car by car, the tender, and then the engineer and fireman, and finally the nose of the engine, and then she shifted as the road switched left and the train disappeared into a tunnel.\n“I had it,” she had said. “But it went to ground. Tell me if I can get it again.”\nHe had looked at the Michelin map and said, “Not for a while.”\n“I’ll let it go then and we’ll see the country.” As the road climbed there were poplar trees along the river and the road climbed steeply and he felt the car accept it and then Catherine shift again happily as it flattened the steep grade.\nLater, when he heard her voice in the garden, he stopped writing. He locked the suitcase with the cahiers of manuscript and went out locking the door after him. The girl would use the pass key to clean the room.\nCatherine was sitting at breakfast on the terrace. There was a red-and-white checked cloth on the table. She wore her old Grau du Roi striped shirt fresh-washed and shrunk now and much faded, new gray flannel slacks, and espadrilles.\n“Hello,” she said. “I couldn’t sleep late.”\n“You look lovely.”\n“Thank you. I feel lovely.”\n“Where did you get those slacks?”\n“I had them made in Nice. By a good tailor. Are they all right?”\n“They’re very well cut. They just look new. Are you going to wear them into town?”\n“Not town. Cannes in the off season. Everybody will next year. People are wearing our shirts now. They’re no good with skirts. You don’t mind do you?”\n“Not at all. They look right. They just looked so well creased.”\nAfter breakfast while David shaved and showered and then pulled on a pair of old flannels and a fisherman’s shirt and found his espadrilles Catherine put on a blue linen shirt with an open collar and a heavy white linen skirt.\n“We’re better this way. Even if the slacks are right for here they’re too show-off for this morning. We’ll save them.”",

They are also pulling down the bazaar, and replacing it by a series of little piazzas for the different trades. This really is an improvement.

Yet the overwhelming feature of his childhood was its loneliness. Often, he recalls, he would go out onto the rooftop of his palace and watch the other little boys of Lhasa playing in the street. Every time his brother left, he recalls standing “at the window, watching, my heart full of sorrow as he disappeared into the distance.”",

Altar boys lounge on the steps leading to the altar, while Puccio and Paola, Paola's face innocent of makeup, exchange the vows that will bind them, divorce laws notwithstanding, in one fashion or another for life.",
