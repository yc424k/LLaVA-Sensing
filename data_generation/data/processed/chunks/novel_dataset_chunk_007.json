As we cruised along slowly I attempted to work out our position in relation to my route last week – but this was surprisingly difficult, for a landscape seen from half-a-mile offshore looks strangely unlike the same landscape seen from the middle, as it were. However, that ghastly semi-swamp put me right and at 2.30 we slid quietly into the wide bay. The crew refused to go close to the unfamiliar coastline, so a tiny life-boat was put down and we were rowed ashore in four groups.",

Then, the downward motion we picture when we hear the word chop, a vertical blow akin to the board-breaking karate move. The blade hit the trunk straight on, bounced off lamely, just missing my shin. I tried this a few times, putting more muscle into it, until the pure ineffectuality of the whole thing stopped me short. I looked to Reba.

A pair of jaybirds came up from nowhere, whirled up on the blast like gaudy scraps of cloth or paper and lodged in the mulberries, where they swung in raucous tilt and recover, screaming into the wind that ripped their harsh cries onward and away like scraps of paper or of cloth in turn. Then three more joined them and they swung and tilted in the wrung branches for a time, screaming. The door of the cabin opened and Dilsey emerged once more, this time in a man’s felt hat and an army overcoat, beneath the frayed skirts of which her blue gingham dress fell in uneven balloonings, streaming too about her as she crossed the yard and mounted the steps to the kitchen door.",

I tore out a few pages and shoved them under the twigs. It was easy to get a blaze going. In no time the larger branches caught fire as well. The fire provided both warmth and light.",

For if some bilious hyper-civilized stranger were its author, the sentiments might pass. But coming from a native, to what depths of morbid discontent do they testify! Considering the recent progress of these regions that has led to a security and prosperity formerly undreamed of, one is driven to the conjecture that these words can only have been penned by some cantankerous churl of an emigrant returning to his native land after an easeful life in New York and compelled—“for his sins,” as he would put it—to reside at the “Hotel Vittoria.”\nTowards that delectable hostelry I now turned, somewhat regretfully, to face a bedroom whose appearance had already inspired me with anything but confidence. But hardly were the preliminary investigations begun, when a furious noise in the street below drew me to the window once more. Half the town was passing underneath in thronged procession, with lighted torches and flags, headed by the municipal band discoursing martial strains of music.\nWhither wending, at this midnight hour?\nTo honour a young student, native of the place, now returning up the Rossano road from Naples, where he had distinguished himself prominently in some examination. I joined the crowd, and presently we were met by a small carriage whence there emerged a pallid and frail adolescent with burning eyes, who was borne aloft in triumph and cheered with that vociferous, masculine heartiness which we Englishmen reserve for our popular prize-fighters. And this in the classic land of brigandage and bloodshed!\nThe intellectual under-current. . . .\nIt was an apt commentary on my _graffito._ And another, more personally poignant, not to say piquant, was soon to follow: the bed. But no. I will say nothing about the bed, nothing whatever; nothing beyond this, that it yielded an entomological harvest which surpassed my wildest expectations.",

The road he followed had once been a major Inca thoroughfare; Francisco Pizarro, the wily Spanish conqueror of Peru, had endured its roller-coaster climbs and descents on his way to the Inca empire’s capital. As it often does near Cusco, the topography transformed almost immediately. “The trail, a rocky stairway not unlike the bed of a mountain torrent, led us rapidly into a warm tropical region whose dense foliage and tangled vines were grateful enough after the bleak mountain plateau,” Bingham wrote. “Parti-colored lantanas ran riot through a maze of agaves and hungry creepers. We had entered a new world.”",

Until the fortifications of Singapore in the 1930s the naval dockyard at Victoria was the Navy’s only first-class repair base east of Malta. Hong Kong would not have been Hong Kong without the Navy then, for not only was it one of the colony’s chief employers, it also set the social pace. An invitation to Government House might be the grandest, a taipan’s dinner-table might be the most luxurious, but there was no party like a party on the Commodore’s Receiving Ship, all white awnings and fairy-lights at its mooring in the harbour, and no ball like a naval ball, when the most elaborate and ingenious decorations enlivened City Hall, and there was always a new batch of spirited young officers to keep things going.",

Really, Mr. Ramy had not deceived them. Clumps of dielytra and daylilies bloomed behind the paling, and a crooked elm hung romantically over the gable of the house.",

A few months after this setback, the idea of an Army career, which had been floating mistily in the air for some time, began to take firmer shape; and the prospect of entering Sandhurst raised its distant hurdle. But what about the sack? When he was appealed to, my ex-housemaster, a strange and brilliant man, composed and despatched the necessary letter of recommendation; and, like the Captain’s, it was a corking good letter, too. (There were no bitter feelings; there had been disappointment on the side of the school authorities as well as relief; utter dejection on mine. But I felt thankful they had alighted on more avowable grounds for my eclipse than the charge of being an intolerable nuisance. The actual pretext could be made to sound dashing and romantic.)",

He had not bought himself a substitute because he liked imagining the one he had lost in the battle of Alabama to be irreplaceable. There seemed to be some heavenly support beneath his shoulder blades that lifted his feet from the ground in ecstatic suspension, as if he secretly enjoyed the ability to fly but was walking as a compromise to convention. Green gold under the moon, his hair lay in Cellinian frescos and fashionable porticoes over his dented brow. Two hollows over his eyes like the ends of mysterious bolts of fantasy held those expanses of electric blue to the inspiration of his face. The pressure of masculine beauty equilibrated for twenty-two years had made his movements conscious and economized as the steps of a savage transporting a heavy load of rocks on his head. He was thinking to himself that he would never be able to say to a taxi-driver “Number five Beggs Street” again without making the ride with the ghost of Captain Farreleigh.",

I’ve sat at campsites watching every kind of nature in my outdoorsy life, but this is something completely new to me. Volcan Fuego erupts most mornings and many evenings that we’re there. I usually wake up at sunrise to the incredible view out my window and a clear blue sky, except for a big plume of smoke coming out of Fuego, which slowly dissipates over the course of the morning. And in the evenings, John and I sit outside in the cool air, totally mesmerized by the orange glow at the top of the volcano in the distance. We watch the orange smear of light growing and shrinking as lava spills out of the volcano and cools as it runs down the sides.",

The Great Hungarian Plain – the Alföld, in Magyar – is the westernmost steppe in Europe, a last outpost of the Pontic and Caspian wastes. Influenced by pictures of the wilder Hortobágy a hundred miles further east, I was disappointed at first to see ploughland and fields green with young wheat and a taller crop with pointed pale green leaves which turned out to be Indian corn; there were rows of tobacco plants, then orchards and farms set about with trees, and the plain between these tracts of husbandry was dotted with herds. Sheep and swine and troops of cattle grazed across the middle distance, with a village every few miles. The one I had been warned about was Alberti-Irsa; this was the difficult stretch. Malek tried to turn down a track which led to a gateway and outbuildings and barns, with a glimpse beyond them of a château half-hidden among trees, where his own stable beckoned. When I insisted on going straight on, there were aggrieved backward glances; I knew other horses were at grass there but his passionate whinny went unanswered – perhaps the groom had led them out of earshot – and after a brief tug of wills we were clip-clopping along as briskly as before.",

The rolling terrain of southern and central Oregon was not difficult, but it was rather monotonous. Ridge, lake, plain, lake . . . I knew that it wasn’t far to my intended campsite near Charlton Lake, but the viewless, predominantly coniferous woods made it seem like an eternity.

As in festival scenes of Sicilian films, colorful, decorative bedspreads were hung from the balconies of the prestigious apartments above il Corso’s ground floor stores. My hosts chose a lovely nineteenth-century, emerald green silk brocade. Their home was equally elegant, with beautifully restored hand-painted ceilings, gilded antique furniture, and a stunning crystal chandelier in the salon that overlooked il Corso. For my first procession, I was lucky to have such a fine view from their corner apartment’s wrap-around balcony, and as a cool refreshment on the hot, Indian summer day, my hosts offered large, silver platters overflowing with mounds of miniature ice cream cones, sold in combination pastry and gelato shops throughout the city.",

The move would be difficult in their emaciated condition, as would building the structure. But the place was less exposed to the elements than the barren coastline of Cape Waring; it was tucked into a little canyon protected from the wind, and Kuraluk was counting on bears and foxes moving through the narrow valley.",

There must have been sixty or more of these nicely done-up tables in all. And every single one of them was empty. Across the length and breadth of the entire cavernous space, not a single person was to be seen, but one: a wiry, middle-aged Asian in a tuxedo, greasy hair combed unhappily across his forehead. Seated on a stool atop a modest stage, he had an electric guitar in his arms and a large black box at his side.",

So I wrote to London with rough dates and addresses for the despatch of cash: this parasitic castle-life had left my funds comparatively intact, but I would be needing some soon. Meanwhile, the valley cast a strong counter-spell and random notions suggesting delay kept dropping out of the air. ‘If you stayed on,’ István said one morning, ‘we could go and shoot chamois;’ then, later, there would be stags; and, later still, bears. When I said I had never shot anything larger than a rabbit he said, ‘I’ll teach you.’ And then, what about fox-hunting with Baron Wesselenyi’s pack? I could manage that, except that I had no money. István smiled.",

Author Alexander McCall Smith said, “That we have the people we have in this life, rather than others, is miraculous . . . a miraculous gift.” Even here in Maine, some people were drawn to me?and me to them?but not others. It is as though we unconsciously recognize those who have potential to connect with, and understand, our deepest feelings. This bond cannot be rushed; it happens with the passage of time and shared experience. And some pairings will fall away as both parties learn that the fit is imperfect. But those who stay give us gifts that can be achieved by nothing else in life. And when they are taken from us, they leave a permanent particle of themselves in our brain. The intimacy of my long-time companions inevitably led me to remember those who, though once close, were left behind . . .",

The bathroom, to the left of the entrance door, was a windowless cubby-hole with space for only one person to stand between bath, lavatory and hand-basin. The hallway, though not big enough to hold a bicycle, provided extra storage space for – in Tiberiu’s case – books.

Among the casualties was the Earl of Oxford, Robert de Vere, one of the many English fighting on the rebel side. More than two months of attack and counter-attack followed, until the ditches being dug by the rebels finally reached Maastricht’s defensive walls. A mine was detonated beneath the main rampart, blowing a large hole in the walls. The Spanish quickly entered into negotiations to surrender, providing the rebels with a crucial victory. By 1648, the Spaniards had little option but to formally recognise the independence of the separatist northern provinces. Meeting in northern Germany, delegates from the warring parties agreed the Peace of Munster, one of a series of treaties known collectively as the Treaty of Westphalia that ended the Thirty Years’ War. The seven United Provinces were definitively separated from the Spanish Crown, while the southern provinces (present-day Belgium) remained in Spanish hands. After decades of conflict, the Dutch struggle for independence was over.",
