A deep green lane led up to it, so rutty and grass-grown that the cousins, jumping from their bicycles, climbed it on foot. Upton pulled out a key, unlocked the padlock of the gate, and led the way in, followed by Vance and Laura Lou. The house, which was painted a dark brown, stood at the end of a short grass-grown drive, its front so veiled in the showering gold-green foliage of two ancient weeping willows that Vance could only catch, here and there, a hint of a steep roof, a jutting balcony, an aspiring turret. The façade, thus seen in trembling glimpses, as if it were as fluid as the trees, suggested vastness, fantasy, and secrecy. Green slopes of unmown grass, and heavy shrubberies of unpruned syringa and lilac, surrounded it; and beyond the view was closed in on all sides by trees and more trees. “An old house--this is the way an old house looks!” Vance thought.",

It told the story of how, some eighty years previously, one of my countrymen had travelled a similar route to me along the river in the opposite direction, making his way – as the book’s subtitle put it – On Foot to Constantinople: From the Hook of Holland to the Middle Danube.",

Leonora, with panic growing and with contrition very large in her heart, visited every one of the public rooms of the hotel—the dining-room, the lounge, the Schreibzimmer, the winter garden.* God knows what they wanted with a winter garden in an hotel that is only open from May till October. But there it was. And then Leonora ran—yes, she ran up the stairs—to see if Maisie had not returned to her rooms. She had determined to take that child right away from that hideous place. It seemed to her to be all unspeakable. I do not mean to say that she was not quite cool about it. Leonora was always Leonora. But the cold justice of the thing demanded that she should play the part of mother to this child who had come from the same convent. She figured it out to amount to that. She would leave Edward to Florence—and to me—and she would devote all her time to providing that child with an atmosphere of love until she could be returned to her poor young husband. It was naturally too late.",

He had no intention of abandoning his original exploration goals; they’d just need to be carried out differently. But the problem was he required resources that were aboard the Karluk, wherever it was. When Dr. Anderson inquired what Stefansson intended to do about the Karluk and its complement, Stefansson said coldly, “For good or ill, we’re evidently unable to affect the destiny of the Karluk in any way and so she was, in a sense, off our minds.” It was a cavalier, even cruel attitude, but coming from Stefansson, hardly surprising. He’d moved on, and his own present needs were all that mattered to him.",

When a minibus pulled into the car park one of the older men murmured urgently to a youngster, who swiftly caught the new arrivals as they disembarked. With the tourist industry hit hard by recent negative media attention, people whose livelihood depended on tourism for their daily bread could not afford to let a crumb slip through their fingers.\nAs we continued northwards, the luxuriant countryside dwindled away to a harsh, barren landscape of blazing white dust, sand, rocks and scrubby thorn trees. If ever there was an example of optimism over reality, it must surely be the Isiolo Lawn Tennis Association, whose office on the outskirts of the town bears the slogan ‘Dream of Excellence’. The association was formed in 2014 with the noble aim of introducing and developing lawn tennis recreational facilities in Isiolo County, to promote the growth of tennis as a sport to the highest level, as well as initiating schools tennis programmes in the county. Their mission is to mobilise local people to participate in sports for recreation, career development and for good health. It is an example of the indomitable spirit of the Kenyan people. They were not deterred from their dream of grass tennis courts despite the fact that there is not a single blade of greenery for as far as the eye can see. Whether they will flourish or wither away, who could tell, but they had support from the very top of the tennis tree – we had missed Roger Federer’s visit to the club by three weeks.\nAt Isiolo, gateway to Kenya’s Northern Frontier District, we stopped in a dusty street reminiscent of a film set from the Wild West, nothing more than a ragged collection of run-down buildings where not even tumbleweed tumbled. It is home to a large Somali community, handsome people who carry themselves proudly, but they were poorly dressed and emanated a quiet air of resignation and hopelessness. They stood watching us through narrowed eyes. ‘Put your cameras away,’ Vivien hissed. ‘Hide them.’",

The mall is large, full of mirrors, glass, escalators and high-end European designer stores and filled with a population similar to a mini-United Nations. Abaya-clad women glide around as if on wheels. Michelle and Danica decided to go incognito, completely decked out in abayas with niqabs to cover their faces, and just observe. Danica had a distinct strut to her walk, and after a few moments they were conscious of drawing stares, attention and general interest. Their attempt to “be” Saudi didn’t seem to be fooling anyone. No one paid a bit of attention to Michelle; she paced herself, quieted her energy and seemed to blend in. After a short chat, they decided they needed some strategy. Danica slowed down her gait, took smaller steps, gave up her strut and kept her arms still. Within a short time, they observed they were attracting less attention and diminished curiosity from the locals. After some practice they felt like they could meld into the population and disappear quite effectively.",

The sand was burned black. The wind was terrific. Fire creates wind, you know. The sky overhead was all afire. A piece of the roof of the Coopers’ house blew off, burning, and went a quarter of a mile through the air. It landed on a house and burned it up. Everybody thought the world was coming to an end, I guess. It looked like the heavens had lit up. We were all scared to death. We were all praying pretty hard. After the fire jumped through the town one time, the wind shifted and it started to come back. They say that a fire can’t go back over ground it has already crossed, but this one did. A neighbor and I stood here on the steps of the store and watched. ‘The town’s going,’ she said. ‘Let’s go for the lake.’ I said, ‘No, I’m going to stick.’”",

He wandered westward into Pennsylvania, eking out a dangerous living by matching fighting cocks against the champions of country barnyards, and often escaping after a night spent in a village jail, with his champion dead on the field of battle, without the clink of a coin in his pocket, and sometimes with the print of a farmer’s big knuckles on his reckless face. But he always escaped, and coming at length among the Dutch at harvest time he was so touched by the plenty of their land that he cast out his anchors there. Within a year he married a rugged young widow with a tidy farm who like all the other Dutch had been charmed by his air of travel, and his grandiose speech, particularly when he did Hamlet in the manner of the great Edmund Kean. Everyone said he should have been an actor.",

Moreover they were girls—and this was a fact which Grace Melbury’s delicate femininity could not lose sight of—whose parents Giles would have addressed with a deferential Sir or Madam. Beside this visioned scene the homely farmsteads did not quite hold their own from her present twenty-year point of survey. For all his woodland sequestration Giles knew the primitive simplicity of the subject he had started; and now sounded a deeper note.",

We got out and walked together on station platforms, enjoying the shock of heat after the air-conditioned carriage. We ate together. When we smoked I watched for other Sikhs. ‘I don’t mind, you understand,’ the Sikh said. ‘But I don’t want to hurt them.’ We talked of London and Trinidad and coffee-houses, India and the Sikhs. We agreed that the Sikhs were the finest people in India, but it was hard to find anyone among them whom he admired. I dredged my memory for Sikh notabilities. I mentioned one Sikh religious leader. ‘He’s a bloody Hindu,’ the Sikh said. I mentioned another. ‘He’s a damned Muslim.’ I spoke of politicians. He replied with stories of their crookedness. ‘The man had lost the election. And then suddenly you had these people running up with ballot-boxes and saying, “Look, look, we forgot to count these.” ’ I spoke of the energy of the Sikhs and the prosperity of the Punjab. ‘Yes,’ he said. ‘The sweeper class is coming up.’ We talked of Sikh writers. I mentioned Khushwant Singh, whom I knew and liked; he had spent years working on Sikh scriptures and history. ‘Khushwant? He doesn’t know anything about the Sikhs.’ The only person who had written well about the Sikhs was Cunningham; and he was dead, as all the finest Sikhs were. ‘We’re a pretty hopeless bunch today,’ the Sikh said.",

Coffee is brewed everywhere, on street corners and unoccupied patches of pavement, on roving carts and in kettles under trees – but brewed in milk that cloys. In South India, cooling hot coffee involves a highly skilled process of pouring the liquid between a tumbler and a metal dish, dragging and stretching the stream into arcs. Preparing coffee is an art form, so ordering it without milk or sugar prompted baffled looks, but started a game in restaurants called Coffee Roulette. When it was ordered all bets were placed on black, but it usually turned up white, extra white, extra sugary; and on those rare occasions when the contents were black, it usually turned out to be tea. At desperate times a Kenco-filled EpiPen would have been useful to jab Passepartout in the arm.",

And when I opened The Times of India (“Invitation price: 2 rupees,” it declares, inscrutably, on the cover), I found a whole section devoted to “matrimonial notices,” in which prospective brides were glowingly described as “homely” and “artful” and “wheat-coloured” (which, in the crazed logic of Indian English, means domestically minded, culturally inclined, and fair-skinned). Even at Hare Krishna Land, the center of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, the sign at the entrance extolled its guru’s “large propaganda program” and, inside, in the center’s school, a smaller board offered tips on “Blooming Manners.”",

For the last fifteen years he had been in receipt of large annual retaining fees from the principal commercial firms of the country; that of one shipping company alone amounted to fifty thousand francs. They found it worth their while since, without doing a stroke of work for them, he gave his tacit support to their most nefarious undertakings. A useful man! As a lawyer in private cases his reputation was tremendous. Judges and juries had been known to faint with emotion at his dramatic gestures, his fiery eloquence. He could pull anybody out of a scrape. Wherever he spoke the Court was crowded to listen to his impassioned arguments, to look upon the cold fire of his blue eyes, his carefully adjusted dress, his fair hair turning to grey, his smooth face which he kept shaven for no other reason—so he used to declare—than because he reverenced the fashions of the old papal regime. \"Just like an Englishman,\" people said.",

He was born and raised in Manhattan, but he lived for a critical adolescent surfer-development period on the Jersey Shore, and he’s consummately at home on Long Island. In fact, Movin’ Out is a musical about blue-collar kids on Long Island, set to Billy Joel tunes. Selya played a prom-king type, Eddie, who ships out to Vietnam and comes home damaged. Heavily muscled, high-strung, charismatic, not tall, he looked the part, and became the character, and his dancing shot out the lights. When we first met, he asked if I knew the New Yorker’s dance critic, Arlene Croce. I didn’t. “I gotta put that lady on my payroll,” he muttered. I looked up her review of Movin’ Out. It called him “an utterly remarkable dancer.” Selya had spent much of his career at American Ballet Theatre, initially under the direction of Mikhail Baryshnikov, before moving to Broadway. He still had the ballet dancer’s duckwalk. I noticed that in an interview with the New York Times, he compared dancing and surfing. With music as with waves, he said, you are “yielding to something more powerful than yourself.” I thought he had that right.",

He stretched out on the rug beside his bed, placed the barrel of his shotgun in his mouth and then pulled the trigger.’ Later, an unwitting Irish officer was sent to the training school for tuition in Burmese. He came to stay at the mess, and was housed in this end bedroom. On his first morning, he turned up groggy for breakfast after a sleepless night. Just as he had fallen asleep, he told the other officers, he had been awoken by a nightmare in which a man lay down on the floor beside the bed, put a shotgun to his mouth, and pulled the trigger.",

    "target_paragraph": "The sorrows of childhood are mercifully passing, for it is only when maturity has rendered soil mellow that grief will root very deeply. Stephen’s grief for Collins, in spite of its violence, or perhaps because of that very violence, wore itself out like a passing tempest and was all but spent by the autumn. By Christmas, the gusts when they came were quite gentle, rousing nothing more disturbing than a faint melancholy—by Christmas it required quite an effort to recapture the charm of Collins.\nStephen was nonplussed and rather uneasy; to have loved so greatly and now to forget! It made her feel childish and horribly silly, as though she had cried over cutting her finger. As on all grave occasions, she considered the Lord, remembering His love for miserable sinners:\nTeach me to love Collins Your way,’ prayed Stephen, trying hard to squeeze out some tears in the process, ‘teach me to love her ‘cause she’s mean and unkind and won’t be a proper sinner that repenteth.’ But the tears would not come, nor was prayer what it had been; it lacked something—she no longer sweated when she prayed.\nThen an awful thing happened, the maid’s image was fading, and try as she would Stephen could not recall certain passing expressions that had erstwhile allured her. Now she could not see Collins’ face at all dearly even if she willed very hard in the dark. Thoroughly disgruntled, she bethought her of books, books of fairy tales, hitherto not much in favour, especially of those that treated of spells, incantations and other unlawful proceedings. She even requested the surprised Mrs. Bingham to read from the Bible:\n‘You know where,’ coaxed Stephen, ‘it’s the place they were reading in church last Sunday, about Saul and a witch with a name like Edna—the place where she makes some person come up, ‘cause the king had forgotten what he looked like.’\nBut if prayer bad failed Stephen, her spells also failed her; indeed they behaved as spells do when said backwards, making her see, not the person she wished to, but a creature entirely different. For Collins now had a most serious rival, one who had lately appeared at the stables. He was not possessed of a real housemaid’s knee, but instead, of four deeply thrilling brown legs—he was two up on legs and one up on a tail, which was rather unfair on Collins! that Christmas, when Stephen was eight years old, Sir Philip had bought her a hefty bay pony; she was learning to ride him, could ride him already, being naturally skilful and fearless. There had been quite a heated discussion with Anna, because Stephen had insisted on riding astride. In this she had shown herself very refractory, falling off every time she tried the side-saddle—quite obvious, of course, this falling-off process, but enough to subjugate Anna.\nAnd now Stephen would spend long hours at the stables, swaggering largely in corduroy breeches, hobnobbing with Williams, the old stud groom, who had a soft place in his heart for the child.\nShe would say: ‘Come up, horse!’ in the same tone as Williams; or, pretending to a knowledge she was far from possessing: ‘Is that fetlock a bit puffy? It looks to me puffy; supposing we put on a nice wet bandage.’\nThen Williams would rub his rough chin as though thinking: ‘Maybe yes—maybe no—’ he would temporize, wisely.\nShe grew to adore the smell of the stables; it was far more enticing than Collins’ perfume—the Erasmic she had used on her afternoons out, and which had once smelt so delicious. And the pony! So strong, so entirely fulfilling, with his round, gentle eyes, and his heart big with courage—he was surely more worthy of worship than Collins, who had treated you badly because of the footman! And yet—and yet—you owed something to Collins, just because you had loved her, though you couldn’t any more. It was dreadfully worrying, all this hard thinking, when you wished to enjoy a new pony! Stephen would stand there rubbing her chin in an almost exact imitation of Williams. She could not produce the same scrabby sound, but in spite of this drawback, the movement would soothe her.\nThen one morning she had a bright inspiration: ‘Come up, horse!’ she commanded, slapping the pony. ‘Come up, horse, and let me get close to your ear, ‘cause I’m going to whisper something dreadfully important.’ Laying her cheek against his firm neck, she said softly: ‘You’re not you any more, you’re Collins!’\nSo Collins was comfortably transmigrated. It was Stephen’s last effort to remember.",

The Serious Crime Group is chiefly concerned with Triads, and employs 200 detectives, it is said, to observe and infiltrate the societies. The Special Branch is a political police force, concerned sometimes with Communist activities, sometimes with Kuomintang: its senior officers are nearly all British, Chinese preferring not to run the risks of reprisals after 1997. The run-of-the-mill force is never out of sight for long. Everywhere smooth-faced, robotic Chinese constables are riding about on immaculate motor bikes, sailing about in motor launches or signing the patrol books which are sometimes to be seen, unaccountably ignored by vandals, hanging from nails in public places. They are no doubt still corruptible on occasion, but look unforgivingly correct; one reads constantly of unauthorized market-stalls forcibly removed, unlicensed hawkers fined, and one can hardly look out across the waters of Hong Kong without seeing a police boat stop a passing sampan for inspection.",

Very good. It was good. The first few times we dated, it was … good.’\n\nGood, I wrote in my notebook.",

One interesting figure glimmers for a moment among these transplanted Dacians a hundred years after Aurelian’s evacuation south of the Danube: the remarkable St Nicetas of Remesiana (now Bela Palanka, in Serbia) who is the author not only of the Te Deum – which was wrongly attributed until early this century to SS Ambrose and Augustine – but also of a clause in the Apostles’ Creed. He was a friend of Paulinus of Nola who wrote an ode to him in sapphics when he visited him in south Italy; this sets him at only one remove from Ausonius and Roman Bordeaux. Then the dark swallows up this twilight beacon.",

Perhaps a thousand years before, the dark-skinned Dravidians of lowland India had been overcome by nomad Aryans from the Asian steppes who were bearing their creed of sky gods, wind, and light across Eurasia.2 Aryan concepts were contained in their Sanskrit Vedas, or knowledge—ancient texts of unknown origin which include the Rig Veda and the Upanishads and were to become the base of the Hindu religion. To the wandering ascetic named Sakyamuni, such epic preachments on the nature of the Universe and Man were useless as a cure for human suffering. In what became known as the Four Noble Truths, Sakyamuni perceived that man’s existence is inseparable from sorrow; that the cause of suffering is craving; that peace is attained by extinguishing craving; that this liberation may be brought about by following the Eight-fold Path: right attention to one’s understanding, intentions, speech, and actions; right livelihood, effort, mindfulness; right concentration, by which is meant the unification of the self through sitting yoga.",

Up went the rooks and down again, rising in lesser numbers each time as the sager birds made ready to settle, for the evening was already spent enough to make the air inside the wood almost dark. The moss was soft; the tree-trunks spectral. Beyond them lay a silvery meadow. The pampas grass raised its feathery spears from mounds of green at the end of the meadow. A breadth of water gleamed. Already the convolvulus moth was spinning over the flowers. Orange and purple, nasturtium and cherry pie, were washed into the twilight, but the tobacco plant and the passion flower, over which the great moth spun, were white as china. The rooks creaked their wings together on the tree-tops, and were settling down for sleep when, far off, a familiar sound shook and trembled—increased—fairly dinned in their ears—scared sleepy wings into the air again—the dinner bell at the house.",

Mosquito netting is strange stuff: while not actually having any holes, it always seems to let some mosquitoes in. In the end, as a result of the mosquito problem, I finally put up glass doors against the garden, installed air-conditioning and effectively divided inside from outside. However, one hundred and fifty years have passed since Tenmangu was moved to its present spot, and as the result of a succession of typhoons and earthquakes, all the pillars lean and there is not a single right angle in the entire house. Insects manage to find a way through the gaps, and I don’t think Tenmangu will ever be completely liberated from them.",

But no extremes of temperature, in my book, means that it is never, ever warm. In summer, when I visited, people were complaining of a heat wave when the temperature hit a chilly 54°; by early fall, bitter winds were whipping through the silent streets, slapping my face and almost knocking me off my feet.

One of the women is about to hurl a rock at her to bring her down. She is running with her eyes closed and a strange half-smile on her lips. Despite the dreamy repose of her face, her body is straining to hurl her along at top speed. The only explanation for this contrast is that she is enjoying the release that wild flight gives in much the same way that a game bird must when, after hiding for several tense minutes, it bursts from cover in complete, unthinking panic.",

On the far side and at the far end of the lake, the land rose in high rocks, studded with candelabra cactus. The water was very blue, marshy by the shore. I ate sandwiches and listened to the silence beneath the steady insect hum of Africa and thought perhaps I was going to have daily attacks of happiness because here it came again, the sensation of being airborne. Canaries flew in shoals through the fever trees, and bigger yellow birds, possibly weavers. Doves sang their sweet mournful song. Those coloured flashes in the leaves might be bee-eaters or sunbirds. So much to see, so much to learn, and no help at hand except the Field Guide to the National Parks. At least I could identify the diminutive antelopes as Kirk’s dikdik and finished my lunch and weighed the dampness on my bottom against the pleasure of a cigarette here, lit the cigarette and watched a parade of greyish monkeys cavort among the treetops.",
