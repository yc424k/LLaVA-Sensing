He realized that his host was different from the artist type he had hitherto encountered; more profound, more veracious. Already he formed the project of returning to listen to his melodious voice, and learn some more about that Hellenic life which had hitherto been a sealed book to him. Nobody every spoke to him after the Count's fashion. He contrasted his address with the bantering, half-apologetic, supercilious tone of those other elderly persons who had heretofore deigned to enlightened him. He was flattered and pleased at being taken seriously and bidden to think in this straightforward, manly fashion; it unstrung his reserve and medicined to his wounded self-respect.",

There was another heirloom of the old Bohemian kings hard by the cathedral: the church of St George, whose baroque carapace masked a Romanesque church of great purity. The round arches that we call Norman plunged through bare and massive walls, flat beams bore up the ceiling; and a slim, gilt mediaeval St George gleamed in the apse as he cantered his charger over the dragon’s lanced and coiling throes. He reminded me of that debonair stone banneret at Ybbs. It was the first Romanesque building I had seen since those faintly remembered Rhenish towns between Christmas and the New Year.",

Large tents full of cots were set up on the lawn, along with a few trailers of varying size. Hikers milled around a large campfire pit at the center of the space. A herd of small dogs bounded toward me, barking a greeting I was certain they delivered to every hiker that came through. The other hikers and the handful of volunteers looked at me. I suddenly felt conspicuous, tentative, shy. Being around people had always been stressful for me and more so now, after days of solitude in the desert. I hadn’t seen Jeff and Donna Saufley since 2005, but as I scanned the faces turned my way I recognized Jeff’s face immediately. A little less hair than last time, but still Jeff. He greeted me warmly and I felt my anxiety lessen, reassured that this was a safe place full of love for wayfaring hikers.",

    "target_paragraph": "Despite the altitude (11,700 feet) this whole settlement reeks of no sanitation. School had just ended and all ninety-eight pupils silently followed us – at a little distance, looking apprehensive as well as curious – while we wandered along narrow lanes of humpy beaten earth, seeking THE SHOP. It was down three steep steps from the ‘street’ and at first we could see nothing; the children were filling the doorway and pressing close to the tiny window. The shopkeeper – a mestizo miner’s wife, young and sad-faced and gentle – explained that we were her first gringo customers and was heart-breakingly apologetic about her stock. She had only sugar and noodles for sale. Rachel’s keen eye then discerned a solitary slab of chocolate, but on being opened it disintegrated. Nor was there any cerveza, only rum and coke. Rachel had two cokes; I had two treble-rums and the effect was sensational on a totally empty stomach. I tentatively wondered about torch-batteries …? A large box was taken from a top shelf but when opened it contained only one unrecognisable mangled lump. Those batteries, like the chocolate, were the victims of age and damp. Miners on £5.28 a week don’t buy such things. As we drank, Señora disappeared for a moment and returned with her daughter. Our eyes had then become used to the gloom and we were quite overwhelmed by the beauty of this toddler, a Dresden ornament sitting on the edge of the counter gravely regarding us with lustrous brown eyes.

It reminds me of torch holders in Siena and Gubbio. We ask for an estimate to repair the cancello, also for an estimate for a new gate, rather simple but with a running form similar to the iron stair railing in the house, maybe a sun shape at the top closing, to go with the house’s name.

The mule was munching in stable, or stamping and nuzzling its empty manger, or asleep standing, boding not of tomorrow; and against the firelight many shadows moved. The negroes had gathered now: old men and women sitting on crackling cushions of cane about the blaze which one of their number fed with pressed stalks until its incense-laden fury swirled licking at the boughs overhead, making more golden still the twinkling golden leaves; and young men and girls, and children squatting and still as animals, staring into the fire. Sometimes they sang—quavering, wordless chords in which plaintive minors blent with mellow bass in immemorial and sad suspense, their grave dark faces bent to the flames and with no motion of lips. But when the white folks arrived the singing ceased, and they sat or lay about the fire on which the blackened pot simmered, talking in broken murmurous overtones ready with sorrowful mirth, while in shadowy beds among the dry whispering canestalks youths and girls murmured and giggled.",

Canberra is a place where nothing plays except the fountains—it has the haunting quietness of a de Chirico landscape of long shadows and lonely colonnades, a Lonely Place institutionalized. Yet at the same time, there is no denying the beauty of this Forest Lawn of designer splendor, its clean horizons undisturbed even by TV antennae or garden fences (both of which are banned). And the sense of uncreatedness that informs much of Australia here finds its pinnacle in the spacey new Parliament House. Its seats prettily designed in the pale greens and pinks of gum trees, its chambers flooded with natural light, the new center of government looks like nothing so much as another of the country’s sparkling new hotels.",

Proponents of the little red pepper, cancarillo, pipazzu, pipi vruscente and diavulillo in various regional dialects, have praised its many health benefits for centuries. Thus, in the Italian region renowned for its production of the peperoncino and in particular the yield from the Tyrrhenian coast between Amantea and Diamante, I found its consumption in light of its beneficial properties with regard to the cardiovascular system completely appropriate to my total body cure. A discriminating bar of dark chocolate with overtones of spicy peperoncino made a great snack to bolster oneself between treatments.",

Sometimes it was Marie, freshly back from Paris or London, loaded with books; or Ines with her falcon’s beauty strumming the guitar and singing some magical passage from flamenco; or Sir Harry gravely discoursing on chapters in Cyprus history which lay outside the dull dusty present – the severed head of Oneseilos buzzing with honey­bees, or Berengaria being crowned in Limassol, or that odd King of Neo-Paphos who invented an early form of fan by anointing himself with Tyrian oil, which his doves adored, in order that their fluttering wings should keep him cool during meals.",

Devils Tower was the mountain used by Steven Spielberg in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the one on which the aliens landed. It is so singular and extraordinary that you cannot imagine what Spielberg would have used as an alternative if it hadn’t been available. You can see it long before you get to it, but as you draw nearer the scale of it becomes really quite awesome. It is a flat-topped cone of rock 850 feet high, soaring out of an otherwise featureless plain. The scientific explanation is that it was a volcanic fluke – an outsized lump of warm rock that shot out of the earth and then cooled into its present arresting shape. In the moonlight it is said to glow, though even now on a wet Sunday morning with smoky clouds brushing across its summit it looked decidedly supernatural, as if it were placed there aeons ago for the eventual use of aliens. I only hope that when they do come they don’t expect to eat out.",

Both the nineteenth-century and the twentieth-century prisoners had essentially the same tools—-shovels, picks, wheelbarrows. And after he finally got out of the Kolyma, Shalamov wrote, “I read memoirs of persons who had been sent to exile in Siberia under the czars. I found their escapes from Yakutia and Verkhoyansk bitterly disappointing: a sleigh-ride with horses hitched nose to tail, arrival at the train station, purchase of a ticket at the ticket window . . . I could never understand why this was called an ‘escape.’ ”",

Almost no one else surfed it in the early morning, which made it a good time to explore the main takeoff area. I began to learn the tricky, fast, shallow sections, and the soft spots where a quick cutback was needed to keep a ride going. Even on a waist-high, blown-out day, it was possible to milk certain waves for long, improvised, thoroughly satisfying rides. The reef had a thousand quirks, which changed quickly with the tide. And when the inshore channel began to turn a milky turquoise—a color not unlike some of the Hawaiian fantasy waves in the mags—it meant, I came to know, that the sun had risen to the point where I should head in for breakfast. If the tide was extra low, leaving the lagoon too shallow to paddle, I learned to allow more time for trudging home on the soft, coarse sand, struggling to keep my board’s nose pointed into the wind.",
