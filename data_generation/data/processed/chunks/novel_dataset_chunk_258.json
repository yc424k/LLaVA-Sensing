I ought to have attended to it and found out what it was.\"\nHe began walking up and down the room, turning on her again and again, making himself more and more excited.\n\"That translation of the Bacchae—what made you think of doing it like that?\"\n\"I'd been reading Walt Whitman—It showed me you could do without rhyme. I knew it must sound as if it was all spoken—chanted—that they mustn't sing. Then I thought perhaps that was the way to do it.\"\n\"Yes. Yes. It is the way to do it. The only way…. You see, that's what my Euripides book's about. The very thing I've been trying to ram down people's throats, for years.

Andalusian steel against weapons of wood, as native foot soldiers attacked armored horses in displays of courage and gallantry as quixotic and hopeless as would be the sacrifices of foot soldiers today taking on the full power of a modern tank. The Spaniards were merciless and cruel, not just by nature but by strategic design; their tactics had been conceived to shatter morale and leave their enemies psychologically broken. Through all of 1537 and the first months of 1538, Quesada and his force laid waste to the Muisca kingdom, defiling the temples, burning homes, violating the women. In desperation, native priests climbed to the highest mountain escarpments to fling their own newborns into the void as offerings for the Spaniards to eat, with the hope that such sacrifices might appease the anger of these devils that had descended from the sky to destroy their world.",

The forecast had showed a weather window – light airs, sunshine – but it was due to close in two days, with big westerlies blowing in. In a small open boat in big open seas, care needs to be taken. So another boat was sailing with us as our good shepherd: an ocean-going yacht called the Hebridean, which would keep a weather eye out for us.",

For seventy years – between the measuring of Everest, and the arrival of the reconnaissance expedition at its foot in 1921 – no Westerner got within forty miles of the mountain. There was a vacuum of information about Everest, and into this vacuum rushed hopes, fears and speculations. Undoubtedly, Everest’s inaccessibility helped to enhance its imaginative allure. In 1899 Lord Curzon, then Viceroy of India, gazed up at the white ramparts of the Himalaya from the windows of his cool and shadowed palace at Simla. Everest enchanted him. ‘As I sat daily in my room,’ he wrote, ‘and saw that range of snowy battlements uplifted against the sky, that huge palisade shutting off India from the rest of the world, I felt it should be the business of Englishmen, if of anybody, to reach the summit.’",

This time the news was all good: the work at Westmore was prospering, and on Justine's side there was a more cheerful report of Mr. Langhope's health, and—best of all—his promise to give them Cicely for the summer. Amherst and Justine were both anxious that the child should spend more time at Hanaford, that her young associations should begin to gather about Westmore; and Justine exulted in the fact that the suggestion had come from Mr. Langhope himself, while she and Amherst were still planning how to lead him up to it.",

Where to procure an explosive machine was, of course, quite another matter. The London Directory gave him no information on the point, and he felt that there was very little use in going to Scotland Yard about it, as they never seemed to know anything about the movements of the dynamite faction till after an explosion had taken place, and not much even then.",

I could tell how proud she was to show us how her job had helped pay for the extension and renovation of their little house. As we chatted, she looked dotingly at her younger siblings who were playing nearby, telling us how well they were doing at school?once again something her role at the hotel was facilitating. Ratha had an air of quiet confidence, and it was clear she had become the role model in her community. Other little girls looked up to her, and it made me realize just how important it was to support such positive and constructive initiatives.",

Don’t underestimate a question, such as, “Do you have enough gas in that thing?” The type of Italian accustomed to actually living the occasional scene that we find so colorful, amusing, or even poignant when viewed on the big screen doesn’t worry about a motorcycle running out of gas on the top of a snow-covered mountain on a late Sunday afternoon. And surprise, surprise, that blackberry doesn’t get a signal. Of course, finding yourself in such a predicament on the peak is certainly preferable to being stranded facing a long ascent. But as anyone who’s ever done the zigzags of a mountain road knows, it’s not always a straight shot down. For the periodic inclines, Fred Flintstone’s stone-age vehicle would be much better suited for the type of pedaling required. The people were shorter in those days and clearly wouldn’t have been able to reach the ground from the back seat of a motorcycle. I guess that’s why this film would have to be called An American in Calabria, as without a pair of long, northern European legs scurrying along from the back seat, the adventure might not have been quite as successful.",

Anna’s flat was on the ground floor of one of several oblong four-storey mini-blocs that fifteen years ago had replaced rows of village houses. The unlit alleyway approach to the rear flats – between two blocs – was so narrow that my hostess had to compress herself before squeezing through. Then we stumbled over rough slushy ground in total darkness, Anna leading me by the hand, and climbed six concrete steps – two perilously unstable – to a warped door leading into a minute hallway. There eighteen-year-old Bogdan, lanky and spotty and grinning from ear to ear, pumped my hand wordlessly while drawing me into an overheated bed-sitter; two divan double beds took up most of the floor space.",

While the other students toured Red Square, he and Cary walked to the Cuban embassy, where they were married in a binding civil ceremony. Zenaida had demanded that they be formally married. It was an old-fashioned attitude for revolutionary Cuba, but she knew from experience with Aristede that a common law marriage could be dissolved with nothing more than too much rum or a flirty smile. Despite the thousands of miles separating them, Cary dared not disobey her mother’s command. Besides, she had already decided that Pipo was the man for her. He was smart and kind, filled with kinetic energy and good humor. She also knew that his parents had been together for decades. She was determined to have a different kind of married life than her mother or her grandmother, who had raised their children on their own. Their friends arranged for them to have a private berth on the train back to Kiev, and once there, the couple threw a big wedding party. They even hired a local photographer, and when he put one of their photos in his studio window, local people who’d rarely seen black faces gawked at it.",

The huge public buildings made concrete the assertion of a will that was public, an ego that was only collective; their effect was to state inarguably that the sum of individuals was less than the whole of the state. Beijing thus appeared to be both imperial and impersonal: a city drafted by committee. And this in turn made for a curious disjunction: while the public world here seemed constructed on the epic scale, the private was on the miniature. The place seemed built not for people but for abstractions. The streets were huge, but virtually carless. The official buildings were enormous, but the sidewalk stalls were cramped. The bureaucratic monoliths were gargantuan and yet, by all accounts, private homes were smaller here than anywhere else in the world. Everything, in fact, was topsy-turvily scaled, right down, and up, to a system in which more than a thousand million people were ruled by one twinkling four foot eleven octogenarian who liked to remain behind the scenes. Beijing seemed a Brobdingnag peopled by Lilliputians.",

Then we were joined by Toni, one of their philology lecturers, and withdrew to the dreary restaurant of the Central Hotel – diametrically across the Square from the Continental – where all the food had run out and there was nothing to drink but an anonymous ‘fruit juice’. Both students were ‘high’ on the Proclamation, describing it as the first coherent plan for Rumania’s future. After ridding the Front of Communists, they saw as the next most crucial need a truly independent television station prepared not only to report events objectively but to undertake the political education of the populace. The Front, they asserted, was now manipulating the media, both nationally and internationally (especially national television), much more subtly and effectively than Ceausescu had ever done. The previous Sunday’s formidable ‘Proclamation Demo’, proving the strength of anti-Front feeling in Timisoara, had been all week cleverly misrepresented on television as a demand for Banat autonomy, led by subversive agitators in the pay of ‘foreign fascists’. (Banat autonomy is not of course even a fringe issue.)",

Abdul Ghiyas, still wearing his windproof suit and labouring under the delusion that he was a sergeant, produced green tea for us brewed as strong as the army sort, and very nasty it was. We both harboured a determination to reach the ridge and, if possible, the summit, that in retrospect I find unbelievable. Our drivers watched us go sadly and Abdul Ghiyas asked us what he should do if we failed to return. (All our impulses were to tell him to head a search party but this seemed unfair.) Apart from telling him to go home, it was difficult to know what to say. The air was full of the promise of disaster. I had not felt it so strongly since the day I embarked on what was to prove my last voyage in a submarine and the wardroom orderly had come running down the mole waving my unpaid bill.",

Dinner was scheduled to start at seven, but because of the confusion of such a mass of people all searching for the right chairs, it was nine o’clock before everyone was seated and serving could begin.

The mate still crouched on the hearth, the dull red fire-glow on his handsome face, patiently trying to roast the kid and poking it against the embers, he had heavy, strong limbs in his khaki clothes, but his hand that held the spit was brown and tender and sensitive, a real Mediterranean hand.

    "target_paragraph": "I enjoy this neolithic world where money is unimportant and all the objects in daily use have been made of mud, wood, stone, hides or horn. However, in one respect life may prove a trifle too neolithic tonight. Eight adults and three children live in this hut, which has a diameter of about eighteen feet, and as the twelfth inhabitant I’ll have to roll up like a hedgehog. In such a confined space my meagre kit seems to occupy an inordinate area, but when I suggested dumping it outside consternation ensued. So many people can live in one minute tukul only because they have no personal possessions, apart from their land, its products and their livestock. Every object here is communal – for storing and grinding grain, or for cooking and serving food. Despite the savage frost, there is not even any extra bedding; yet these people do suffer from the cold, which may be why they sleep in a crowd. I felt guilty about needing to sit near the fire, though wearing everything I’ve got, so after supper I moved away and wriggled into my flea-bag – a procedure which causes much astonished amusement in every compound.",

Before boarding the Saurashtra Mail, the nearest available option was at a wooden cart just outside the station, where a pyramid of apples gleamed like polished cricket balls. Once train 37 had begun to thunder into its five-hour journey to Dwarka, I moved into the doorway with a bottle of Aquafina and sat down to rinse my apples. Drumbeats and bell ringing came from the adjoining carriage, where pilgrims to Lord Krishna’s home were singing and clapping their way through the afternoon, tapping their thighs with the backs of their hands. The stretch to Dwarka was desolate and felt detached from the rest of the country. It had the pleasing serenity that foreign eyes searched for in Indian village life, but its calm belied ugly truths. Agricultural mechanisation and the government’s handing over of much of the land to industrialists had stripped many farmers of their livelihood. Production costs far exceeded revenue from produce, causing a decline in profits and a reported increase in farmer suicides, though Gujarat’s chief minister vehemently denied this was the case.",

I had just turned twenty-three, and still had no idea what I was going to do for a living on my return. I had a vague notion about making writing a career, although in what way, I couldn’t see. I wrote poetry, but knew that was a genre that was never going to support me, and I wasn’t sure if I could ever write anything else; fiction, for instance. Besides, I knew many Irish writers, and almost none of them earned enough to support themselves by writing alone, no matter what genre they worked in.",

A few days later, we randomly met two of the rappers/producers—whom I’ll call Yosvany and Dagoberto—on the street. Though they were missing the gold chains and Timberlands, they had other markings of their trade. Dagoberto wore a black beret and overcoat and walked with a carved wooden cane; Yosvany wore blue mirrored sunglasses and black cowboy boots. We invited them to lunch at Los Amigos, an especially good paladar in Vedado. (As in other family-owned and -operated restaurants, you dined right in Los Amigos’ living room, surrounded by photographs of the people serving you, and walked through someone’s bedroom to get to the bathroom.) Machi ordered us a criollo meal of fried chicken, plantains, french-fried potatoes, black beans, white rice, and a round of Cristal beer, and we asked about their music.",

Myriads of small suns danced before my eyes as I went along the edge of the stream to the seat round the oak in my spring garden, where I sat a little, looking at the morning from there, drinking it in in long breaths, and determining to think of nothing but just be happy. What a smell of freshly mown grass there was, and how the little heaps into which it had been raked the evening before sparkled with dewdrops as the sun caught them. And over there, how hot the poppies were already beginning to look—blazing back boldly in the face of the sun, flashing back fire for fire. I crossed the wet grass to the hammock under the beech on the lawn, and lay in it awhile trying to swing in time to the nightingale's tune; and then I walked round the ice-house to see how Goethe's corner looked at such an hour; and then I went down to the fir wood at the bottom of the garden where the light was slanting through green stems; and everywhere there was the same mystery, and emptiness, and wonder. When four o'clock drew near I set off home again, not desiring to meet gardeners and have my little hour of quiet talked about, still less my dressing-gown and slippers; so I picked a bunch of roses and hurried in, and just as I softly bolted the door, dreadfully afraid of being taken for a burglar, I heard the first water-cart of the day creaking round the corner. Fearfully I crept up to my room, and when I awoke at eight o'clock and saw the roses in a glass by my side, I remembered what had happened as though it had been years ago.",

About the bedroom bags and boxes gaped, and on the bed, on chairs, on the floor, were spread his clothes—jackets and trousers of all kinds and all individual as old friends. A servant moved about in the next room and he entered, but the man ignored him with silent and deft efficiency, and he went on to the window. The thin curtains stirred to a faint troubling exhalation of late spring. He put their gentle billowing aside and lit a cigarette and idly watched the match fall, its initial outward impulse fading into a wavering reluctance, as though space itself were languid in violation. Someone crossing the quad called up to him indistinguishably. He waved his hand vaguely in reply and sat on the window sill.",

    "target_paragraph": "Just before you turn off the road to go into camp, there’s a smokers’ hut. It’s called the fumador and inside are two hammocks strung between the beams. The roof is thatched and there are no walls, just spaces that look out on one side to the road and on the other to the jungle, which is so close the palm leaves poke through to tickle your face. Tom, Faustino’s friend, is passed out in one of the hammocks. He’s snoring loudly. In the other is another guy, complete with ubiquitous beard. He’s handsome, if you ignore the filth, and wiry. The end of his cigarette flares as he turns his head. His brownish-blond hair is too long. His beard almost reaches his chest and he’s got cutting blue eyes. He’s not wearing a shirt and sweat gleams in the hollow of his stomach.",
