In the Willow Trading Post one morning, a man in a baseball suit was tending bar, and people sitting on stools there were talking about the five acres they had bought for two thousand dollars and how they had recently been offered fifty thousand dollars but were waiting for seventy-five. “OUR COW IS DEAD,” said a sign above them. “WE DON’T NEED YOUR BULL.” Just up the track was another, somewhat newer sign: “WILLOW BROOK ESTATES, A QUALITY DEVELOPMENT BY LANDAK, INC.”",

The Bear had been involved in not only the dangerous and heroic rescue of Commander Greely and surviving members of the Lady Franklin Bay Expedition in 1884 but more recent relief efforts following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake as well. If any ship could make it through those waters, Bartlett figured it was the Bear. After spending time with Cochran, Bartlett was equally confident that “her master … was not afraid to put her in the ice.” Bartlett felt that Providence might once again have stepped in: “On the whole,” he wrote, “it seemed to me that it would be a matter of singular interest for the Bear to rescue the Karluk survivors as she had rescued the Greely party thirty years before, on the other side of the continent.”",

It is also clear that the lists of Romaic and Hellenic characteristics represent different strata as well as opposed principles. The Romaic list enumerates humbler traits. The Hellenic idiosyncrasy affects every degree of the Greek ladder but spreads more amply as the rungs mount and the Romaic heritage thins out. The Dilemma is not only a struggle between the Old and the New, but between the East against the West as well.",

But while the man on the island was oppressed by a bizarre sense of unreality affecting the very ground upon which he walked, the mind of the Capataz of the Cargadores turned alertly to the problem of future conduct. Nostromo’s faculties, working on parallel lines, enabled him to steer straight, to keep a lookout for Hermosa, near which he had to pass, and to try to imagine what would happen tomorrow in Sulaco. Tomorrow, or, as a matter of fact, today, since the dawn was not very far, Sotillo would find out in what way the treasure had gone. A gang of Cargadores had been employed in loading it into a railway truck from the Custom House storerooms, and running the truck on to the wharf. There would be arrests made, and certainly before noon Sotillo would know in what manner the silver had left Sulaco, and who it was that took it out.",

There were only five Fulmers; but at times they were like an army with banners, and their power of self-multiplication was equalled only by the manner in which they could dwindle, vanish, grow mute, and become as it were a single tumbled brown head bent over a book in some corner of the house in which nobody would ever have thought of hunting for them—and which, of course, were it the bonne's room in the attic, or the subterranean closet where the trunks were kept, had been singled out by them for that very reason.",

Yet the building still retains great dignity and power. This is especially so of the interior. Nothing, except perhaps Hagia Sophia, prepares one for the sheer scale of the vast, unsupported, heavenward-thrusting dome. It encloses an enormous space, far greater than one would expect from the outside. It dwarfs the observer.",

He led us first to the Plaza de la Libertad, the birthplace of the revolution. In Enrique’s telling you could almost hear the sound of the many hundreds of momposinos who gathered in the square on August 6, 1810, determined “to be free or to die,” a slogan that immediately brought to mind Lexington and Concord, and the patriots of another American revolution. Mompox became that day the first town and province in El Nuevo Reino de Granada to proclaim its absolute independence from Spain. Enrique’s eyes dampened at the thought. Xandra detected a tear on his cheek as he read the inscription on the base of the statue that is the centerpiece of the plaza, words attributed to Simón Bolívar: Si a Caracas debo la vida, a Mompós debo la gloria. “If I owe my life to Caracas, then to Mompox I owe my glory.” Our next stop, Enrique assured us, would explain all.",

Words, words; all the words in the world didn't get one a hair's breadth nearer anyone else's understanding, once there was no personal interest, once one had wrinkles, once one had lost one's looks to such an extent that one seemed to be a stranger.

My blanket is burnt to scraps and everywhere there’s the crackle, pop and fizz of flames. Animals howl. I’m in hell, I think, as a huge, bleeding and blackened tapir hurdles out of the inferno. She is so panicked that when she sees me, she just turns around and runs right back in. I’m not sure anymore what I’m fighting for, to put the fire out? I don’t think it’s possible. It’s going to keep burning forever. When it starts to get dark, I think it’s just the smoke and confusion. Where are the people who started these fires? I don’t know how I realise hours must have passed. I can barely see my hand in front of my face. It’s only then that I leave the blaze and race blindly through the ashes. Tears are running down my face. The first person I find is Jane. Flames from the thousands of tree fires are leaping above her head.",

In Tent Life, Kennan dodges danger and has adventures of thrillingness or awfulness on almost every other page. We see him galloping along a Kamchatka beach in a race with the incoming tide for thirty miles fenced in by sheer cliffs, and climbing into reindeer-herder dwellings that can be entered only by the chimney hole, and being dragged nearly to his death by a runaway horse, and dancing with every woman at a ball in the Siberian village of Anadyrsk in the middle of winter, and almost losing his life when a small sailboat he’s in becomes dismasted in the Sea of Okhotsk, and battling flights of mosquitoes that turned the tundra sky gray, and enduring a dogsled journey so cold and grueling that one of his comrades, having survived it, shot himself soon afterward. Despite all difficulties, Kennan’s team made good progress, and eventually had poles and supplies in place to begin building the line.",

    "target_paragraph": "THE SOURCE OF THE MOVEMENTS AND PLOTS of particular Balinese dances is often extremely hard to trace; scraps of myth, Hindu theology, and bits and pieces of the great epics are often assembled in a quite eclectic way into the dance. And the variety from village to village is considerable. The Jimbaran barong is no exception. In this dance, the Barong-Rangda confrontation is a fairly straightforward enactment of a fragment of a longer story, the calonarang, which describes the conflict between a powerful widow — rangda in high Balinese means \"widow\" — and an East Java ruler. But no such clear-cut source can be found for the Sandar-Omang standoff that precedes the climactic entrance of Barong and Rangda. After watching some three dozen different village barongs, reading several texts, and talking to Department of Religion sources, a score of pemangkus, and other knowledgeable observers, the best I can report is a handful of theories. Some of which, in the best Balinese tradition, contradict one another.",

The poor Twingo’s axle! We ford several impromptu streams and almost get stuck in a washout of near-ditch proportions. When we arrive everyone is gathered by the gigantic fireplace, already into the red wine. This is one of the most magnificent houses in the local vernacular. The living room, formerly a granary, soars two stories high with rows of dark beams. The immense room is filled with a lifetime collection of antiques, rugs, and treasures. The space is too large to heat, however, so we settle into big sofas in the former kitchen, with its fireplace large enough for the original cooks to set their chairs inside it and tend their pots. Downstairs the thirty-foot-long table is laid with pine boughs and red candles. Ghosts of Christmases past join us in everyone’s stories of other holidays. Fenella pours the hot polenta onto a cutting board. Ed carves the faraone while Peter slices the succulent roast. We pile our plates. Fenella has journeyed to Montepulciano for a stash of her favorite vino nobile, which travels around the table. “To absent friends,” Fenella toasts. “To the polenta!” Ed rejoins. Our little expatriate band is merry, merry.",

The idea of absolute financial probity as the first law of a gentleman's code was too deeply ingrained in him for sentimental considerations to weaken it. An adventurer like Lemuel Struthers might build up the millions of his Shoe Polish on any number of shady dealings; but unblemished honesty was the noblesse oblige of old financial New York. Nor did Mrs. Beaufort's fate greatly move Archer. He felt, no doubt, more sorry for her than her indignant relatives; but it seemed to him that the tie between husband and wife, even if breakable in prosperity, should be indissoluble in misfortune. As Mr. Letterblair had said, a wife's place was at her husband's side when he was in trouble; but society's place was not at his side, and Mrs. Beaufort's cool assumption that it was seemed almost to make her his accomplice. The mere idea of a woman's appealing to her family to screen her husband's business dishonour was inadmissible, since it was the one thing that the Family, as an institution, could not do.",

He tried to move and a sickening jet of pain coursed through his shoulder. He lay still on his back in the shadows, looking up at the scarp over which he had fallen.

The noise of the crowd grew louder as they appeared, the bell swung, but gave no sound, and across the square the trumpets of the procession were all but inaudible. Slowly they marched round, the representatives of all the seventeen contrade of the city. Besides its drummer and its two bannermen, each contrada had a man-at-arms on horseback, three or four halbardiers and young pages and, if it happened to be one of the ten competing in the race, a jockey, all of them wearing the Pinturicchian livery in its own particular colours. Their progress was slow; for at every fifty paces they stopped, to allow the bannermen to give an exhibition of their skill with the flags. They must have taken the best part of an hour to get round. But the time seemed only too short. The Palio is a spectacle of which one does not grow tired. I have seen it three times now and was as much delighted on the last occasion as on the first.",

You labor up the last steep stretch of rocky slope to what is after all a considerable eminence and pop your head over the edge, and there you are greeted by, of all things, a vast, terraced parking lot, full of automobiles gleaming hotly in the sun. Beyond stands a scattered complex of buildings among which move crowds of people in shorts and baseball caps. It has the air of a world’s fair bizarrely transferred to a mountaintop. You get so used along the AT to sharing summits with only a few other people, all of whom have worked as hard as you to get there, that this was positively dazzling. On Washington, visitors can arrive by car on a winding toll road or on a cog railway from the other side, and hundreds of people—hundreds and hundreds of them, it seemed—had availed themselves of these options. They were everywhere, basking in the sunshine, draped over the railings on the viewing terraces, wandering between various shops and food places. I felt for some minutes like a visitor from another planet. I loved it. It was a nightmare, of course, and a desecration of the highest mountain in the northeast, but I was delighted it existed in one place. It made the rest of the trail seem perfect.",

I had never seen anyone die before, and among the tears was a sense of awe that I was witnessing the end of a beloved life lived so long and well; ‘a terrible beauty’, as Yeats wrote in ‘Easter, 1916’.",

It would be a good day, he thought as he furled out the Genny and engaged Monitor. With a little luck, he would make Savannah by nightfall. As the day wore on the wind started to build, it was now 20 knots and gusting to 30. OK, Monitor, let’s see what you’re made of. He had the main and the Genny up, and Lone Eagle was making 6.5 knots. As the gusts hit, Monitor would round up into the wind, spill some off, and fall right back on course. Magic, he thought – even if I’m a bit over canvassed, she’ll spill off the wind. This was going to come in handy in a blow. He could sense Monitor would act-up if he were over canvassed. If he put a reef in the main, she would settle right down.

One guy walks into the bushes with a gun and then comes out carrying by the ears a tundra jackrabbit almost half as long as he is. More laughing, more vodka drinking, more firing of rifles into the air. The rabbit is skinned and cut up somewhere offscreen while the guys make a fire in half an oil drum. The rabbit reappears, now skewered on sticks, to be cooked as shashlik (like shish kebab). Edward paused the tape to tell me that if I wanted, he could provide a vezdekhot for me to drive, and that obtaining one would be very simple. I would have liked to try it, but I thanked him and declined. Vladimir had told us that vehicle tracks on the tundra take twenty-five years to heal. I figured it was okay if the Russians wanted to drive around out there—it was their tundra—but that wouldn’t apply to me.",

Then in March, when the war was over, I came and unlocked the door and walked in here for the first time since the New Year.

These people are bound for Pokhara from Dhorpatan, a week away. When crops are harvested, the Tibetans, Mustang Bhotes, and other hill peoples follow the ridges and valleys south and east to Pokhara and Kathmandu, trading wool and salt for grain and paper, knives, tobacco, rice, and tea. One Tibetan boy has caught a rockfish in the shallows; he runs to show me, almond eyes agleam. The children all along the way are friendly and playful, even gay; though they beg a little, they are not serious about it, as are the grim Hindu children of the towns. More likely they will take your hand and walk along a little, or do a somersault, or tag and run away.",

Phu-Tsering tells me that this past September, while he and four or five other villagers were digging potatoes at Khumbu, in eastern Nepal, a small yeti appeared, the size of a “big sheep,” moving along a hillside more or less on all fours, as if foraging; when it fled, Phu-Tsering says, it rose on its hind legs and moved much faster. It has a distinct pointed head, and was “between black and red” in color. I thought of the unknown creature I had seen in the upper Suli Gad, which had looked darker than the reddish color usually attributed to the yeti: “Between black and red” was about right, and well describes many primate creatures, which often have black hair in early life and tend toward reddish as they age. Perhaps Phu-Tsering is untruthful or deluded, or is concocting something that the sahib might wish to hear. It is also possible that what he says is true.",
