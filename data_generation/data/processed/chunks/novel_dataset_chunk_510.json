She said: ‘So ‘I’m to sit there on that staircase with my skirts spread or maybe better with my back against the balustrade and one foot propped against the wall of Mrs Tubbs’ kitchen while you men who never had time yesterday to ask that old nigger a few questions and so all he had last night was a boy, a child——’ His uncle said nothing. The sheriff leaned above the window breathing vast subterranean sighs, not breathing hard but just as a big man seems to have to breathe. Miss Habersham said: ‘Drive me home first. I’ve got some mending to do. I aint going to sit there all morning doing nothing so that Mrs Tubbs will think she has to talk to me. Drive me home first. I realised an hour ago what a rush and hurry you and Mr Hampton are in but you can spare the time for that. Aleck Sander can bring my truck to the jail on his way to school and leave it in front of the gate.’",

Even John Muir, for whom glaciers were the entire point of the voyage, had to admit that “no green mountains and hills of any country I have seen, not even those of the Emerald Isle, can surpass these.”",

It rested without violence or heat upon retreating pyramids of steel and stone, fumed at their peaks with fading wisps of smoke.

    "target_paragraph": "Speaker soon built another dam, swishing the jet carefully from side to side, piling up gravel and rocks. Certain small boulders struck by the jet leaped ten feet into the air. While he waited for the pond to fill again, he went up his pipe to check his ditch. The whole mountainside system consisted of four thousand feet of steel pipe, eleven inches in diameter at the lower end, increasing up the slope to twenty-two inches at the top, where it came out of the ditch. “Notice how much harder it is underfoot near the bottom,” he said as he briskly walked up the pipe in perfect balance, his voice as pantless as if he were sitting in a chair. I had to run to hear him—struggling the while not to fall. Near the top, he said, “The pipe is not quite full up here, you can feel it jumpin’ yet.” It was studded with pressure valves and ringed with slip joints. Without the valves, he said, changes in pressure could “suck the pipe flat.” Without the slip joints—sleeves made from fifty-five-gallon drums—the pipe could expand and buckle in the sun. He had taught himself to weld, and had built the system alone, for less than twenty thousand dollars. At the top, he checked the level of the water in the ditch, the rate of its flow into the orifice of the pipe. “This ditch is seven thousand six hundred feet long, and I built it in eight days,” he said. “How’s that for bulldozin’? I guess that’s the record, ain’t it? See the grass here. Moose and caribou come to this ditch and graze here, the full length of it. This ditch is just a flower garden when the flowers are in bloom.”",

One group lost all they had, while the other found all they needed – tables, chairs, closets, pots, pans, plates, sometimes clothes, family albums, books, radios and pets. Most of the immigrants broke into the abandoned Arab houses without direction, without order, without permission. For several months the country was caught up in a frenzy of take-what-you-can, first-come, first-served … Immigrants also took possession of Arab stores and workshops, and some Arab neighbourhoods soon looked like Jewish towns in pre-war Europe, with tailors, shoemakers, dry-goods merchants – all the traditional Jewish occupations.",

And as I descended from Mandalay Hill after watching the sun fall over the river, a middle-aged woman hopped nimbly into the back of my trishaw. “Make hay while the sun shines,” she cried as she entered. As the cycle began moving, she winked broadly and advised, “Don’t let the cat out of the bag.” The next thing I knew we were riding together through broad avenues in the falling dusk and she was alternately cackling inscrutably and singing “Blue Suede Shoes” or other hits from the distant past. When at last we drew up to my hotel, the ineffable lady solemnly extended a skinny hand and, though it was the eve of a Buddhist festival in mid-October, declared, “Please give my very best regards to your parents and wish them, on my behalf, all best wishes for Christmas and the New Year.”",

They advertise every day in the best newspapers, also on big signs set in the sidewalk beside all the important bus stops; the space must be rented by the city. There are many other such ads in the papers and on the insides of urinals; a dramatic one read “Better Hell than Impotence” and had along with the doctor’s address a picture of a devil with a pitchfork; and there is one “sexologist” who advertises only in the communist paper; but none can compete with the great two-headed Dr. Strom. The only question is whether he really exists, and if he does, how he can make a living. However you take him, it is more of that blurting out; romance is impossible.",

For this, not for their conversions, the authorities hate and hamper them; there is nothing to be jealous of in a religion which has no more appeal here than a Mohammadan mission would have in Rome. The Persians have a talent for cutting off their nose to spite their face. They stopped the Junkers air service because it exhibited foreign superiority. They make roads, but their customs duties prohibit the import of motors. They want a tourist traffic, but forbid photographing because somebody once published a picture of an Iranian beggar, while conformity with their police regulations is a profession in itself, as I have discovered in the last day or two. Indeed Marjoribanks-land ablaze with Progress offers a depressing contrast with Afghanistan. I am reminded of the hare and the tortoise.",

So my father would lose his temper and throw everything into the car and drive us at high speed to some roadside diner where a sweaty man with a floppy hat would sling hash while grease-fires danced on his grill. And afterwards, in a silent car filled with bitterness and unquenched basic needs, we would mistakenly turn off the main highway and get lost and end up in some no-hope hamlet with a name like Draino, Indiana, or Tapwater, Missouri, and get a room in the only hotel in town, the sort of rundown place where if you wanted to watch TV it meant you had to sit in the lobby and share a cracked leatherette sofa with an old man with big sweat circles under his arms. The old man would almost certainly have only one leg and probably one other truly arresting deficiency, like no nose or a caved-in forehead, which meant that although you were sincerely intent on watching Laramie or Our Miss Brooks, you found your gaze being drawn, ineluctably and sneakily, to the amazing eaten-away body sitting beside you. You couldn’t help yourself. Occasionally the man would turn out to have no tongue, in which case he would try to engage you in lively conversation. It was all most unsatisfying.",

He had left right after supper, we didn’t know where, and now I would say, maybe just hunting dark and solitude and space and silence for what wasn’t there or anywhere else for him either. And I know now why the direction we—she—took was west too, and where the money came from that we had for a while too until we couldn’t pay for riding anymore and had to walk, because she—we—took nothing from that house except the clothes we wore and our shawls and a little food which Marya carried in that same basket yonder. And I could say here also: “But you were safe; it was not enough” except that I dont, not to you who have in you what all heaven too might do well to blench at. So we walked then, and still westward: who might not have learned to think in that place during that week but at least she had memorised something of geography. Then there was no more food except what we could beg, but it would not be long now even if we had had money left to ride with too. Then that night, it was already winter when we left home and now it was Christmas, the eve before; and now I dont remember if we were driven from the inn itself or just turned away or maybe perhaps it was our mother still who would cut even that cord too with man. I remember only the straw, the dark stable and the cold, nor whether it was Marya or I who ran back through the snow to beat on the closed kitchen door until someone came—only the light at last, the lantern, the strange and alien faces crowding downward above us, then the blood and lymph and wet: I, a child of nine and an eleven-year-old idiot sister trying to hide into what privacy we could that outraged betrayed abandon and forsaken nakedness while her closed hand fumbled at mine and she tried to speak, the hand still gripping, holding onto it even after I had given my word, my promise, my oath——’",

Bus-size whales slip beneath boat keels, beginning or ending migration, while microscopic plankton drift the currents, awaiting direction. In a day of paddling you might glide beneath the ice-aged face of a glacier, katabatic winds watering your eyes, and half an hour later tuck into a plate glass cove with swampy kelp draped on the water, plovers after bugs at the shoreline, a torpid sea otter tailing your boat. Batten down hatches for a long crossing, and as you weave between grimy container ships bound for Japan and cruise ships decked with toasting retirees, the Sound seems the world’s crossroads. Then find land again, duck into a long, slim arm where your buddy’s boat is the only one visible, and the sea seems like a private away you’ve entered via wardrobe.",

In it Maggie wrote the chapters (which appear here) on wayang kulit and traditional gamelan, since that is her specialty. The second volume came out in 1986, with 24 more chapters. A small run of plain-vanilla editions of these two volumes met with modest sales in the hotels and book stores of Denpasar, Kuta, and Sanur. I had the materials ready for a third volume when I was asked by Eric Oey if his press, Periplus Editions, could publish these books and three others I was then working on. Of course, I agreed at once.",

And there would fall between them sometimes long rigid silences, when, in a state of mind which annoyed Lily in her, half plaintive, half resentful, she seemed unable to surmount the tempest calmly, or to laugh as they laughed, but in her weariness perhaps concealed something. She brooded and sat silent. After a time he would hang stealthily about the places where she was—roaming under the window where she sat writing letters or talking, for she would take care to be busy when he passed, and evade him, and pretend not to see him. Then he would turn smooth as silk, affable, urbane, and try to win her so. Still she would hold off, and now she would assert for a brief season some of those prides and airs the due of her beauty which she was generally utterly without; would turn her head; would look so, over her shoulder, always with some Minta, Paul, or William Bankes at her side. At length, standing outside the group the very figure of a famished wolfhound (Lily got up off the grass and stood looking at the steps, at the window, where she had seen him), he would say her name* once only, for all the world like a wolf barking in the snow, but still she held back; and he would say it once more, and this time something in the tone would rouse her, and she would go to him, leaving them all of a sudden, and they would walk off together among the pear trees, the cabbages, and the raspberry beds. They would have it out together. But with what attitudes and with what words? Such a dignity was theirs in this relationship that, turning away, she and Paul and Minta would hide their curiosity and their discomfort, and begin picking flowers, throwing balls, chattering, until it was time for dinner, and there they were, he at one end of the table, she at the other, as usual.",

The seats were like lawn chairs with a single piece of canvas for the back; one’s knees supported the spine of the passenger in front while one leaned on the passenger behind. For the first time I heard that characteristic sound of Russian departures, the clink of vodka bottles in plastic shopping bags. The plane waited for a while on the runway and the cabin became stuffy, so some of the male passengers removed their shirts and undershirts. Finally the plane took off and flew through the night, and the passengers slept all jumbled up with one another. An eight- or nine-year-old girl on my right slept on my right side while I sprawled on the uniformed man on my left. Just before dawn, the uniformed man woke up and looked out the window. As the plane descended to land at Omsk, he turned to me, gestured at the view, and said, “Sibir’!”",

With Gillian in the cockpit with the kite’s sheets in hand, he went forward. He untied the halyard and held it firmly as he positioned himself in the pulpit forward of the Genny with the snuffer control lines in his other hand. It was awkward, the wind was building, and Lone Eagle started a yawing, side-to-side motion. He yelled to Gillian to adjust her course so that the main would blanket the kite. It took a few seconds, but it worked. Gillian released the windward kite sheet while he pulled the snuffer down. There was still a lot of wind in the kite that made pulling the snuffer down tricky. He yelled to Gillian, and she released more of both sheet lines, and he was able to pull the snuffer all the way down. Lone Eagle settled, and the yawing stopped. He lowered the kite taking in arm-fulls of it, bit-by-bit until it was in a heap at his feet in the pulpit. He opened the forward hatch and stuffed all of it down below.",

    "target_paragraph": "From the hill-chapel of St Paraskeva you may look down on Krasnoyarsk in puritan disgust. A pool of slums separates you from its massed concrete, where the Yenisei glimmers dully, and from the west a vast suburb advances on the centre under a pall of smokestacks. The whole city cringes beneath clouds of carbon, coal tar and dust. Southward a bridge charges over the river to where the chimneys shoot up again, belching soot, or sending up wavering pillars of grey. Invisible beyond them, an immense dam and hydroelectric plant, the most powerful in the world on its completion in 1971, shores up a reservoir two hundred and fifty miles long above the drowned villages of 48,000 displaced people.\nWhere, you wonder, is the town admired by Chekhov, the spacious city of gold merchants? But Krasnoyarsk had swelled with reassembled factories during the Second World War, to become a metropolis of a million. Before 1991 it was closed to foreigners. The satellites surrounding it to the north–Soviet maps omit them–harbour a nest of underground military electronics plants and nuclear reactors, now converting in part to the manufacture of cassettes and Samsung televisions.\nYet once inside the city, this squalor withdraws. Running in long parallels above the river, the streets are lined with the honey-coloured blocks built by Japanese prisoners-of-war, with Corinthian hulks and turn-of-the-century confections in plaster and stone, with the surprise of a wooden mansion here and there, or a nineteenth-century villa. The Yenisei flows grandly under them. And you forget for a while the polluted and near-identical citadels of the poor which circle them, imagining that this is the city’s heart.\nThe Yenisei mesmerised me. The slim torrent which I had seen at Kyzyl, flowing from the centre of Asia, had now swollen to a flood over a mile wide. And still it was just beginning. With its Angara tributary, it is the sixth longest river in the world, slicing Siberia into two unequal halves as it moves three thousand four hundred miles from Mongolia to the Arctic. I wandered its banks where the great bridge, built by a French engineer in the 1890s, leapfrogged its current south. A smart-looking steamer, the Mastrov, was tied up at the quay. I watched it revictualling. Then, feeling like a runaway boy, I bought a ticket to the Arctic Circle, a voyage to the edge of my map and expectation.\nBut hours would pass before it sailed. Downriver I came upon the paddle-steamer that carried Lenin into exile at Shushenskoe. It had been hoisted clear of the water, the machinery which drove its rusted paddles still oiled and intact. Inside, the museum once sacred to Lenin had diversified, and there I found a steel document-case once belonging to Nikolai Rezanov.\nA young nobleman in the service of Grigory Shelikhov, the founder of Russian Alaska, he set out in 1803 with two ships on an imperial trade mission to America, and plotted to spread Russian dominion into California. While buying provisions in San Francisco, he fell in love with the beautiful daughter of the Spanish commandant, but religious impediments delayed their union, and Rezanov sailed home, promising to return within two years.\nThe legend survives in Siberia that he and his future father-in-law planned to create an independent California under the protection of the czar. But the following March Rezanov died of pneumonia in Krasnoyarsk, and was buried a few hundred yards from the quay where I walked. His fiancee waited. (Consuella’s Rock, facing the sea near San Francisco, commemorates her.) Then, on the news of his death, she founded California’s first convent and became its first nun.\nFor more than a century Rezanov’s monument stood by the cathedral near the river. Then in the 1930s a parachute school was built on the site, and the tomb, with its perilously pointed urn and spiked railings, was swept away.",

Even Mr. Soutar, the clergyman, had emerged from his lonely gloom, and dined by preference at the same table with the middle-aged ladies—the table farthest from the bay window. The Hankins, out of pure kindness, had taken pity on the old lady, Mrs. Jurd. They had made advances to the Lucys, perceiving an agreeable social affinity, and had afterward drawn back.

Yet outwardly he pursued the even tenor of his days, unchanged, performing his duties with his slow meticulous care. But within him smoldered something of which he himself grew afraid, and at times he found himself gazing at his idle hands on the desk before him as though they were not his hands, wondering dully at them and at what they were capable, nay importunate, to do. And day by day that lust and fear and despair that moiled within him merged, becoming desperation—a thing blind and vicious and hopeless, like that of a cornered rat. And always, if he but raised his head and looked toward the window, there was the boy watching him with bland and innocent eyes beneath the pale straw of his hair. Sometimes he blinked; then the boy was gone; sometimes not. So he could never tell whether the face had been there at all, or whether it was merely another face swum momentarily from out the seething of his mind. In the meanwhile he wrote another letter.",

All day our track went up and down and round and down and up and round again. On every side the mountains lay in long, smooth lines, and the midday heat haze gave a familiar look to their lower slopes, whose mixture of red clay and green scrub produced a heathery tinge. We passed one very beautiful teff-harvesting scene. This cereal has grain and straw of the palest gold and for miles the whole countryside was glowing against the strong blue of the sky or the faint powder-blue of distant mountains. After the straw has been threshed by bullocks the women winnow the grain by tossing it on huge wicker trays.",

With few exceptions, the Pacific salmon that run in these Arctic rivers are of the variety known as chum. Their flesh lacks the high pink color of the silver, the sockeye, the king salmon. Given a choice among those, a person with a lure would not go for chum, and they are rarely fished for sport. After sockeyes and humpbacks, though, they are third in the commercial salmon fishery. Many millions of dollars’ worth are packed each year. Athapaskan Indians, harvesting from the Yukon, put king salmon on their own tables and feed chum salmon to their dogs. Hence, they call chum “dog salmon.” Eskimos up here in the Arctic Northwest, who rarely see another kind, are piqued when they hear this Indian term.",

So we shop in enclosed malls, and drive to those malls with the car windows up and the air-conditioning on, even when the weather is flawless, as it was on this day. We work in office buildings where we cannot open the windows even if we wanted to—not, of course, that anyone would want to. When we go on vacation, it is often in an outsized motor-home that allows us to view the great outdoors without actually exposing ourselves to it. Increasingly, when we go to a sporting event it is in an indoor stadium. And almost all those Dick and Jane things we did as kids—ride bikes up and down the street, run to the park, play hide ’n’ seek or some game of ball—have pretty much vanished. Walk through almost any American neighborhood now in summer and you won’t see children doing any of this stuff because they are all inside. All you will hear is the uniform hum of air-conditioning units.",
