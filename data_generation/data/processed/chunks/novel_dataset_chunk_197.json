Usually when I sail alone, the sounds of fluttering sails and waves, the motion of my boat rising and plunging, never leave me even as I hang in my bunk dreaming of faraway places. If a movement varies slightly or an unfamiliar noise slaps against my eardrum, I am immediately awakened. Yet last night’s dream was almost too real. My life has become a composition of multilayered realities—daydreams, night dreams, and the seemingly endless physical struggle.",

The heavy wooden front door, preserved under myriad coats of red paint, stood seven steps above the level of the street, insulating the cool, dark interior from the chaos outside. Still, when horses pulling decrepit wagons clip-clopped by, the sound streamed in through the glassless windows just as it must have a century and more before. The tile floor, shades of rose swirling with beige and a hint of pale green, were the same tiles that Mari’s great-grandmother Eustoquia walked on as she tried to reconcile herself to a future she had neither dreamed of nor wanted. The tall glass chandelier, the same one that Eustoquia sat under pondering the well-being of her family after Cuban rebels vanquished the Spaniards to win Cuba’s imperfect independence, still lit the front parlor when Mari had visitors. On one wall there was still a framed portrait of Mari as a young woman, dressed in the formal ruffles and collars of a Spanish dancer, a lacy peineta adorning her blond curls. Below the picture, on a marble pedestal, a graphite bust of a young Julius Caesar stared across the room at a plaster bust of Raphael, both sculptures created by Mari’s mother when she was an art student. Mari’s traditional wooden rocker faced another rocker just as it might have in Eustoquia’s time, the two of them often enveloped by the aroma of freshly brewed Cuban coffee, insanely sweet, served in tiny cups any time of the day or night.",

Lucius Harney was there, then—he had not gone down to Hepburn with Mr. Miles, as she had at first imagined. But where had he taken his evening meal, and what had caused him to stay away from Mr. Royall’s? The light was positive proof of his presence, for Miss Hatchard’s servants were away on a holiday, and her farmer’s wife came only in the mornings, to make the young man’s bed and prepare his coffee. Beside that lamp he was doubtless sitting at this moment. To know the truth Charity had only to walk half the length of the village, and knock at the lighted window. She hesitated a minute or two longer, and then turned toward Miss Hatchard’s.",

Mr Daniel had formerly been the manager of a theatre in Wexford and he had often spoken at public meetings through the country. He recited national pieces in a stern declamatory fashion amid attentive silence. The daughters also recited. During these recitations Stephen’s eye never moved from the picture of the Sacred Heart which hung right above the head of the reciter’s head. The Miss Daniels were not so imposing as their father and their dress was {illegible word} somewhat colleen. Jesus, moreover, exposed his heart somewhat too obviously in the cheap print: and Stephen’s thoughts were usually fascinated to a pleasant stupor by these twin futilities. A parliamentary charade was frequent. Mr Daniel had sat for his county some years before and for this reason he was chosen to impersonate the Speaker of the House. McCann always represented a member of the Opposition and he spoke point-blank. Then a member would protest and there would be a make-believe of parliamentary manners.\n—Mr Speaker, I must ask …\n—Order! Order!\n—You know it’s a lie!\n—You must withdraw, Sir.\n—As I was saying before the honourable gentleman interrupted we must …\n—I won’t withdraw.\n—I must ask honourable members to preserve order in the House.\n—I won’t withdraw.\n—Order!

Outside, I can hear excited cries. “Mira!” “Dime!” “El jefe!” A little later, the doors open, just a crack, and I see a bright-yellow head, and then a black face with a beard. “Don’t worry,” the face assures me. “You cannot move.” The doors clang shut again, and I hear a crowd gathering outside, more “Psssts” and cries. Every now and then, the doors open up a few inches and a new face peers in to wave at me and smile. Then I hear a voice of authority, and as a chain gang of men strains to push open the doors, a teenager gets up on a stepladder and, methodically, starts to unscrew the whole contraption.",

He measured the panes by eye and hand, cut, cut again, fitted, tapped in little nails and went away. Then a new coir matting was laid down on the steps and corridors and top gallery. It was too wide for the gallery – a sewage pipe stood in the way – and it remained curled along one edge; on the steps an absence of rails made it dangerous; and after every gusty shower the matting in the corridor was soaked. Two days later a patterned green plastic tablecloth covered the dining-table. And that was not the end. Overalls turned up again. He went from green door to green door, painting numbers in chocolate, wiping out inelegancies with a rag, leaving each shaggy number in a brownish blur; then he went to the kitchen and ate a plateful of rice.",

Lindbergh seemed blissfully oblivious. If he had any trouble finding Lambert Field in the fog he never mentioned it. In fact, he said nothing at all of bad weather in any of his published accounts of those eventful days other than to note that he was glad of the storm system because it kept the other fliers in New York pinned down until he got there. That he was perhaps the only person between the two coasts bold enough to take to the air seems not to have occurred to him then or later.",

It was a fine clear night in early October, crispness and an indefinable smell of smoke were in the air, students were coming briskly along the street, singly or in groups of two or three, light glowed warmly in the windows of the book-shops, pharmacies, and tobacco stores near Harvard Square, and from the enormous library and the old buildings in the Harvard Yard there came a glow of lights, soft, rich, densely golden, embedded in old red brick.",

Without the air pump my raft will deflate and I’ll last only hours. Should I lose even bits of paper or plastic, I might be unable to make a repair or device that could spell the difference between life and death. I double-tie my emergency equipment duffel to the lifelines. Into it I put every item of primary importance, especially the air pump. The raft requires periodic topping up. It slowly leaks air, primarily as the sun heats the black tubes and excess pressure is released through the valves. There is a small foot pump, similar to those used to blow up air matresses, with a long hose that plugs into the valves. It seems an odd pump for a raft, because one cannot stand up to pump it and the rippling floor is not solid enough to press the pump against it by hand. Instead, I grasp it with my hands and squeeze, feeling lucky that my hands are relatively large and strong.",

Varuna was heading west and the rising sun in the east shone in through the companionway and right onto my bed. The sun was my alarm clock, and if a pillow over my head permitted me a few extra minutes of sleep, Dinghy would prod me with his nose and begin walking all over me, anxious for breakfast. When the sun rose to about 15 degrees above the horizon, I would take the first sight with the sextant, then calculate and plot it on the chart. The next one was at noon and, in the meantime, I worked around the boat, making repairs, rearranging things, cleaning out the litter box, reading, munching away on crackers or fruit. At noon, after taking the second sight and crossing the lines of position with the earlier one, what I thought was an exact fix could be established. By then the sun was at its zenith and Varuna turned into an oven. During the afternoon, it was too hot to do anything too strenuous other than fitfully read, munch and drink, and throw buckets of water over my head. This simple way of life was broken up by the odd ship wandering over the horizon, or frighteningly nearby, with whose radio operator I would chat over the VHF.",

It was his condition. His sex was functional, like eating and drinking.

He stood elevated in the witness-box, with burning cheeks in a cool lofty room: the big framework of punkahs moved gently to and fro high above his head, and from below many eyes were looking at him out of dark faces, out of white faces, out of red faces, out of faces attentive, spellbound, as if all these people sitting in orderly rows upon narrow benches had been enslaved by the fascination of his voice. It was very loud, it rang startling in his own ears, it was the only sound audible in the world, for the terribly distinct questions that extorted his answers seemed to shape themselves in anguish and pain within his breast, — came to him poignant and silent like the terrible questioning of one’s conscience. Outside the court the sun blazed — within was the wind of great punkahs that made you shiver, the shame that made you burn, the attentive eyes whose glance stabbed. The face of the presiding magistrate, clean shaved and impassible, looked at him deadly pale between the red faces of the two nautical assessors. The light of a broad window under the ceiling fell from above on the heads and shoulders of the three men, and they were fiercely distinct in the half-light of the big court-room where the audience seemed composed of staring shadows. They wanted facts. Facts! They demanded facts from him, as if facts could explain anything!",

With the kanda empat's help one can become a leyak (spook), and perform black magic. One can force them to cause sickness and accidents to enemies, and bring wealth to oneself.

They wasted and grew sick with hate and poison because another man received promotion, because another man had got his poem printed, because another man had eaten food and swallowed drink and lain with women, and lived and would not die; they sweltered with hate and fear against the professors who employed them – they grew pale and trembled, and spoke obsequiously when their employer passed, but when the man had gone, they whispered with trembling lips: ‘Has he spoken to you yet? … Has he said anything to you yet about next year? … Are you coming back next year? … Did he say anything to you about me next year? …’ They greeted him with sly humility and a servile glance, but they snickered obscenely at him when his back was turned. And they smiled and sneered at one another with eyes that glittered with their hate: they never struck a blow but they spoke lying words of barbed ambiguity, they lied, cheated, and betrayed, and they sweltered in the poisons of their hate and fear, they breathed the weary hatred-laden air about them into their poisoned lungs.",

It was landscape uncompromised, under small white cumulus by the tens of dozens evenly spaced to the corners of the sky. I remembered Frank Warren, in Circle, talking about the Park Service’s yen for the Charley, and saying, “What can you do to improve an area that is perfect? What possible satisfaction could a hiker ever get walking on a man-made trail?” We descended the bluff and descended the stream, stopping at the cabin built by Al Ames, where the government had posted a sign beside the door forbidding habitation.",

The mud villages of this area are much better designed than those of western Persia, where the houses are as primitive as you could find anywhere. Here they are most attractive, with domed roofs and miniature ‘Gothic’ windows and endless variations between one house and another. I longed to take a few photographs but Muslims being so sensitive on the subject it seemed wiser not to risk spoiling the good relations I’d achieved with the locals.",

Workers were deeply disenchanted over pay and conditions, and mystified by the American foods like oatmeal and Jell-O that they were served in the dining hall (though mercifully Ford did not insist on his workers following his soybean diet). Wages were a particular sore point. Most estate employees had assumed that they would be paid $5 a day, as Ford workers in America were. Instead, they found, their pay was 35 cents a day, and from those meager wages money was deducted for food whether it was eaten or not. The limitations placed on personal freedom?in particular, strictures against drinking?were also much resented, especially when the plantation managers could be seen enjoying cocktails on their verandas of an evening. The upshot was that the employees one night cracked and rioted, running through the camp with machetes, belaying pins, and other dangerous implements. Many of the managers had to escape by boat or flee into the jungle until things calmed down.",

As he sat there, Halo Tarrant’s face substituted itself for the other. Slim and dark-braided, with flowing draperies and sandalled feet, she leaned in the window, looking out through the wistaria fringes for something, for someone. . . . Vance stood up, brushing away the vision. Weren’t we all like Elinor Lorburn, looking out, watching for what never came? Ah, but there were the books--the books that had sufficed her, after all! He moved away, as if with her hand in his--that shy compelling virgin hand--moved through the rooms, down passages and stairs, and across the patterned parquet of the drawing rooms to the library. He reached out to open the shutters, and as he did so Miss Lorburn’s hand slipped from his, and he knew that when he turned she would no longer be beside him, young and wistful, but withdrawn into her frame above the mantelpiece, the mature resigned woman with the chalk lights on forehead and lappets. The woman who read Coleridge alone. . . .",

A black stowaway had been discovered, a sad mad young man whose history is anybody’s guess. At dawn I saw him lying in a narrow space behind the last row of seats, his hands and feet heavily manacled, his expression terrified. When I glanced down at him he began to cry. He had wet himself: they wouldn’t, he sobbed, let him go to the toilet. One could scarcely blame them for that; he looked seriously deranged and the midnight struggle had sounded strenuous. Nearby, an Afrikaner steward sat on guard, a tall hulky fellow, his thick sleek hair like a shiny brass helmet, his pale blue eyes close-set, his lips thin in a plump face that was easily rearranged. For me it wore a professional, steward’s smile. When I emerged from the loo it wore a snarl of contempt as he addressed some remark, in Afrikaans, to his captive. I asked, ‘What’s the story?’ Discomfited, the steward looked away – this stowaway might, after all, have been a hijacker … Then he muttered, ‘Even in the air they make trouble!’",

At the prodding of figures such as Amsterdam’s Jewish mayor, Job Cohen, the Dutch authorities had made concerted efforts to reach out to alienated Muslims. One notable ambassador and role model was the rapper Ali B, a Dutch-Moroccan chart-topper who caused a sensation when he hugged the beautiful Queen Maxima. In Rotterdam, city authorities had proposed a code of conduct for residents that included recognising Dutch as the city’s language. Authorities also encouraged the famous Muslim scholar Tariq Ramadan to relocate to the city, offering him a post as an official ‘integration adviser’ and a job at Erasmus University. In the area where I lived, local authorities and civic groups were forever arranging street-cleaning parties and ethnic food fairs aimed at bringing communities together. Such schemes were derided by critics as ‘drinking tea in mosques’, but seemed somewhat effective in helping combat extremism in the years following the assassinations.",

Everywhere you go is air-conditioned, so the air is always as cool and clean as a freshly-laundered shirt. People don’t wipe their necks much any more or drink sweating glasses of lemonade, or lay their bare arms gratefully on cool marble soda-fountains, because nowadays summer heat is something out there, something experienced only briefly when you sprint from your parking lot to your office or from your office to the luncheon counter down the block. Nowadays, black people sit at luncheon counters, so it’s not as easy to get a seat, but it’s more fair. And no-one goes to Washington Senators games any more because the Washington Senators no longer exist. In 1972 the owner moved the team to Texas because he could make more money there. Alas.

Long intervals of strolling on and on, feeling, although he seemed content to walk in silence, that one ought to be asking intelligent questions and, all the time, the lovely setting, aloof, each prospect sending with the first glimpse, its intimate message, its demand to be seen in solitude.",

With every mile we became wetter and colder and soon visibility was down to fifty yards and liquid mud lay six inches deep on the track. Frequently through the gloom we heard the uncanny booming of avalanches and despite the extremity of my discomfort I rejoiced to have known Baltistan in this mood, too. One doesn’t expect one’s beloved to be always amiable. Sadiq tells us that throughout the Skardu Valley it has been snowing thus for four days and nights non-stop.",

    "target_paragraph": "By the Nam Xong I drank Beerlaos under the shaggy thatched roof of a bar-hut on stilts built out over the riverbank, some thirty feet below. Here is a busy dry-season ford and at intervals the clear water turned muddy as large trucks lurched across, loaded with rocks for some construction project. The traffic was constant, including several power tillers drawing carts piled with green bananas. (Power tillers are motorized mini-ploughs imported from China.) Two of these broke down in midstream and had to be hauled on to dry land after their drivers summoned helpers to hump the bananas. A very tall backpacker, wearing a scarlet bow on his long flaxen pony-tail, waded across carrying a guitar. Four straw-hatted young women, bearing formidable loads of thin bamboo poles, got the giggles when he had passed them. Young men, shouldering heavy sacks of rice, crossed cautiously; immersion in the Nam Xong would have done their precious loads no good. Three Toyota pick-ups were packed with passengers and pigs. Another power tiller appeared, pulling a shaded wagon full of women and children, the latter soothingly stroking the hens on their laps. An elderly man carried his bicycle across, taking care not to let it get wet. Then two slim canoes came speeding downstream, their outboard motors raucous; each carried four men, balancing on narrow slat seats. Below me suntanned boys were swimming gracefully with their dogs in a deep pool. (An unwary backpacker, a non-swimmer, had been drowned here a few weeks previously.) Upstream from the pool three young women, modestly draped in sarongs from armpits to calves, were bathing and hair-washing – then laundering garments while their hair dried before being vigorously brushed and swept up into chignons. (Nowadays some young women wear their long hair loose; previously this was considered indecorous.) When it comes to hair care, the Lao verge on the obsessional. Shampooing is a daily event for men, women and children and in all but the remotest villages sachets of imported shampoo are available; not long ago a shampoo equivalent was derived from forest plants. As I was leaving a mother wearing a garish nylon skirt (at the other end of the aesthetic scale from the sin) led her food-stained small son into the river for a post-prandial scouring.",

The other was a fifty-five-foot Australian ketch called Alias. It had a rust-streaked hull and a salty, heavy-weather look, with frayed, old-fashioned fittings and bicycles and surfboards lashed to the bow rails. I guessed the boat was eighty years old. It turned out to be two. A surfer commune had built it from scratch near Perth, in Western Australia, with stolen wood and parts and scavenged tools. The women in the group had waitressed to keep the workers fed. The hull was ferrocement. A tall, sun-wrecked, curly-haired character named Mick told us the boat’s story. Alias had barely survived its maiden voyage, he said, after its novice sailors, impatient for wind, took it far south, into the Roaring Forties, and got clobbered by a gale. “Seas were as high as the mast,” Mick said. “Got knocked down once. We were all down below, praying. Thought we were going to die.” When they limped into South Australia, half the group disembarked, swearing off sailing forever. Four people—two couples—had stayed. Now Mick’s girlfriend, Jane, was heavily pregnant, so Alias would be going nowhere until after she delivered.",

    "target_paragraph": "Having Eddie with me was magic in terms of being accepted by Aboriginal people. Everyone knew Eddie, everyone loved him. And because he was there, and because I had camels, they loved me too. We stopped one day at a small camp by a bore, where there were maybe twenty people. We sat down together outside a humpy and talked for hours, drinking weak, cool super-sweet billy tea and chewing damper. Because I was the guest, I was given the tin mug to drink out of instead of sipping it straight from the billy like the others. The mug had been used for mixing flour and water so great clumps of the stuff floated around the top. It didn’t matter. By now my attitude to food had changed utterly. Food had become something you put in your mouth to give you energy to walk, that’s all. I could eat anything, and did. Washing had become an unnecessary procedure by then too. I was putrid. Even Eddie, who was no sparkling example of cleanliness, suggested I should wash my face and hands one day. He was finickity about Diggity too, and refused to let her drink from his mug.",

The picture of this flushed, rosy, and excited little person, surrounded by a cluster of fashionable and sophisticated-looking people, made him think of some kind of strange and lovely flower surrounded by a swarm of buzzing bees, save that this flower seemed to draw honey to itself as well as give it off. The contrast between Mrs. Jack and all these other people was so startling that for a moment he wondered by what strange trick of chance she had been thrust among them. For a moment, she seemed almost to belong to another world, a world of simple joy, of childlike faith, of sweetness and of naturalness, of innocence and morning. In this sophisticated gathering, each person stamped in his own way with the city’s mark, each touched with the sickness of the nerves which seems to be a tribute that the most favorite and most gifted of the city’s children pay—the hard smile and the bloodless tone, the jaded and most weary eye—she seemed to have intruded like some accidental Alice of the noonday world, who had wandered in and out of green fields and flowery meadows, suddenly to find herself through the looking glass in a whole world of—mirrors. And the transition seemed to delight her. It all seemed so gay, so brilliant, so exciting, and so wonderfully good and friendly. She opened to it like a flower, she beamed and beaconed to it like an enchanted child, she couldn’t seem to get enough of it, and her flushed face, her eager interest, her constant air of bewildered and yet delighted surprise, as if her wonder grew with every breathing step, as if she could no longer quite take all of it in, but was sure that each new moment would be even more enchanting than the last—it was all the happiest and most appealing contrast to this hard and polished world imaginable—and yet?",

While one walks about trying to find a laundromat to wash and iron his clothes, or a cobbler to repair his shoes, or to buy a specific item such as an anti-itch lotion, in effect he is forced to interact in a more practical fashion with the foreign culture. Errands thus allow the traveler to approach the “everyday life” of a place from another angle. These little practical things, which are many (see a typical list below), also bring one in contact with the services, business practices, and overall “systems” in a country – things that are often invisible when one moves from place to place but does not live in the country. The running of errands may thus be considered a substitute for actually working or living in a place. Furthermore, the form of interactions with the foreign culture when one runs errands is usually of a very different character than when one simply travels. This immensely enriches one’s travels, which offsets any annoyance of having to run errands.",
