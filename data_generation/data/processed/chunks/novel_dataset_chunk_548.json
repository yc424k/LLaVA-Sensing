Especially her movements and language. In her hand was usually a cigarette holder. She was curious about me and very interested. Her Budapest apartment was quite small. A room where you could hardly move, because there was a grand piano. The room dominating and imposing. Bookcases with glass doors. We slept on a pull-out mattress, with our feet under the piano. I went to stay with her two to three times a year, mostly alone. Hungary back then was behind the Iron Curtain, and she couldn’t get an exit visa, but for me in Austria, it was easy to go there. It was my first self-sufficiency, first independent travel. And Jolan was a great destination.",

This northwestern arm is the valley of the Phoksumdo River, and its delta of boggy tundra streams, of gravel bars and willow, is so like Alaska that both of us exclaim at the resemblance. A cold wind drives waves onto the dead gray beach, and when the sun sinks behind the Kanjiroba Massif at the head of the valley, it is still very early in the afternoon. Shey is two thousand feet higher than our present camp, and therefore considerably colder; with precious little fuel for lamps and no way to heat the tents, we can only hope that the western mountains there are low, and sunset later.",

Then, anger, righteousness and hatred swelled in bitter bile, consuming and paralyzing me with hopelessness. Today, the knot of anger moves slowly down from my heart to sit in the pit of my stomach. Now sadness swells in my chest. I’ve always seen anger as strong and sadness as weak, but now sorrow seems stronger than fury. It’s less likely to spread the energy of hate, an energy that must have consumed those terrorists. If I can be strong enough to use my Buddhist training by not giving in to anger, then I become less like them; I can help stop the cycle of hatred and violence. I realize life is precious and tenuous and I need to focus on what I do believe in and what sustains me: my family, my husband, my friends and the lotus people—those who grow tall and beautiful above the muck and mud of humanity.",

The first great guest to be entertained there was Grand Duke Nicholas, the future Tsar of Russia, who had found in Hong Kong, as we have seen, a fairly chilly public reception, and spent much of his time at Government House looking at his own ship through a telescope on the roof.",

    "target_paragraph": "An hour later, we were looking from a summit pass long distances across the peaks of the country. We paused, taking it in, and he told me another story remembered from the North Slope. He and the others would now and again see a lone raven, flying over the flat tundra. It would fly on and on, close to the ground. Below the raven, almost always, was a running fox. Mile upon mile, the fox stayed under the raven. If the raven sped up a bit and settled to the ground, the fox then stalked the raven. When the fox sprang for the capture, the raven—at the last moment—would jump into the air, and fly on across the tundra, with the fox running below. The relationship was apparently static, a ritual equilibrium, a possible pantomime. One day, such a pair came flying and running almost into camp. The raven set down. The fox went into its assassin creep —one crafted step after another—and then made a sudden dash. The raven jumped into the air. After a short flight, it came down, and was again stalked and rushed by the fox. Again it made a short flight, and settled down, even closer to the crew. The fox renewed its subtle glide, this historically futile contest with the raven’s eye. Once more came the move, the rush, the leap. The fox caught the raven, ate it on the spot, and left a pile of black feathers on the ground.",

I resort to a counting strategy of fifty steps and stop. Every time I get to a rise, another rise looms. Meanwhile, Jane is pushing along behind me, a Classics educated version of the Energiser Bunny. I start to realise something about Jane. She may not be fit. She may have an urban commuter bike. She may not have been on a long cycle trip before. But, she is relentlessly determined and positive. (I am also starting to realise that I think she lied about the fitness thing because we get to the top of these enormous hills where I am ready to collapse, and she marches right by me.) Her prowess is undermining my tender ego. We mount up and ride past yet another waterfall onto the Scosthrop Moor. We are in the Yorkshire Dales National Park.",

I’ve been to these Imax screenings before and frankly I can’t understand their appeal. I know the screen is massive and the visual reproduction theoretically stunning, but the films are always so incredibly dull, with their earnest, leaden commentaries about Man’s conquest of this and fulfilling his destiny to do that—this latest offering that had the crowds flocking in was actually called Destiny in Space—when any fool can see that what everybody really wants is to go on a roller-coaster ride and experience a little here-comes-my-lunch aerial dive bombing.",

I was a bit surprised to see them in this parched place because unlike many other antelope species they do not thrive in dry conditions, and are water-dependent, hence their name. I hoped it would rain soon.\nThis was the furthest north I had ever been in Kenya, and it was the first time I had seen the rare and beautiful reticulated giraffe. They have distinctly different markings from their Maasai cousins, far more geometrical and neater, as if they have taken greater care when painting their pattern. I loved their elegant, slow-motion lollop, their necks swaying gently as they sashayed across the ground with lazy strides, swinging those long, long legs like pendulums.\n‘Have you considered how a giraffe drinks?’ Dedan asked. I must admit this is not something that had previously preoccupied me, but when I considered it I could see that it could pose a problem, bending the head all that way down to ground level and drawing water up such a long neck. A giraffe’s heart has to be very strong to pump blood up to the brain, so if the neck is down and the heart is working hard, surely all the blood will go into its head? What does it do – stop its heart? No. Firstly, it must bend and splay apart its forelegs to lower its body, because otherwise it can’t reach the ground with its mouth, which is possibly an engineering design fault? However, the designers redeem themselves by equipping the giraffe’s neck with a series of non-return valves to control the flow of blood. Isn’t nature wonderful?",

Then came a four-lane motorway in the making; on both sides of this Prestige Project unschooled children swarmed between homes ingeniously constructed in varying combinations of tin, plywood, cardboard, canvas and plastic sheeting.

She donned the coat and hat and went toward the barn, the torn leaves in her hand, splotched over with small cuts of clothes-pins and patent wringers and washing-powder, and entered the hallway. She stopped, folding and folding the sheets, then she went on, with swift, cringing glances at the empty stalls. She walked right through the barn. It was open at the back, upon a mass of jimson weed in savage white-and-lavender bloom. She walked on into the sunlight again, into the weeds. Then she began to run, snatching her feet up almost before they touched the earth, the weeds slashing at her with huge, moist, malodorous blossoms. She stooped and twisted through a fence of sagging rusty wire and ran downhill among trees.",

He had never released the knife and again the boy saw the almost infinitesimal movement of his arm and shoulder as he probed and sought; then the bear surged erect, raising with it the man and the dog too, and turned and still carrying the man and the dog it took two or three steps toward the woods on its hind feet as a man would have walked and crashed down.

In a flash the fading city soared out of the dark and expanded in a geometrical infinity of electric bulbs. Diminishing skeletons of yellow dots leaped into being along the banks and joined hands across the flood in a sequence of lamp-strung bridges. Cologne was sliding astern. The spires were the last of the city to survive and as they too began to dwindle, a dark red sun dropped through bars of amber into a vague Abendland that rolled glimmering away towards the Ardennes. I watched the twilight scene from the bows of the leading barge. The new plaque on my stick commemorated the three Magi – their bones had been brought back from the crusade by Frederick Barbarossa – and the legend of St Ursula and her suite of eleven thousand virgins.",

Occasionally there was some excitement – when a panther killed a dog or hundreds of wild horses were sighted galloping across the steppes. Quite often dangerously flooded rivers had to be negotiated and then the mules and horses swam with their riders through the swift, icy water and the yaks were ferried on square, flat-bottomed boats of wood and yak-hide. But on the whole this sounded a happy and peaceful journey, and Lobsang looks back on that period with inevitable nostalgia, realising that his Tibet has by now been changed for ever.",

    "target_paragraph": "In such an unaccommodating world, it is not surprising that visitors are often as unorthodox, in their way, as locals. (“Whenever I meet a foreigner here,” an Icelandic girl told me in a disco, “I ask him, ‘Why do you come to Iceland?’ It is cold; it is expensive; and the people, they are closed.”) Yet the country seems to bring out something pure in visitors, something a little bit out of the ordinary. The most luminous translations of modern Icelandic poetry into English, for example, were composed by a recent U.S. ambassador to Iceland, Marshall Brement, who has written beautifully of how Icelanders were the great European poets of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and how even now, on one night a year, every member of Parliament must speak in rhyme. And though the island’s attraction to photographers (Eliot Porter) and to poets (from Auden and MacNeice to Leithauser) may be self-evident, it seems to evoke something poetic even in an everyman. I once asked a young Danish student, who had chosen to live here for a year, what was the most exciting thing to do in Reykjavik. He thought for a long, long time. Then, a little sheepish, he replied, “Well, for me, I like walking at night in the Old Town, seeing the old houses. Or if you can go a little bit out of Reykjavik, if it is cold, like tonight, you can see the northern lights.” The most beautiful place he had ever seen, he said, was Greenland. “It is so rich, in many ways. When you walk there, you see more clearly, you think more easily. Here it is a little bit the same.”",

The Greeks stood in front of the icon of the mounted saint, hands cupped in prayer. The Turks put prayer carpets on the floor and bent forward in the direction of Mecca. One veiled Muslim lady scraped with long nails at a tattered nineteenth-century fresco of the saint, then with her fingertip touched a fragment of the paintwork to her tongue.",

It has a long narrow wooden jetty running across the marshy shore to the ferry, and moored to the end of this jetty lay a big fishing-smack with furled brown sails. I got out and walked down to it to see if it were the ferry-boat, and whether the ferryman was in it. Both August and the horses had an alarmed, pricked-up expression as they saw me going out into the jaws of the sea. Even the emotionless Gertrud put away her stocking and stood by the side of the carriage watching me. The jetty was roughly put together, and so narrow that the carriage would only just fit in. A slight wooden rail was all the protection provided; but the water was not deep, and heaved limpidly over the yellow sand at the bottom. The shore we were on was flat and vividly green, the shore of Rügen opposite was flat and vividly green; the sea between was a lovely, sparkling blue; the sky was strewn across with loose clusters of pearly clouds; the breeze that had played so gently among the ears of corn round Miltzow danced along the little waves and splashed them gaily against the wooden posts of the jetty as though the freshness down there on the water had filled it with new life. I found the boat empty, a thing of steep sides and curved bottom, a thing that was surely never intended for the ferrying across of horses and carriages. No other boat was to be seen. Up the channel and down the channel there was nothing visible but the flat green shores, the dancing water, the wide sky, the bland afternoon light.",

I forgot to note her name so let’s call her Mrs A. This one-roomed shack, measuring some twelve feet by twenty, had a small fire burning in the middle of the earthen floor – the window served as chimney – and a high ceiling of smoke-blackened thatch. Opposite the door was a long communal bed of bamboo stakes, raised some four feet from the ground, the many quilts neatly folded. Well-worn garments hung from vines strung between the tree-trunk struts supporting the roof. A small table and bench completed the furnishings. In one corner was the ‘shop’: three short shelves holding a few bottles of Sprite and a meagre stock of toothpaste, instant noodles and cigarettes – alas! no Beerlao. A barrel of kerosene with a patch of oil on the floor beneath its tap stood close to the fire, from which sparks flew at intervals. On the wall beside the barrel hung an abacus on which Mrs A. did mysterious calculations when kerosene customers arrived.",

They met daily in that strange and solemn interval, the twilight of the morning, in the violet or pink dawn; for it was necessary to rise early, so very early, here. Milking was done betimes; and before the milking came the skimming, which began at a little past three. It usually fell to the lot of some one or other of them to wake the rest, the first being aroused by an alarm clock; and, as Tess was the latest arrival, and they soon discovered that she could be depended upon not to sleep through the alarm as the others did, this task was thrust most frequently upon her. No sooner had the hour of three struck and whizzed, than she left her room and ran to the dairyman’s door; then up the ladder to Angel’s, calling him in a loud whisper; then woke her fellow-milkmaids. By the time that Tess was dressed Clare was downstairs and out in the humid air. The remaining maids and the dairyman usually gave themselves another turn on the pillow, and did not appear till a quarter of an hour later.",

Then, after talking it over with Carlos and weighing her family responsibilities, Lili decided to accept Lourdes’s invitation to run for delegada. Like Cary, she saw the neighborhood’s need to take care of its own problems as a metaphor for Cuba. “Everybody blames everything on the embargo, the embargo, the embargo,” she started telling her neighbors. “Well sure, the embargo is a problem, but the streets here need to be repaired, and the garbage has to be taken care of. What does the embargo have to do with those things? Nothing. The real problem is organization.”",

I feel bad, all the more so because the Sherpas’ clothing is inadequate, and Tukten’s especially: what little he had was stolen at Ring-mo on his way back from Jumla. He is happy to wear whatever I can spare him, though not once has he asked for it: Tukten never seems to suffer—a true repa. At the fire, I make a special effort to be friendly, to acknowledge my stupidity in not deferring to his judgment—after all, he has been over this same route in the past month. But with this Tukten, all such effort is absurd; how can he forgive me, when he hadn’t bothered with resentment in the first place?",

The dark rock walls showed great zig-zag scars of white – one could fancy lightning had been painted on them – and their strangely square tops, as though dressed by giant stonemasons, were in extreme contrast to the tangle of jagged summits just visible beyond. Then on all sides there was ice in unimaginable shapes and forms. The infinite variety of ice, and the exquisite grotesqueness of its formations, delights Rachel more than almost anything else here; but not more than the prodigious chenar tree near our ‘hotel’, which is twenty-nine of my long paces in circumference and reputed to be 600 years old. It still flourishes, though it has had its centre burnt out to make a large room, floored with dry leaves, which serves as the hotel latrine; and very welcome that shelter was early this morning, especially as our present limited diet has reduced me to an unprecedented state of constipation.",

While the plane was refuelled, Roy and I sat on the damp ground and ate a sumptuous breakfast of one bowl of dry rice and tea. That was the only nourishment until we got the same repast in the late afternoon at Kunming. I said there was no nonsense about comfort.",

This room, which had a harsh angular steel-and-cement newness that the other did not have, seemed to be of more recent construction, and to have been added on to the front part of the jail. In this room, also, there were several rows of cells, ascending in tiers up to the ceiling. When they entered, the place was quiet, but immediately a drunken Negress in one of the cells began to bawl and rave and sob, smashing, hammering, and rattling the bars of her cell like a demented ape. There was everywhere a foul rank odour of undrained faecal matter, tempered with the odour of the tarry disinfectant, and cut more sharply with the acrid smell of some ammoniacal fluid.",

We watched videos and read from a booklet to pass a couple of written tests. Then two other students and I worked for three weeks with a driving instructor. Looking out the windshield of a truck those first weeks felt like being stuck in a real life video game. I learned the control station, seeing the super-realistic graphics whiz by. The game had an edge of fun, but if I wiped out the stakes had become much higher than losing a couple of quarters in an arcade game or losing face in front of friends.",

On several occasions, the guards having failed to repel them, the king of the Khazars has been compelled to march out against them in force, so as to prevent them from crossing the ice, and thus he has saved his kingdom from invasion.

These are brought from distant places and it is quite a business to carry them to Lhasa. It is managed in a very primitive way, and my indignation was aroused when I saw, for the first time, a procession coming in. It reminded me of the Volga boatmen. About twenty men drag each trunk which is attached to them by a rope round their waists. They sing a monotonous air as they trudge along, keeping step with one another. They sweat and pant, but their foreman, who leads the singing, gives them no pause for rest. This forced labour is in part a substitute for taxation. The carriers are picked up at villages on the road and dismissed when they come to the next settlement. The monotonous airs to which they drag their burden are said to distract their minds from the severity of their task. I should have thought they would do better to save their breath. The sort of fatalistic resignation with which they lent themselves to this back-breaking toil always used to infuriate me. As a product of our modern age, I could not understand why the people of Tibet were so rigidly opposed to any form of progress. There must obviously be some better means of transporting these heavy burdens than by man-handling them. The Chinese invented and used the wheel thousands of years ago. But the Tibetans will have none of it, though its use would give an immense impulse to transport and commerce and would raise the whole standard of living throughout the country.",
