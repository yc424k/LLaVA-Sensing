As the train neared Orléans there was a noticeable increase in the travelling public: at every station there was a noisy traffic of arriving and departing passengers.

A few rich people went there for the winter, but hardly anyone else considered the state a destination. But then the wider mass of Americans discovered the attractiveness of Florida’s climate and the pleasantness of its beaches, and it suddenly became desirable. In 1925, Florida repealed income and inheritance taxes, which made it even more attractive. People swarmed into the state in huge numbers and began an intense and increasingly irrational property boom.",

Each year newspapers acknowledge the event by publishing a photo showing some poor goof getting speared in the backside by a charging toro. It’s a dumb idea, but the city is haplessly wedded to the tradition because it draws two million people each year and scads of euros. Yet Pamplona need only throw together half a dozen photos, market itself as a destination for romantics, and the world would beat a path to its doorstep for reasons other than bulls.",

It was a magnificent spacious room, so richly, softly carpeted that the foot sank down with velvety firmness to a noiseless tread. The quality of the room was the quality of the whole house – a kind of château-like grandeur and solidity, combined with the warmth, comfort and simplicity of a country house. Joel pressed buttons, flooding the great room with light. The wide and snowy covers of the great bed had been drawn back for the night. It was a bed fit for a king, and long and spacious enough for a man of seven feet: it waited there with a kind of still embrace, a silent and yet animate invitation that was eloquent with the promise of a strange and sweet repose.",

Lone Eagle had been their boat for 23 years, and they were amazed at how she was fitted out for long-distance cruising. They didn’t miss a detail and asked so many questions. Tudi hugged Gillian and said that Lone Eagle looked gorgeous. She couldn’t get over how the bronze portholes just glowed. It had taken a lot of elbow grease, but Gillian was so proud of how she had taken care of Lone Eagle. They reminisced about his time in New Bern, North Carolina, where he spent two weeks fitting out and trying to outrun winter on his way south. They talked about Gillian flying in to be with him and carrying an entire Thanksgiving dinner with her in her luggage. They all just laughed. They had a wonderful evening together and were sorry to see them go. They would meet up at his mom’s house tomorrow.",

Non-Jews were moved out while Jews were collected up and imprisoned within the walls – on average fourteen people to a room. No one escaped alive until the war was over.",

Just yesterday he has finished a long period of silent meditation—for the past three months he has not spoken. We will be his first visitors. This is most auspicious.” Doug, Lou, and I each gave Chhongba one hundred rupees (approximately two dollars) to buy ceremonial katas—white silk scarves to be presented to the rimpoche—and then we removed our shoes and Chhongba led us to a small, drafty chamber behind the main temple.",

We were moving slowly, using a torch, when a strange noise rang out from the bike that we couldn’t identify. The torch didn’t give out enough light to find the cause and we had no choice but to camp where we were. We settled down as best we could, erecting our tent and crawling into it, hoping to suffocate our hunger and thirst (for there was no water nearby and we had no meat) with some exhausted sleep. In no time, however, the light evening breeze became a violent wind, uprooting our tent and exposing us to the elements and the worsening cold. We had to tie the bike to a telephone pole and, throwing the tent over the bike for protection, we lay down behind it. The near hurricane prevented us from using our camp beds. In no way was it an enjoyable night, but sleep finally won out over the cold, the wind and everything else, and we woke at nine in the morning with the sun high above our heads.",

These snowfields are impassable, and anyway, it is too late in the day and in the year to go to Shey, and much too high, too cold, to make camp here. Nor are the Sherpas any help. When I persist in my arguments, wondering where in hell GS could be, Jang-bu and Phu-Tsering take me aside and express discouragement about proceeding farther. The Ring-mos have persuaded them that even if Kang La is reached, the north face of the pass is perilously steep and icy: why, last year a man lost his life there! Jang-bu is also worried about his friend Gyaltsen—how would he and Tukten ever find us, since the wind is sure to cover any tracks? It is best that we return to Ring-mo.",

It is carefully preserved without having the managed feel of an open-air museum, and its setting is as near to perfection as could be imagined. At the end of every street you are confronted by a towering backdrop of mountains, muscular and snow-peaked beneath intensely clear skies.",

McKinley, even Everest, have been surmounted by men on foot. (Some of them, incidentally, rank amateurs, to the horror and indignation of the professional mountaineers.) The interior of the Grand Canyon, a fiercely hot and hostile abyss, is visited each summer by thousands and thousands of tourists of the most banal and unadventurous type, many of them on foot – self-propelled, so to speak – and the others on the backs of mules. Thousands climb each summer to the summit of Mt. Whitney, highest point in the forty-eight United States, while multitudes of others wander on foot or on horseback through the ranges of the Sierras, the Rockies, the Big Smokies, the Cascades and the mountains of New England. Still more hundreds and thousands float or paddle each year down the currents of the Salmon, the Snake, the Allagash, the Yampa, the Green, the Rio Grande, the Ozark, the St. Croix and those portions of the Colorado which have not yet been destroyed by the dam builders. And most significant, these hordes of nonmotorized tourists, hungry for a taste of the difficult, the original, the real, do not consist solely of people young and athletic but also of old folks, fat folks, pale-faced office clerks who don’t know a rucksack from a haversack, and even children. The one thing they all have in common is the refusal to live always like sardines in a can – they are determined to get outside of their motorcars for at least a few weeks each year.",

Then the boy saw the buck. It was coming down the ridge, as if it were walking out of the very sound of the horn which related its death. It was not running, it was walking, tremendous, unhurried, slanting and tilting its head to pass the antlers through the undergrowth, and the boy standing with Sam beside him now instead of behind him as Sam always stood, and the gun still partly aimed and one of the hammers still cocked.",

An old man patiently pumps air into the fire by pushing feathered plungers up and down in large bamboo tubes. Or one might see workers casting the bronze keys in molds lubricated with coconut oil and covered with peels of banana tree stem. Someone else might be scraping newly cast keys with a file, bringing them to a golden sheen, every now and them tapping them with a stick and bringing them to his ear, to see if the desired pitch has yet been achieved.",

So it was a treat to experience the country’s interior as Machi and I worked our way south toward Cuba by bus, from the frenetic pace of Mexico City to the tranquillity of Tepoztlán. Yet being around puros mexicanos—real Mexicans—made me feel grossly incompetent. Every word I had ever uttered in Russian or Mandarin had seemed like a trophy to me, something I had sought, studied, and conquered. In Spanish, however, my speech felt pocked with failures, as though everything I managed to say were an admission of what more I could not. Though I had invested time in the language that year, studying from workbooks and conversing with my tías, I dreaded using it—largely out of fear of the direction a conversation with a mexicano might take. “ ¿Tu mamá es mexicana? Híjale, what the hell happened to you?”",

Scriptural throngs tread the air among the banks of vapour and the toppling perspectives of the balustrades. Allegories of the seasons and chinoiserie eclogues are on the move. Aurora chases the Queen of the Night across the sky and Watteau-esque trios, tuning their lutes and their violins, drift by on clouds among ruins and obelisks and loosened sheaves. A sun declining on a lagoon in Venice touches the rims of those clouds and veils the singing faces and the plucked strings in a tenuous melancholy; irony and pity float in the atmosphere and across the spectator’s mind, for there is little time left and a closing note sounds in all these rococo festivals.",

From bleak and grimy back-to-back houses (so called because every row of houses was mirrored by another row attached to its back, with no open space between), Salt’s workers came to airy, spacious cottages, each with little yards front and rear, a private gas supply, and at least two bedrooms.

Across the walk, on the other lobe of grass, several men and women were playing croquet. There was laughter on the vine-hid porch. Next door, at the Belton, the boarders were assembled on the long porch in bright hash-house clatter. The comedian of the Dixie Ramblers arrived with two chorus girls. He was a little man, with the face of a weasel and no upper teeth. He wore a straw hat with a striped band, and a blue shirt and collar. The boarders gathered in around him. In a moment there was shrill laughter.",

The roofs, doors and windows were packed with Mexicans, singing and beating time with their heels, as they fired their rifles in a sort of salute upon entering the town. At the station this curious equipage drew up, and from it proceeded—who but Patricio, General Urbina’s fighting stage-driver at whose side I had so often ridden and danced! He threw his arms around me, yelling: \"Juanito! Here is Juanito, mi General!\"\nIn a minute we were asking and answering each other a million questions.\nDid I have the photographs I took of him? Was I going to the battle of\nTorreon? Did he know where Don Petronilo was? And Pablo Seañes? And\nRaphaelito? And right in the midst of it somebody shouted \"Viva\nUrbina!\" and the old General himself stood at the top of the steps,—the lion-hearted hero of Durango. He was lame, and leaned upon two soldiers. He held a rifle in his hand,—an old, discarded Springfield, with the sights filed down,—and wore a double cartridge-belt around his waist. For a moment he remained there, absolutely expressionless, his small, hard eyes boring into me. I thought he did not recognize me, when all at once his harsh, sudden voice shot out: \"That’s not the camera you had! Where’s the other one?\"",

While I waited for my laundry to dry down the hall on a blustery gray summer day, three different women walked past wearing traditional Samoan lavalava wrap skirts. I asked the last of them if there was a Polynesian-themed party going on, perhaps a luau for a visiting cruise ship. She told me that, no, a couple of dozen people had made the move from American Samoa a few years back, starting with a pastor who had felt called to serve the Lord in Alaska. It was a classic case of lighting out for the Alaskan territory, though in this case the pioneers had traveled five thousand miles northeast, from a South Seas paradise where I had swerved to avoid coconuts in the road to a town that owes its existence to the strategic value of its crappy weather. She said she was getting used to it and gave me the name of a store in Anchorage that sold taro root.",

He only just had time to give me a vague outline before they all piled out. Some were from the London press, some were from television, some were from the Australian papers. I hissed and snarled and ground my teeth at them. I stomped into the bushes and ordered them point-blank from behind a tree to put their cameras down. Rick told me later that I looked and behaved like a mad woman. Exactly what they had expected. I had washed my hair in a salty bore, so it stuck out of my head in a frizzed, bleached electric halo. I was frazzled and burnt black by the sun and I hadn’t been sleeping much in the last week or so, so that my eyes were piggy little slits, with brown sag beneath them. I had not recovered from the loss of Diggity and couldn’t handle this invasion of what looked to me then like inter-galactic war-lords. I was so adamant and so crazy that they shuffled their feet with embarrassment and did as they were told. I came back. And then, like a fool, I partially relented. Curiosity killed the cat. When I look back I marvel at myself. At what makes me instantly apologetic to people I have stood up to when they have been prepared to walk all over me. I still allowed no photos so one of them photographed my campfire. ‘Can’t go back with nothing, I’d get fired.’",

He was about the same distance away. As she turned, our elephant lowered her head while simultaneously pulling her ears back against her body. She then sped up bumped firmly into the adolescent elephant. The adolescent stumbled sideways, paused, and then received a second blow from our elephant. It was readily apparent that our elephant was pushing the adolescent in the opposite direction. She was saying, “Leave him alone; don’t go testing your manhood against him.” Perhaps she was even saying, “He’s one of ours.” Whatever the message, the adolescent understood. He walked obediently to the rear of the herd.",

Incredibly, she genuinely wanted him to go.\n\n“You love Virginia more than me,” he said, his heart suddenly hot with jealousy.\n\n“Oh Chris, don’t be silly,” said Catherine impatiently.",

On a hot Sunday forenoon I wandered all over the Centru, joining in the novel Sabbath pastime of window-shopping. To the Rumanians these displays afforded glimpses of a world hitherto only contacted through illicit pop music or smuggled Western magazines. Yet most goods were tacky, especially the Italian toys and ‘fancy goods’. Crowds thronged around every window, ooo-ing and aaa-ing, the children evidently not thinking of acquiring any toy but satisfied to be able to stare at them, wonderingly. Only around the very long Benetton windows – a recently opened store on a corner – was the atmosphere different. One wouldn’t of course expect Rumanians to be impressed by advertisements showing a tall handsome black man kissing a blonde, a slim slinky black girl caressing a blue-eyed Nordic giant and the usual row of elegantly-clad multi-racial children oozing mutual affection. I wished then I had a camera to record some of the expressions of indignation, horror, disgust, scorn or rage on all sorts of faces – the disgust more marked on women’s faces, the rage on men’s. In one of Europe’s most racist countries, how many garments will this gimmick sell? Yet it may do some good, young Rumanians being so prone to ape the West, by conveying the subliminal message that there racial equality is a respected ideal.",

She taught them about the Biafran flag. They sat on wooden planks and the weak morning sun streamed into the roofless class as she unfurled Odenigbo’s cloth flag and told them what the symbols meant. Red was the blood of the siblings massacred in the North, black was for mourning them, green was for the prosperity Biafra would have, and, finally, the half of a yellow sun stood for the glorious future. She taught them to raise their hand in the flying salute like His Excellency and she asked them to copy her drawings of the two leaders: His Excellency was burly, sketched with double lines, while Gowon’s effete body was outlined in single lines.",

When World War II broke out, T.’s mother and father, Italians who had emigrated to Scotland, were arrested in their Glasgow home and transported to Canada and interned for the duration. Her father's “crime,” T. says, was that one of his daughters had been seen in the company of Fascists. In fact, it was government policy to intern Italians. Perfectly blameless people were swept up in this way, caught by surprise. T.’s father did frequent an Italian “social club” (as did her mother—to learn to sew); but T., who was born in Canada and returned later to Scotland, is convinced that he would have been a partisan had he remained in Italy. (The past can be tamed, reshaped, controlled.)",

Although Patterson was an avowed socialist and McCormick was just an inch or so to the left of fascism, they worked surprisingly well together, and the paper prospered, doubling its circulation in their first decade of management. In 1919, the cousins launched the tabloid New York Daily News. Remarkably, for the first six years of its existence, they ran it from Chicago. Eventually Patterson went off to New York to focus on the Daily News, leaving McCormick in sole charge of the Tribune.",

The weather continued to worsen, and this forced us to seek shelter and descend from the mountain slope we were on, and plan for an early evacuation. Gale-force winds at fifty-one kilometres per hour started battering the mountains. This was another reminder that mountain weather is fickle and no matter how warm it is one moment, it can turn into a raging storm in minutes. Of course, I was disappointed that we had to cut our trip short by one day, but safety was the priority and there was no other way around this.",

These people moved from near Nam Noen in ’75 – in a bad way after a cholera epidemic. The bombing made their water dirty. Here they were hungry for years, with little land and only rain to water the rice. They were borrowing rice at 300 per cent interest, they were exploited with many children dying and no hope. Then the LWU got them a UNICEF “integrated rural development programme” and in ’92 they were given fifteen tons of rice. Their LWU leaders set up a rice bank charging low interest and in two years saved enough rice to sell and get money to build a reservoir and irrigation canals. Everyone gave free labour, even small children did small jobs! With water this ground is very fertile, now each hectare gives five tons – maybe more – and nobody is hungry and the children grow strong.’",
