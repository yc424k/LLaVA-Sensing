But it was too late now. Holmes was coming. Razors he might have got, but Rezia, who always did that sort of thing, had packed them. There remained only the window, the large Bloomsbury lodging-house window; the tiresome, the troublesome, and rather melodramatic business of opening the window and throwing himself out. It was their idea of tragedy, not his or Rezia’s (for she was with him). Holmes and Bradshaw liked that sort of thing. (He sat on the sill.) But he would wait till the very last moment. He did not want to die. Life was good. The sun hot. Only human beings? Coming down the staircase opposite an old man stopped and stared at him. Holmes was at the door. ‘I’ll give it you!’ he cried, and flung himself vigorously, violently down on to Mrs Filmer’s area railings.",

It resembles, like most of the settlements in Iceland, a kind of Lego town—rows of tiny, clean white boxes set out in geometric grids, with roofs of red and blue and green. Much of the country feels as if it were made for children—even the ponytailed boys and ring-nosed girls are pushing baby strollers—and Reykjavik might almost be a small child’s toy, as clean and perfect as a ship inside a bottle. Iceland is famous for having no mansions and no slums (“There is no architecture here,” complained W. H. Auden), in much the same way as its language has no accents and no dialects: with a population smaller than that of Colorado Springs, uniformity is not hard to achieve. And because nearly all the houses are geothermically heated, the city whose name means Smoky Bay shines silent in the smokeless air, as clear as if seen through panes of polished glass. Reykjavik is one place where it really is worth climbing the steeple of the highest church to see the city, mute and motionless, laid out against the silver sea.",

I stayed motionless, trusting that I was right where I needed to be, prickly weeds and all. Without the chug of my worry engine running, even the pain on my back was different. My former impulse was to gasp, brace, or complain to anyone within earshot, but no longer was it something to resist; it was something that was just so. A part of the experience. Now I could see that pain, either physical or emotional, is just another fact among facts: sky, grass, flowers, birds… pain. What compounds it into unmanageable proportions is the resistance—the Should’ves and Could’ves; the Why-Me’s and This-Shouldn’t-Be’s; the What Ifs, and the Fuck-This-Shits. But if you let it exist, because it eventually will for all of us, it doesn’t have the same power over you.

    "target_paragraph": "The taxi delivered everyone to his/her exact destination, which meant our driving to nine of the seventeen sections, and during this tour I stayed on board. Botshebelo’s few posh homes are breeze-block shoe-boxes, their tin roofs weighted with stones and tyres; the low hills to the north give scant protection from the frequent gales that drive dust into every crevice. Many live in tiny mud huts, crudely built, or (some 60 per cent) in ‘informal residences’ – one room, constructed of scraps of scavenged materials. Electricity is available in some sections but rarely affordable. The scarcity of litter is owing to an ANC anti-litter campaign which in this loyal-to-Madiba township has worked miracles. Ninety-five per cent of families must use the bucket sewage system and we passed two ‘sanitation’ tractors lurching along the rutted tracks, their trailers piled with black plastic buckets. Only three sections have a domestic water supply; the rest depend on one standpipe per street and since mid-November many of those have been dry. All the basic services deteriorated after the setting up of Botshebelo’s Transitional Local Council (TLC) and ‘the old guard’ within the Provincial Administration are suspected of trying to sabotage it.",

The stair by which I go to my room suggests possibilities, for it has been removed three inches from the wall by an earthquake, which also brought down the tall chimney of the boiling-house. Close by there are small, pretty frame-houses for the overseer, bookkeeper, sugar boiler, and machinist; a store, the factory, a pretty native church near the edge of the cliff, and quite a large native village below. It looks green and bright, and the atmosphere is perfect, with the cool air coming down from the mountains, and a soft breeze coming up from the blue dreamy ocean. Behind the house the uplands slope away to the colossal Mauna Kea. The actual, dense, impenetrable forest does not begin for a mile and a half from the coast, and its broad dark belt, extending to a height of 4000 feet, and beautifully broken, throws out into greater brightness the upward glades of grass and the fields of sugar-cane.",

Cold tracks to be walking on at this time of night.\nNorth of the frozen little Northern town a couple walking side by side on the tracks. It is Yogi Johnson walking with the squaw. As they walk Yogi Johnson silently strips off his garments. One by one he strips off his garments, and casts them beside the track. In the end he is clad only in a worn pair of pump-maker shoes. Yogi Johnson, naked in the moonlight, walking North beside the squaw. The squaw striding along beside him. She carries the papoose on her back in his bark cradle. Yogi attempts to take the papoose from her. He would carry the papoose. The husky dog whines and licks at Yogi Johnson’s ankles. No, the squaw would carry the papoose herself. On they stride. Into the North. Into the Northern night.\nBehind them come two figures. Sharply etched in the moonlight. It is the two Indians. The two woods Indians. They stoop and gather up the garments Yogi Johnson has cast away. Occasionally, they grunt to one another. Striding softly along in the moonlight. Their keen eyes not missing a single cast-off garment. When the last garment has been cast off they look and see far ahead of them the two figures in the moonlight. The two Indians straighten up. They examine the garments.\n“White chief snappy dresser,” the tall Indian remarks, holding up an initialled shirt.\n“White chief going get pretty cold,” small Indian remarks. He hands a vest to the tall Indian. The tall Indian rolls all the clothing, all the cast-off garments, into a bundle, and they start back along the tracks to the town.\n“Better keep clothes for white chief or sellem Salvation Army?” asks the short Indian.\n“Better sellem Salvation Army,” the tall Indian grunts. “White chief maybe never come back.”\n“White chief come back all right,” grunted the little Indian.\n“Better sellem Salvation Army, anyway,” grunts the tall Indian. “White chief need new clothes, anyhow, when spring comes.”\nAs they walked down the tracks toward town, the air seemed to soften. The Indians walk uneasily now. Through the tamaracks and cedars beside the railway tracks a warm wind is blowing. The snow-drifts are melting now beside the tracks. Something stirs inside the two Indians. Some urge. Some strange pagan disturbance. The warm wind is blowing. The tall Indian stops, moistens his finger and holds it up in the air. The little Indian watches. “Chinook?” he asks.\n“Heap chinook,” the tall Indian says. They hurry on toward town. The moon is blurred now by clouds carried by the warm chinook wind that is blowing.\n“Want to get in town before rush,” the tall Indian grunts.\n“Red brothers want be well up in line,” the little Indian grunts anxiously.\n“Nobody work in factory now,” the tall Indian grunted.\n“Better hurry.”\nThe warm wind blows. Inside the Indians strange longings were stirring. They knew what they wanted. Spring at last was coming to the frozen little Northern town. The two Indians hurried along the track.",

The place reminds me of a medieval castle, and is entered by crossing a drawbridge over a saltwater moat. Skinny windows in the brick stare at one crossing the drawbridge, behind which guards armed with muskets must have once stood.\nThe long halls of Fort Jefferson run the length of each side of the brick building. The floors are dusty grey slate, large squares and rectangles of differing sizes fit together like some simple puzzle. Brick columns, square edged, protrude from brick walls and support brick arches. The bricks are red, brown, black, white, or some combination of these colors. Large openings where windows would have been installed had the fort ever been finished look out across a shallow moat to the bright blue waters of the Florida Straits, a meeting place of the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the mighty Atlantic Ocean. There are no walls on the side of the halls facing into the large grassy courtyard. With these openings, on both sides, the halls of Fort Jefferson are well-lit and ventilated.",

Gustavo, the lad who had tutored him for all those many months, had been staying on the ranch but had gone to town for the evening and was not expected back until the following day. As a precaution, Juan Guillermo decided to spend the night in the room Gustavo had been using. Asleep at midnight, he was startled awake by a strange sound at the front door, followed moments later by a noise at his window. Someone was trying to pry open the shutters. Taking a revolver from beneath his pillow, he waited silently in the darkness. A crashing sound filled the room. Without hesitation, he fired into the shadows, certain that the intruder had come to murder him. Then he heard the words that would haunt him for the rest of his life:",

After unbolting the port winch from the deck (there were only two winches on Sobrius) I removed the snap ring at the top and the winch body slid off the gear assembly inside. I laid all the pieces out, in the order in which I removed them, on paper towels on the small table in the galley. Everything got cleaned with WD40, then sprayed with Corrosion X, dried, and lubricated with marine grease. This process reminded me of my time working on bicycles, from another life.\nThe winch project took up the first half of January 9th, and the second half of the day I spent rebuilding the head with a rebuild kit. This was a fairly easy process, and in the end the head worked perfectly. After this I went shopping and provisioned Sobrius for the journey home with canned soup and chili, canned fruit, nuts, crackers, energy bars, apples, bananas, olives, peperoni, V8, and fruit juice.",

Placido has a friend with him and they are beginning to train the falcon. He asks if they can go out on our land to practice. I try not to show the extent of my fear. “Ho paura,” I admit, thinking how accurate the Italian is: I have fear. Mistake. He steps forward with the twitchy bird, inviting me to take it on my arm; surely I won’t be afraid if I see the magnificence of this creature. Ed comes downstairs and steps between us. Even he is somewhat alarmed. My phobia gradually has rubbed off on him. But we are happy that our Placido feels neighborly enough toward the stranieri to come over, and we walk out to the far point of land with him. His friend takes the bird and stands about fifty feet away. Placido removes something from his pocket. The falcon extends its wings—a formidable span—and flaps madly, rising up on his talons.",

The light from the long, wide, mullioned window opposite shone in upon his nook, and, assisted by a secondary light of cold blue quality which shone down the chimney, enabled him to read there easily whenever disposed to do so. Between Clare and the window was the table at which his companions sat, their munching profiles rising sharp against the panes; while to the rear was the milk-house door, through which were visible the rectangular leads in rows, full to the brim with the morning’s milk. At the farther end the great churn could be seen revolving, and its slip-slopping heard – the moving power being discernible through the window in the form of a spiritless horse walking in a circle and driven by a boy.",

The big storm that had blown the Karluk away had blanketed everything with a layer of snow that insulated the ice and prevented it from freezing hard. On one occasion, they found themselves on very thin ice that buckled beneath their weight. It began to break and the sled was partway underwater—but the dogs pulled for all they were worth, and they managed to make it safely ashore on the other side. Stefansson thought it was mostly a matter of luck that they lost neither the sled nor any of their lives.",

Her only idea of intercourse with her kind was to organize it into bands and subject it to frequent displacements; and society smiled at her for these exertions like an infant vigorously rocked. She saw at once Undine’s value as a factor in her scheme, and the two formed an alliance on which Ralph refrained from shedding the cold light of depreciation. It was a point of honour with him not to seem to disdain any of Undine’s amusements: the noisy interminable picnics, the hot promiscuous balls, the concerts, bridge-parties and theatricals which helped to disguise the difference between the high Alps and Paris or New York. He told himself that there is always a Narcissus-element in youth, and that what Undine really enjoyed was the image of her own charm mirrored in the general admiration. With her quick perceptions and adaptabilities she would soon learn to care more about the quality of the reflecting surface; and meanwhile no criticism of his should mar her pleasure.",

The state’s oil reserves were dwindling, and the price per barrel had collapsed, crippling the regional economy. Alaska faced a difficult choice: double down and open protected wilderness areas for drilling, which climate scientists argued was the opposite of what should be done in light of alarming warming trends; or move on to the Next Big Thing, whatever that might be, as the state always had.",

Beau’s college roommate Paul, temporarily his bunkmate again in a roomette, arrived shortly before lunch and recounted the effect his sister posing as a Playboy centerfold had on his college years, in the early 1970s. “As you’d imagine, the subject did come up occasionally,” he said.",

On either side of the road were neat two-storey houses: some constructed with blackened wood, others built of faded timber beams and brick walls smoothed over with plaster the colour of egg custard. The gardens were filled with trees, and bougainvillea hung down from the verandahs. On each front porch there was an earthenware jar of water with plastic cups so that passers-by could take a drink. A woman holding a child by each hand strolled by with an enormous cabbage balanced on her head. Two elderly women sat on the front steps of their wooden house smoking cheroots that seemed to me as thick as rolling pins. Every so often a truck thundered down the road, piled high with logs. Mostly, however, the traffic consisted of trishaws and pony carts painted in the bright reds, blues and yellows of a child’s colouring book.",

Her nose has a crusty scab on it, healing, and the backs of her ears are pitted with scars, layered beneath new bloody ridges from the yellow flies. Even now I can see at least ten swarming around her. She flicks her ears irritably and hisses, attempting to snap at one of them. Then she sighs miserably, lies her head back down on her paws, and waits. Her pupils contract, making her eyes soft again.
