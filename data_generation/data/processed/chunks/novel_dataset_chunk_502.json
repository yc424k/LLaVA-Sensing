Beyond the square, and past the café, the path split in two directions, neither of which looked particularly interesting. Teresa had a plan, so I let her lead the way. We followed a narrow alley lined with storefronts and doorways shuttered behind steel gates. The alley twisted right and left, and as we walked further into the maze the buildings closed over the road. The blue sky disappeared behind sun-bleached, green awnings and oversized roofs of corrugated steel. The sound of our footsteps echoed off the stone walls around us like the opening scene of a film noir.",

Sixty blows in a single beating were enough to kill a man. The authorities ordered Dostoyevsky flogged twice in prison—once for complaining about a “lump of filth” in a fellow prisoner’s soup, and once for saving another prisoner from drowning after he had been ordered not to. The second flogging put him in the hospital, and when he got out and rejoined the other convicts, they nicknamed him Pokoinik, the deceased.",

Diggity’s feet were pin-cushioned with bindy-eye prickles, so I heaved her up on to Dookie’s back. She hated it, and stared off into the distance, sighing dramatically, with that long-suffering look common to brainwashed dogs. My own feet were blistered and aching, and my legs cramped up as soon as I stopped walking. Zeleika had a large lump which distended her milk vein and her nose-peg was infected. Dookie’s saddle was rubbing him slightly but he stepped high and seemed, unlike the others, to be thoroughly enjoying himself. I suspected he had always wanted to travel.",

Here and there among the mounds stand figures carved out of the soft volcanic rock who stare at the visitors, and at the still lake in which fish do not live, and at the stained wooden buildings of Osorezan Bodaiji. They wear red aprons that have faded to a yellowish pink and caps that give them the appearance of costers. The wind and rain have blown so long against their faces that, though they stare, they stare without eyes. It is said that blind witches live on the mountain and that these witches can speak with the spirits of the dead.",

It took me nearly two hours to reach the town’s outskirts, and another hour to walk along the endless front to the center, by which time I was tired and limping. I got a room in a small hotel on the front and spent a long time lying on the bed, booted and still condomed, before I could summon the strength to change into something less obviously mirth making, have a light wash, and hit the town.",

It rose high and dark and somber above the sunny meadow that stretched all around. While unlocking the door, our guide swung into her narrative about how this church had been built in the town of Zashiversk in 1700 on the Indigirka River far to the northeast; and how in those days trade fairs for all northern Siberia took place in that town; and how after a fair a mysterious wooden trunk was left behind, and a local shaman warned the villagers that the trunk was cursed and they should take the trunk and cut a hole in the ice and throw the trunk in it, but the church’s priest said it would be better to throw the shaman himself through the ice, so the people opened the trunk, and the curse came out, and the church’s entire congregation fell ill and died of smallpox, except for one girl who survived; and how the town was then abandoned, and soon only the church remained, perfectly preserved; and how the church was then discovered by A. P. Okladnikov, the famous anthropologist, and other scientists on an expedition from Akademgorodok in the twentieth century; and how the scientists had the church brought here in pieces and reconstructed so that everybody could see what a beautiful wooden church in far northern Siberia looked like long ago. To move and reassemble the church cost so much, she said, that each log might as well have been made of gold. Galina added that when the scientists were first taking apart the church, they found the body of the girl who had survived the smallpox, frozen in the ice beneath the altar. She was wearing a beautiful dress and many costly jewels.",

Some of the design styles survived, but wayo as an artistic style died out, and most calligraphy we now see is karayo. Today, ‘non-individual’ has negative connotations, but the ‘supra-individual’ world of calm and elegance created by the wayo calligraphers was one of Japan’s great achievements. The Chinese, ceaselessly trying to express their individuality, never produced anything like it.",

Lastly, we entered the “Grand Hotel” where we waited in the lobby for a virtual train ride.

But he and Katharine were alone together, aloft, splendid, and luminous with a twofold radiance.

To be president of the United States and not accomplish anything is, after all, a kind of accomplishment in itself.",

It was too happy, this wandering alone together on those blessed solitary sands–too, too happy, after the dark torments of the week, to risk spoiling it. Let her say what she liked. Let her coo away about being friends; in another moment she would probably assure him that she would like to be his sister, his own dear sister, or his mother to whom he could always turn in trouble, or some absurd female relation of that sort. He wouldn’t stop her. He would only listen and laugh inside himself. His Catherine. His love. As sure as she walked there, as sure as there behind her, reaching farther and farther back, was a double ribbon of her little wobbly footprints in the sand, she was his love. And presently she too would know it, and all the sister and mother and friend talk go the way such talk always went, and be remembered some day only with wonder and smiles.",

At altitude, on a clear day, the sky was no longer the flat ceiling of the lowlands, but an opulent cobalt ocean, so sensuously deep that some travellers felt themselves falling up into it. Looking at it, you could be bowled over by what one traveller – lost, like so many, for words – described as ‘an inexpressible sensation of immensity’. On reaching an Alpine pass in 1782 the German Leonard Meister was overwhelmed by the new sense of space. ‘Inspired, I raised my face to the sun; my eyes drank in the infinite space; I was shaken by a divine shudder; and in deep reverence I sank down.’",

Inside, through a low gate, was a central courtyard where two young monks, in red, were seated at a folding table, as if selling tickets to a high-school prom. I handed over some banknotes—quite a few—and one of the boys got up, pulling his robes about his shoulders, and motioned for me to follow him through a low opening into the next courtyard, and a prayer hall. Inside, like all the chapels of Tibet, it was dark. Candles flickered in the little rooms that led off from the main chamber, and the air was thick and dark with the smell of melted butter, the dust, the incense of centuries. Through the gloom I could see a few faded murals, and as I wandered among the chanting figures I slipped, more than once, on ground made uncertain by years of melted yak butter.",

We explored the tombs on our own. Immediately inside the tomb entrances the air temperature dropped by ten degrees or so, but the air was stale and heavy. We struggled to breathe while we marveled at the colorful illustrations and intricate engravings. Their craftsmanship equaled anything we had seen from Giza to Cairo to Luxor. Except here, the work was far better preserved; it looked much as it did during the New Kingdom. The colors were vivid though gaudy and repetitive. We walked carefully, and stopped to admire the scenes that covered every surface in the tombs. As we climbed slowly down the long, wooden ramps the air grew heavier and warmer. My tongue detected a faint metallic taste that I could neither recognize nor enjoy; it was acrid and grew increasingly unpleasant by the minute. The ramps descended deeper into the tombs, and we had to duck in some places to avoid the low ceilings (hard stone surfaces against which the ancient cutting tools were no match). Some of the tombs included large antechambers or side rooms that once held stacks of mummies and urns and clothing and papyri scrolls. Anything that wasn’t looted in antiquity has since been relocated to museums and warehouses around the world, Mohamed explained afterward. I asked whether they had “top men working on it right now” but he didn’t understand my cinematic reference (Major Eaton from Raiders of the Lost Ark).",

The Gate (later demolished) stood beside what is now the museum’s building. In the 1930s a Palestinian architect, Anton Baramski, designed this stone mansion, giving it impressive ornamental columns and tall arched windows – defaced by concrete walls with firing slits when the Haganah took over in December 1947. The Baramski family and all their middle-class Palestinian neighbours were quickly forced into exile, hardly given time to pack a suitcase. Since then this mansion has been known to Israelis as the Tour Jeman Post; it served as a military base until 1967 and its façade remains war-scarred.",

(The world’s biggest national park is in northeastern Greenland, if you happen to be in the neighborhood.) The town of Yakutat is a little larger than Gustavus, population-wise (662 as of the last census), but more spread out. What had looked on my phone to be a short walk from my B & B to the Park Service office turned out to be several miles, so I stuck out my thumb and tried to hail a ride. Fifteen minutes went by and not one vehicle passed. I went back to the inn and borrowed one of the bicycles in the yard, which turned out to have a wonky chain that fell off every quarter mile or so.",

I was struck by the fact that these soldiers had their hair cut in Western fashion in contrast to all other Tibetans. The thirteenth Dalai Lama had probably been favourably impressed by the appearance of British and Indian troops during his stay in India and had modelled his bodyguard on them. The officers lived in nice little bungalows with flowerbeds blooming all round them. The duties of officers and men were easy. They consisted mainly in mounting guard and turning out to march in ceremonial processions.",
