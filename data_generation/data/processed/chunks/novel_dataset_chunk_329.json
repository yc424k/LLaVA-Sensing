For one thing, some of his portion of food rations was with them, as was his best parka. The one he was wearing had a rip so large he feared it was beyond repair, unless Auntie had some extra skins. But McKinlay didn’t feel right leaving Munro and this band of invalids, at least not until they were all improved. And he wasn’t yet strong enough for the sixty-mile trek himself. He often thought of Mamen and wondered how he and the others were getting along down south, but there were enough challenges here at Icy Spit to occupy him. The fuel oil was so low that soon they’d need to cook and boil water outside on the wood fire. This presented great difficulty in wind and snowstorms. The bear meat was down to two days’ rations. It would be just pemmican and tea unless Hadley and Kuraluk—the only two fit enough to hunt—could find game.",

My friends were in a hurry to get to their post, but they found the hotel car for me—a battered, rusty vehicle—and put me into it and waved goodbye. I liked what I saw of the town on the way to the hotel. The train had made an abrupt descent from the highland into an appealingly lush, tropical country, full of flowers and trees and big white-plastered houses and smaller adobe ones. There were palms along the coast road, and I caught a strong whiff of the sea. It was a true port city, full of shops and people of all sorts. After months of living in a backwoods community where everyone was a member of a neighborhood tribe, I was stirred with sudden delight at the sight of so many different people—Indian, African, Arab, European, even Chinese—sauntering about to catch the evening breeze. Then I remembered that I would have to leave all this almost as soon as I'd discovered it, and the old regret rushed in once more.",

It is six days’ march from Phari to Kampa Dzong, the Tibetan hill-fort through which Younghusband’s army passed en route to Lhasa. Six days over high sepia deserts. Like all deserts, these ones are cold and calm in the early mornings when they wake; by lunchtime the heat is rampant, shimmering up in waves ahead, glaring off the surfaces of rock rubble, creating a furnace hot enough to strip away the skin on one’s cheeks. In the afternoon the wind stirs itself, and stirs too the tons and tons of dust which lie loosely on the ground. At night tailless rats scutter about unnervingly on the groundsheets of their tents, and the temperature hurtles downwards. The mountains which edge the deserts are bosomy in profile, cleaved by long-vanished glaciers and river gulches, shaley in texture, the higher ones striated horizontally with snow.",

The analyses of the Kashmir situation which I had been reading endlessly in newspapers had no relation to the problem as the Kashmiris saw it. The most anti-Indian people in the Valley were Punjabi Muslim settlers, often in high positions; to them Kashmiris were ‘cowardly’, ‘greedy’; and they often came to the hotel with rumours of troop movements, mutinies and disasters on the frontier. To their politics the Kashmiris brought not self-interest but their gifts of myth and wonder; and their myths centred on one man, Sheikh Abdullah, the Lion of Kashmir, as Mr Nehru had called him. He had made the Kashmiris free; he was their leader; he had been friendly to India but had ceased to be friendly, and since 1953 had been, except for a few months, in jail. From Kashmiris I could get no more; I could get no glimpse of the leader’s achievements, personality or appeal. Over and over I was told, as if in explanation of everything, that when he came out of prison in 1958, there were crowds along the road from Kud to Srinagar, and red carpets everywhere.",

The many alimentara stocked the usual thousands of repellant jars, tins and bottles. The general magazins displayed four saucepans in one twenty-yard-long window, two jackets and a few shirts in another, six leatherette belts and an umbrella in a third – and so on. A fast-moving queue signalled the presence of bread; having secured a stale kilo loaf I did not have to queue for the tin of blackberry jam bought to enliven it. On my way back I passed a Gypsy girl peddlar standing on a street corner calling her wares – ‘Antibebi pills! Antibebi pills!’ I lingered at a little distance, wondering who might be her customers; but all the young women passing on their way to work had too much sense to risk a purchase.",

The waiting area was lined with rows of seating, glass walls, and a television monitor. Except for the hum of air-conditioning, the room was silent. Our fellow passengers kept to themselves; some dozed off, others scanned their phones. We took our seats, and Teresa put her head on my shoulder. “It’s cold,” she said, as she closed her eyes for a nap. I glanced around the room and inspected the men and women who would soon travel to England with us. Their skin was pale and clear, their shoes polished, and their clothes pressed. I wondered where they had been, and what they had seen. I wondered how long they had been in Egypt. I wondered whether they ever left their air-conditioned tour buses and luxury resorts and buffet tables. I scoffed under my breath: tourists! Soon, the public address system buzzed and clicked, and a gate agent announced that it was time to go.",

Their dream was to drown all their memories of the war and create new lives as dairy farmers. In 1927, Tichen traveled to Hamburg to buy a Holstein cow. By chance, he ran into a zoo owner who persuaded him to try instead an Indian zebu, the ideal breed for a tropical climate. Tichen gambled on the man’s word and returned with Palomo, the first zebu bull ever to graze on the grasses of Colombia. From modest beginnings, Enrique remarked, great things arise. Tichen had wisely named his bull after Simón Bolívar’s favorite horse, surely an auspicious move. Today, the country ranks seventh in the world in beef production, with no fewer than twenty-four million head of cattle, the progeny of an immigrant’s dream.",

Coptic monks rubbed shoulders with Jewish glassblowers, Persian silk traders and Gepid mercenaries who had walked to the city after padding across the ice of the frozen Danube. In the city’s great markets and bazaars, Aramaic-speaking Syrians would haggle with Latin-speaking North Africans, Armenian architects and Herule slave traders who knew only some debased dialect of Old German. Goldsmiths, silversmiths, jewellers, ivory carvers, workers in inlay and enamel, weavers of brocade, sculptors and mosaicists all found ready markets for their wares. Already, by the second quarter of the fifth century, the city boasted five imperial and nine princely palaces, eight public and 153 private bath houses; by the time of Justinian there were over three hundred monasteries within its walls.",

Prisoners who had lived in barracks like this reported that the stove usually heated a radius of fifteen to eighteen feet. As this building was maybe thirty feet from end to end, areas of it must have always been cold. From inside you could see the logs that the walls were made of. The cracks between the logs had been chinked with moss. The barracks space had been divided into several rooms, with bunks set into the walls. The bunks also were made of bare planks—some planed on both sides, some planed on only one. Planks with the bark still on them had been fitted into the bunks so that the bark side faced down.",

A thirty-year-old father and twenty-five-year-old mother, likely by now to have three, four or even five children, were aged eight and three when the first Intifada began. Although that was a largely non-violent movement on the Palestinian side, the routine IDF responses were disproportionate and indiscriminate, not conducive to children’s developing self-control and a respect for authority. And then, during that age group’s adolescence came the savagery of the second Intifada.",

    "target_paragraph": "Light dawned over another land. The dusty plains had gone. Vahid too, at some time in the night, had gone. Through eyes swollen half shut I gazed out at the hard plateaux of the Turkic world, rolling their brown grass into a changeless sky. I leant outside to cool my inflamed face. Through the hills in front, our multicoloured carriages moved like a harlequin snake, obscenely bright.\nHalf an hour later I stumbled out on to the platform at Maragheh, and into the first hotel I saw. On its lobby wall the trio of ruling clerics had shrunk to two, the hardline Khamenei surviving alone while the dead Khomeini loured behind him like an angry ghost. In these poor rooms–along with the Koran, the prayer-mat and the sacred stone–a lonely touch of the past surfaced: a hung carpet, perhaps, or some faded plasterwork.\nAnxious, hunting for a dentist, I tramped the grid of streets between the hills and a thin river. I felt faint, my own footsteps far away. Under the dusty chestnut trees I became aware of a harsher world. The food stalls were shut for Ramadan and gangs of out-of-work youths were marching the pavements. Their stubbled beards seemed to stem more from poverty than faith. Through my pain-blurred nerves I imagined some unexpended force, even threat. The Persian suavity had gone.\nI found two dentists in a tiled alley. Off their waiting room one door led to the male dentist, the other to the female, and nobody mingled. In the mirror my abscess was erupting like a livid anemone. It hung in my upper jaw above the failing tooth. My smile, when I tried it, was a slit in a mask. The only other patients were two green-faced women with handkerchiefs clamped to their mouths.\nI had hoped for an elderly practitioner, a leftover Armenian perhaps, who would probe tenderly into my mouth, disperse the abscess and send me away with an antibiotic. Instead the male door opened on a stocky mechanic with a crew cut. He beamed welcome. I said in a panic that I didn’t want a tooth extracted. But he spoke no English. In the basement an old man worked an antique X-ray machine. On its photograph my tooth looked like a rotted mandrake, its roots coagulated. The dentist held this to the light, and murmured foreboding. Then he motioned me to his divan–patients lie here, they do not sit–and chose his instruments. He gave no anaesthetic. Overhead a lamp shed a baleful pool For two hours he drilled and dug and chiselled, first at one tooth, then at its neighbour, and I had no idea what he was doing. From time to time he realigned my head left or right by pulling my nose. He seemed to be grinding my skull with pumice stone. I mewed again that I wanted to keep my tooth, most of my teeth, any teeth, but he only grinned uncomprehendingly, and went on excavating with the help of medieval-looking tongs and files, while I tried to recall what instruments my London dentist used.\nSlowly the ache of my abscess turned into the raw pain of whatever he was doing. He chattered to me in Turki and once, with a spark of hope, I heard the word ‘root canal’. Then he stopped for another X-ray. He was looking bewildered. My heart sank. He motioned me to rest, take a walk. An hour later I was on his rack again. But something had changed.\nOne by one, three colleagues in chadors filtered in. Their heads circled close above me, fascinated, as if a Western mouth might be different from an Iranian one. Then they started to hand out instruments and murmur suggestions. Their headscarves turned them sleek as seals. There was a pretty one who scowled, and a homely one who smiled, and one who had no expression at all. Finally, heretically, from the circle of murmuring seals, a woman dentist took over. For another hour she picked delicately into my gums, refining something which the man had been unable to do. Beneath her chador and surgical mask only a pair of spectacles gleamed, like headlights in a fog. The man stood back, with no visible shame, while she filled my root canals.\nIn the end, when someone produced a mirror, I did not know what I would see. For an instant I expected a landscape of cracked incisors and a cave where the tooth had been. Or perhaps, after this four-hour ordeal, I would see a mouth surgically transformed. But when I looked, all seemed perplexingly the same. Only the sac of the abscess hung empty, and the pain had gone.",

    "target_paragraph": "Despite the high sea running the lagoon itself was calm save for a slight swell. The wind was north which meant that the western headland took the full force of the sea and sent down the smooth lolling aftertow into the bay. The spring water was cold and pained one – as a drink of iced wine will hurt the back of the throat – but it was delicious. I abandoned myself to the running tide, not swimming, but simply keeping afloat, to be drawn smoothly out into the bay from where the whole screen of luminous mountains was visible. The sun had cleared them now and they were taking on that throbbing dark mauve which inhabits the heart of a violet. The trees had turned silver and the slices of corn-land to the east gleamed kingcup-yellow and shone like bugles. I let myself be drawn slowly but surely towards the little mosque, which glittered before me as if carved from rock-salt, but veined by the winter damps in a dozen tones of grey and yellow. The Hodja stood watching me from his balcony with his cat in his arms – a patch of vivid black like a raven’s wing. I raised my hand in a salute and he answered it at once. Then he turned and walked down the path to the seashore to wait for me as I drifted unhurriedly towards the pitted and perforated shelf of rock which prevented the full force of the sea from exploding on the walls of the mosque. Hereabouts it was as if some great rock-carpenter had been busy, carving out shelf upon shelf of metamorphic limestone, and stepping them downwards to the sandy bottom of the lagoon, three fathoms deep. Once jagged and serrated like teeth, these tables had been ground smoothly down and papered over with brilliant fucus and immense wigs of seaweed which stirred like gonfalons in the movements of the current. The top of this natural table was full of rock-pools, flushed out by the lazy tides, and abounding in shrimp and crab and the smaller varieties of fish. The capri­cious tides threw them up on to these stone tables and fell back, to leave them marooned, and here the barefoot shepherds roamed occasionally to see what they might capture for the pot.",

It’s wonderful and rewarding work but she would rather be shut up in a little cell and meditating. Eventually this nunnery will contain little huts for women from all over the world to do just that. In quiet hills away from cares and worries, it will become a safe space for consciousness-cleansing in long retreats. Maybe when I’m more disciplined I’ll return. I can’t imagine being able to meditate for months—I still shudder at some of the recollections of my ten days at Vipassana.",

But there are tiles on the floor, which are always cold. There’s a double bed with a real mattress. There are shelves, a chair, hooks on the walls for my things. There’s a couch made of folded-over foam. There’s a family of rats in the roof and a porcupine that visits at three a.m. to eat the brick. There’s a tiny spot between bushes, just off the path, which I use as a toilet, with dung beetles that clear away any mess. “I love it,” I whisper.",

And their scrutiny was inescapable. I was in a car accident at age seven that left a scar on my lip that plastic surgery reduced to a minuscule mark. Americans hardly ever notice it, but I have yet to meet the Russian woman who hasn’t asked about it upon first acquaintance and then tried to cover it up with her lipstick.

The supper which had been cooking on the hearth when he entered at dusk had not even been taken up, what was left of it long since charred and simmered away and probably almost cool now among the fading embers. He set the skillet and coffee pot aside and with a stick of wood he raked the ashes from one corner of the fireplace, exposing the bricks, and touched one of them with his wet finger. It was hot, not scorching, searing, but possessing a slow, deep solidity of heat, a condensation of the two years during which the fire had burned constantly above it, a condensation not of fire but of time, as though not the fire’s dying and not even water would cool it but only time would. He prised the brick up with his knife blade and scraped away the warm dirt under it and lifted out a small metal dispatch box which his white grandfather, Carothers McCaslin himself, had owned almost a hundred years ago, and took from it the knotted rag tight and solid with the coins, some of which dated back almost to Carothers McCaslin’s time, which he had begun to save before he was ten years old. His wife had removed only her shoes (he recognised them too. They had belonged to the white woman who had not died, who had not even ever existed.) before lying down. He put the knotted rag into one of them and went to the walnut bureau which Isaac McCaslin had given him for a wedding present and took his razor from the drawer.",

They had lived in the suburbs of Rotterdam for twenty years, the man explained in Dutch, and had ‘seen a lot of changes’, but were proud of their city’s ability to mix people from ‘different countries, different cultures, different religions’. The march offered an opportunity to celebrate and defend that diversity. I was interested to hear their views and steered the conversation carefully until it landed on the subject of the latest figurehead of Dutch anti-immigrationists, another populist whose strident criticism of Islam had earned him death threats of his own, along with the passionate support of a sizable slice of society. ‘Nooooow,’ the man said, in the drawn-out way with which the Dutch would often exclaim, enlongating his vowels until the word sounded like a saw rasping through wood. ‘It’s true that there are some problems with the Moroccans, but he goes too far. Pim Fortuyn never hated people, he even slept with Muslims. But this one, he is much more nasty.’ ‘I think he’s just awful,’ his wife interjected. ‘More like a Nazi.’",

He is blond, with a strong and handsome face that would not be out of place on an old coin, she light and slim, with brown, quick, smiling eyes. Around their table pass sparkling cherry wine, additional wines from varietal grapes, wines they have made from berries in Eagle, wild-cranberry ketchup, baked salmon, mincemeat made from moose. From under the gable at one end of the cabin protrudes a pair of moose antlers fifty-six inches tip to tip, truly a mighty rack. Greene was humming along in his orange Volkswagen bug one day when the moose stuck its nose out over the road. He has shot spruce grouse from the VW, opening the door and firing a .22. In like manner, with a .30—’06, he dropped the big moose.",

After this attempt at a meal I took the satellite phone outside to call my wife. She was sick, as were my son and daughter, all laid up with the flu.
