Or maybe we just went the wrong way, I’m not really sure. In the end, we stumbled upon a tree-lined patio on the edge of an open pit where a massive section of the old fortress erupted from the bowels of Coptic Cairo. From the pit, a round tower rose several stories over the old riverbank, which itself was about twenty feet below the patio. The tower, with its double walls and arched windows, must have stood a hundred feet wide. The tower ringed a courtyard, but I couldn’t see what lay at the bottom, it was too deep and dark. Defensive walls stretched out from the tower, beneath our feet, and across Coptic Cairo. I was surprised by the size and complexity of the fortress. The modern buildings and roads that surround Coptic Cairo dwarf the old fortress, but, in its time, the old fortress would have dwarfed the huts and lanes that surrounded it.",

Several of his friends dropped by and gave him a hand for a couple of hours, but Dave was there every day. The Monitor wind vane was the hardest. It took hours to get all the lifting ropes just right to position it on the stern and then even more drilling and sealing of all the through bolts for the mounting. What a strange-looking metal contraption he thought, as he stepped back to look at his new wind vane. He knew he would have to do a lot of experimenting with it, as this contraption was going to be steering Lone Eagle all the way to Australia.",

The soil was concrete-hard, just dust and rocks, back-breaking work for men who would earn next to nothing but were swinging their picks energetically. In a country where there is high unemployment, any work is welcome.\nOur route passed the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton, taking the first steps towards creating the next generation of the British monarchy.\nHalf an hour later, we were at Archers Post, a small straggly settlement which, if you pinpoint it on a map of Kenya, is almost exactly at the centre. (Incidentally, I compared the outline of Kenya with the outline of France – they are both hexagonal and remarkably similar.)",

All roads leading to the park were closed by barbed-wire barricades and trucks, and as I walked towards the park I found the area almost deserted. Across the road from one of the park gates, a small huddle of onlookers stood on tiptoe, craning their necks for a glimpse of the parade. I nudged my way to the front of the crowd, but there was nothing to see. Tall trees around the edge of the park obstructed any view of the events going on inside, and soldiers patrolled the park’s perimeter to make sure that passing pedestrians kept their distance. The only hint of any activity inside were the thunderous sound of thousands of boots stomping up and down and the occasional glint of a bayonet, glimpsed through the trees.",

He may have known the Emperor too well, and been glad to die finally because of it; or perhaps he was seeing farther than that; there was certainly no happiness in looking back, to any immediate past.

Horrified bystanders pleaded with Bouyeri to stop, as van Gogh (in perhaps the most Dutch response to being murdered imaginable) cried out: ‘Surely we can talk about this!’ Ignoring his victim’s pleas, Bouyeri shot him a couple more times before producing a knife and sawing at his throat until the filmmaker was nearly beheaded.

Barbara’s husband was still at his barbershop. She tucked the children into the bed they shared—an old mattress on a hardwood floor—and kissed them one by one. Then she walked into the only room with a door and locked it behind her. A shot rang out moments later. The eldest daughter pounded on the door and, when she heard no response, gathered her brothers and sisters and herded them next door, where Tía and Tío lived (the ones I thought to be my grandparents).",

It is customary, when you ask a question here, for the local to talk total codswallop rather than say they don’t know. They really must never say they don’t know. That would be letting you down and embarrassing for all concerned. It’s much better to say any old crap and send you on a merry chase. This particular merry chase took me past a small discount shoe shop, where I found a good new pair of well cushioned walking shoes. The shoes I was wearing were finished. Eventually I ended up in the Night Bazaar, which is a major tourist trap/attraction, depending how you look at it.",

Instead, I stifle my relief and walk to the passenger side. I wish I could have come up with something pithy, some words befitting the magnitude of the whole scene. A couple of months ago I wouldn’t have bet my last bag of nuts and bolts that we’d be here, let alone about to drive through Beijing. Instead, I force myself to open my mouth, and out come words of utter banality. “So, I guess this is it,” I say with feigned composure. “Time to hit the road, honey.” That’s the thing about extraordinary times. Sometimes all you want to do is diminish them to the ordinary, make them mundane so you don’t have to come to grips with all the strange things that could happen next.",

There’ll still be the lighting switches on the walls everyone remembers, and new palms have been planted where old ones had to come down. Yet guests will not now be kept up late at night by the click-clack of high-heel shoes on the floors above them. As he leads me around the dusty outlines of the new property, the front office manager, Bernd Knaier, explains how “many people say, ‘I love your squeaky wooden floors. I love your box TVs. I love your fans.’ But they’re less happy with air-conditioning that isn’t completely reliable. Or windows that let in sounds from the street”.",

Another short train ride would take us to Kanyakumari, giving us an hour to settle before the solar eclipse began. After Kanyakumari the plan was to work up the western coast of the country through Kerala and Goa, along the Konkan Railway to Mumbai. From there we were due to board a newly launched luxury train, the Indian Maharaja-Deccan Odyssey. Luxury trains were not considered to embody the true Indian train experience, but it was foolish to ignore the one set of trains that so many swarmed to India to enjoy. After ending in Delhi, we would worm our way back down the centre of the country to Kerala, and then temple hop across Tamil Nadu. It was an awkward detour, but the Indian Maharaja had no other availability until March.",

At the outset of our journey we had taken pills to ward off malaria, but they had long ago run out or been lost, and I hoped I wouldn’t come down with the illness here. The mosquitoes sought out every bare patch of skin showing through my tattered clothing and attacked mercilessly. Since my encounter with the jaguar I was out of repellent and had no defence but swatting them with my hands. The mosquitoes were determined, however, and I gave up first. Then I had an idea. I would sew my clothes together, offering them fewer targets. I toiled a long while over my shirt, using the thin fishing line and a small hook. Then I repaired my trousers as well.",

Yet even here, amidst this virgin quiet, one could feel a steady buzz of restless, mercantile energy. Along the tree-lined streets, pretty with shuttered consulates and overgrown old villas, there was still a furious commotion of cyclos, bicycles, and pedestrians, so crowded that a car could hardly pass; and along the age-old, sloping streets, a dizzying seethe of shops and stalls. In days gone by, the streets of the old quarter were called Cotton and Silk and Comb, each one offering a single commodity; today the names remain, but one street is devoted to motorbikes and one to Sony Walkmans; one has nothing but Seiko watches, one only fake bank notes, to be offered to the dead.",

He has fabricated a conqueror’s role for himself and struts as the second deliverer of Haiti, thus ranking himself with L’Ouverture, Dessalines and Christophe. He goes about it by having himself photographed with the frowning mien of a conqueror and looking for all the world like a ferocious rabbit. Without cracking a smile he announces himself as the Second Deliverer of Haiti. He bases his claim on the fact that President Roosevelt, in keeping with his good-neighbor policy, withdrew the Marines from Haiti during Vincent’s administration. He knows that the N.A.A.C.P., The Nation and certain other organizations had a great deal more to do with the withdrawal of the Marines than Vincent did and much more than they are given credit for. In fact they are never mentioned when Vincent orates about Second Independence and honors himself as the Second Liberator. The story of how he drove out the Marines all by himself is a great one, the way he tells it. He even holds a celebration about it every year on August 21st. For the 1937 celebration he is supposed to have spent 80,000 gourds (about $16,000) to illumine the city of Port-au-Prince in celebration of an event that never took place.",

After the war, however, those reconstructing the country were determined to put cycling back at its heart. When cities like Rotterdam were rebuilt, care was taken to plan not only new roads and train lines but also miles of new cycle lanes, complete with clear signposting and dedicated bicycle-only bridges, tunnels and traffic lights. Cyclists were given automatic priority at roundabouts, and thousands of bicycle parking spaces were provided at train stations. Many areas were designated as woonerven, ‘living streets’ in which cars were forbidden to move faster than walking speed. As commuters in other countries began using new motorway systems to commute from their suburban homes to their workplaces or shopping centres, the Dutch became increasingly accustomed to cycling everywhere. The fact that cyclists had no legal obligation to wear a helmet meant the fashion-conscious were not deterred from cycling, while strict legal liability laws meant that if an accident occurred, car drivers almost always took the blame.",

Australia has a sly sense of irony that gives an edge to its sunshine, makes it something more than just a pretty face. That air of wry mischief is apparent in the Club Foote Cabaret, or the ad for a “Top Tourist Attraction” that features nothing but the photo of a sage-bearded man under the title “The Opal King.” The comment in a museum’s visitors’ book is as dry as the Outback: “Could be worse.” And the man who is being acclaimed as Australia’s Woody Allen is a thirty-two-year-old writer-director whose name alone—Yahoo Serious—places him a fair distance away from the Bergman of the Upper West Side. Nothing, it seems, is sacred: at the Collins Baptist Church in Melbourne, Reverend Ham is discoursing on the theme “God is Parked Outside your Front Door.”",

That first night off hitch, a week stretched ahead endless, long enough for the first day at home doing nothing, the exquisite luxury of laundry and showers, an elaborate meal in a real kitchen, sex and foot rubs, swimming in the river on a hot evening, renting a movie on a rainy one. Then, four days left for trips, cragging at the reservoir, nights out in the tent, or a bunch of day hikes, climbing peaks, remote traverses, guiding out-of-town visitors to favorite places. The last day meant town, for groceries and supplies, a stop at the bookstore, then home to portion out food and prepare meals together for the next go. We packed the truck the night before, snuggled in cool sheets with the pre-hitch feeling mounting, the dawning idea of work in the morning, so long ago now we forgot we had jobs at all. Six a.m. came and we slipped sweet notes into each other’s duffels, buried treats in the bottom of daypacks, snuck a quick kiss at the barn. On hitches, the occasional veiled radio contact, the “10-4, got your message, 253 clear” meant to us “All good on my end, I’d jump your bones if you were here,” and the eager pitch to the stomach on day eight, hiking out with the adolescent quease, This afternoon I’ll see him again.",

The end of one journey is simply the start of another. You have to see what you missed the first time, see again what you already saw, see in springtime what you saw in summer, in daylight what you saw at night, see the sun shining where you saw the rain falling, see the crops growing, the fruit ripen, the stone which has moved, the shadow that was not there before. You have to go back to the footsteps already taken, to go over them again or add fresh ones alongside them. You have to start the journey anew. Always.

The very luckiest live at the western end, where the streets are busier but the windows overlook Notre-Dame. I cannot imagine tiring of that view, though I suppose in August when the streets are clogged with tour buses and a million tourists in Bermuda shorts that SHOUT, the sense of favoured ecstasy may flag.",

Mrs Flushing strode to the river-bank in high spirits. The day had been long and hot, but she had enjoyed the speed and the open air; she had left the hotel which she hated, and she found the company to her liking. The river was swirling past in the darkness; they could just distinguish the smooth moving surface of the water, and the air was full of the sound of it. They stood in an empty space in the midst of great tree-trunks, and out there a little green light moving slightly up and down showed them where the steamer lay in which they were to embark.",

I sat alongside Kenny as we cruised along Interstate 4, with the cassette player belting out some Country tunes. Karen sprawled across the huge backseat, the warm Florida breeze playing havoc with her curly perm. America was what travel was all about, and this was just one State.

The swarm of flies which now enveloped me, told me he was only around half a metre away on the other side of the bush. I could hear him breathing and my nostrils were suddenly filled with his strong, earthy, wet-beast scent as he began to probe the bush around the level of my waist with an inquisitive hand. I imagined he was debating which part of my body would detach most easily when he launched his attack. Peering over the bush, I saw that the rest of our group were now monitoring the developing situation. The researchers and trackers looked terrified at what could be about to occur, the Germans were wide eyed and open mouthed…only Kirsty seemed to be taking it in her stride. She'd whipped out her iPhone, flicked it onto video mode and, to my eyes, seemed to be mentally willing the young gorilla on.",
