Sobrius sits among them in the clear blue-green water that reflects the bright sun. Their four masts rise up towards the sky. Cumulus clouds move across the scene. A thin strip of sand and scrubby trees separates the water from the sky and provides some shelter from the waves and the relentless wind for the anchored sailboats who patiently wait for their next adventure. The air is clean and has passed over many miles of sea before reaching me. I take in deep lungfulls while standing atop the fort, staring out over the water.\nI walk along the narrow trail on the earthen roof of the fort and come to a shiny black cannon that has been restored. The barrel is long and thick, open at the business end and capped with a fatter cylinder at the other end. The barrel rests on a triangle of steel that holds it via two fat pegs protruding from the rear of the barrel, where the two cylinders meet. The supporting structure rests on two steel rails that appear to be connected to something beneath a low brick wall in front of the cannon. The other end of the rails rest on wheels upon a semi-circular track, allowing the cannon to be aimed left or right. A historical plaque mentions that the cannons here were modern weaponry at the time they were installed, in the late 19th century.",

The camp has become essentially a city in the desert, with schools and markets and permanent habitations. It has been there so long now that a generation of children has grown to adult-hood without knowing any life other than being behind razor wire and heavy iron gates, and a sense that all the world beyond this snug perimeter offers nothing but danger or indifference. CARE has 175 employees on site. Forty-five percent of its spending in Kenya goes to the camp. Dadaab is a vivid reminder that refugee problems don’t end simply because journalistic interest moves elsewhere. The inhabitants themselves are irremediably stuck. They can’t go back to Somalia because it isn’t safe and they can’t go elsewhere in Kenya because Kenya has problems enough of its own without having 134,000 Somalis pitching up in Nairobi or Mombasa, looking for food and work. And so way out in the desert there exists this strange city-that-isn’t-a-city filled with people who have nowhere to go and nothing much to do.",

Walking such a long distance activates the body, making it strong and energetic, and when it comes time to rest, it doesn’t always want to stop moving. Even after long days, one of the first activities we’d do after taking our bags off and having showers was a bunch of haphazard yoga poses, or even an outburst of random jumping and pumping and throwing our limbs about like a pair of children on a sugar high. In twenty days of nightly practice, I could use my core strength to lift my legs up into a perfect headstand. I would say that it made me feel like I was eighteen again, but I never had that much energy or strength at eighteen. I felt strong and capable inside this new body.",

There was a difference, and it was simply all the difference in the world, between their two cases. She had been horribly right when at the beginning she snubbed Christopher for declaring there wasn’t. Stephen didn’t need to watch Virginia as she watched Christopher, anxiously on the alert for the least sign of change in her, in what she did, what she said, in the very tone in which she said it. Stephen was safe, was at rest; Virginia would never, never do anything but love him. He was the father of her child, the authority she looked up to, the intelligence she adored. But Catherine–she wasn’t going to be the mother of any child of Christopher’s, she hadn’t got any intelligence for him to adore, and wouldn’t have wished to have authority, even if she could have, for him to look up to. For her there was nothing but strain and effort, with the tormenting knowledge that her very strain and effort were bound to bring about what she dreaded.",

There! Out it boomed. First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable. The leaden circles dissolved in the air. Such fools we are, she thought, crossing Victoria Street.* For Heaven only knows why one loves it so, how one sees it so, making it up, building it round one, tumbling it, creating it every moment afresh; but the veriest frumps, the most dejected of miseries sitting on doorsteps (drink their downfall) do the same; can’t be dealt with, she felt positive, by Acts of Parliament for that very reason: they love life. In people’s eyes, in the swing, tramp, and trudge; in the bellow and the uproar; the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of June.",

We missed the house and come back understanding the next few circles around us. Qualities those of us with northern blood envy—that Italian insouciance and ability to live in the moment with gusto—I now see came down straight from the Etruscans. All the painted images from the tombs seem charged with meaning, if we only had the clues to read it. I close my eyes and look at the crouching leopards, the deft figure of death, the endless banqueting. Sometimes Greek myths come to mind, Persephone, Actaeon and the dogs, Pegasus, but the instinct I have is that the tomb images—and the Greek ones—each came from further back, and those further back came from something even earlier.

She hangs up the pelt of a wolverine. “The wolverine is the most verbally abused animal in the country,” Dick says as he works on his bee frames. “And unjustly so. It’s one of the finest animals out here. People say a wolverine is ‘ornery,’ ‘mean,’ ‘vicious,’ ‘worthless.’ They say it can’t live with another wolverine. No animal is considered lower. My experience is entirely different. The wolverine is powerful. It hunts with its mate. If one is injured, the other will stick by it. Wolves are affectionate, too. They are really beautiful animals. I have come to know and love them. This year, I have a mating pair on my line. Two years ago, I had a whole pack. The nonbreeders pack up, so they won’t get in the way of the sex game. Around the first of March, twenty-five of them went right by the cabin here. Wolves are easy to shoot in mating season. They’re in love, I guess. They run in pairs. They don’t pay attention to what they’re doing. Indians call animals their brothers. You soon realize here that your life is no more important than the animals’. Animals give up their lives, and you will, too. You can’t have life without death.”",

Above the dam the river widened quickly to a still deep green, and there were trout pools and ice-cream stands and expensive-looking drive-ins. But once past the crossroads it narrowed again into the steady rapids that gurgle steeply out of the three-pronged lake. This is a stretch of the Oirase River made famous by tourist posters and by dabblers in the traditional forms of Japanese poetry. In autumn the road will be jammed with cars, bumper to bumper, and fathers will wish they had stayed at home, and children will wail for Coca-Cola, and mothers will lean out of car windows to snap the red and gold trees with Instamatic cameras. Nothing will daunt the poets, though, and they will see and hear only what thousands of others have wanted to see and hear before them:",

Could it be seven already? She had been there since midday! She must really run to catch her train. Mr Kenyon shut his book – he had been reading aloud – and stood with his back to the fire; Mrs Jameson with a sharp, angular movement pressed each finger of her glove sharp down. And Flush was patted by this one and had his ear pulled by another. The routine of leave-taking was intolerably prolonged; but at last Mrs Jameson, Mr Kenyon, and even Miss Mitford had risen, had said good-bye, had remembered something, had lost something, had found something, had reached the door, had opened it, and were – Heaven be praised – gone at last.",

We showered together, even peed together, snickering swordsmen crossing our streams in toilet-bowl battle. He was a true beach kid, with a crew cut bleached white by sun, feet with soles like wood, and a back that in summer went black as tar. He knew what the tide was doing at any moment, no matter where we were, as if he could smell it on the air. He knew when the grunion were running—mysterious fish that washed up in the shorebreak to spawn, but only at night, an hour after high tide, and only in certain months and certain phases of the moon. With a flashlight, you could fill a gunnysack with grunion in an hour. Floured and deep-fried, they were considered a delicacy. Walking on Newport Pier, Bill poked around in the buckets of fishermen without permission, putting them at their ease with offhand, wharf-rat encouragement. “Nice corbina.”",

    "target_paragraph": "If there were a contest for the most beautiful town in Italy—a task from which King Solomon might shrink—Locorotondo would surely be a contender, for no corner of the Old City is ugly, as befits a circular town on a round hill. Nine kilometers southeast of Alberobello, Locorotondo rises from the green Murge; dazzlingly white, it seems to rest suspended on a round plate. Its two-story houses are whitewashed twice a year; their steeply pitched limestone gray roofs look as if they might have come from a northern country, the north of England perhaps; the town is flooded with Mediterranean light. This is architecture and town planning that exemplifies the music of geometry, the poetry of shadow and light. A circle is also a maze: The white houses, with their purple, pink, blue, green shutters, their oiled and polished doors, their balconies luxurious with overhanging flowering plants, are set in urban proximity one to another on winding narrow streets, and—as they, like the neighboring trulli, are expressive of individuality within conformity—form unexpected communal courtyards, surprising angles and cutoffs and projections. External staircases provide an additional dimension, another canvas for the play of sunlight and shade. There are no cars in the historical center of Locorotondo; there are pots of plants—not only on balconies but on staircases and grouped on the flat and shiny checkerboard limestone pavement. This is an act of trust, justified; no one will hurt or steal the flowers. Flowers inhabit space and are allies in human habitation. To walk into a maze (for one cannot be in a circular town without trying to find its center or heart) is a gratifying adventure and also an act of trust, but very little faith is required, for the embrace of this town is gentle; one breathes easy.",

We stopped at an Edwardian station with high Swiss gables overhung with flowering creepers; in the window-boxes there were primroses and sunflowers. The temperature dropped.

He’d taken advantage of available building materials whenever he could and the little resort’s fish camp origins were evident. The “beach huts” were built on pole stilts, which kept them about two feet above shallow water at most tide levels but left them standing over almost dry land when the tide was low. There was scant evidence of a beach. The huts were simply constructed and sided with painted plywood and pine boards. The main building housed the dining area and kitchen and served as a general headquarters. The simple dining room was paneled with split bamboo poles and offered a delightful view of the anchorage and the azure waters beyond. The faint music of waves crashing against the distant reef played in the background, accompanied by the rattle of palm fronds rustling in the breeze. The walls were adorned with a collection of tattered national flags of the world and a large nautical chart of the local waters. There was a stack of old sailing magazines on a small corner table. Like any good campsite, the place had all you’d need to live simply for a time, free from the distractions of the outside world. The physical and emotional distance from civilization was palpable. Unfortunately, our circumstances dictated that we soon venture out of this haven and make a foray into the real world, the one populated by the bureaucrats that you can never seem to escape for long no matter where you go on the planet.",

Chhokrapur was once a walled city; it has long since spread outside its walls, but parts of these and some of the old gateways are still standing. I entered through the main gateway, by the caravanserai, which lies on the Rajgarh road at the foot of the Guest House hill, and found myself in a wide, straight street. It was in good repair but very dusty, and bordered by crude dwellings of mud or whitewashed brick, all raised on low brick platforms which formed a kind of wide step in front on which the inhabitants might squat in the shade of the eaves. There were a number of people about, and before I had gone very far I began to feel timid. Curiosity had brought me out; but I now found myself an object of curiosity, and this embarrassed me. Every one stared at me; people who were squatting on their heels in front of their houses rose up, salaamed, called others out and stood staring; groups of men interrupted their conversation to watch me pass; children followed me, and women concealed their faces, no matter how old and ugly they might be, in the long red cloths in which they were draped. I felt intrusive and self-conscious in my English clothes, and omitted to return salutes in case the saluters should be encouraged to speak to me and I should not understand what they said.",

It glowed on the windward side, rising and falling in intensity like the end of a cigar. Then a superincumbent bundle rolled down, with a whisking noise, flames elongated and bent themselves about with a quiet roar, but no crackle. Banks of smoke went off horizontally at the back like passing clouds, and behind these burned hidden flames, illuminating the semi-transparent sheet of smoke to a lustrous yellow uniformity. Individual straws in the foreground were consumed in a creeping movement of ruddy heat, as if they were knots of red worms, and above shone imaginary fiery faces, tongues hanging from lips, glaring eyes, and other fancied forms, from which at intervals sparks flew in clusters like birds from a nest.",

The ER attending was there. He was crying himself. Raeef had horrible head injuries. I actually saw some brain tissue there on the stretcher. I think his neck was broken too. My wife had fallen to the floor. Her abbayah was covered in Raeef's blood. She had reached him before me.

Those first few moments in the Middle East remain imprinted on my memory. I remember gazing up to the dark, starry sky and being struck by the position of the moon, which seemed to be lying on its side—not quite upright and feeling that it was not where it normally rests in the Western Hemisphere. It felt like a premonition, simultaneously disturbing and peaceful, of some sort of internal shift to come. When my feet hit the tarmac, I was walking into a fresh, wide-open future.",

On discovering that breasts existed beneath my loose shirt this brave explorer rushed off to find her mother, screaming ‘Set nat! Set nat!’ (It’s a woman!) However, her companions could not easily credit this improbability so now, emboldened by her example, they proceeded to remove my shirt – which led to further exclamations of wonder when they saw the colour of untanned faranj skin.",

Lee is fresh to the road and is just beginning to understand something of the other kinds of people he meets: the odd recreational walker, some long-term professional tramps (who were identifiable because they ‘brewed tea by the roadside, took it easy, and studied their feet’). But there were others, Lee noticed, ‘all trudging northwards in a sombre procession’, who belonged to ‘that host of unemployed who wandered aimlessly about England at that time’. These people:",

And St. Louis was, in fact, a pleasant place. There must have been other towns along the Mississippi with a similar charm-places where cement had not yet tamped down everything and nature still showed through—but I thought mine unique. I firmly believed that the little girl from New York who came out every summer to visit her grandparents next door was as miserable, when the time came to return to the brownstone fronts of the East, as Persephone going back to the underworld. In New York, we children told each other, there were no back yards. That unfortunate Eastern child had to live in a flat, with no place to dig in the dirt. Actually, what should have bothered us was that St. Louis was a hell of a place for a summer resort. It rests in a topographical hollow, and the air is usually quiet, growing humid to an extreme degree in summer, except for the times when everything blows up all at once in a cyclone. Our cyclones and tornadoes were inconvenient, and even dangerous, but we were proud of them.",

In our barsati, in the absence of radiators or a fireplace, we were forced to go out and buy a great battery of bar heaters to keep ourselves warm. We kept them burning most of the day, and took it in turns to replace the fuses when, as happened with exciting frequency, Mrs Puri’s antiquated electrics blew up with a fantastic blue flash.",

At home no one would condemn a beloved animal to such a career; here one day treks, with a long rainy season vacation, offer an easier life than regularly carrying loads to market and pulling primitive ploughs up precipices. So this morning we presented ourselves to Sancho, the young man who apparently runs the Tourist Office, and asked him if he would like to buy an affectionate, good-looking, intelligent, docile and hardy young riding mula.",
