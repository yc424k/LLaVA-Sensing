A high tide was pouring powerfully across the causeway into the lagoon: how could we keep our balance in that current on a surface of shifting stones? I was about to suggest returning to the road by another route when two fishermen, smelling strongly of wood smoke, overtook us. They knew precisely where to step – and when, in relation to the ebb and flow. Having greeted us briefly they summed up the situation, carried the Trio across, then offered me a supporting arm – without which I would certainly have been swept into the lagoon. Only Rachel, with the aid of my stick, made it alone. Our silent rescuers showed no curiosity about this daft family. Muttering ‘adios’ they hurried ahead and were soon scrambling on to a ledge at the base of that limestone cliff and casting lines from their reels. Already we could see that the cliff presented an insuperable obstacle: we were doomed to turn inland.",

In the eighties, during a stark economic crisis, whole communities were relocated from the altiplano, the cold highlands near La Paz. They were poor, their Indigenous cultures mountainous, Incan, pre-Incan, and they came wind-hardened with different languages. The government said they wanted to redistribute the wealth, promising that farming would be better down here. But divides between the collas, these migrants, and the cambas, people from the richer, eastern lowlands, are stark and difficult.

    "target_paragraph": "Down in Washington, D.C., Gilbert Grosvenor evidently saw things a little differently. After viewing Bingham’s photographs from Machu Picchu, the editor decided immediately that National Geographic would devote an entire issue to the story, the first time in the magazine’s history that it would do so. Grosvenor also arranged the seating chart for the society’s annual dinner, held in January 1913, so that Bingham dined at the head table. There he was joined by the evening’s main attractions: toastmaster and North Pole hero Robert E. Peary, who told the assembled attendees that Bingham’s discoveries had “astounded the scientists of the world,” and the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, recipient of the year’s Explorers Gold Medal for winning the race to the South Pole. (The world was still a few weeks from hearing the news that the frozen body of Amundsen’s rival Captain Scott had been discovered.11) Dressed formally in white tie and tails, Bingham delivered a brief speech that focused on the triumphs of 1911, not the disappointments of 1912. “Buried in the jungle, we found a city called Machu Picchu,” he told the evening’s six hundred distinguished guests. “That is an awful name, but it is well worth remembering.”",

We have been given the carpeted half of the floor and two hours ago the old couple spread tattered goat-hides on the mud half, laid their wretched bits of bedding over these and went to sleep. Just now another elderly couple and three adolescent girls came in and took their bedding from the pile in the corner. So we have a full house and are not likely to feel cold – as we might have done, during the small hours, had there been only four (or three and a half) people sleeping in a room of this size.",

According to Michael, one of the latter was being surveyed as a possible exclusive holiday resort for very rich tourists.

The TEC’s reverence for democracy led them to over-indulge dotty minuscule parties like KISS (Keep It Straight and Simple) and SOCCER (Sports Organization for Collective Contributions and Equal Rights). Not to mention the Ximoko Progressive Party, which has never let the public glimpse its policy. And the Dikwankwetla Party, led by T.K. Mopeli of whom no one has ever heard – but surely anyone swayed solely by euphony would vote for the Dikwankwetlas. All this works against South Africa’s novice voters who must cope with a foot-long national ballot paper listing the names, logos and leaders’ photographs of eighteen parties, the greater number completely irrelevant. And some of the provincial ballot papers list twenty-eight parties.",

    "target_paragraph": "Johnson traveled to California from New York City in 1889 looking to assign stories. Among his goals was to get work out of Muir, who spent most of the 1880s running the fruit farm he had taken over when he had married Louie Strentzel in 1880. “I am degenerating into a machine for making money,” he lamented to Hall Young during a visit from the minister. Johnson’s timing was excellent. Muir was eager to start writing again and had a general subject in mind: the horrible state of affairs in Yosemite Valley. Amid one of the most iconic landscapes in America, virtually unregulated entrepreneurs were raising livestock (“hoofed locusts” was Muir’s term for the wildflower-munching sheep), operating sawmills, and luring tourists to seedy hostels. “Perhaps we may yet hear of an appropriation to whitewash the face of El Capitan or correct the curves of the Domes,” Muir wrote. Johnson joined Muir on a camping trip to the valley and was struck by its beauty and its abuse. “Obviously the thing to do is make Yosemite National Park around the Valley on the plan of Yellowstone,” Johnson told Muir.",

While in northern Syria hundreds of unnamed and unknown late antique towns and villages still exist virtually intact, in Jerusalem, once probably the most magnificent provincial town in the entire Christian Empire, only desultory fragments of floor mosaic and piles of collapsed pillars remain to hint at what has been lost. Following the trail of John Moschos’s writings around the city takes one to a variety of dank cellars and obscure crypts, but even here there is little surviving that is of more than antiquarian interest. Ironically, the only great Byzantine building left in the city is a mosque – the Dome of the Rock – decorated by Byzantine craftsmen for the new Muslim conquerors in the late seventh century, shortly after the fall of the eastern half of the Empire. Runciman has called the Dome ‘the supreme example of the rotunda-style of building in Byzantine architecture’.",

She stopped, out of breath, and finding herself at the extreme northern end of the Park, with the first street-lights beginning to gem the bare trees. The need to be with Anne suddenly seized her. Perhaps, by dropping a careless word or two, she might learn something from her daughter—learn at least if the baleful Lilla were using the girl as a confidant, as that brief scene in the studio had once suggested. On that point, at any rate, it was the mother’s right, her duty even, to be informed.

The man was fulsome about the joys of living in sin far from the idiocy of the modern world.

    "target_paragraph": "Stephen, as a cool refuge from the warmths of Christopher, had been restful, but only up to a certain point. He had provided the sort of relief the cool air of a cellar gives those coming rather blinded out of the heat of the sun, and, like a cellar, he had presently palled. She had long ago found, and it had been greatly to her regret, that it was difficult to keep her eyes open after a short time alone with Stephen. She thought this must be due to his conversation. There was nothing to lay hold of in it. It was bony. One slipped off. Besides, he didn’t talk to her as if she were anything but another bone. Bones to bones; how dreary; how little one likes being behaved to as if one were a bone. Yet he knew now about love, and nobody could hear him preach without being thrilled by his appreciation of it. He appreciated it in his sermons in all its branches. At present in his life there was only one branch really living, and that was married love. All those other loves he praised–brotherly love, which he entreated might continue; the love of friends, surpassing, he declared, in beauty and dignity the love of the sexes; that large love of humanity, which needs must well from every thinking heart–were theories to him. Well, perhaps by sheer talking about them from pulpits to impressed congregations they would gradually become real. One did, in a very remarkable way, talk oneself into attitudes of mind that altered one’s entire behaviour; or was talked into them by somebody else, which was less excellent–in fact, should be guarded against.",

She loved the water, which was lucky (though not for her fair Irish skin). On the patch of damp sand at the bottom of our path, she would spread beach towels and lead the little ones into the lagoon with masks and nets. She got my sister, Colleen, into training for her First Communion at a church in Waikiki. She even, when possible, jumped on planes to the neighboring islands with my dad, usually with Michael, who was three, on her hip, and some hasty babysitting arrangement in her wake. And in the outer islands she found, I think, a Hawaii more to her liking—not the Babbitty boosters and country-club racists of Honolulu. In snapshots from those jaunts, she looked like a stranger: not Mom but some pensive, stylish lady in a sleeveless turquoise shift, alone with her thoughts in the middle distance—a Joan Didion character, it seems now, walking barefoot, sandals in hand, past a shaggy wall of shorefront pines. Didion, I later learned, was her favorite writer.",

Such is the case when a temple is so full of worshipers, and when time and space are so limited, that to treat each individual separately would be impossible. In such an event, one of the pemangkus sprinkles holy water over the entire group using a brush like implement called a lis. A lis is made from a bundle of immature coconut leaves — busung — which are cut into elaborate and symbolic patterns. The exact patterns used and the number of leaves per lis are specified by tradition. Most lis are about 10 centimeters across, and up to 75 centimeters long. The leaves are bound together at one end, forming a kind of handle into which is thrust a flower and a special variety of rice container made from coconut leaf called ketipat. The free ends are temporarily held together by a cover. When put into use, this cover is symbolically cut by striking it with a knife three times. The pemangku now removes the cover, dips the free end into a container of holy water and begins sprinkling. Using a large container of holy water and a big lis a pemangku can sprinkle a great many worshipers with holy water. It is a common sight to see this in the larger ceremonies — hundreds of people seated on the ground, the pemangku walking among them, spraying holy water as if he were sowing seeds.",

So they produced a new parchment. It reached the desk, but even as the Grand Commander reached his hand for the pen, a draft of air came from nowhere (if you know General Martel, you know that any room he stops in long enough to remove his hat, must be hermetically sealed)—came from nowhere and wafted the parchment twenty metres across the room and into the fire, where it vanished pouf! like celluloid. But to what avail, between them armed only with the flaming swords of clumsy mythology, and the Comité de Ferrovie snoring with revolving pistols and the rattling belch of Maxim guns? So now he has gone to a Tibetan lamasery. To repent.’",

They were Jim and Heath, father and son, from Chattanooga, and they were cheerful, friendly, and not remotely daunted by the weather. They had come hiking for the weekend, they told us (I hadn’t even realized it was a weekend), and knew the weather was likely to be bad, though not perhaps quite this bad, and so were well prepared. Jim had brought a big clear plastic sheet, of the sort decorators use to cover floors, and was trying to rig it across the open front of the shelter. Katz, uncharacteristically, leapt to his assistance. The plastic sheet didn’t quite reach, but we found that with one of our groundcloths lashed alongside it we could cover the entire front. The wind walloped ferociously against the plastic and from time to time tore part of it loose, where it fluttered and snapped, with a retort like gunshot, until one of us leaped up and fought it back into place. The whole shelter was, in any case, incredibly leaky of air—the plank walls and floors were full of cracks through which icy wind and occasional blasts of snow shot—but we were infinitely snugger than we would have been outside.",

In the province of Reggio Calabria (that includes the Locride), the public transportation system serves as the school bus, so schedules are set to coincide with student travel. Taking a bus or train during these hours can be quite unpleasant. Once on a train in Reggio, a group of ‘students’ ripped a pair of seats off their base and threw them out the window in a tunnel. Needless to say, I didn’t see any Homer or Virgil amongst their belongings. Luckily, my students were the types who carried physics, Latin and philosophy books.",

He once described himself as a riparian child, in contrast to the truly amphibian people living on the lower Magdalena. The people of the ciénagas, the great wetlands, he noted, live immersed by the Magdalena. The river influences every aspect of their lives, from their food to their music, the way they move, even the color of their dreams. The people of La Jagua and the upper Magdalena always keep one foot on the land. They fish without canoes, from the shore, walking and throwing their nets, or atarrayas, as they make their way upstream, one eye on the water, another turned back to the land, where spirits linger. William grew up with tales of La Patasola, the one-legged guardian of the forests, a spirit being that sometimes takes the guise of a beautiful woman to lure violators of nature deep into the forest, where she transforms into a monster with eyes of fire and a Medusa head with jaguar teeth ready to rend the flesh and suck the blood of her victims. Is it any wonder, I teased him, that he became a botanist, dedicated to conservation?",

It’s a dam good thing we never had any kings and presidents; we’d all be down there at Jackson chasing butterflies.

The brief interval of cold weather was over, and the day was as soft, and almost as hot, as when she and Harney had emerged on the same scene on the Fourth of July. In the square the same broken-down hacks and carry-alls stood drawn up in a despondent line, and the lank horses with fly-nets over their withers swayed their heads drearily to and fro. She recognized the staring signs over the eating-houses and billiard saloons, and the long lines of wires on lofty poles tapering down the main street to the park at its other end. Taking the way the wires pointed, she went on hastily, with bent head, till she reached a wide transverse street with a brick building at the corner. She crossed this street and glanced furtively up at the front of the brick building; then she returned, and entered a door opening on a flight of steep brass-rimmed stairs. On the second landing she rang a bell, and a mulatto girl with a bushy head and a frilled apron let her into a hall where a stuffed fox on his hind legs proffered a brass card-tray to visitors. At the back of the hall was a glazed door marked: “Office.” After waiting a few minutes in a handsomely furnished room, with plush sofas surmounted by large gold-framed photographs of showy young women, Charity was shown into the office….",

I asked why and he said because their scientists were so much smarter than ours, because their country was so much bigger than ours that they had many more brilliant scientists to draw from. Also, he said, their kids were better at science than our kids were. I took this last to be aimed at me; I had never been as good at math and science as he had hoped.
