Her incessant movements were not the result of shyness: she thought it the correct thing to be animated in society, and noise and restlessness were her only notion of vivacity. She therefore watched herself approvingly, admiring the light on her hair, the flash of teeth between her smiling lips, the pure shadows of her throat and shoulders as she passed from one attitude to another. Only one fact disturbed her: there was a hint of too much fulness in the curves of her neck and in the spring of her hips. She was tall enough to carry off a little extra weight, but excessive slimness was the fashion, and she shuddered at the thought that she might some day deviate from the perpendicular.",

    "target_paragraph": "Three or four days after the ceremony, I went again to the memorial, this time with Fred Brown. The wreaths, which were on stands, had fallen over in a wind. All papers, cups, and beer cans had been taken away, and the memorial clearing, wreaths aside, looked just as it had when I first saw it—desolate and improbable. “I heard him,” Fred said. “I heard him when he went down. That was in an awful thunderstorm. I heard him circling. I said to my wife, ‘There’s an airplane in trouble.’ Then I didn’t hear it no more. I knew from the sound that it was out in the Hocken Lowlands where he crashed. I come out here the next day. This was tall timber here. It’s burnt since he went down.” Fred walked to a large pine that had been left standing in the cleared area, and he paced out four yards from the tree. “Carranza’s wing fell three hundred yards up that way,” he said, gesturing to the east. “The rest of the airplane hit this tree, and right here is where his head was. There wasn’t no blood where he laid. What do you suppose—he just bled inside? There was no blood. He had a flashlight still in his hand, an ordinary nickel flashlight, no more than a two-cell.” Carranza’s widow visited Chatsworth some years after her husband’s death. She wore a purple blouse and a purple skirt, and protruding from her sandals were purple toenails. Carranza’s sister also came. She flew over the monument and scattered roses from the air. The road that leads into the pines through Tabernacle Township and goes past the memorial and on to Speedwell is not marked with a name, even on topographic maps. For almost thirty years, however, the people of the Pine Barrens have called it Carranza’s Road.",

    "target_paragraph": "Every one, I suppose, is subject to a trick of mind which often puzzles me. I am reading or thinking, and at a moment, without any association or suggestion that I can discover, there rises before me the vision of a place I know. Impossible to explain why that particular spot should show itself to my mind's eye; the cerebral impulse is so subtle that no search may trace its origin. If I am reading, doubtless a thought, a phrase, possibly a mere word, on the page before me serves to awaken memory. If I am otherwise occupied, it must be an object seen, an odour, a touch; perhaps even a posture of the body suffices to recall something in the past. Sometimes the vision passes, and there an end; sometimes, however, it has successors, the memory working quite independently of my will, and no link appearing between one scene and the next.\nTen minutes ago I was talking with my gardener. Our topic was the nature of the soil, whether or not it would suit a certain kind of vegetable. Of a sudden I found myself gazing at—the Bay of Avlona. Quite certainly my thoughts had not strayed in that direction. The picture that came before me caused me a shock of surprise, and I am still vainly trying to discover how I came to behold it.\nA happy chance that I ever saw Avlona. I was on my way from Corfu to Brindisi. The steamer sailed late in the afternoon; there was a little wind, and as the December night became chilly, I soon turned in. With the first daylight I was on deck, expecting to find that we were near the Italian port; to my surprise, I saw a mountainous shore, towards which the ship was making at full speed. On inquiry, I learnt that this was the coast of Albania; our vessel not being very seaworthy, and the wind still blowing a little (though not enough to make any passenger uncomfortable), the captain had turned back when nearly half across the Adriatic, and was seeking a haven in the shelter of the snow-topped hills. Presently we steamed into a great bay, in the narrow mouth of which lay an island. My map showed me where we were, and with no small interest I discovered that the long line of heights guarding the bay on its southern side formed the Acroceraunian Promontory. A little town visible high up on the inner shore was the ancient Aulon.\nHere we anchored, and lay all day long. Provisions running short, a boat had to be sent to land, and the sailors purchased, among other things, some peculiarly detestable bread—according to them, cotto al sole. There was not a cloud in the sky; till evening, the wind whistled above our heads, but the sea about us was blue and smooth. I sat in hot sunshine, feasting my eyes on the beautiful cliffs and valleys of the thickly-wooded shore. Then came a noble sunset; then night crept gently into the hollows of the hills, which now were coloured the deepest, richest green. A little lighthouse began to shine. In the perfect calm that had fallen, I heard breakers murmuring softly upon the beach.\nAt sunrise we entered the port of Brindisi.",

Every hotel showed pictures of its swimming pool. There were turquoise blue lozenges under an equally blue sky, there were oval pools, there were round pools, there were the occasional asymmetrical pools. Sometimes there were two pools looking like a figure of eight, with a pedestrian bridge arching over them, or pools with little islands in the middle, waterfalls tumbling over piled rocks. What they all had in common was that clarity of blue and lightness, the surfaces shimmering with tantalizing promise.",

After a few minutes a horn sounded and though we couldn’t see past the ship in front of us, we knew the gates to the next lock were swinging open. The next step was the part where boats can easily be damaged if the ship pilot makes a mistake. It takes a lot of energy to overcome the inertia of a big ship at rest. They are moved between locks by cables attached to large locomotive engines called electric mules, which run on tracks along the top of the lock walls. Sometimes the pilot will direct the ship’s captain to bump his propeller forward a few turns to help the mules start the ship moving. The problem with this for boats behind the ship is that it kicks back a powerful wall of water, sometimes powerful enough to snap the warps or rip deck hardware from a yacht, breaking the raft free from its restraints and slamming the boats into the jagged concrete walls. The pilots have become more alert to this after several well-publicized incidents, and it had been a while since it had happened, but we were still anxious. The ship ahead of us was not a Panamax, but it was quite large and would be difficult to get moving.",

Starwick was climbing up into a compartment, Eugene followed him, flung his valise inside, and clambered in, breathless, just as the guard with a remonstrant face slammed the door behind him.\n \nDuring the journey back to Paris, Eugene and Starwick said little. The two young men were the sole occupants of the compartment, they sat facing each other, looking out through the windows with gloomy eyes. The grey light of the short winter’s day was fading rapidly: when they entered Paris dusk had come; as the train rattled over the switchpoints in the yard-approaches to the Gare St Lazare, they could see lights and life and sometimes faces in the windows of the high, faded buildings near the tracks. Through one window, in a moment’s glimpse, Eugene saw a room with a round table with a dark cloth upon it, and with the light of a shaded chandelier falling on it, and a dark-haired boy of ten or twelve leaning on the table, reading a book, with his face propped in his hands, and a woman moving busily about the table laying it with plates and knives and forks. And as the train slackened speed, he saw, high up in the topmost floor of an old house that rose straight up from the tracks, a woman come to the window, look for a moment at a canary-bird cage which was hanging in the window, reach up and take it from its hook. She had the rough, blowsy, and somewhat old-fashioned look of a demi-monde of the Renoir period; and yet she was like someone he had known all his life.",

There were Gordon, a short, eager man of thirty who looked like an amateur knocked-about model for Harry, and his wife, Myra, a listless lady with flaxen hair under a fur automobile cap. Almost immediately Sally Carrol thought of her as vaguely Scandinavian. A cheerful chauffeur adopted her bag, and amid ricochets of half-phrases, exclamations and perfunctory listless \"my dears\" from Myra, they swept each other from the station.",

Then, out of the sodden, grey, cold dawn, José reappeared with a chipped enamel bowl holding four hot maize dumplings with savoury fillings. We unwrapped these goodies from the maize leaves in which they had been steamed and relished the luxury of a hot breakfast while José sat cross-legged in the shelter of the front flap, his hard-soled bare feet tucked under him, and questioned us about Ireland. When the rain eased off he pointed out the first stage of our redura, an unmistakable section of the Camino Real, its paving still discernible, running across a bleak expanse of puna into the clouds. The restricted visibility worried me; unless one can see far ahead, gaps in puna reduras can be hopelessly confusing. This morning however we were confused not by a gap but by a landslide at the base of a steep 500-foot embankment. I did a solo recce and at the third attempt found a way to the top, which was also the summit of a mountain. I whistled and waited. Then a sudden wind rose and as the others joined me the clouds ahead were blown away. Together Rachel and I stood surveying a wide jumble of peaks and valleys – all blue-grey and golden-brown – beyond which lies the Apurimac gorge, our last major challenge (as it was the conquistadores’) on the Royal Road to Cuzco.",

The crowd pools at a defective metal detector below “Little Tibet,” the Tsuglagkhang Temple beside the Dalai Lama’s palace. Rocks painted with bright yellow mantras purify the earth and huge red-painted barrels spin prayers into the sky. Inside a temple room, young monks are chanting to clashing cymbals and rolling drums. It’s a strange sound, resembling a symphony played backward at half speed; the voices are so low, slow and resonant that they vibrate my inner organs.",

He walked on trying to bolster his moral courage, trying not to look like a sneaking nigger, but, in spite of him, it seemed that every dark quiet house stared at him, watching him with blank and lightless eyes, making his back itch after he had passed. But what if they do see me? What am I doing, that anyone should not do? Walking along a deserted street after midnight. That’s all.

    "target_paragraph": "And then the egg-cup of ink would come off the dresser and the letter would be written, and Ma would buy a postal order on her way to work next morning. But it was no use. Nothing made little Lennie put it on. Taking him to the cemetery, even, never gave him a colour; a nice shake-up in the bus never improved his appetite.\nBut he was gran's boy from the first...\n\"Whose boy are you?\" said old Ma Parker, straightening up from the stove and going over to the smudgy window. And a little voice, so warm, so close, it half stifled her—it seemed to be in her breast under her heart—laughed out, and said, \"I'm gran's boy!\"\nAt that moment there was a sound of steps, and the literary gentleman appeared, dressed for walking.\n\"Oh, Mrs. Parker, I'm going out.\"\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\"And you'll find your half-crown in the tray of the inkstand.\"\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\"Oh, by the way, Mrs. Parker,\" said the literary gentleman quickly, \"you didn't throw away any cocoa last time you were here—did you?\"\n\"No, sir.\"\n\"Very strange. I could have sworn I left a teaspoonful of cocoa in the tin.\" He broke off. He said softly and firmly, \"You'll always tell me when you throw things away—won't you, Mrs. Parker?\" And he walked off very well pleased with himself, convinced, in fact, he'd shown Mrs. Parker that under his apparent carelessness he was as vigilant as a woman.\nThe door banged. She took her brushes and cloths into the bedroom. But when she began to make the bed, smoothing, tucking, patting, the thought of little Lennie was unbearable. Why did he have to suffer so? That's what she couldn't understand. Why should a little angel child have to arsk for his breath and fight for it? There was no sense in making a child suffer like that.\n...From Lennie's little box of a chest there came a sound as though something was boiling. There was a great lump of something bubbling in his chest that he couldn't get rid of. When he coughed the sweat sprang out on his head; his eyes bulged, his hands waved, and the great lump bubbled as a potato knocks in a saucepan. But what was more awful than all was when he didn't cough he sat against the pillow and never spoke or answered, or even made as if he heard. Only he looked offended.\n\"It's not your poor old gran's doing it, my lovey,\" said old Ma Parker, patting back the damp hair from his little scarlet ears. But Lennie moved his head and edged away. Dreadfully offended with her he looked—and solemn. He bent his head and looked at her sideways as though he couldn't have believed it of his gran.\nBut at the last... Ma Parker threw the counterpane over the bed. No, she simply couldn't think about it. It was too much—she'd had too much in her life to bear. She'd borne it up till now, she'd kept herself to herself, and never once had she been seen to cry. Never by a living soul. Not even her own children had seen Ma break down. She'd kept a proud face always. But now! Lennie gone—what had she? She had nothing. He was all she'd got from life, and now he was took too. Why must it all have happened to me? she wondered. \"What have I done?\" said old Ma Parker. \"What have I done?\"\nAs she said those words she suddenly let fall her brush. She found herself in the kitchen. Her misery was so terrible that she pinned on her hat, put on her jacket and walked out of the flat like a person in a dream. She did not know what she was doing. She was like a person so dazed by the horror of what has happened that he walks away—anywhere, as though by walking away he could escape...",

The shore and the river curved away in a dark embracing slumber to where a bank of tiny lights flickered and trembled, bodiless and far away. It was much cooler here and they removed their hats.

Thunder clamoured and rolled, and the grape-blue semi­darkness of the sea was bitten out in magnesium flashes as the lighting clawed at us from Turkey like a family of dragons. The stone floors turned damp and cold, the gutters brimmed and mumbled all day as they poured a cascade of rain into the street. Below us the sea dashed huge waves across the front where not a week ago we had been sitting in shorts and sandals, drinking coffee and ouzo, and making plans for the summer. It was a thrilling change, for one could feel the luxuriant grass fattening under the olives, and the spring flowers unwrapping their delicate petals on the anemone-starred slopes below Clepini.",

Because he now looked down the almost perpendicular landward slope of the levee through sixty feet of absolute space, upon a surface, a terrain flat as a waffle and of the color of a waffle or perhaps of the summer coat of a claybank horse and possessing that same piled density of a rug or peltry, spreading away without undulation yet with that curious appearance of imponderable solidity like fluid, broken here and there by thick humps of arsenical green which nevertheless still seemed to possess no height and by writhen veins of the color of ink which he began to suspect to be actual water but with judgment reserved, with judgment still reserved even when presently he was walking in it. That’s what he said, told: So they went on. He didn’t tell how he got the skiff singlehanded up the revetment and across the crown and down the opposite sixty foot drop, he just said he went on, in a swirling cloud of mosquitoes like hot cinders, thrusting and plunging through the saw-edged grass which grew taller than his head and which whipped back at his arms and face like limber knives, dragging by the vine-spliced painter the skiff in which the woman sat, slogging and stumbling knee-deep in something less of earth than water, along one of those black winding channels less of water than earth: and then (he was in the skiff too now, paddling with the charred log, what footing there had been having given away beneath him without warning thirty minutes ago, leaving only the air-filled bubble of his jumper-back ballooning lightly on the twilit water until he rose to the surface and scrambled into the skiff) the house, the cabin a little larger than a horse-box, of cypress boards and an iron roof, rising on ten-foot stilts slender as spiders’ legs, like a shabby and death-stricken (and probably poisonous) wading creature which had got that far into that flat waste and died with nothing anywhere in reach or sight to lie down upon, a pirogue tied to the foot of a crude ladder, a man standing in the open door holding a lantern (it was that dark now) above his head, gobbling down at them.",

    "target_paragraph": "We had come to a clearing where thousands of blueberry bushes grew. In the center of it was the packing house—a small, low building with open and screenless windows on all sides. In front of it was a school bus marked “Farm Labor Transport.” The driver stood beside his bus. He was a tall and amiable-looking man, with bare feet. He wore green trousers and a T-shirt. The end of the working day had come. Pickers were swarming around a pump—old women, middle-aged men, a young girl. A line was waiting to use an outhouse near the pump. Inside the packing house, berries half an inch thick were rolling up a portable conveyor belt and, eventually, into pint boxes. Charlie’s sister was packing the boxes. Charlie’s daughter-in-law was putting cellophane over them. And Charlie’s son Jim was supervising the operation. Charlie picked up a pint box in which berries were mounded high, and he told me with disgust that some supermarket chains knock off these mounds of extra berries and put them in new boxes, getting three or four extra pints per twelve-box tray. At one window, pickers were turning in tickets of various colors, and they were given cash in return. One picker, who appeared to be at least in his sixties, tapped Charlie on the arm and showed him a thick packet of tickets held together with a rubber band. “I found these,” the man said. “They must have fallen out of your son’s pocket.” He gave the packet to Charlie, who thanked him and counted the tickets.",

All its fences had fallen in a long time ago; the neighbours’ buffaloes would pace in the morning across the open space, snorting profoundly, without haste; the very jungle was invading it already. Jim and the girl stopped in the rank grass. The light in which they stood made a dense blackness all round, and only above their heads there was an opulent glitter of stars. He told me it was a beautiful night — quite cool, with a little stir of breeze from the river. It seems he noticed its friendly beauty. Remember this is a love story I am telling you now. A lovely night seemed to breathe on them a soft caress. The flame of the torch streamed now and then with a fluttering noise like a flag, and for a time this was the only sound. “They are in the storeroom waiting,” whispered the girl; “they are waiting for the signal.” “Who’s to give it?” he asked. She shook the torch, which blazed up after a shower of sparks. “Only you have been sleeping so restlessly,” she continued in a murmur; “I watched your sleep, too.” “You!” he exclaimed, craning his neck to look about him. “You think I watched on this night only!” she said, with a sort of despairing indignation..",

    "target_paragraph": "She laid down the paper and sat motionless, staring at her note. She understood now that he was never coming – that he had gone away because he was afraid that he might come. She rose, and walking across the floor stood gazing at herself for a long time in the brightly-lit mirror above the mantelpiece. The lines in her face came out terribly – she looked old; and when a girl looks old to herself, how does she look to other people? She moved away, and began to wander aimlessly about the room, fitting her steps with mechanical precision between the monstrous roses of Mrs Peniston’s Axminister. Suddenly she noticed that the pen with which she had written to Selden still rested against the uncovered inkstand. She seated herself again, and taking out an envelope, addressed it rapidly to Rosedale. Then she laid out a sheet of paper, and sat over it with suspended pen. It had been easy enough to write the date, and ‘Dear Mr Rosedale’ – but after that her inspiration flagged. She meant to tell him to come to her, but the words refused to shape themselves. At length she began: ‘I have been thinking—’ then she laid the pen down, and sat with her elbows on the table and her face hidden in her hands.",

He wore a neat but shabby grey suit, its open jacket revealing a Harvard University T-shirt.\n\n‘They told me you come from Ireland,’ he said. ‘My name is Moses and my teachers were Irish – Father Declan, Father Pat, Father Malachy. They were good teachers and now I love Ireland.’ He sat opposite me and added, ‘You will give me a beer.’",
