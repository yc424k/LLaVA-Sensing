But she had to take her share of the felicitations which the whole far-reaching circle of friends and relations distributed to every member of Hubert’s family on the approach of the happy event. Nor was this the hardest of her trials. Raymond had done what she asked—he had stood out against his mother’s protests, set aside considerations of prudence, and consented to go up to Paris for two months; but he had done so on the understanding that during their stay they should exercise the most unremitting economy. As dinner-giving put the heaviest strain on their budget, all hospitality was suspended; and when Undine attempted to invite a few friends informally she was warned that she could not do so without causing the gravest offense to the many others genealogically entitled to the same attention.",

As he had done an hour earlier—positively he had been sitting there a whole hour, and he thought it was five minutes—she pushed the tangle of creepers aside, and stood on the threshold staring in; and, also as he had done, having observed the signs of occupation, and the tidiness where that afternoon, when she showed it to Miss Dodge, had been cobwebs and grime, and the clean smell of soapsuds in place of damp frowst, and the pail of water set ready by the stove, and the kettle, lid removed, filled with roses, she called out, surprise and question in her voice, even as it had been in his, “Miss Dodge? Are you there, Miss Dodge?”",

Again and again, my subconscious took me down into the moist valley of warm, familiar faces, where the door of an old house creaked open to reveal something rich and vital that I couldn’t do without. The eyes of jackals lined the fringes of the forest like lanterns, then I would wake up. By coming to Strandja, I had opened some kind of Pandora’s Box in my own psyche. Strandja was now holding me in. There was a powerful gravitational pull in these ranges. What if some voodoo had been put on me two years ago, in the Village in the Valley? Back then, I hadn’t believed in uroki, in mountains that didn’t let you in or out, or in springs whose cold water drew you back. Now I wasn’t so sure about the things I didn’t believe in.",

It was the scene in Steamboat Bill Jr. in which the front wall of a house falls onto Keaton, but he survives because he is standing in the space of an open window. To make the scene maximally thrilling?and it truly is?the window was made just two inches wider than Keaton on either side. Had the wall warped or buckled slightly or the point of impact been fractionally miscalculated, Keaton would have been killed. Perhaps nothing says more about silent movies and those who performed in them than that actors routinely risked their lives for the sake of a good joke. That didn’t happen in talking pictures.",

At 10.30 a.m. its door stood wide open but there was no one in sight. The high-ceilinged, dimly lit foyer was a study in greys and browns. On my way to the long reception desk I tripped over a central strip of ragged, dark grey matting. No one responded to loud thumping, followed by questioning shouts, so I sat in one of several dark brown armchairs (c.1950, their guts protruding) and contemplated the empty cigarette packets on the floor and the overflowing ashtrays and empty tea-glasses on chipped and scratched coffee tables.",

    "target_paragraph": "Saturated with the Etruscans, well fed, pleased with the hotel, we pack and take off for Talamone, a high-walled town over the sea. The water must be pure here. It’s clear as far out as I can wade and quite cold. At our modern hotel, there’s no beach, just rocks jutting straight up, with concrete platforms on the water where you can sit in a striped chair and sunbathe. We chose Talamone because it is adjacent to the Maremma’s preserved seashore, the only long stretch of Tuscan coast unblemished by development. Most sand beaches are a series of concessions for umbrellas and rows of chairs as deep as the beach is wide, leaving only a strip along the water for walking. Often these concessions have changing rooms, showers, and snack bars. Italians seem to like this way of being at the beach. So many people to talk to! And, usually, families or groups of friends are together. As a Californian, I’m unhappy to be surrounded. Beaches I grew up on in Georgia and my years of loving the raw windy stretches of sand at Point Reyes unequip me for the Old World beaches. Ed and my daughter like the umbrellas. They’ve dragged me to Viareggio, Marina di Pisa, Pietrasanta, insist it’s just different; you have to get into it. I like to lie on the beach and listen to the waves, to walk with no one in sight. The Tuscan beaches are as crowded as streets. The Maremma preserve, however, even has wild horses, foxes, boar, and deer, according to the brochure. I love the smell of the macchia, the wild salty shrubs sailors say they can smell when still out of sight of land. Mostly there’s nothing—trails with wild rosemary and sea lavender through sandy hills, the vacant beaches. We walk and sit on the beach all morning. Tyrrhenian, Tyrrhenian the waves say, that ancient sea. We’ve brought mortadella sandwiches, a hunk of parmigiano, and iced tea. Except for a small group of people down the beach, I have my wish to be in nature alone. What color is the sea? Cobalt is close. No, it’s lapis lazuli, exactly the color of Mary’s dress in so many paintings, with a tesselated sheen of silver. It’s good to walk, after days of chasing sites in the car. I’m trying to read but the sun is blaring—perhaps an umbrella would be nice.",

He thought her beautiful, believed her impeccably wise; dreamed of her, wrote poems to her, which, ignoring the subject, she corrected in red ink; he saw her, one summer evening, walking in a green dress in a square; ‘It has flowered,’ the gardener might have said, had he opened the door; had he come in, that is to say, any night about this time, and found him writing; found him tearing up his writing; found him finishing a masterpiece at three o’clock in the morning and running out to pace the streets, and visiting churches, and fasting one day, drinking another, devouring Shakespeare, Darwin, The History of Civilisation,* and Bernard Shaw.",

It had taken them eighteen days, but as they stepped onto the airy heights of Mt. York, they were rewarded with a view of pastoral splendor never before seen by white people in Australia. Below them, for as far as the gaze could reach, stretched a sunny, golden Eden, a continent of grass—enough to support a population of millions. Australia would be a mighty country. The news, when they returned to Sydney, was electrifying. In less than two years a road was cut through the wilderness and the westward peopling of Australia had begun.",

At 5.30 I began a nine-mile marathon up continuously severe gradients through Pietermaritzburg’s richest suburbs – each garden like a medium-sized botanical park. By 6.30 the heat was debilitating. By 9.30 a roaring scorching gale had sprung up and was against me. By 10.30 it seemed I was sickening for something; I felt dizzy, nauseous, headachy. At 11 I gave up and for the next five hours lay under a giant bluegum, the sweat flowing non-stop as I read Edward Said’s 1993 Reith Lectures. Meanwhile, that strange scorching gale never abated for a moment. At 4 p.m. I struggled on, too enfeebled to cycle though the road was level. It took me almost three hours to walk the next six miles and I reflected that if this is typical Natal summer weather I won’t get much further. But just now the TV news reassured me; today’s was the highest temperature recorded locally since December 1968 – 41.2°C. And humidity ‘reached the danger level of 105’. Small wonder I still feel a bit odd. Tomorrow must be a rest day.",

Firelight is romantic and makes everyone look beautiful, just as it did for the Bush Camp. With lanterns lit and a beaming staff, the place looked perfect.

Then he switched to English, which he spoke well. Vladimir-the-Yupik told me he comes to this camp to fish for salmon every year. He lives in the village of Novo Chaplino, his son had come with him, and his wife, Cenia, was the pregnant young woman inside. The son, he said, had found a float from a whaling ship that day. An orange rubber ball maybe three feet in diameter, it lay on the ground nearby. He said it had belonged to a Japanese ship and was worth a lot of money. Then he told me that the fish hanging to dry on the outside of his cabin wall were called antler fish and tasted very good boiled in seal oil. He also enjoyed eating young cormorants, which he catches before they have all their feathers and are able to fly. He had shot three Dall sheep, another tasty species, on the far side of the inlet last year. “I like this country,” he said, gazing reflectively at the foggy starkness around him and dragging on another book-paper cigarette. When he turned to go inside the cabin, I saw on the back of his softball warm-up jacket the words POLARIS BAR, NOME, ALASKA.",

I remember the engine noise which seemed to increase in volume the slower we went. I remember the symphony of creaks and groans and clangs rising to its climax, and the bus drawing to a halt on a high Turkestan plateau. A series of repairs kept us going until, sometime after midnight, we drew into a freezing castellated caravanserai. There we bedded down on the floor in one big dormitory. The next morning, to Louisa’s horror, we were given soup to drink with great lumps of greasy yellow yak-fat floating in it.",

With a bill-hook in one hand, and a leather glove much too large for her on the other, she was making spars—such as are used by thatchers—with great rapidity. She wore a leather apron for this purpose, which was also much too large for her figure. On her left hand lay a bundle of the straight smooth hazel rods called spar-gads*—the raw material of her manufacture: on her right a heap of chips and ends—the refuse—with which the fire was maintained: in front a pile of the finished articles. To produce them she took up each gad, looked critically at it from end to end, cut it to length, split it into four, and sharpened each of the quarters with dexterous blows which brought it to a triangular point precisely resembling that of a bayonet.",

But after fifty years of destruction, there are few kura left to demolish, and ubu objects are gradually disappearing from the Kyoto auctions. Folding screens, in particular, have declined drastically in quantity and quality, and ink paintings have only a few more years before they vanish as well. The spring is running dry. My ability to keep collecting depends on just one thing: the lack of interest in Asian art displayed by the Japanese. As long as this continues, I will be able to keep adding to my collection.

He came to understand that Cuba had somehow invented its own form of communism, one that was different from the Soviet system in both substance and spirit. It wasn’t simply that Cuba was considered part of the nonaligned movement, or that Fidel had just assumed leadership of that group. The two countries operated in fundamentally different ways. Although the Communist Party of Cuba held supreme power, Cuba was being run according to the personal ideology of Fidel Castro and his family. Some called it castrismo, and others just got used to saying, “this thing.” It was a mash-up of socialist concepts shaped by Fidel’s obstinate will. Havana took money from Moscow, lots of it, but Fidel rarely took orders from the Kremlin.",

We got back to the oak tree at the very moment the car came snorting uphill. István told us he had run into an old fellow-hussar and couldn’t get away, and we teased him about being so popular. He said he wished he’d been down to bathe; then murmured to me, ‘Not much point, though, now the reaping’s finished.’",

    "target_paragraph": "We rode through endless thickets of yellow-pollened cassi—if riding it could be called; for those fragrant thickets were inhabited by wasps. And such wasps! Great yellow fellows the size of small canary birds, darting through the air with behind them drifting a bunch of legs a couple of inches long. A stallion abruptly stands on his forelegs and thrusts his hind legs skyward. He withdraws them from the sky long enough to make one wild jump ahead, and then returns them to their index position. It is nothing. His thick hide has merely been punctured by a flaming lance of wasp virility. Then a second and a third stallion, and all the stallions, begin to cavort on their forelegs over the precipitous landscape. Swat! A white-hot poniard penetrates my cheek. Swat again!! I am stabbed in the neck. I am bringing up the rear and getting more than my share. There is no retreat, and the plunging horses ahead, on a precarious trail, promise little safety. My horse overruns Charmian's horse, and that sensitive creature, fresh-stung at the psychological moment, planks one of his hoofs into my horse and the other hoof into me. I thank my stars that he is not steel-shod, and half-arise from the saddle at the impact of another flaming dagger. I am certainly getting more than my share, and so is my poor horse, whose pain and panic are only exceeded by mine.",

So beautiful was the sound of their voices that by degrees they scarcely listened to the words they framed. Long silences came between their words, which were no longer silences of struggle and confusion but refreshing silences, in which trivial thoughts moved easily. They began to speak naturally of ordinary things, of the flowers and the trees, how they grew there so red, like garden flowers at home, and there bent and crooked like the arm of a twisted old man.",

And in respectable quarters with stucco pillars through small front gardens, lightly swathed, with combs in their hair (having run up to see the children), women came; men waited for them, with their coats blowing open, and the motor started. Everybody was going out. What with these doors being opened, and the descent and the start, it seemed as if the whole of London were embarking in little boats moored to the bank, tossing on the waters, as if the whole place were floating off in carnival. And Whitehall was skated over, silver beaten as it was, skated over by spiders, and there was a sense of midges round the arc lamps; it was so hot that people stood about talking. And here in Westminster was a retired Judge, presumably, sitting four square at his house door dressed all in white. An Anglo-Indian presumably.",

Victor Serov is a trim man in his fifties with ice-blue eyes and a blond mustache thick enough to hold the many icicles that have hung from it. Publicity director defines only one of his occupations; Victor Serov is also a guide who specializes in extreme adventure, and expeditions to most of the cold places on earth you can name. He has been to the North Pole twenty-two times, led a ski trek to the South Pole, and wintered in Antarctica twice. He also climbs mountains, and his skill as an alpinist is such that he leads climbs all over the world. When I said I wanted to cross Siberia by car, he said he could help me. He added, offhandedly, that he did not think such a trip would be difficult to do.",

The hanamichi (‘flower path’) through the audience is a particularly famous example. Actors enter and leave the stage via this walkway; separated from the action on the main stage, the actor on the hanamichi enters a solitary realm where he is free to reveal the inner depths of his role. For instance, the play Kumagai Jinya (Kumagai’s Battle Camp) is a traditional tale of giri-ninjo (the conflict between love and duty): Kumagai must kill his own son and substitute the boy’s severed head for the son of his lord. His ruse is successful, but in remorse Kumagai shaves off his hair to enter a life of asceticism, and exits down the hanamichi. When the late Kanzaburo XVIII played Kumagai, he imparted such a sense of personal desolation as he exited down the hanamichi that Kumagai Jinya seemed not a tale of giri-ninjo, but an antiwar play.",

    "target_paragraph": "Mario had left Havana in 1970, aged twenty-five, and settled in Key West because he detested Miami’s anti-Castroism. ‘I felt like I was living in an unhealthy swamp with no good air to breath. I’d left for the same reason you, as a writer, would have left. You wouldn’t be happy in a country where you couldn’t express all your true thoughts and feelings. Still I admire the good the Revolution was doing for most – my bad karma, being in the repressed minority! So I sailed away not hating el comandante but seeing no space for me in his world. You could meet many like me in Miami but having to keep quiet, not allowed not to hate Castro! More repression! In Key West there’s space for all sorts.’",
