Their next door neighbours, walking down the path together, kids going to school, or just playing outside, they are constantly surrounded. The Jews are not called heroes for nothing. Their whole life is filled with purpose. They are living on a higher plane … Living in such close proximity to the Ma’arat Hamachpela – what more can you ask for when raising a family and trying to instil the precious values of our Torah young children? The Jewish families living in Hebron truly ‘walk the walk’ in every sense … We must be so thankful and grateful to our brothers and sisters living on the front line, enabling us to come and visit our Patriarchs and Matriarchs … There are truly no words to describe the spiritual feelings and emotions that one experiences … to breathe in that special air, to live that life of self-sacrifice for a higher purpose and truth, to stand united and show courage to those living there on a daily basis!",

    "target_paragraph": "The Frau Förster insisted on showing me the bedrooms. They are simple and very clean, each one with a beautiful view. The rest of the house, including the dining-room, does not lend itself to enthusiastic description. I saw the long table at which the four-and-twenty painters eat. They were doing it when I looked in, and had been doing it the whole time I was under the chestnuts. It was not because of the many dishes that they sat there so long, but because of the few waiters. There were at least forty people learning to be patient, and one waiter and a boy to drive the lesson home. The bathing, too, at Vilm cannot be mentioned in the same breath with the glorious bathing at Lauterbach. There is no smiling attendant in a white sunbonnet waiting to take your things and dry them, to rub you down when you come out shivering, and if needful jump in and pull you out when you begin to drown. At Vilm the bathing-hut lies on the east shore, and you go to it across a meadow—the divinest strip of meadow, it is true, with sea behind you and sea before you, and cattle pasturing, and a general radiant air about it as though at any moment the daughters of the gods might come over the buttercups to bleach their garments whiter in the sun. But beautiful as it is, it is a very hot walk, and there is no path. Except the path through the rye from the landing-stage up to the inn there is not a regular path on the island—only a few tracks here and there where the cows are driven home in the evening; and to reach the bathing-hut you must plunge straight through meadow-grass, and not mind grasshoppers hopping into your clothes. Then the water is so shallow just there that you must wade quite a dangerous-looking distance before, lying down, it will cover you; and while you are wading, altogether unable, as he who has waded knows, to hurry your steps, however urgent the need, you blush to think that some or all of the four-and-twenty painters are probably sitting on rocks observing you. Wading back, of course, you blush still more. I never saw so frank a bathing-place. It is beautiful—in a lovely curve, cliffs clothed with beeches on one side, and the radiant meadow along the back of the rocks on the other; but the whole island can see you if you go out far enough to be able to swim, and if you do not you are still a conspicuous object and a very miserable one, bound to catch any wandering eye as you stand there alone, towering out of water that washes just over your ankles.",

No trace of flowers or shrubs remained; the walks, the ornamental stone seats and artificial terraces, were merging into brown earth. Here, in the centre of this ruined pleasaunce, the health-giving fountain had lately flowed, bubbling up in a couch-shaped basin of cement. It was now dry. But a damp warmth still clung to its rim, whereon the mineral had left a comely deposit of opaline texture. Lowering his hand he felt an intermittent stream of hot air rising out of the ground, feeble as the breath of a dying man. Still some mysterious gusts of life down there, he concluded, in the dark earth. How curious that volcanic connection with the mainland, of which Count Caloveglia had spoken!",

The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised.

Every time we neared a village, the pick-up driver increased his speed, while one of the guards would flick off his safety catch, balance on the back-flap and search the rooftops for snipers. Before long we turned off the main Upper Egypt road and headed into the town of Sanabu. This was the place that the Gema’a al-Islamiyya had attacked two years before, initiating the current campaign. Two convoys of armed activists had swooped down early in the morning. By the time they withdrew, seven Coptic farmers had been hunted down and murdered in their fields; seven others were shot dead in the streets. I had read brief agency reports on the massacre, but wanted to know more. What had precipitated the attack? Had it been completely unexpected?",

It was overcast; the invisible wind blew strong and steady among the invisible palms, from the invisible sea—a harsh steady sound full of the murmur of surf on the outside barrier islands, the spits and scars of sand bastioned with tossing and shabby pines. “Hemorrhage?”",

The portly heroes drove Mercedes-Benzes. They flashed Nikons at the camera. They decanted bottles of Johnnie Walker and showed off copies of Time on their coffee tables. And the poignancy was further redoubled by the fact that the government imported no goods whatsoever, and assessed an enormous import duty on all foreign goods that were privately imported; thus, foreign substances had the lure not only of unattainable luxuries but also of forbidden fruit.",

And as I walked down “Poppies’ Gang,” the dusty, narrow lane where I had stayed the year before in the Lasi Erawati, I could hardly orient myself for all the new additions. On one side of the field full of cows was a snazzy new singles bar, and on the other, a glassy café called Warung Transformer. Farther down the lane was a fresh two-story joint called Kempu’s Café (offering pizzas, tofuburgers, beef tacos and three kinds of guacamole), and down by the sea a newcomer called Chip’s that served hot dogs, hamburgers and piña coladas. More motorbikes than ever were racing down the unpaved road, throwing up water from puddles and forcing old women to back against bushes.",

The sound of forest waters in the night, the rustling of cool corn-blades in the dark, the goat-cries of a boy into the wind, the pounding of great wheels upon a rail, the sound of quiet casual voices at a country station in the night, and the thorn of delight, the tongueless cry of ecstasy that trembles on the lips of the country kid as he lies awake for the first time in the night in the top berth of a Pullman car while the great wheels pound beneath him toward the city, and he hears the good-looking woman in the berth below him stir languorously and move, in a gesture of heavied and sensual appeasement, her milky thighs. – These things had been upon the earth, past all the mockery of the old scornmaker’s pride, and would endure for ever. These facts, together with a thousand more – the incredible magic of the peach bloom in the month of April, the smell of rivers after rain, the wordless glory and first green of a young tree seen in a city street at daybreak in the month of May, the bird-song breaking into light once more, a cry, a leaf, the passing of a cloud – these facts, as bright as herrings in a shining water, as literal as nails to fix the hides of falsehood to the wall, as real as April and all magic whatsoever, returned now under the furious light of his awakened and incontrovertible memory.",

Drunk and disorderly? Anti-social thuggery? Or something more political? These and other nosy questions were duly noted. I had already ordered the maximum number of documents allowed, twenty-five at a time. Sometimes, I didn’t exactly know what they were, but photographed everything in sight.

The courtyard project that the realtor assured me had been abandoned had newly come to life at seven o’clock one morning shortly after I moved in. Particularly vexing, the hired hands only worked when I was present, never in the afternoon or evening while I was out teaching. My school classroom was the same, just when I was about to do a listening exercise, PRBLAH-BLUH-BLAH-PPBLAHAHAHAUGH! The racket emanated from the adjoining building; for the better part of a year, every day around 5 p.m. the infernal attack would begin. If I was doing an individual lesson, I had the option of switching to the closet cum studio that reeked of fish from the dumpsters directly under its window. Once, during an extended serenade, a high school student in a class often subjected to the absurdity shouted over the din, “One day we’re going to walk outside and there’ll be a castle next door!” I came to appreciate the hidden beauty in the abandoned construction projects throughout the region.",

A few solitary trees dotted the trail, but none offered any real shade. The air felt like a dry sauna. It wasn’t long before Syd fell a couple of turns behind. I worried about him having another episode of vertigo in the heat but my pack was too heavy and it was too hot to stop without any shade, so I just pressed on.

They plonked themselves down, forcing me and Katz into opposite corners, and immediately began delving in the food bags, passing round handkerchiefs full of little dead fish, hunks of dry bread, runny boiled eggs and dripping slabs of pungent curdled cheese whose smell put me in mind of the time my family returned from summer vacation to discover that my mother had inadvertently locked the cat in the broom cupboard for the three hottest weeks of the year. They ate with smacking lips, wiping their stubby fingers on their shirts, before sinking one by one into deep and spluttering comas. By some quirk of Balkan digestion, they expanded as they slept, squeezing us further and further into our respective corners until we were pressed against the wall like lumps of Blu-Tack. We had twenty-two hours of this to get through.",

Each day she departed directly after her swim and sunbath, with the pad and color box, leaving him to move about the house empty yet at the same time thunderous with the hard impact of her presence—the few garments she owned, the whisper of her bare feet on the boards—while he believed that he was worrying, not about the inevitable day on which their food would run out, but at the fact that he did not seem to worry about it: a curious state which he had experienced once before when his sister’s husband had taken him to task one summer because he refused to exercise his vote. He remembered the exasperation just about to become rage in which he had tried to present his reasons to his brother-in-law, realising at last that he was talking faster and faster not to convince the brother-in-law but to justify his own rage as in a mild nightmare he might be grasping for his falling trousers; that it was not even to the brother-in-law he was talking but to himself.",

Another village offered hospitality I wouldn’t take. Babu and Kolieva stayed and drank water outside one of the ragged huts, but I went stubbornly on to where the forest began again.

But I went on: I couldn’t bear the thought of waiting; I had been walking now for more than eight hours, but I had gained my second wind. One of the two men dropped behind; I was alone with Babu and the harps; it was not only the heat that was fading out of the air, the ferocity of the light between the branches was tamed.",

It was like driving on swirling dunes, and handling of the vehicle bore no similarity to driving on tarmac or gravel. This wasn't helped by the fact that I'd stupidly forgotten to deflate the tyres, and their lack of traction made driving feel like trying to control a speedboat on a choppy sea. For the most part I was trying to follow the faint tyre grooves of other vehicles in the sand, but occasionally these had been obscured by the harsh desert wind, which called for a slow-down to snail's pace as we tried to pick out the best route, avoiding deep sand which could strand us.",

But meanwhile many packed trains and buses were continuing to arrive from the townships, from rural areas, from nearby towns. Today the authorities provided free transport – an admirable ploy, were it not that the organizers of this event lack imagination. When some 150,000 Madiba-worshippers are expected to converge on an open space to see their idol it is worse than tactless to exclude them from the best vantage point by erecting a grandstand that blocks their view – apparently for the benefit of foreign media people who failed to attend. In the bad old days this crassness might have provoked a full-scale riot. In euphoric, Madiba-guided South Africa it at first seemed to be causing only a good-humoured crush. Inexplicably, the 300 red chairs, occupying a large space in front of me beyond the wire fence, remained empty.",

As Tania boasted, ‘When overseas people talked about the Revolution collapsing, its spirit was being revived here in this city by the new challenge of having to feed ourselves’. Those revivalists had Marx on their side. In Das Kapital he noted: ‘Capitalist production … disturbs the metabolic interaction between man and the earth, it prevents the return to the soil of its constituent elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing. All progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the workers, but of robbing the soil.’",
