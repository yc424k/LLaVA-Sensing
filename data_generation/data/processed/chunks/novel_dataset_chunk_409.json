From the British, Zionists learned how to keep Arabs down – with executions and demolished houses.’ He paused, then raised his voice to say that recently he had read Mein Kampf in Arabic and ‘I only hate Hitler because he didn’t kill them all.’",

Travellers stopped to fill up with cheese, yogurt, and katuk, the first fatty cream of the milk. At the turn of the twentieth century, after observing peasants in Rhodopean villages where you lived for ever, the pioneering Russian microbiologist Ilya Mechnikov singled out the mandra, with its leather saddlebags that allowed milk to be transported over the mountains on muleback, as the key to the remarkable longevity of the locals. Mechnikov identified one product as the agent that made gut floras healthy and prolonged lives: yogurt. Lactobacillus bulgaricus, named after the Geneva-based Bulgarian student of medicine Grigorov who isolated the good bacterium that ferments milk into yogurt, is alive and well in our yogurt pots. But the only thing that survives from the mandras that gave rise to yogurt is these ruins. And dairy-derived expressions. For example, ‘a woman like a mandra’, an old-fashioned compliment. In the ruins of the mandra, Galen told me a story, his gentle voice punctuated by distant gunshots and barks.",

UNRWA then calculated that a square kilometre would be space enough – just – for 5 to 6,000 displaced persons. By 1960 there were more than 9,000 and structures had replaced tents: one 3 x 3m cement block room per family. In the 1970s a sewage system was provided, and running water, and each family got a bathroom. In the 1980s electricity arrived. Meanwhile families were growing and the occupying power forbade building beyond the one square kilometre – so the Balatans built up. And up and up, on foundations that were dodgy to begin with, using the cheapest possible materials.",

In early August I returned to Anchorage, which seemed an appropriate midpoint on my journey, being equidistant from my first maritime stop, Ketchikan (about 770 air miles southeast), and my last, Dutch Harbor, in the Aleutians (about 790 air miles southwest). By this time, the luxury Crystal Serenity’s sold-out burst into the silent, and ice-free, seas of the Northwest Passage was just a couple of weeks away. The ship was scheduled to make some of the same stops I was planning in the wake of the Elder, and I’d called and e-mailed a few times to see whether they’d be interested in having a reporter on board. Perhaps, I thought, some clever marketing executive would see the parallels between the historic, but comfortable, 1899 voyage of the Elder and the Crystal Serenity’s own history-making excursion, on which I assumed no one would be camping in the observation lounge. The stops on the second half of my journey?Whittier, Kodiak, Katmai National Park, Nome?were spread out along a couple thousand miles of almost roadless coast, only part of which was covered by sporadic ferry service: the three-day end-of-the-line run out to the Aleutians. The Serenity was making the same voyage, and the idea of traveling on a ship with its own casino and driving range sounded a lot more appealing than my other option: three days on the Alaska Marine Highway’s oldest ship, the fifty-year-old Tustumena, aka the “Trusty Tusty,” aka the “Rusty Tusty.”",

Each consists of a series of fortifications arranged in roughly concentric circles. Each has a keep – or donjon – at the center of these circles, and each contains numerous turrets and angles from which the defenders, in relative safety, can inflict damage on the attackers. Kumamoto Castle, completed in 1607, is one of the three largest castles in Japan (the outermost of its concentric circles is nearly thirteen kilometers in circumference) and was the last to suffer a medieval-style siege (during the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877). Strolling round the castle on the warm 116th day of my walk, I was struck not so much by its similarities to European models as by one significant difference.",

Stripping the thatch from the roof, we strapped it to our backs, four bundles at a time, and carried it over the mountain paths to my house. As it was old thatch, the accumulated soot of decades of hearth fires puffed out with every step, and by the end of each day we all looked like coal miners.",

Charity had spent more than she could afford on the dress, which was to surpass those of all the other girls; she had wanted to let North Dormer see that she was worthy of Harney’s admiration. Above the dress, folded on the pillow, was the white veil which the young women who took part in the exercises were to wear under a wreath of asters; and beside the veil a pair of slim white satin shoes that Ally had produced from an old trunk in which she stored mysterious treasures.",

But they were fixed and secure in something; he thought of that, he remembered in an instant of despairing rage the firm earth fixed and founded strong and cemented fast and stable forever by the generations of laborious sweat, somewhere beneath him, beyond the reach of his feet, when, and again without warning, the stern of the skiff struck him a stunning blow across the bridge of his nose. The instinct which had caused him to cling to it now caused him to fling the paddle into the boat in order to grasp the gunwale with both hands just as the skiff pivoted and spun away again. With both hands free he now dragged himself over the stern and lay prone on his face, streaming with blood and water and panting, not with exhaustion but with that furious rage which is terror’s aftermath.",

The City is usually more crowded and noisy because there’s a billiard table; people are rather more dashing, get a little drunk and tell indecent stories; but not if there’s a woman present. I had never found myself in a place which was more protective to women; it might have been inhabited by rowing Blues with Buchman consciences and secret troubles. Everyone either had a wife at Hill Station and drank a bit and bought chocolates at the weekend and showed photographs of their children at home:",

There were cases of Twain memorabilia – first editions, one of his typewriters, photographs, some letters. There was precious little to link him to the house or the town. It is worth remembering that Twain got the hell out of both Hannibal and Missouri as soon as he could, and was always disinclined to come back. I went outside and looked around. Beside the house was a white fence with a sign saying TOM SAWYER’S FENCE. HERE STOOD THE BOARD FENCE WHICH TOM SAWYER PERSUADED HIS GANG TO PAY HIM FOR THE PLEASURE OF WHITE-WASHING. TOM SAT BY AND SAW THAT IT WAS WELL DONE. Really wakes up your interest in literature, doesn’t it? Next door to the Twain house and museum – and I mean absolutely right next to it – was the Mark Twain Drive-In Restaurant and Dinette, with cars parked in little bays and people grazing off trays attached to their windows. It really lent the scene a touch of class. I began to understand why Clemens didn’t just leave town but also changed his name.",

Aarzoo often wears jeans or Western dresses, but Billie, who’s far more sedate, wears Indian clothes or conservative long skirts and will only come out when her brother is around to accompany her. The weekly club ritual begins at one of the few discos. Due to licensing laws and a Punjabi prohibitionist attitude to alcohol, most of the places that offer drinking and dancing are in soulless five-star hotels or in the smoky basements of bad restaurants. There’s one new nightclub that, apart from having too much exposed brass, is bearable. It always has a competitive queue out front but Aarzoo is a practiced pusher and hustler and we get in relatively easily. Indians always carry their ID—they can get married at the age of fifteen but can’t drink in this state until twenty-five. Inside, the decor is bland and the fashion is black. Hundreds and hundreds of young Delhi things in tight black pants and little tops do the puja of the pose.",

The C Class hotel was a three-storey cement box; my room was a cubby-hole with a full complement of dead flies, mashed mosquitoes on the walls and hairy dust balls drifting around the floor. The population of Kastelli, not surprisingly, appeared sunk in speechless gloom, none more so than the proprietor of the C Class hotel where I was, also not surprisingly, the only guest. On the side of the Post Office, across from my room, a political enthusiast had painted a large black slogan. Amepikanoi was the first word, and I needed no Greek to know that it meant Yank Go Home. You bet your boots, gladly, cannot wait to oblige; but there was no way out until the afternoon bus the next day.",

The hawks flapping heavily over Bathurst, a long low backcloth of houses and trees along a sandy beach; a swarm of figures in the native quarter like flies on a piece of meat; the not being allowed to land because of yellow fever; the sense of isolation that the woman had as she went off to join her husband in the quarantined town; this was more really the Coast—the seedy Pole in a singlet and a pair of dirty white trousers who came on board at Conakry, couldn’t speak any English or French and wanted to learn the name of the suits in bridge. The Captain took his gun and shot a hawk which sat in the rigging, the gulls scattered, twisting in the glittering air, and the dusty body plunged through them on to the deck, like a reminder of darkness.",

The same claim could be made, however, for Avenida Brasil in Asunción, which divides this abandoned bastard child of Tijuana and La Jolla down the middle: on one side, the bargain-basement commotion of downtown; on the other, the jasmine-scented quiet of the mansions. What can one say about a city where the four-star hotels offer no direct-dial phone service—even within Asunción—while the taxis are Mercedeses? Where women carrying baskets of fruit on their heads walk past ice cream parlors that accept eleven international credit cards? Where the per capita income is half that of Mexico, yet twenty-first-century arcades abound? At the very least, it seems fair to say that Asunción enjoyed a radical facelift in the seventies, when billions of dollars poured into the town from President Stroessner’s construction deals—and it now seems only fitting that the main features of the suburbs are “facial” salons, makeup parlors, and plastic surgeons.",

He concentrated upon her finally, but all she would say was that it was a family secret brought from Africa which could not be divulged. He kept at her and she yielded enough to say that she could not tell him until he had been baptised in a certain ceremony. He went to the trouble and expense to have the baptism. After that was over, she returned to her original position that it was an inherited secret which she could not divulge under pain of death. So that is as far as we got on the food-without-fire ceremony. This is an annual affair and some day I shall try again.",

We were visibly steaming as we wandered along a rough street where Rachel’s food-orientated eye discerned what seemed to be an eating-house, some thirty feet below street level. Four urban-type men were sitting at a rickety wooden table in a farm-yard, drinking home-made spirits while awaiting a late lunch. Noticing the gringoes, they yelled cheerful ‘Olés!’ and beckoned us. Soon Juana had been tethered amidst pigs, hens, dogs, goats, turkeys and guinea-pigs – all swarming around the yard seeking what they might devour but apparently on excellent terms with each other. When presented with her luncheon Alf, which it had greatly inconvenienced me to transport thus far, our mulita bonito spurned it. ‘Not fresh enough for Her Highness’, deduced Rachel; which was probably true, though I saw it being cut at dawn this morning. The proprietress – a handsome, charming mestizo campesino – then detected her pigs trying to steal our Alf and rushed to rescue it; but I said the pigs could have it. In exchange, we were given a free lunch of excellent soup to which one added barley-mash according to taste from a big dish in the centre of the table, followed by potatoes with rich gravy and a tiny leg of roast guinea-pig. (At home I’m both a vegetarian and a devotee of guinea-pigs; walking through the Andes, such sensibilities become atrophied. Here one would eat one’s grandmother, even if she weren’t very well cooked.)",

The mosquitoes stayed close but in lessening numbers, it seemed, as I climbed over humps of travertine toward the head of the waterfall. Near the brink of it, six feet from the drop-off and the plunge, I found a sandy cove just big enough for my bed. The racing creek as it soared free over the edge created a continuous turbulence in the air sufficient to keep away all flying insects. I slept well that night and the next day carried the cot to the place and made it my permanent bedroom for the rest of July and all of August.",
