In whatever incomprehensible manner Sotillo had already got his information about the lighter, he had not captured it. That was clear.

His wits were very much at work. He detected in Sotillo a certain air of doubt, of irresolution.",

That was satisfying; that was real. Ah, how she hated her—hot, hypocritical, corrupt; with all that power; Elizabeth’s seducer; the woman who had crept in to steal and defile (Richard would say, What nonsense!). She hated her: she loved her. It was enemies one wanted, not friends—not Mrs Durrant and Clara,* Sir William and Lady Bradshaw, Miss Truelock and Eleanor Gibson (whom she saw coming upstairs). They must find her if they wanted her. She was for the party!",

I had no possible guide to the idea of suicide and the sight of the little flask of nitrate of amyl in Florence’s hand suggested instantly to my mind the idea of the failure of her heart. Nitrate of amyl, you understand, is the drug that is given to relieve sufferers from angina pectoris.*",

Meanwhile, on the other side of the Square, at police headquarters, the sergeant had sent John Chapman out to head Dick off. Mr. Chapman was perhaps the best-liked man on the force.

After each question she had to loosen the typewriter platen and move the sheet of paper around to get the next answer in the vicinity of the blank space for it. (This was not her strongest skill.) The whole thing took ages. Finally, I was given a carbon copy of the report to use in securing a refund. The top copy, I have no doubt, went straight into a wastebasket.",

A woman crouched on the steps of an all-night market, three suitcases in front of her. A man reciting to himself, outside a darkened theater. Another wheeling a suitcase across a deserted intersection—2:57, says the digital clock outside the bank.",

These are the lucky interludes one enjoys nowhere so much as on an island – to see the Lion Mount, as if for the first time, through the cool rare eyes of Rose Macaulay, herself bound for ruins stretching still further back into time than this Gothic castle in the shadow of which I lived. (‘Have you ever wondered how it is that the utilitarian objects of one period become objects of aesthetic value to succeeding ones? This thing was constructed purely to keep armies at bay, to shatter men and horses, to guard a pass. How do we find it more beautiful than the Maginot Line? Does time itself confer something on relics and ruins which isn’t inherent in the design of the builder? Will we ever visit the Maginot Line with such awe at its natural beauty?’) The thoughts of a fellow-writer which tease the mind long after she has gone …",

We finally took a little open-air train up the river that turned into these awe-inspiring monsters. There is a wooden walkway that goes over the river, and the water is wide, and quiet, and appears to be slow moving … until it suddenly hits the cliffs that transform it into the huge, mind-blowing phenomenon that it is. We sat over the river, and talked about how the river had become something unique and amazing just by cruising along on its path. How even if your life seemed quiet and typical, you never knew if around the next bend you were about to become something spectacular. Or fall spectacularly in love. We talked about how that was probably how I wanted to feel when I fell in love, like I was going over a waterfall for all eternity, and how that might just possibly not be sustainable, or, if you really thought about it, enjoyable. Then we made fun of ourselves for getting so deep, man. Kristin-Adjacent can get pretty cheesy.",

They give the city a transitory look, these mountains; it seems that it could have grown up anywhere among them, or could be moved quite easily, but that is counteracted a little by the broken lines of the old aqueducts, not romantic at all from up there, coming in across the flat country; coming in much farther than you would ever think from below, to blend with sections of the brick Aurelian wall right in the busiest tangle of the city. They are of course distinctly Roman, so are the eccentric color and course of the Tiber, and the fury of the little figures you see twitching about on the football (soccer) fields, but nothing is nearly as lovely or permanent-looking in this view as the railroad tracks: a cool graph of somewhat insane lines with their ends, in a sudden reversion to control, all coming sidelong together like a boxful of pencils.",

The Tushita center is a sweet collection of Tibetan-style buildings set among damp trees; inside its shrine room, or gompa, a massive brass Buddha looks down at twenty Western travelers, and water bowls decorate an altar of photos of past and present teachers. A monk called David takes our class; an Aussie in his former life, he sits pale, shorn and orange-freckled in dark robes. He makes us meditate on the fact that we are going to die.

Emerging outside onto the streets of Japan was a perennial and most curious adventure. Stimulation was everywhere in the form of noisy traffic with incessant sirens, blinking lights on neon signs and endless activity of humanity in motion. I rode a traditional Japanese bicycle to and from the markets with my toddler strapped into the little seat on the back and a basket up front for the precious groceries I had scored that morning. I would frequently purchase unidentifiable food and study the packaging in order to find clues as to how to prepare these offerings. The streets were filled with colorful characters. Little old bent-over ladies perfectly dressed in pressed kimonos, punk rock twenty-year-olds sporting purple and teal hairdos masquerading as the latest personalities from manga comic books, as well as neat ranks of small children walking lockstep, dressed in immaculate yellow school uniforms, were part of my reality.",

GS, too, has seen blue sheep, and later, after tents are pitched, he goes out and finds more. He returns at dusk, delighted—“The first data in a month and a half!” he cries. And I tell him of a small find of my own. Back down the trail there was a solitary print, as if a dog had cross the path and gone its way, leaving no trace on the stony ground to either side. There were no signs of human travelers on the wet earth, and the print was fresh. Therefore a dog seemed most unlikely, and having assumed it was a wolf, which still occurs in the wilder regions of Tibet, I had not checked for foretoes on the print. “This is perfect country for the snow leopard,” says GS. The headman of Tarakot declares that snow leopards occur here in the Jang region, but the all-knowing Tukten shakes his head. “Only on Dolpo side,” says Tukten, “not in Nepal.” Dolpo lies on the Tibetan Plateau, and it interests me that he regards it as a foreign land.",

We each gulped three mugs of coffee, which thawed us completely. I then hung our wet garments beside the few family rags, on sticks protruding from under the thatch, and stacked our gear in the corner. Rachel was much diverted by a pet lamb and pet kid, both spoiled rotten, who went bounding cheekily over everything and everyone until put to bed in the inner room with the three older children, whom we had ousted from the verandah. The room had to be tidied for them by the light of our torch; it contains a loom, stacks of sheep-skins and spun wool, mounds of potatoes and scores of empty Inca Cola bottles. Everybody sleeps on layers of sheep-skins beneath piles of old clothes and tattered blankets. Our host spread new sheep-skins beneath our flea-bags; then, obviously considering these bags absurdly inadequate, he fetched a newly-woven blanket – brown and white and silky soft like thistledown – and spread it over us. As a result, I have written this in an unbelievable glow of heat – unbelievable when one considers that we are lying in the open air in a below-freezing temperature. The human body is a marvellous bit of machinery; a few hours ago I was literally speechless with exhaustion, now I feel too lively after all that coffee.",

Then he turned. He was good-looking. He didn’t have a humorous or happy look, he had what Ratliff called a merry look, the merry look of a fellow that hadn’t heard yet that they had invented doubt. But he didn’t even look merry now and he took the book—it was the John Donne I had taken to Linda yesterday—and kind of shot it onto the desk so that the ripped and torn pages came scuttering and scattering out across the desk and some of them even on down to the floor.",

Where other people might throw their hands up, Charles just sees room to grow: “There’s so much potential here, there’s still so many things that can be done and shaped and moved.",

South Indian languages, excessively vowelled, rattled about me. The South Indians were beginning to unwind; they were lapping up their liquidized foods. Food was a pleasure to their hands. Chewing, sighing with pleasure, they squelched curds and rice between their fingers. They squelched and squelched; then, in one swift circular action, as though they wished to take their food by surprise, they gathered some of the mixture into a ball, brought their dripping palms close to their mouths and – flick! – rice and curds were shot inside; and the squelching, chattering and sighing began again.",

A section of the perimeter fence, on the river side, was a gate, now open to admit home-coming buffaloes and pigs. The former proceeded ponderously to their individual spaces beneath the dwellings where children tethered them to stilts. Sows were being fed rice husks and rice water in wooden troughs, women stirring the mixture as the pigs crowded around grunting and shoving and making nasty noises at each other. Growing piglets are fed separately. Here were no turkeys but countless hens and ducks. Teenage girls returning from the forest carried neatly cut loads of firewood, worn like rucksacks. A woman passed balancing a musket on her head, holding a baby on one hip, carrying a huge roll of banana fronds under the other arm. A small girl passed with a large tray of winnowed rice on her head, her upcurving arms stretched to their limit. Tantrums are unusual in Laos but on the opposite balcony a toddler lay kicking and screaming, his mother clearly exasperated but being commendably patient. Then, catching sight of me, she picked him up, held him standing on her lap and directed his attention to the falang. Instant silence. He was riveted – and, being in the maternal arms, not alarmed.",

When it comes to corruption the territory has always sailed as close to the wind as possible, and bribery, variously euphemized as ‘cumshaw’, ‘squeeze’, tea money, steak fees, kickback or entertainment expenses, has always been a fact of life, whether it is a street-vendor bribing the local constable to let him stay on his pitch, or a building contractor slipping a few thousand dollars to an appropriate Government department. Ever since the days of the compradors, the Chinese intermediaries who interpreted and negotiated for the early British merchants, Hong Kong has been run very largely by brokers, agents and go-betweens, and it is a small enough step from commission to graft. Besides, it is a dazzling, tempting city in itself – just the place to seduce those who are, as Conrad once wrote of corrupt officials in the East, ‘not dull enough to nurse a success’.",

The circumstances were truly exciting, the chances of wealth were real, events moved at a tumultuous pace, there was a raffish and vagabond element that seemed a promise of adventure. Yet all too often Hong Kong depressed its visitors – ‘like a beautiful woman with a bad temper’, thought Lawrence Oliphant, who went there in the next decade. Was it just the climate? Was it the cramped and improvised environment? Was it the lack of any higher purpose or ideology, such as inspired the imperialists in other parts of their Empire – Raffles of Singapore, for instance, who hoped the British would leave a message for posterity ‘written in characters of light’? Or were the colonists of Hong Kong even then, consciously or subconsciously, overawed by the presence of China beyond the harbour, so enervated and contemptible in the 1840s, but surely so certain, one day, to come mightily into its own?",

The Laparelli girl, who became a saint and now lies uncorrupted in her venerated tomb, stopped here for her grapes before she gave up eating, in order to feel His suffering more clearly. “From my garden this morning,” she heard, as I do when Maria Rita holds up the melon for me to smell the fruit’s perfume and her clean hand so often in the earth. When she takes me in the back of her shop to show me how much cooler it is, I step back into the medieval rabbit warren many buildings still are, behind their facades and windows filled with camcorders, silk skirts, and Alessi gadgets. We’re under stone stairs, where she has a sink to wash the produce, then, another step down, we’re in a narrow stone room with a twist into darkness at the end. “Fresca,” she says, fanning herself, and she shows me her chair among the wooden crates, where she can rest between customers. She doesn’t get much rest. People shop here for her cascades of laughter, as well as for the uncompromising quality of her produce. She’s open six and a half days a week, plus she cares for a garden. Her husband has been ill this year, so she’s shifting crates every day as well. By eight, she’s smiling, washing down her stoop, wiping a speck off a pyramid of gargantuan red peppers.",
