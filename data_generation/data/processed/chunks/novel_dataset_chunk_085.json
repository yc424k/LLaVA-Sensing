The fourth, a shuffling OAP leading an obese dachshund, growled ‘Speak it with Hebrew!’ then walked on. The fifth, a young man sans beard or ear-locks and shouldering a daughter to play school, pointed to an ugly circular complex looming over the town centre: small shops below, offices above including the Municipality. Many stores were defunct, some with stock draped in dust-sheets. A long grimy stairway led up to a long grimy corridor; in the first open office a sallow, thin-lipped man said, ‘No English speak here!’ Simultaneously a tall, middle-aged woman appeared beside me speaking the Queen’s English. She was dressed and mannered like a senior Whitehall civil servant – perhaps with her I could discuss Kiryat Arba’s past, present and future? She invited me into her office, read my letter, then brusquely declared, ‘I can give you two numbers, a rabbi in Hebron – a distinguished scholar – and our best known lawyer who lives here. These men may help.’ She scribbled in my notebook, then indicated, politely but decisively, that she was a busy woman.",

For the next twenty-five years, until his death in 1808, Mutis would be free to wander, licensed to explore the most remote reaches of an unknown land. His conduit to the interior was the Río Magdalena. From late 1783 until 1791, among the most productive years of the survey, Mutis based the expedition in Mariquita, in the very house we had come to see. There is a restaurant now in the great hall where Mutis received his guests, and the tranquility of the garden is disturbed by the raucous laughter of young children dragged to the place by parents with only a tourist’s sense of who and what the great man represents in the history of Colombian science. Still, it was a joy to see the children there, running about, playing among the trees, having fun.",

I follow this moonstruck figure down the path toward two white entrance-stupas. The stupas, ringed and decorated in warm red, are fat and lopsided, like immense gingerbread houses, and it seems fitting that, nearby, a cave beneath a giant boulder is walled up with stones in which a small crooked wooden door has been inset. All about are red-gold shrubs—barberry, gooseberry, and rose—and a glistening of the last silver wisps of summer’s caper blossoms. Beyond the stupas, protecting the walled town like a moat, is the Bauli torrent that falls down from Phoksumdo. A bridge with flags crosses the torrent where it narrows to enter its mile-long chute down around the west end of the ridge to the great falls, and just above this bridge, in the roaring waters, is a boulder that was somehow reached by a believer. OM MANI PADME HUM has been carved there in mid-torrent, as if to hurl this mantra down out of the Himalaya to the benighted millions on the Ganges Plain.",

Willkie grew up in Elwood and thus is another on the long list of Midwesterners who have traveled in Siberia. He came here because of the war. Although Willkie lost to Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential race, he was credited afterward with helping to unify America behind the war effort, and in that capacity he made a round-the-world tour in a U.S. bomber to represent his country and demonstrate the Allies’ mastery of the air. The part of Yakutsk that specifically evoked Elwood for him was the boardwalks on the bigger streets; his hometown had board sidewalks when he was a boy. Willkie also spoke more generally about the heartiness of Yakutsk’s citizens, the simplicity of their tastes, and the place’s “tremendous vitality.” He said, “The town itself seemed, in many ways, like a western town in my country a century ago.”",

There are optimal routes to sail across open sea, as there are optimal routes to walk across open land. Sea roads are determined by the shape of the coastline (they bend out to avoid headlands, they dip towards significant ports, archipelagos and skerry guards) as well as by marine phenomena. Surface currents, tidal streams and prevailing winds all offer limits and opportunities for sea travel between certain places.",

Here and there, in a break of the snow, they trod on a bed of wet leaves that gave out a breath of hidden life, or a hemlock twig dashed its spicy scent into their faces. As they grew used to the twilight their eyes began to distinguish countless delicate gradations of tint: cold mottlings of grey-black boles against the snow, wet russets of drifted beech-leaves, a distant network of mauve twigs melting into the woodland haze. And in the silence just such fine gradations of sound became audible: the soft drop of loosened snow-lumps, a stir of startled wings, the creak of a dead branch, somewhere far off in darkness.",

He kicked my prone would-be benefactor – hard, on the buttocks – and shouted something that made all the men laugh. Appalled, I laid a restraining hand on his arm. As he impatiently shook it off the street door opened and three Gypsy women entered, their long swirling brilliant skirts seeming to light up that dismal cavern. The Boss looked from them to me to the groaning drunk. ‘Tigani!’ he explained, loading the word with the accumulated contempt of centuries. In 1950 I would have tongue-lashed him in a white-hot rage, regardless of the fact that he couldn’t understand me. In 1990 I merely turned away and took a swig of whiskey, cannily keeping the bottle concealed in its plastic bag. Meanwhile the Gypsy trio – hefty women, though low of stature – had got their man to his feet and were half-carrying him to the door, ignoring everyone.",

She found an excuse in the constant rain—it was really useless, as she wrote Mr. Langhope, to keep the child imprisoned in an over-heated hotel while they could get no benefit from the outdoor life. In reality, she found the long lonely hours unendurable. She pined for a sight of her husband, and thought of committing Cicely to Mrs. Ansell's care, and making a sudden dash for Hanaford. But the vision of the long evenings in the Westmore drawing-room again restrained her. No—she would simply go back to New York, dine out occasionally, go to a concert or two, trust to the usual demands of town life to crowd her hours with small activities.... And in another week Mr. Langhope would be back and the days would resume their normal course.",

I think, on average, we have taken exactly the opposite trajectory. For example, I now live in a one-room hut, pulling down our bourgeois average quite badly. As a punchline for what I thought was my first walk into this part of town, I realised that this building looked familiar. I had indeed wandered past here before. In fact, it was the site of a joke – not a good one, but technically a joke. A groaner.

The concern extended beyond the physical damage the elephants were doing; they were worried about someone getting hurt. A collision of some sort seemed inevitable.",

A dawn hush still lay over the mountains, and on this mantle of silence were embroidered the urgent rushings of new-born streams, and the myriad harsh or melodic bird cries that are the voice of the forest. Far below me a motionless pillow of cloud hid the depths of the valley and beyond this gulf the dark blue outlines of the opposite mountains were half-revealed, then obscured, then again half-revealed as their sheaths of mist shifted – until quite suddenly the sun was dominant, and the long, smooth lines of these crests lay free against a clear blue sky. Now the whole scene was changed by this vigorous golden light that came pouring over the mountaintops. As the warmth rapidly increased one could feel the earth’s eager response and around every corner were freshly-blossoming shrubs, their white, blue and deep pink flowers unfolding as one watched, to bloom with a most sweet radiance against the dark green of the undergrowth.",

It was completely disinterested, and besides, it had a quality which could only exist between women, between women just grown up. It was protective, on her side; sprang from a sense of being in league together, a presentiment of something that was bound to part them (they spoke of marriage always as a catastrophe), which led to this chivalry, this protective feeling which was much more on her side than Sally’s. For in those days she was completely reckless; did the most idiotic things out of bravado; bicycled round the parapet on the terrace: smoked cigars. Absurd, she was—very absurd. But the charm was overpowering, to her at least, so that she could remember standing in her bedroom at the top of the house holding the hot-water can in her hands and saying aloud, ‘She is beneath this roof . . .

This is the largest fishing-port in East Asia, and you cannot be long in Hong Kong without seeing a fishing-boat sail off to sea, whether it be a high-pooped junk all black with age, or one of the blunt-nosed trawlers that always suggest to me sea-going bull-terriers, or possibly vintage Saabs. Off it trundles to its fishing-grounds with a dour kind of resolution, its engines thumping heavily, its crew working away unsmiling on its decks, and far out at sea you may later see it, among its scattered colleagues of the fleet, tossing and rolling in a web of nets as though it has been fishing there for ever. And taking the early-morning ferry yourself to the fishing island of Tap Mun, in the north-east of the archipelago, as the ship’s cook warms up your canned breakfast noodles behind a canvas windbreak in the stern, and the fishermen on their passing sampans huddle themselves in hoods, scarves and anoraks against the dank – sailing on a winter morning out to Tap Mun, its houses battened down among the waters of Mirs Bay in a miasma of drizzle and dried fish, is a reminder that Hong Kong shares this sea-industry with peoples far, far up the coast of China, away beyond the Tropic of Cancer to the Yellow Sea and Manchuria.",
