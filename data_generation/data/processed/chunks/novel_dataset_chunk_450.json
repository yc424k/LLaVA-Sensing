The TV crews put on their lights and some girls sashayed back and forth in grass skirts. Then a few fireworks went up into the sky, so scanty they would have been the disgrace of Norfolk, Illinois, and a great mounting roar of wonder spread around me. For three, four minutes, the heavens were a fountain of pink and emerald lights and the whole island seemed to hold its breath. Then we all went back to our quiet rooms and faced the gusty winds and the empty silence of a new millennium. The messages I’d sent from Easter Island all came with the name “Josef Schmid” at the top.",

Before heading back to Dallas, we emptied the random bits of packaging that littered the floor of the damaged trailer so they wouldn’t fly out onto the highway. The back door stayed rolled up so the hole in the side wouldn’t create a pocket of air and make the back trailer swerve to one side or tip over.

The Weald to the north was almost lightless. The sky was a tarnishing silver. I rolled my sleeping mat out between two of the remaining beech trees just as dark fell, and took my shoes and socks off. The rabbit-cropped turf soothed my feet, and I wriggled my toes in it, then walked the circumference of the Ring. Nearly back at my starting point, I stepped on some sheep dung and had to spend a few minutes flossing the consequences out from between my toes with bunches of grass. After I’d eaten, I lay down to sleep, placed an ear to the turf and imagined the depths of history the soil held – Neolithic, Iron Age, Bronze Age, Roman, Augustan, down through all of which the beech roots quested. I held that giddying thought for at least half a minute, and then sank into senseless sleep.",

She came from the northern part of Saudi, and when attending the clinic, she dressed modestly in a plain abaya, not giving off any airs and graces. Terry had no idea she was of royal descent.",

There is an old tradition in Germany of benevolence to the wandering young: the very humility of my status acted as an Open Sesame to kindness and hospitality. Rather surprisingly to me, being English seemed to help; one was a rare bird and an object of curiosity. But, even if there had been less to like, I would have felt warmly towards them: I was abroad at last, far from my familiar habitat and separated by the sea from the tangles of the past; and all this, combined with the wild and growing exhilaration of the journey, shed a golden radiance.",

I had a look around, explored the maze of alleyways off the Piazza Tasso and gazed admiringly in the neat and well-stocked shop windows along the Corso Italia, then repaired to an outdoor seat at Tonino’s Snack Bar on the square, where I ordered a Coke and watched the passing scene, radiating contentment.",

He has a gift for silence that is eloquent--oh, devoutly eloquent!--among all the loud but for the most part meaningless vociferation of the current stage. All this your diligent observer is privileged to repeat with more than customary elation. Moreover, Mr. Shulberg has revealed to us in the person of Montgomery Mortimer the finest youthful talent that this season has discovered. Finally----'\"",

I rested on a shattered pillar within Nablus’s Roman amphitheatre (second century AD) This was among Palestine’s largest, seating 7,000, but since its unearthing in 1979 it has been shamefully vandalised. Instead of excavating with t.l.c., the authorities used part of Hadrian’s bequest as a quarry and bulldozed a road through another part to serve the nearby rash of post-Oslo villas. These tell us something about the funding (mostly from the EU and US) that has been flowing into Area A since 1995. It is not trickling down; it is spurting up.",

Then on, the Camino Real only slightly undulating for miles, its stone paving just visible under a carpet of soft grass. This luxury was appreciated by all; Juana sometimes trotted spontaneously out of sheer joie de vivre. Yet on either side was sadness: field after field of maize, potatoes and wheat all withered and brown and mournfully rustling in the breeze. Many substantial two-storey dwellings were deserted; whole families have fled to Trujillo or Lima to escape famine, as they think. This unfortunately is nothing new. Because of the erratic rainfall, two out of five Andean harvests are poor – if not as calamitous as this – and there is a long-established tradition of migration to the coastal cities in times of drought. For much of the way the Camino Real was lined with tall, shady eucalyptus, or bramble hedges. In a village of straggling hovels a red flag fluttered and I swilled the chicha avidly, though it was bitter and weak and full of interesting insect corpses. One is advised not to drink alcohol at these altitudes but I can’t think why. Here a dozen unfriendly, jeering mestizo boys followed us for half a mile and tried to mislead us onto another track; but they turned back on the edge of the Rio Negra gorge, which lay some 2,000 feet below the edge of the escarpment. As yet no river was visible – just a vast width of pale stones, stretching as far as we could see to left and right, and beyond them an unbroken wall of soaring brown mountains.",

He doesn’t speak great English, but she speaks fluent Italian (and also fluent French and Chinese, so that’s not intimidating). Giulio wants to learn English, and asked if he could practice conversing with me in another Tandem Exchange. In case you’re wondering why he couldn’t just study English with his American-born wife, it’s because they’re married and they fight too much whenever one tries to teach anything to the other one.

    "target_paragraph": "That afternoon we went for a walk into French Guinea with the engineer. The border is the Moa River, about twice the width of the Thames at Westminster. We crossed in a dug-out canoe, standing and balancing with the roll. It was quite easy, only a little frightening because there were alligators in the Moa. The curious thing about these boundaries, a line of river in a waste of bush, no passports, no Customs, no barriers to wandering tribesmen, is that they are as distinct as a European boundary; stepping out of the canoe one was in a different country. Even nature had changed; instead of forest and a rough winding road down which a car could, with some difficulty, go, a narrow path ran straight forward for mile after mile through tall treeless elephant grass. Along the hot wrinkled surface lay the skins of snakes. Natives came stooping up the path, bowed under green hammocks of palm-nuts; they looked like grasshoppers in a Silly Symphony. We walked for an hour and a half without coming to a village and at last turned back to Sierra Leone: The engineer said the path went straight down to the Coast by Conakry, and again one felt the happy sense of being free; one had only to follow a path far enough and one could cross a continent. Sweating in the hot dry day and growing cool again, one found it hard to believe that this part of Africa should have so unhealthy a reputation; one forgot C’s sickness and the diseased villagers. I had not so much as heard a mosquito and the daily five grains of quinine seemed a waste of medicine.",

He did not move on tiptoe, yet he went down the corridor with astonishing silence and celerity; he had reached the stairs and begun to descend before Mrs Littlejohn could have emerged from the other room. At first, three years ago, he would not try to descend them. He had ascended them alone; nobody ever knew if he had walked or crawled up, or if perhaps he had mounted them without realising he was doing so, altering his position in altitude, depth perception not functioning in reverse. Mrs Littlejohn had gone to the store. Someone passing the house heard him and when she returned there were five or six people in the hall, looking up at where he clung to the rail at the top step, his eyes shut, bellowing. He still clung to the rail, bellowing and tugging back, when she tried to break his grip and draw him downward. He stayed upstairs three days while she carried food to him and people would come in from miles away and say, “Aint you got him down yet?” before she finally coaxed him to attempt to descend. And even then it took several minutes, while faces gathered in the lower hall to watch as the firm, gentle, unremitting hand, the cold, grim, patient voice, drew him, clinging to the rail and bellowing, step by step downward. For a while after that he would fall down them each time he tried to descend. He would know he was going to fall; he would step blindly and already moaning onto nothing and plunge, topple, sprawling and bumping, terrified not by pain but by amazement, to lie at last on the floor of the lower hall, bellowing, his blasted eyes staring aghast and incredulous at nothing.",

The street has the high, utterly silent, closed appearance of a French street at night: the corrugated shutters are drawn down in front of all the little shops, and the secretive people who sleep in the high old houses, which lean steeply into one another with the settled, malleable sculpture of age, have closed their blinds firmly so that no one may look in. Across the street below him he can see the faded letters above the shutters of a little shop—Pâtisserie. It is immensely old and immensely familiar. The street sleeps, and yet possesses a strange, living watchfulness—it is as if one great, dark eye was brooding watchfully and sleeplessly over the destiny of the street.",

But in this case the Prince possessed an intellect, in addition to his few square miles of territory, and to one of the most beautiful Field Marshal's uniforms that had ever encased a royal warrior. The Prince was not a warrior, however; he was stooping, pacific and spectacled, and his possession of the uniform had been revealed to Mrs. Hicks only by the gift of a full-length photograph in a Bond Street frame, with Anastasius written slantingly across its legs. The Prince—and herein lay the Hickses' undoing—the Prince was an archaeologist: an earnest anxious enquiring and scrupulous archaeologist. Delicate health (so his suite hinted) banished him for a part of each year from his cold and foggy principality; and in the company of his mother, the active and enthusiastic Dowager Princess, he wandered from one Mediterranean shore to another, now assisting at the exhumation of Ptolemaic mummies, now at the excavation of Delphic temples or of North African basilicas. The beginning of winter usually brought the Prince and his mother to Rome or Nice, unless indeed they were summoned by family duties to Berlin, Vienna or Madrid; for an extended connection with the principal royal houses of Europe compelled them, as the Princess Mother said, to be always burying or marrying a cousin. At other moments they were seldom seen in the glacial atmosphere of courts, preferring to royal palaces those of the other, and more modern type, in one of which the Hickses were now lodged.",

Millions are going about their business as our taxi driver wends his way through traffic, stopping now and then to let a flood of pedestrians flow across the clogged streets. When a gap appears at the curb, new pedestrians swarm to fill it, backed by countless more. Peering through the window, I alternate between stunned gratitude that I’m here and a fretful anxiety at what this implies. Everywhere are street signs in Mandarin, a language I’ve been unable to learn. Since I’m stupefied with lack of sleep, I actually believe if I stare hard enough at them I’ll learn the language by osmosis. If I don’t, how will I ever understand signposts to get us out of the country once the race begins?",

He knew enough of the society into which the Hickses had drifted to guess that, within a very short time, the hint of the Prince's aide-de-camp would reappear in the form of a direct proposal. Lansing himself would probably—as the one person in the Hicks entourage with whom one could intelligibly commune-be entrusted with the next step in the negotiations: he would be asked, as the aide-de-camp would have said, \"to feel the ground.\" It was clearly part of the state policy of Teutoburg to offer Miss Hicks, with the hand of its sovereign, an opportunity to replenish its treasury.",

I tried the local favorite, chicken shawarma, and Teresa ordered a mince-onion potato pie with mushy peas. Both of our orders came with big, fat steak fries. It was only after we ordered our food that we realized there was no power. Our drinks were cool, but not cold, and all the coolers, air conditioners, and fans were off. Teresa suggested we cancel our order, but I was hungry and tired, and figured the power would be back soon enough. Besides, I enjoyed eavesdropping on the conversation in the smoking lounge.",

Useless, fragmentary, and inchoate as were these first abortive efforts, he began to write now like a madman – as only a madman could write – driven by an insanity of sense and soul and feeling which he no longer could master or control, tranced in a hypnosis by whose fatal and insatiate compulsions he was forced, without will, to act. Gripped by that ungovernable desire, all ordered plans, designs, coherent projects for the work he had set out to do went by the board, were burned up in the flame of a quenchless passion, like a handful of dry straw. Seated at a table in his cold, little room that overlooked the old cobbled court of the hotel, he wrote ceaselessly from dawn to dark, sometimes from darkness on to dawn again – hurling himself upon the bed to dream, in a state of comatose awareness, strange sleeping-wakeful visions, dreams mad and terrible as the blinding imagery that now swept constantly across his brain its blaze of fire.",

The idea is that I can commune with the mysticism of the site. Hard to do with 200 people wandering around and a barking dog. This is all very disappointing so I start to head back down the hill only to meet Green Boy and his friend. At the same time, the barking dog runs up to us and starts licking my leg. I shout “No, No, Bad Dog.” The dog keeps licking. Green Boy and his friend keep talking. I yell “No, No Bad Dog” again. Green Boy and his friend keep talking at me. I break off the conversation, because I am so annoyed, and say, “I wonder who the fuck owns this fucking annoying dog?” Guess what Green Boy says?",

The ambivalence that shadowed me at Ocean Beach was gone. Unfortunately, my surfing was in decline. I was getting old. It really hit me on crowded days at Pequena. Crowded in Madeira was still a relative term—there might be twelve people out. Most of them would be red-hot Portuguese guys, probably some of the country’s top pros. They paddled and surfed rings around me. Telling myself that they were half my age, or less, and that they probably surfed ten times as much as I did nowadays, should have helped. It didn’t. I appalled myself. I missed waves I should have caught, lumbered to my feet when I should have sprung. Getting old as a surfer, I’d heard it said, was just a long, slow, humiliating process of becoming a kook again. I clung to my delusions that I could still surf decently. The Owl boards helped.",

I found a hotel next to one of the sawmills.

She was making out, she said, in her work—she was a photographer—and there was no need to contemplate going home to her native state. While she moved around, doing something to a camera tripod, we talked—about ourselves, as usual: personalities, personal affairs, nothing large and comprehensive like the law of supply and demand. But perhaps I didn't talk in quite the same lighthearted way I usually did. I have an idea I must have gone off the rails and talked about Life. At any rate, Mary gave me a queer look and said, \"You're in a dreary mood, aren't you?\" She broke off to tighten a screw, and added, \"Better snap out of it, my dear.\"",

I’d stored a small bag of local maps and winter clothes at the flat of Mr C and Mr C, now they’d finally made it official and moved in together. I sold my printer to a student, for half what I paid, via Kevin the translator. Kata had a nice grocery top-up earlier. I made the rounds of preferred eateries, had my last chance at the weekend Sunday market, and the last jar of Mr Nice Guy’s hot chilli sauce. I’d already established a pattern of returning empty, clean jars, for a huge smile and nice discount. I was ready to see him next year. I kept talking about next year. Maybe I can’t, I said to everyone, but I’d love to, so I vowed to try.",

So without doubt that would be the moment when he gave him the signed paper setting him free of his past, the man not knowing that that first step out of ranks had already set him free of whatever else breathing could do to him more; and the man saluted and about faced and marched out the gate into darkness. Into death. And I thought for a moment you had spoken again, were about to ask how, if the ultimatum would not take effect until dawn tomorrow, did the Riff chief discover that a scout would attempt to get out that night, and so have an ambush ready at the mouth of the wadi through which the scout would pass. Yes, how: the man himself probably asking that in the one last choked cry or scream remaining to him of indictment and repudiation, because he didn’t know about the ribbon then either.",

The circumstances of his meeting with her varied from repelling with a single annihilating blow of the fist the proffered violence of some Irish thug, to finding quite by accident in the gutter, already half obscured by the dead leaves of Autumn, a wallet or a mesh-bag containing not only ten or twenty thousand dollars in bank notes of huge denominations, but also a rope of pearls, some loose, uncut gems, an emerald of great size mounted on a ring, and a number of stocks or bonds, together with letters of the most valuable and distressing privacy. This form of meeting he preferred to any other, for, although it deprived him of heroism, it enabled him to show equivalent virtues of honesty and manly dignity. Also by means of it he could pay his way.",
