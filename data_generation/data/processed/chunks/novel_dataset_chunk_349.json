He wished that Major Madu had not invited them to dinner; he was not at all interested in meeting the man’s wife. He got up and stretched and went around to the front yard and looked at the violet bougainvillea that crept up the walls. He walked for a while down the muddy stretch of deserted road that led to the house before he turned back. Kainene was in bed reading a newspaper. He climbed in beside her and she reached out and touched his hair, her fingers gently caressing his scalp. “Are you all right? You’ve been tense since yesterday.”",

Even the Mughal gardens were uprooted and replaced with sterile English lawns. In the place of the marble fantasies they tore down, the British erected some of the most crushingly ugly buildings ever thrown up by the British Empire—a set of barracks that look as if they have been modelled on Wormwood Scrubs. The barracks should have been torn down years ago, but the fort’s current proprietors, the Archaeological Survey of India, have lovingly continued the work of decay initiated by the British: white marble pavilions have been allowed to discolour; plasterwork has been left to collapse; the water channels have cracked and grassed over; the fountains are dry. Only the barracks look well maintained.",

Henry which she had bought once from a blue-eyed agent and read occasionally. And there were several chairs which matched, but were none of them comfortable, and a pink-shaded lamp with blackbirds painted on it and an atmosphere of other stifled pink throughout. There were nice things in it—nice things unrelentingly hostile to each other, offspring of a vicarious, impatient taste acting in stray moments. The worst was typified by a great picture fumed in oak bark of Passaic as seen from the Erie Railroad—altogether a frantic, oddly extravagant, oddly penurious attempt to make a cheerful room. Marcia knew it was a failure.",

His romantic olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. There was something in his low, languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His cool, white, flower-like hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own. But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered him. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life’s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be afraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be frightened.",

Downed trees and power poles were everywhere. My other main impression was that it was still blowing too hard to be out walking around. But it was possible to walk, just. The wind was only picking up smaller chunks of stuff now, not heavy things, so I kept moving toward the overlook. I advanced slowly, leaning back against the pressure of the wind to keep it from blowing me forward. Every now and then a strong gust would threaten to knock me off my feet and I would have to go down on one knee and put a hand on the ground to keep my balance.",

    "target_paragraph": "A Tale of Two Islands\nBali and Nias (Indonesia)\nLet’s say there’s an island covering a little over 2,000 square miles of land in the Indian Ocean. It has a tropical climate with a rainy and a dry season; its coastlines boast world-class surf breaks and more than their fair share of coral reefs. Beaches abound, some in bays and coves, others fully exposed to the power of the ocean. Its mountainous interior provides not only a cooling respite from the heat at the shores, but also waterfalls, swimming holes, and villages of unique culture and architecture, housing people whose ancestors wielded great power in the region. Its local cultures are the stuff of countless anthropological studies. In its more recent history, this island became part of a Dutch colony.\nLooking around, we find this place bears a striking resemblance to Bali, the Indonesian island that in recent decades has become synonymous with a certain style of spiritually plump, paradisiacal travel. If we look harder, we will find that Nias, a little-known island off the western coast of Sumatra, also fits the bill. Zoom in a bit and see Bali’s overcrowded streets, its uberdeveloped shorelines, its beaches sometimes blanketed with plastic trash. Pan over and see Nias’s lush jungles, its lack of traffic, its halting efforts at tourism. Nias is Bali without the tourism industry. Bali is Nias without the perpetual failure to launch. With a few twists of fate, one could have ended up the other. On both islands, it is both the best of times and the worst of times, though never in the same ways. Taken side by side, these two islands become a microcosm of the pros, cons, benefits, and challenges that come with the growth of beach tourism in a developing economy.",

It was about the size and shape of a municipal water tank, maybe a hundred feet high with a spiral staircase winding up its side that was so rusty that we had to test the steps before putting our full weight on them. When we reached the top we had an unobstructed view of the anchored supply ship lying about a quarter-mile offshore. The most immediate and overwhelming impression was of rust. The ship had once been white, probably, but there was so much rust streaking the topsides, decks and superstructure that it just looked like a rusty-orange hulk with a little dirty white mixed in. It may not have been the worst looking derelict I had ever seen but it was the definitely the worst one still floating and in operation. We watched as the launch tied up alongside and another bunch of eager passengers scrambled over the rail and down the ladder.",

The high altitude was necessary because here the appalling down-draughts plunged the plane thousands of feet in seconds towards the valley floor. We were always cold to frozen but I began to feel ashamed (soft, nothing worse than being soft) because I was also flushed and my legs and arms twitched and my mind seemed peevishly dislocated and I thought with horror that I might burst into tears for no reason. Confessing some of these symptoms to Roy, with a forced laugh, he said it was only lack of oxygen and I’d be all right when we got to Lashio after ten that night. Flare pots lit the runway at Lashio; it was much easier on the nerves to land in the dark when you couldn’t see what a mess you were landing on. Sixteen hours and 1,494 miles, if flying like a crow, seemed to me a fairly mammoth trip, but this was a regular weekly run for Roy and the other pilots.",

For twelve days, at anchor, under an overhead tropic sun, the deck lay dry. It was a new deck. It cost me one hundred and thirty-five dollars to recaulk it. The second captain was angry. He was born angry. \"Papa is always angry,\" was the description given him by his half-breed son. The third captain was so crooked that he couldn't hide behind a corkscrew. The truth was not in him, common honesty was not in him, and he was as far away from fair play and square-dealing as he was from his proper course when he nearly wrecked the Snark on the Ring- gold Isles.",

Cows were tethered on it almost to where the Bodden glittered in the sun, and it was scattered over with great pale patches of clover. On the left was the Spyker Schloss, with the spire of Bobbin church behind it. Far away in front, blue with distance but still there, rose as usual the round tower of the ubiquitous Jagdschloss. I leaned out into the sunshine, and the air was full of the freshness of the pines I had seen from the heights, and the freshness of the invisible sea.

Israel’s other universities, as they were founded, did likewise. For Zionist purposes, Jewish history needs to be studied in its own sterilised space, uncontaminated by gentile methodology. Unfortunately for Zionism, this neat arrangement came unstuck in the 1980s when Israeli universities began to breed those subversive scholars now revered or reviled as ‘the new historians’.",

I love farmland. Getting to see how other people work the land in such a faraway place is a real pleasure for me.

My guidebook claims that Makalle ‘gives the impression of a boom town’ – and perhaps it does, to those who knew it ten years ago. To me it gives the impression of a neat feudal settlement, gathered happily around the somewhat misleadingly named ‘palace’ of the Emperor Yohannes IV. It has such an atmosphere of remote tranquillity that neither the turmoils of its past nor the progress of its present are easily credited. We drove straight to the new tourist hotel, a converted eighty-year-old castle, managed by Indians, which stands small and square on a low hill. Here prices are reasonable (about twenty-five shillings for bed and breakfast) and, though tourist hotels are not my natural habitat, I find the wall-to-wall carpeting and the pink-tiled bathroom sufficiently compensated for by eccentric electricity and a moody water supply. When countless servants had pitted themselves against the plumbing for over an hour we achieved baths, before setting off to dine at the palace – me in my Husky outfit, which seemed one degree less removed from palatial evening-wear than a pair of ill-fitting Cairo-tailored shorts.",
