    "target_paragraph": "the keel after day-one of repairs\nOn day-two of the keel project, I still had a layer of large pieces of cloth to apply. These were much more difficult to apply than the smaller pieces. They were very messy and hard to deal with as I picked up the dripping sheets of cloth and tried to coax them onto the keel with some semblance of control. But by lunch time, I had the final pieces on and the project was looking good. While the epoxy set, I took a long lunch break at a nice café where everyone else was clean and well-dressed.\nMy next task was to find all the air pockets that I had missed during the application and open them up with the grinder. After this was done, I sanded the whole keel as best I could with my 6-inch random-orbital sander. The final job of the day was to fair the keel with thickened epoxy. I used a 10-inch drywall knife for most of this, and worked until I felt like I couldn’t get the keel any smoother. It was dusk as I left the boatyard and went back to the hotel.\nOn the morning of keel-project day-3, I donned my paper suit, respirator, goggles and gloves, and sanded the keel to the extent of my endurance. I used my Rigid 6-inch random-orbital sander, which is a fine tool indeed. When I felt like sanding could do no more good (or maybe it was when I ran out of sanding discs), I painted on one final coat of 2-part epoxy paint and called it done.\nI left the marina and went home to St Augustine for a few days while the yard painted the bottom. Upon returning on December 23rd I drilled and screwed the stanchions in place. The stanchions are the vertical steel rods around the edge of the deck that support the lifelines – the horizontal lines that prevent people from falling overboard. Up until then the stanchions could be pulled out of their seats, which was not safe at all. This day I also replaced the sacrificial zinc anode on the propeller, which prevents galvanic corrosion, which would otherwise destroy the propeller.",

Commander of the Faithful.” The larger tower is richer, its bricks are closer set, and all eight zones are filled with elaborate ornament, sometimes bordered with lesser inscriptions. Another sixteen panels round the top proclaim the titles of Masud; their Kufic is taller and more graceful, standing out from a maze of pattern like soldiers from a crowd. Generally, when it is a question of comparing two buildings of similar design but different dates, the simplicity of the older is preferable. Here that is not so. The fineness of the larger’s brickwork and the elaboration of its ornament have a functional propriety. They weight the tower to the earth, giving it that air of strength and cohesion which it needed to support the shaft above. An old photograph in the Legation at Kabul, taken about 1870, shows the detail of this shaft. The first twenty-five feet were plain and were probably hidden, when the tower was first built, by a wooden balcony. Thereafter it was divided into ornamental ribs, alternately curved and flat. These were surmounted by eight pairs of elongated niches and by a belt of carving which looks as if it contained a Kufic inscription.",

Settlements don’t normally have schools, but I soon discovered that the local headman is an unusually civic-spirited individual, who went to Gondar and persuaded the authorities to open a school, guaranteeing to organise the building of a schoolhouse by volunteer workers, and to provide for the teachers at his own expense. Happily, he has got the teachers he deserves – two refreshingly idealistic Gondares, who don’t at all resent living in discomfort and isolation.",

The Nevada left Auckland two feet deeper in the water than she ought to have been, and laboured heavily. Seas struck her under the guards with a heavy, explosive thud, and she groaned and strained as if she would part asunder. We held no communication with each other, or with those who could form any rational estimate of the probabilities of our destiny; no officials appeared; the ordinary invariable routine of the steward department was suspended without notice; the sounds were tremendous, and a hot, lurid obscurity filled the atmosphere. Soon after four the clamour increased, and the shock of a sea blowing up a part of the fore-guards made the groaning fabric reel and shiver throughout her whole bulk. At that time, by common consent, we assembled in the deck-house, which had windows looking in all directions, and sat there for five hours. Very few words were spoken, and very little fear was felt. We understood by intuition that if our crazy engines failed at any moment to keep the ship's head to the sea, her destruction would not occupy half an hour. It was all palpable. There was nothing which the most experienced seaman could explain to the merest novice. We hoped for the best, and there was no use in speaking about the worst. Nor, indeed, was speech possible, unless a human voice could have outshrieked the hurricane.",

This valley is still inhabited and we passed several settlements, two small herds of emaciated cattle, and a few neglected, unploughed fields from which the last thin teff crop has long since been harvested. Yet I saw not even one shepherd-boy, and as we walked between endless low, grey-brown hills, disfigured with dead scrub, the whole sun-plagued scene reeked of misery. The junipers, which somehow contrive to look freshly green everywhere else, were withered here and even the cacti hung limply. One felt that the remaining population had accepted the nearness of death and were sitting dully in their tukuls, not trying any more. Deserted, uninhabited landscapes delight me but the memory of that still, suffering valley will haunt me for a long time to come.",

Nyet, I couldn’t squeeze their eggplants to see if they were ripe. Nyet, they wouldn’t look in the back for a pair of shoes in my size. Or check to see if my fax had arrived. Or take my order, or pour me a refill, or bring me the check. Couldn’t I see they were busy smoking cigarettes and staring into space? Why didn’t I just go away?",

Mikhail, who’s as sprightly now as he was when we started, and who does not seem to react to the chilly air despite his tiny shorts and skimpy T-shirt, leads us into the motel foyer, a stark, efficient affair from which room keys are dispensed but little else. He chats up the concierge, motioning at us with his head. It seems he tells the concierge we are honored travelers and must have their best room, because when she shoves a gray rate sheet across the desk and points, her finger reveals that ours is the highest priced accommodation they have.",

A street artist bought her, kept her in a little box in a loud, dusty place, and made her perform tricks. Baby Wayra. I just . . .” Jane visibly grits her teeth. “In the wild, she would have stayed with her mum until she was two. Instead she was kept on a chain, whipped and malnourished.

Almost from the moment Europeans arrived, they realized there was coal out there in quantities almost beyond conception. The trouble was, it was virtually all anthracite, a coal so immensely hard (it is 95 percent carbon) that for a very long time no one could figure out how to get it to light. It wasn’t until 1828 that an enterprising Scot named James Neilson had the simple but effective idea of injecting heated air rather than cold air into an iron furnace by means of a bellows. The process became known as a hot blast, and it transformed the coal industry all over the world (Wales, too, had a lot of anthracite) but especially in the United States. By the end of the century America was producing 300 million tons of coal a year, about as much as the rest of the world put together, and the great bulk of it came from Pennsylvania’s anthracite belt.",

This place is quite unique. It is said that 15,000 people are ouried away in these low-browed, shadowy houses, under the glossy, dark-leaved trees, but except in one or two streets of miscellaneous, old-fashioned-looking stores, arranged with a distinct leaning towards native tastes, it looks like a large village, or rather like an aggregate of villages. As we drove through the town we could only see our immediate surroundings, but each had a new fascination. We drove along roads with over-arching trees, through whose dense leafage the noon sunshine only trickled in dancing, broken lights; umbrella trees, caoutchouc, bamboo, mango, orange, breadfruit, candle-nut, monkey pod, date and coco palms, alligator pears, \"prides\" of Barbary, India, and Peru, and huge-leaved, wide-spreading trees, exotics from the South Seas, many of them rich in parasitic ferns, and others blazing with bright, fantastic blossoms. The air was heavy with odours of gardenia, tuberose, oleanders, roses, lilies, and the great white trumpet-flower, and myriads of others whose names I do not know, and verandahs were festooned with a gorgeous trailer with magenta blossoms, passion-flowers, and a vine with masses of trumpet-shaped, yellow, waxy flowers. The delicate tamarind and the feathery algaroba intermingled their fragile grace with the dark, shiny foliage of the South Sea exotics, and the deep red, solitary flowers of the hibiscus rioted among familiar fuchsias arid geraniums, which here attain the height and size of large rhododendrons.",

Mothers were there, shapeless bundles of rags, nursing infants at the breast. The girls were draped in gaudy hues, and ablaze with metal charms and ornaments on forehead and arms and ankles. They showed their flashing teeth and smiled from time to time in frank wonder, whereas the boys, superbly savage, like young panthers caught in a trap, kept their eyes downcast or threw distrustful, defiant glances round them. Here they sat in silence, smoking tobacco and taking deep draughts out of a pitcher of milk which was handed round from one to the other. Occasionally the older people would pick up their instruments—bagpipes of sheepskin, small drums and gourd-like mandolines—and draw from them strange dronings, gurglings, thrummings, twangings; soon a group of youngsters would rise gravely from the ground and, without any preconcerted signal, begin to move in a dance—a formal and intricate measure, such as had never yet been witnessed on Nepenthe.",

There is no reference in her biography to this story, which I refuse to believe, though the Devil’s Advocate (whose duty it was to reply to the above-named ‘Positiones super Dubio’)doubtless made good use of it by designating the priest’s legacy for the construction of the convent as an “expiatory” one.",

For sleep, one bed; for sitting in, one armchair; for cleansing one’s teeth and shaving one’s chin, one tumbler, one looking-glass.

Instead of locking them away in a laboratory, a glassed-in restoration studio was set up in Reggio’s Palazzo Campanello, the seat of the regional government, thus allowing the public to watch the restorers at work. It is a curious vision, the two heroes lying on their backs, their imposing strength frozen in time, their legs and arms forever poised in an incongruous movement when viewed from a horizontal perspective. The position allowed visitors to see the openings in their feet, exposing the statues’ hollow forms. As with people, checkups included surface examinations, x-rays and assorted interior probes and procedures. Over the course of various operations, more than 100 kilos (220 lbs.) of clay and soil originally used in their construction was removed from each statue and subsequently analyzed, as the restorations were and will continue to be both conservative interventions and exploratory in nature.",
