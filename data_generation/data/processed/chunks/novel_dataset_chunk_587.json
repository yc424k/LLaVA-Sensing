The hall was devoid of humans, but filled with exhibits of soaps, herbal remedies, beauty creams, and massage tables. It was a trade show with no trade yet.",

Hung with armour and native embroideries, furnished with divans and screens, which shut off convenient corners, the room was less formal than the others, and was evidently the haunt of youth. Signor Rodriguez, whom they knew to be the manager of the hotel, stood quite near them in the doorway surveying the scene—the gentlemen lounging in chairs, the couples leaning over coffee-cups, the game of cards in the centre under profuse clusters of electric light. He was congratulating himself upon the enterprise which had turned the refectory, a cold stone room with pots on trestles, into the most comfortable room in the house. The hotel was very full, and proved his wisdom in decreeing that no hotel can flourish without a lounge.",

Each morning he would drop the bike at a finishing point ten miles or so down the trail, drive the car back to the start, hike between the two and cycle back to his car. He did this for two weeks every April and figured he had about another twenty years to go. Another day I followed an older man, lean and rangy, who looked to be well into his seventies. He had a small, old-fashioned day pack of tawny canvas and moved with extraordinary swiftness. Two or three times an hour I would sight him just ahead, fifty or sixty yards away, vanishing into the trees. Though he moved much faster than I did and never seemed to rest, he was always there. Wherever there was fifty or sixty yards of view, there he would be—just the back of him, just disappearing. It was like following a ghost. I tried to catch up and couldn’t. He never looked at me that I could see, but I was sure he was aware of me behind him. You get a kind of sixth sense for the presence of others in the woods, and when you realize people are near, you always pause to let them catch up, just to exchange pleasantries and say hello and maybe find out if anyone has heard a weather forecast. But the man ahead never paused, never varied his pace, never looked back. In the late afternoon he vanished and I never saw him again.",

I took a long swig from my CamelBak, the warm water less satisfying in view of the tantalizingly cool river.

It was extremely distressing; and the raising of Mrs Verloc’s mother’s voice sounded like a wail of pain.",

It revealed two rough circles – one 44 yards in diameter, the other 50 – formed of boulders taken from a dry riverbed and mostly shaped into crude oblongs. The circles are thought to be late Neolithic (about four thousand years old) and the usual theories have been advanced to account for them – that they are part of a burial complex, that they are part of a place of worship, that they have some vague astronomical significance. It never seems to occur to people that primitive man might have made things like this to amuse himself, as we amuse ourselves with musical chairs and statues of nude women on plinths by lakes. The signboard on the wire fence apologizes for the mystery: ‘Not even the professors,’ it moans, ‘are certain …’",

His journeying from wild place to wild place, his wintering out, his sleeping close to the ground: all this made inspiring sense to me. What also made me warm to Sweeney was his occasional wish, when out in the wild, for a ‘soft pillow’, a bed and a hot meal. These were longings I recognised with sheepish affection.",

In the 1990s, many baseball players suddenly became immensely strong?some evolved whole new body shapes?and began to smack home runs in quantities that made a mockery of Ruth’s and Maris’s numbers. It turned out that a great many of this new generation of ballplayers?something in the region of 5 to 7 percent, according to random drug tests introduced, very belatedly, in 2003?were taking anabolic steroids. The use of drugs as an aid to hitting is far beyond the scope of this book, so let us just note in passing that even with the benefit of steroids most modern players still couldn’t hit as many home runs as Babe Ruth hit on hot dogs.",

We passed a number of villages and inhabited caves, but the people took little notice of us. Our donkey driver, who came from Lhasa, was nice and friendly to us and enjoyed going into the villages and swaggering about. We found the population less mistrustful—no doubt it was the influence of our safe-conduct. While we were trekking through the district of Rongchung we found ourselves following Sven Hedin’s route for a few days, and as I was a great admirer of this explorer, lively memories of his descriptions were kindled in my mind. The terrain we traversed remained very much the same. We continued to cross plateaux, climb down into deep valleys and climb painfully up the other side. Often these ravines were so narrow that one could have called across them, but it took hours to walk across. These constant ups and downs, which doubled the length of our journey, got on one’s nerves and we thought our own thoughts in silence. Nevertheless we made progress and had not to bother about our food. At one point, when we had the idea of changing our menu, we tried our luck fishing. Having had no luck with the hook we stripped and waded into the clear mountain burns and tried to catch the fish in our hands. But they seemed to have better things to do than to end up in our cooking-pot.",

A proudly European Polish-Russian of Cossack descent, Przhevalsky detested the Asian peoples among whom he spent so much of his life. In his last book he suggested exterminating all Mongolians and replacing them with Cossacks, a policy which Stalin – rumoured to be Przhevalsky’s son – would go some distance towards enforcing. Przhevalsky overcame his abhorrence of non-Europeans sufficiently to lead four expeditions across Central Asia, including one to the far east of Kyrgyzstan. He died among Asians too, in 1888, in Karakol, the town at the eastern tip of Lake Issyk-Kul which in Russian is now named after him. His shining black statue surveys one of that town’s dusty squares, and there is a little-visited museum devoted to his memory, filled with the bric-à-brac of his trade: saddle-bags, maps, weapons and – oddly – troupes of stuffed animals.",

Most knew nothing about liberty, democracy, holidays abroad. If they were clever, university degrees were free. The old middle class had mostly been got rid of – killed or imprisoned or fled into exile or terrorised into silence. And what did the rest know about anything better than Communism? Rumania’s peasants and workers were always exploited. When they were moved into blocs they had comforts they never saw before – hot water, bathrooms and WCs, gas cookers, central heating. Only when Ceausescu’s paranoid economies took those things away they turned against him. Then Iliescu gave them back and now they love him, though he is still a Communist!’",

I had intended to follow last night’s plan of walking slowly round the court, but was prevented by two crowds, one listening to a preacher before the main ivan, one praying before the Tomb opposite; so that either way I was threatened by religious etiquette. Other pilgrims were squatting along the walls, many of them Afghans, all quite different in clothes and manner from my lower middle-class Persian self, and eyeing me, so I imagined, with hawk-like scowls as I walked to and fro between the two crowds. At last it was no longer imagination: my gaping inquisitiveness attracted notice. I scuttled back into the bazaar. The mullahs were no longer in the passage. Out in the street stood Christopher, leering wantonly as I passed him with eyes averted. Now, on the way back, the sun was in my face, and people turned to look at me as I passed. There was something wrong. Whatever it was, Mrs. Gastrell did not jump to it. She was drying her hair by the fire, and was highly incensed when her privacy was abused by an unknown native.",

By then it was almost nine thirty in the evening; Sergei said he thought our train would be loading soon. But at about ten thirty, the stationmaster, a blocky woman with dyed red hair, a dalmatian-spotted blouse, and an orange workman’s vest, appeared among the vehicles and told us all that there would be no train tonight. Nor would there necessarily be one tomorrow, she added with keen enjoyment disguised as nonchalance. The quiet way she savored giving out this disappointing news was a wonder to see. Maybe a train would come along tomorrow night, she speculated; but then again, maybe it would not.",

And raining. The kind of rain that turns the streets into pools of silver, the same color as the sky, as it splatters wet and bitter through the holes in the tarps that hang between the buildings.\nBut one of the few buildings where it’s warm inside is the Austrian Hospice.\nI’m sitting with Leila in the Austrian Hospice drinking hot chocolate while a Mozart concerto flitters in the background.\nThe thing about Jerusalem is there’s the part you see when you walk through the alleys, and then there are entire worlds behind the stones, like this place, the Austrian Hospice, that you can’t see unless you know where to look.\nAfter the wintery afternoon when the Journalist took me to the Old City that first time after all that time, I found this place. It was right around Christmas when another journalist friend told me about the little buzzer in the wall that you can press that opens a door into another world.\nAnd sure enough, it’s like going back in time to Vienna, circa mid-nineteenth century, when the world is apple strudel and violin concertos and high vaulted ceilings.\nIt’s the perfect place to be in the throes of a winter storm, which is why Leila and I are here, drinking hot chocolate as one does.\nLeila is from Egypt, but she was raised in Denmark, and she lived in New York, and now she lives in Jerusalem and is about to marry a Palestinian who lives in Ramallah, and she works with Syrian refugees in Jordan. Yeah, she’s a legit mermaid. We connected online over an article I had written, because she understands what it’s like to live between layers that don’t always make sense together. She has long, black, curly hair that tumbles wildly over her shoulders, and there are little drops of rain clinging to each strand. She’s lived in different worlds, an inside-outsider, too. We get each other, which is why we’re friends.\nThere’s a nun at the counter slicing pieces of fresh apple strudel and all is well with the world, except it isn’t. We are talking about terror, and about reprisals, and about how two sides must come to the table.\n“How can we talk about peace when we have no peace partner?” I ask her.\nShe pats my hand.\n“Basbussa,” she says to me, touching my hand.\n“Wait, what does that mean?”\n“It’s like ‘sweetheart’—‘Basbussa’ is the sweet cake drenched in honey that Arabs love. It’s a good thing,” she squeezes my hand.\nI smile.\n“What I want to say is you’re right,” she continues. “Israelis have no peace partner, because a partnership is based on equality, and the Palestinians aren’t equal. Occupation, home demolitions, checkpoints, restrictions, curfews, not to mention corruption . . . you’re right, you don’t have a peace partner because you’re on the mountain, and we are in the valley.”\nThe Mozart concerto changes, and now it’s Beethoven. The nun is still slicing the strudel.\n“So what do we do about it?” I ask.\n“Well, it’s a lot easier for you to reach your hand down to us, than it is for us to reach our hand up to you. So what’s your move?”\n“I’ll buy lunch?” I wink.\nShe laughs and shakes her curls. “Oh Basbussa, I’m not talking about you. You and I can split the check.”",

They spoke softly for a time, with Gustavo explaining that he had decided to come back to the ranch on a whim. With his last words, he forgave Juan Guillermo, saying that it was not his fault, that it was just the madness of the times. Juan Guillermo held his friend closely in his arms as both men wept; their tears ran together and pooled on Gustavo’s cheek as he passed away. In that instant, Juan Guillermo, horrified by the violence that had overtaken his dreams, turned his back on politics forever. Renouncing his position in the movement, he became a dedicated pacifist, so committed to the sanctity of life that he would not, from that moment forward, so much as step on a passing ant or slap a bothersome mosquito.",

Mrs. Toy was saying, in her flat uncadenced voice, like tepid water running into a bath: “I don’t see how people can live without lifts in their houses, do you? But perhaps it’s because I’ve never had to. Father’s house had the first electric lift at Climax. Once, in England, we went to stay with the Duke of Humber, at Humber Castle—one of those huge parties, royalties and everything—golf and polo all day, and a ball every night; and, will you believe it, we had to walk up and down stairs! I don’t know what English people are made of. I suppose they’ve never been used to what we call comfort. The second day I told Herman I couldn’t stand those awful slippery stairs after two rounds of golf, and dancing till four in the morning. It was simply destroying my heart—the doctor has warned me so often! I wanted to leave right away—but Herman said it would offend the Duke. The Duke’s such a sweet old man. But, any way, I made Herman promise me a sapphire and emerald plaque from Cartier’s before I’d agree to stick it out . . .”",

Someone proposed building it over an immense mound of dirt piled in the cathedral.

Fortunately, Brunelleschi figured out how to engineer his dome.
