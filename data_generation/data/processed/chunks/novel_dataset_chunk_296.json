The station was modern and clean and almost comfortable. There were rows and rows of hard plastic seats and a proper counter staffed by two agents. I asked for two tickets to Cairo, selected our seats, paid in cash, and thanked the staff. The entire transaction took four or five minutes, and I felt like a jackass. We had walked five miles across Sigalla and Al Dahar; it took three frustrating hours. We should have taken a taxi; then we could have strolled the streets and found a café and browsed the shops. Instead, we were covered in sweat and dust, just like always. I asked Teresa, jokingly, if she wanted to walk back, but she didn’t appreciate my humor. I flagged a taxi.",

After a while the preternatural stillness of the treeless wastes can get to you, and inside you, and you can feel a Brontëan wildness in the soil. With its uncommonly beautiful people, its island curiosity, its closeness to traditions and tales, Iceland resembles nowhere so much as Java, its spellbound air charged with an immanence of spirits. Cold winds whistle through rows of white crosses in the black moor outside Akranes. The distinctive feature of the Icelander, for Sir Richard Burton, was “the eye, dark and cold as a pebble—a mesmerist would despair at the first sight.” From my bed, at night, I could see nothing but a white cross shining in the dark.",

Obsessed by vague forebodings, they found an able and eloquent interpreter of their fears in the Commissioner who, rather redder in the face than usual, strode fussily up and down the premises, tugging at his disreputable briar pipe, drinking the whisky with anybody who cared to pay for it, and declaring to all and sundry that something must be done. It was his panacea—his unvarying formula for every emergency, scandalous or otherwise. Something must be done, he avowed. And from the card-table came two approving echoes—the voices of Mr. Muhlen and Signor Malipizzo, who did not care tuppence about the fountain but never lost an opportunity of expressing their public approval of Mr. Parker's words and actions.",

From its summit, they were awed to discover an even taller range of peaks to the east, still draped in early season snow. His team wanted to investigate the new range, but Brewer wisely judged the passage across the snow to be too dangerous. Nevertheless, young Clarence King begged Brewer to let him and his friend Cotter have a shot. After much pestering, Brewer assented. According to King’s account, which many consider overdramatized, the two struggled up and down over ice-covered cliffs—risking death at nearly every step, with little more than a length of rope between them to stop a fall. Finally crossing the snows, they reached the foot of the high range they’d spotted from Mount Brewer. Climbing what King took to be the tallest of the peaks, the two assailed its heavily-crevassed slopes, reaching the top only within inches of their lives. Upon summiting, King rang his climbing hammer against the tallest rock, declaring the peak to be “Mount Tyndall.”",

The scattered farms looked more prosperous and the meadows climbed high up the rolling hillsides, giving the valleys an alpine air. The sun was soon high and warm. On a ridge overlooking an expanse of hazy foothills, I passed a sign that said PEACHAM, SETTLED 1776 and beyond that stood a village. I parked beside a red general store and got out to have a look around. There was no-one about. Presumably the people of Littleton had come in the night and taken them off to the planet Zog.",

    "target_paragraph": "Miss Bart’s arrival had been welcomed with an uncritical friendliness that first irritated her pride and then brought her to a sharp sense of her own situation – of the place in life which, for the moment, she must accept and make the best of it. These people knew her story – of that her first long talk with Carry Fisher had left no doubt: she was publicly branded as the heroine of a ‘queer’ episode – but instead of shrinking from her as her own friends had done, they received her without question into the easy promiscuity of their lives. They swallowed her past as easily as they did Miss Anstell’s, and with no apparent sense of any difference in the size of the mouthful: all they asked was that she should – in her own way, for they recognized a diversity of gifts – contribute as much to the general amusement as that graceful actress, whose talents, when off the stage, were of the most varied order. Lily felt at once that any tendency to be ‘stuck-up’, to mark a sense of differences and distinctions, would be fatal to her continuance in the Gormer set. To be taken in on such terms – and into such a world! – was hard enough to the lingering pride in her; but she realized, with a pang of self-contempt, that to be excluded from it would, after all, be harder still. For, almost at once, she had felt the insidious charm of slipping back into a life where every material difficulty was smoothed away. The sudden escape from a stifling hotel in a dusty deserted city to the space and luxury of a great country-house fanned by sea breezes, had produced a state of moral lassitude agreeable enough after the nervous tension and physical discomfort of the past weeks. For the moment she must yield to the refreshment her senses craved – after that she would reconsider her situation, and take counsel with her dignity. Her enjoyment of her surroundings was, indeed, tinged by the unpleasant consideration that she was accepting the hospitality and courting the approval of people she had disdained under other conditions. But she was growing less sensitive on such points: a hard glaze of indifference was fast forming over her delicacies and susceptibilities, and each concession to expediency hardened the surface a little more.",

I also realise that my back no longer feels so stiff. There are a few clouds, soft tufts blowing along the road. My arm still throbs every time I lower it below the level of my heart. I haven’t told my parents what happened. I don’t want to hear what they’ll say. I hug it to my chest, the bandages that I change every lunchtime soaked with sweat, dirt and the oozing pus of infection. Maybe I should be more worried than I am. But Agustino says it’ll be OK.",

Rachel was enthralled as we wandered from one narrow, dimly-lit alleyway to another. Above us loomed tall stone and wood houses, centuries old, and we passed butchers and bakers and candlestickmakers (literally: one coppersmith was at work on a candlestick). Often we paused to watch men weighing huge chunks of marble, or carving wood or mending transistors or cobbling shoes or beating brass or tailoring shirts – all by the light of lanterns hanging from the roofs of their little stalls. A flour-covered baker gave us a length of hot nan from his underground mud oven, and we were invited into one eating-house for juicy kebabs, and into another for small bowls of delicious tangy curds, and into two primitive tea-houses for little red and blue china pots of green tea – gahura, the Pathans’ national drink – which filled me with an almost unbearable longing for Afghanistan. As we sat cross-legged on filthy matting in one teahouse a small boy came strolling up the alleyway, noticed us, hesitated a moment, and then stood on tiptoe to hand up to Rachel a glorious pink rose bud, about to unfold. Before we could thank him he had disappeared into the surrounding shadows, his impulsive gesture having completed the perfection of our evening.",

Outside, in the middle of the avenue, a strangely tasteless memorial stands on the spot where she fell: a bouquet of red glass roses on a frosted crystal plinth, a gift from the people of Czechoslovakia. It is as if it marked the place of her death. But in fact as she lay there, pouring with blood from some twenty bullet wounds, Indira Gandhi was still alive.",

It was spread over eight acres, as vast as it was absurd. We laughed as a man in a polyester Qing Dynasty outfit flew past our window strapped to a flying fox, sailing over an artificial lake with a tray of hot food in his free hand. We ate shredded chicken, seafood chow mein, deep-fried fish intestines with cashews, dim sum served with century egg, fungus and mushroom soup, crispy-skinned duck, Buddha’s delight and tom yum fish soup. Going against my expectations of beauty contestants, the girls pigged out.",

She was an independent businesswoman, a rarity in a country that did not yet officially recognize private enterprise, although it had started to accept a few small-scale ventures. Since the terrible summer of 1994, Cuba had permitted individuals to open family-run restaurants called paladares in their homes under strict guidelines that limited the number of tables and did not allow anyone but family to work in them. In theory, Cubans would not be allowed to enrich themselves on the backs of others. The waiters and housekeepers at the fancy resort hotels in Varadero would argue with that premise, but officially, socialist orthodoxy remained the rule.",

A walker would pick up a hook and use it to lop off branches that were starting to impede passage. The hook would then be left at the other end of the path, for a walker coming in the opposite direction. In this manner the path was collectively maintained for general use.",

Compared with my Havana-Bayamo train of indelible memory this was indeed first class but it had its little idiosyncrasies. A cockroach Rapid Reaction Force swarmed just above my arm-rest, its divisional headquarters the crevices around the window, its reactions attuned to the opening of food parcels. Far worse were the mosquitoes; at sunset they zoomed hungrily through all the open windows and soon I felt like one big mosquito bite. Long before I needed the malodorous loo its defects were evident: a loudly banging unlockable door, a floor slithery with pee.",

More springtime activity took place on the tin top of the defunct air conditioning unit that Mrs Puri had left attached to our bedroom wall. There, every morning soon after dawn, two pigeons performed an elaborate and very noisy mating dance. Though the unit had long since given up any pretence of cooling the room, it did turn out to have a curious talent for magnifying the pigeons’ footfalls so that their tap dance rang out like a drum-roll at six every morning. Olivia, who likes her sleep, soon developed a great loathing for our morning visitors, but all her efforts to drive them away and apart had little success, and spectacularly failed to calm the passions of the energetically copulating birds.",

I could go out into the overgrown garden with them and walk a little, taking shaky steps to the creek where ducks swam, and then we would drink tea under a tree. They helped the time pass, which was good, because without distraction it dragged terribly. \"The mortal boredom of the smoker who is cured!\" wrote Cocteau. Most vivid of all, though, was the way I felt about the bed. Night after night, I had to lie on it without sleeping, until I detested it with a bitter, personal spite. I hated the very smell of the mattress. I don't suppose it was really bad, being kapok and nothing else, but for the first time in some years my numbed nose was working, and any scent would have had an unpleasant effect on newly sensitive nerves. To me the mattress stank, and it was lumpy, besides. I knew every lump. I resolved to settle that bed's hash as soon as I was my own master. One morning, I asked Bobby what it would cost to replace it.",

We did a two-week test trip pulling Lilly in a trailer, but realized she would get bored sitting for so many hours a day, plus I didn’t like the idea of her bouncing along behind me on a one-lane road in the mountains of Ecuador. Ultimately, we were so enamored by the idea of traveling from our home all the way to the bottom of the world without ever getting on an airplane that we stuck with the idea, but, by van instead of bike. (And maybe our lazy, middle-aged bodies were glad to use Lilly as an excuse for traveling the more comfortable, easy way!)",

Then they stopped. Yet they still didn’t rush at the table, still hovering, semicircular, almost diffidently, merely enclosing it, their noses trembling questing like those of rabbits at the odors from it, grimed, filthy, reeking still of the front lines and uncertainty and perhaps despair; unshaven, faces not alarming nor even embittered but harassed—faces of men who had already borne not only more than they expected but than they believed they could and who knew that it was still not over and—with a sort of amazement, even terror—that no matter how much more there would be, they would still bear that too.",

And then, one by one, they were unaccountably torn down, and replaced for the most part with gray concrete bunkers. At the eastern end of the street the whole of St. James’s Square, an open green space surrounded by a crowd of eighteenth-century apartment buildings, was bulldozed to make way for one of the squattest, ugliest shopping center/hotel complexes ever to spill from an architect’s pen. Now about all that is left of Princes Street’s age of confident grandeur is odd fragments like the Balmoral Hotel and the Scott Monument and part of the front of Jenners department store.",
