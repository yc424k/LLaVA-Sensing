Ridiculous, like the innocent defenseless backside of a small boy caught delving into an apple barrel, and a few of the guests cast their eyes upward in polite astonishment. Belle raised her head sharply, with an indescribable gesture, then she looked at Horace with cold and blazing irritation, enveloping, savage, disdainful of who might see. The thumping ceased, became a cautious clumsy tipping, and Belle’s anger faded, though her gaze was still full upon him. Little Belle played again and Horace looked away from the cold fixity of Belle’s gaze, a little uncomfortably, and so saw Harry and one of the men guests enter surreptitiously and seat themselves; he turned his head again. Beneath the heavy shadow of her hair Belle still watched him, and he shaped three words with his lips. But Belle’s mouth did not change its sullen repose, nor her eyes, and then he realized that she was not looking at him at all, perhaps had never been.",

No letters could be found conveying any clue as to his whereabouts. But—what was almost incredible—there was loose money lying about. A more minute investigation proved that the gentleman had dressed himself with considerable care prior to leaving the establishment for the last time. He had changed his socks and other underwear—yes, he had donned a clean shirt. The old one, blue-striped, which he had been seen to wear at breakfast, was lying negligently across the back of a chair with a pair of costly enameled links, of azure colour to match, in the cuffs. Moreover, in a small box hidden beneath some collars in a drawer were found a few foreign bank-notes, a ring or two, and a handful of gold coins such as he was in the habit of carrying about his person. The judge, who superintended the researches, caused these valuables to be impounded, sealed, and deposited in the Court of Justice.",

In India, human misery seems so pervasive that one takes in only stray details: a warped leg or a dead eye, a sick pariah dog eating withered grass, an ancient woman lifting her sari to move her shrunken bowels by the road. Yet in Varanasi there is hope of life that has been abandoned in such cities as Calcutta, which seems resigned to the dead and dying in its gutters. Shiva dances in the spicy foods, in the exhilarated bells of the swarming bicycles, the angry bus horns, the chatter of the temple monkeys, the vermilion tikka dot on the women’s foreheads, even in the scent of charred human flesh that pervades the ghats. The people smile—that is the greatest miracle of all. In the heat and stench and shriek of Varanasi, where in fiery sunrise swallows fly like departing spirits over the vast silent river, one delights in the smile of a blind girl being led, of a Hindu gentleman in white turban gazing benignly at the bus driver who reviles him, of a flute-playing beggar boy, of a slow old woman pouring holy water from Ganga, the River, onto a stone elephant daubed red.",

She had warned her mother that she might be a little late in getting home, and had asked her, in view of Mr. Landers’s excessive punctuality, to be downstairs in time to receive and pacify him.",

Elephants who are not serious about their intent—those that may be playing with you or just want you to move—do a mock charge. This mock charge involves loud trumpeting, flapping ears, and a raised trunk. Elephants intent on harm roll up the trunk for protection or leave it hanging loosely toward the ground. These latter elephants lay their ears flat against their heads and point their tusks directly at the object to be attacked. This charge is usually silent. Thus, the elephant we chose to pass was the more dangerous.",

Then, with the practiced hand of a Vegas magician, the shopkeeper produced a silver tray lined with glass bottles, each filled with a brightly colored perfume that Egyptians call essence. The hapless shopkeeper unleashed a story about perfumes and pharaohs, but the details of his pitch were lost on us. Teresa looked at me and frowned, and I looked at Sayid and scowled. We were not interested in souvenirs or essence or papyrus, and, even though I knew the answer, I asked Sayid where the museum was. The shopkeeper interrupted me. He insisted that the papyrus museum was upstairs, and maybe it was, but we never saw it. Instead, Teresa and I jumped to our feet and left the store. Sayid chased after us.",

He took my bags and led me to the guest room, where he poured a glass of ouzo and offered me a bowl full of rose-scented loukoumi. As he did so, he chattered happily about his life in the merchant navy. He had visited Aberdeen on a Cypriot ship in the winter of 1959, he said, and had never forgotten the fog and the bitter cold. I asked where I could find the librarian, Fr. Christophoros. It had been Fr. Christophoros’s letter – surmounted by the great Imperial crest, the double-headed eagle of Byzantium – that had originally lured me to Athos. The manuscript I was looking for was in Iviron’s monastic library, he had said. Yes, it had survived, and he would try to get the Abbot’s permission for me to see it.",

Bagley came to this part of Georgia, saw the stately white pines and poplars, and was so moved by their towering majesty and abundance that he decided to chop them all down. They were worth a lot of money. Besides, freighting the timber to northern mills would keep his railroad cars puffing. In consequence, over the next thirty years, nearly all the hills of northern Georgia were turned into sunny groves of stumps. By 1920, foresters in the South were taking away 15.4 billion board feet of timber a year. It wasn’t until the 1930s, when the Chattahoochee Forest was officially formed, that nature was invited back in.",

His supporters and their attendant journalists assembled at the airport to welcome him and were astonished to see a hale and hearty ‘hero’ descending the aeroplane steps, his ‘paralysis’ having been cured en route. The usual suspects funded his subsequent European lecture tour. Then, having obtained US citizenship (a quickie job), he was appointed to represent the US at Geneva as a member of the subsequently discredited UN Human Rights Commission. At that point a disillusioned and embarrassed Regis Debray commented, ‘The man wasn’t a poet, the poet wasn’t paralysed, and the Cuban is now a US citizen’. Debray, a French writer, had acted as Ché’s main link with Fidel during the Bolivian venture.",

This had been a known fact about me since my childhood. My French mother and Austrian father, having spent their youth in the Alps, were passionate about the outdoors. Every weekend they took us on hikes in the Catskills, ski trips to Vermont, outings to the Long Island shore. Early in the morning we’d make sandwiches, using good butter, slices of cold meatloaf, steak, or chicken left over from last night’s dinner, and plenty of crisp lettuce. Cucumbers, carrots, and sweet peppers would be sliced for crunchy bites. Apples were polished, cookies wrapped in foil. We were a family who loved our picnics. On the long drive to the slopes or the trailhead, my sister and I whiled away countless hours engrossed in silly car games. We’d chant hand-clapping rhymes like “The spades go two lips together, twilight forever, bring back my love to me!”, try to divine the number of wheels on a big rig up ahead, search for out-of-state license plates, or challenge our parents with our favorite word games. On the way home, as night closed in, we lay on our backs with legs scrunched against each other, peering out our respective windows for satellites and shooting stars. We loved being in the back seat together. But when I tried to read, I went from good-humored to queasy. Word games, fine; books, not.",

Some thirty years later, activists in Oregon who heard about the White Bicycles were inspired to start their own bike-sharing scheme in Portland. Their scheme in turn provided the inspiration for public bike-sharing programmes in major cities around the world. Years later, the Dutch White Bicycles’ descendants could be borrowed from docking stations in London, Paris, Brussels and New York.",

So when two British airmen did just that, in the summer of 1919, it was quite a surprise to everyone, including, it seems, the airmen. Their names were Jack Alcock and Arthur Whitten “Teddy” Brown, and they deserve to be a good deal more famous. Theirs was one of the most daring flights in history, but it is sadly forgotten now. It wasn’t particularly well noted at the time either.",

Khayelitsha, meaning ‘new home’ in Xhosa, is allegedly the most lawless and violent of the Cape townships. In retrospect, its controversial creation looks like apartheid’s last stand – a final effort to escape the swart gevaar, at least to the extent of keeping them as far away as possible from the city centre. In the mid-’70s the whole world was shocked by the brutal destruction of the Crossroads squatter camp and global protests did bring about a reprieve of sorts. But when the squatters were offered a barren windswept site on the False Bay coast they resolutely refused to move; to have any hope of earning a living, they needed to be much nearer Cape Town. Then their own leaders, bribed by officialdom, betrayed them. With overt police support, those leaders organized a terror campaign of killings, maimings and shack-burnings. In 1986, when the migrants reluctantly gave in, Khayelitsha was founded. Since that date many thousands more have moved south – because for the first time in a century blacks now have a legal right to live permanently on the Cape Peninsula.",

They stopped at the same marinas along the way that he and his father had stopped some twenty years earlier. They hadn’t changed much. They encountered a few thunderstorms on their way north, which made sailing a bit sporty. Most they dodged, but one got them. They were right off the Marine airbase at Quantico, Virginia. Thank God for their revolving beacon at their airfield and for the hand-held GPS he had bought before they left. Visibility went to zero and the winds gusted to fifty knots and he had to keep Lone Eagle in the narrow channel of the Potomac. They got passed that one – little did he know it was the first of many big blows yet to come.",

In design this flat was identical to Anna’s but seemed more spacious because Dorana lived alone. Her two sons worked in an Oradea factory; her husband had recently run off with a glamorous young woman from Bucharest who had been compelled to teach in Lipova. Husband’s photograph still adorned the TV: he had a treble chin, a down-turned mouth and a crew-cut. The glamorous young woman must have been desperate. But possibly an accommodation problem, rather than other needs, had fuelled this romance. As an engineer working in Lipova, husband was entitled to a flat there – a better flat than any fledgling teacher could ever hope to get.",

It was empty, lighted by spaced weak electric bulbs. They had seen no other sign of life and suddenly it was as though they apparently were not going to until they were out of it again. The narrow corridor had not descended, there were no more steps. It was as if the earth it tunnelled through had sunk as an elevator sinks, holding the corridor itself intact, immune, empty of any life or sound save that of their boots, the white-washed stone sweating in furious immobility beneath the whole concentrated weight of history, stratum upon stratum of dead tradition impounded by the Hôtel above them—monarchy revolution empire and republic, duke farmer-general and sans culotte, levee tribunal and guillotine, liberty fraternity equality and death and the people the People always to endure and prevail, the group, the clump, huddled now, going quite fast until the Iowan cried again:",

    "target_paragraph": "Mary saw that it would be useless to try to stop her. All she could do was to insist upon coming too, but she met with no opposition; Katharine seemed indifferent to her presence. In a few minutes they were walking along the Strand. They walked so rapidly that Mary was deluded into the belief that Katharine knew where she was going. She herself was not attentive. She was glad of the movement along lamp-lit streets in the open air. She was fingering, painfully and with fear, yet with strange hope, too, the discovery which she had stumbled upon unexpectedly that night. She was free once more at the cost of a gift, the best, perhaps, that she could offer, but she was, thank Heaven, in love no longer. She was tempted to spend the first instalment of her freedom in some dissipation; in the pit of the Coliseum,* for example, since they were now passing the door. Why not go in and celebrate her independence of the tyranny of love? Or, perhaps, the top of an omnibus bound for some remote place such as Camberwell, or Sidcup, or the Welsh Harp* would suit her better. She noticed these names painted on little boards for the first time for weeks. Or should she return to her room, and spend the night working out the details of a very enlightened and ingenious scheme? Of all possibilities this appealed to her most, and brought to mind the fire, the lamplight, the steady glow which had seemed lit in the place where a more passionate flame had once burnt.",

On the neighbouring peaks the last remnants of the snow shone blindly white in the warm sunshine, giving that peculiar charm to the springtime which I remembered in our mountain scenery at home. One day the summer season was officially declared to have begun and summer clothes might be worn. One had no right to leave off one’s furs when one wanted to. Every year, after considerations of the omens, a day was fixed on which the nobles and monks put on summer dress. The weather might have already been very warm, or snow or storms might follow. That did not matter. Summer dress must be worn from that date only. The same thing happens in autumn, when winter dress is officially resumed. I continually used to hear complaints that the change-over had come too soon or too late and that people were stifling or half-frozen.",

A place of life that gave meaning to the entire site plan of Las Mesitas, built as it was on a flat man-made plain bordered by waterways that come together to flow, as all the waters of San Agustín do, into the Magdalena. This sense of the river as creative essence, a source of joy, a living inspiration, came back to us later in the afternoon when we scrambled along the stone banks at El Estrecho, a cleft in the earth just upriver from San Agustín where the entire Magdalena, having burst out of the Macizo, is chastened by volcanic stone, forced to run for a quarter mile through a chasm not six feet across. If the river was a child, this was a form of discipline. At El Estrecho, the Río Magdalena seems, if only for that short stretch, to be under the thumb of a schoolmaster, which perhaps explains why the many young boys and girls, picnicking with their families, radiated such joy and delight as the river finally escaped the rocks and continued its rambunctious run to the sea.",

He built three separate fortunes. The first was as the inventor of a cult science he called Physcultopathy, which featured strict adherence to his principles of vegetarianism and strength through bodybuilding, with forays into nakedness for those who dared. The movement produced a chain of successful health farms and related publications. In 1919, as an outgrowth of the latter, Macfadden came up with an even more inspired invention: the confession magazine. True Story, the flagship of this side of his operations, soon had monthly sales of 2.2 million. All the stories in True Story were candid and juicy, with “a yeasty undercurrent of sexual excitation,” in the words of one satisfied observer. It was Macfadden’s proud boast that not a word in True Story was fabricated. This claim caused Macfadden a certain amount of financial discomfort when a piece in 1927 called “The Revealing Kiss,” set in Scranton, Pennsylvania, turned out, by unfortunate chance, to contain the names of eight respectable citizens of that fair city. They sued, and Macfadden was forced to admit that True Stories’ stories were not in fact true at all and never had been.",

We swarm with honey, we like laughter, richness, movement, food, and the fullness of a crowd. This was my meadow. I knew it and I loved it, I walked about in it, these faces were my blades of grass. I understood the life that dwelt in it—the tired but happy life of streets when crowds have left them in the evening, the brooding calm of buildings breathing after use and labor, the quiet sounds of the day’s end, the smell of the sea and shipping that comes forever from the harbor, the last, red, earthless light of the sun that falls remotely, without violence or heat, upon the ancient red of old brick buildings.
