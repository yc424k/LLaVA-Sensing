Once George had asked one of the drivers the destination of these nightly journeys, and the man had told him that they went to Philadelphia, and would return again by morning.",

I believe he continued to express regret and offer advice, but what he said fell on my ear with the indifferent trickling of water when one is not thirsty. At first anger, keen resentment, and disappointment surged within me, for why, I asked myself, did she not say good-bye? I walked up and down on the hot stubble, my hands deep in my pockets and myself deep in conflicting emotions, while Menzies-Legh supposing I was listening regretted and advised, asking myself why she did not say good-bye? Then, gradually, I could not but see that here was tact, here was delicacy, the right feeling of the truly feminine woman, and began to admire her all the more because she had not said it. By degrees composure stole upon me. Reason returned to my assistance. I could think, arrange, decide. And before Edelgard came back with the two children, mere heated debris of that which had lately been so complete, what I had decided with the clear-headed rapidity of the practical and sensible man was to give up the Elsa, lose my money, and go home. Home after all is the best place when life begins to wobble; and home in this case was very near the Eckthum property—I only had to borrow a vehicle, or even in extremity take a Droschke, and there I was. There too the delightful lady must sooner or later be, and I would at least see her from time to time, whereas in England among her English relations she was entirely and hopelessly cut off.",

Rising over the White River, the moon illuminates the ghostly prayer flag blowing so softly on the roof of the still hut, and seems to kindle the stacked brushwood; on its altar stone my small clay Buddha stirs.

And it would have been better, Lawrence Stephen said, for Nicky to have made love to all the married women in Cambridge than for him to marry Phyllis Desmond.\nThese reflections were forced on them by the ironic coincidence of Nicky’s engagement with his rehabilitation at the University.\nDrayton’s forecast was correct; Nicky’s brother Michael had not been removed from Nicky’s College eight months before letters of apology and restitution came. But both apology and restitution came too late.\nFor by that time Nicky had married Desmond.",

This, that in fifty years such structures will have become obsolete—stranded in slums at the back of new quarters yet undreamed of. New depots will have to be built. Whereas in Italy the now distant city will in fifty years have grown to reach its station and, in another half-century, will have encircled it. Thanks to our sagacity, the station will then be in its proper place, in the centre of the town. Our progeny will be grateful; and that again, you will admit, is a worthy aim for our politicians. Besides, what would happen to our coachmen if nobody needed their services on arriving at his destination? The poor men must not be allowed to starve! Cold head and warm heart, you know; humanitarian considerations cannot be thrust aside by a community that prides itself on being truly civilized. I trust I have made myself intelligible?”",

    "target_paragraph": "This sense of self-enclosure, the sense that people and buildings were always keeping an eye on one—Bhutan had little of the instant friendliness of much of Asia, just as it had none of its importunacy or intrusiveness—clearly matched the institutionalized suspiciousness of the government itself. Even in hotels, Bhutanese doors were guarded as tightly as those of any Manhattan apartment, with padlocks under double bolts. And the country’s great fear—of being overrun by tourists, being “Nepalmed,” in a sense—was not, of course, without foundation. Nepal, after all, had hardly opened its doors to the world before it was being colonized as the ultimate hippie outpost, Shangri-la on two dollars a day; in the twenty years since, temples had been disfigured, the people’s respect for temples had been deformed, and most incredibly of all, per capita income had actually fallen. “There is a perception abroad that we are trying to discourage tourism,” a top Bhutanese official told me over tea one day. “That is not true. We want to encourage it. But we want tourists in the package form. Look at Nepal. There are people there who are dirty, with long hair and bad clothes. Women who will have sex with anyone. Pot, marijuana. People sleeping in the streets.” His voice picked up heat as he thought of the countercultural Gomorrah. “This we do not want in Bhutan.”",

The municipality even supplies an open-air, train-like vehicle reminiscent of those found in children’s parks that perilously whips people up and down the switchbacks from a parking lot to the upper village, which is the focus for most tours. However, the town has two levels. In the lower part, called Borgo Maggiore, a conglomeration of churches from diverse periods in various states of disrepair can be seen as well as dwellings dug right out of the volcanic rock, a few still containing ceramic workshops, an historic, local craft. The Borghetto, the upper village, features the castle, a number of churches including the cathedral and a few significant private mansions.",

These camping experiences turn out to be just as educational and thought-provoking as the ruins we’ve come to see.",

As soon as I tried to swing my legs over the side of the five-inch-thick mattress, I knew I was in trouble. I felt like I'd been run over. Then reversed over. As I stood up, my thigh muscles felt like they were about to burst out of my skin, and a shooting electric shock of pain in my calves caused me to fall back onto the bed. I realised that the enforced crouching gait during my tunnel exploration, had obviously utilised muscles I'd never previously had to employ, and I'd been scuttling about in the tunnels for about an hour. Unable to walk, I sank to the grubby linoleum floor and dragged myself into the bathroom. I managed to haul myself into the bath, where I alternated between hot and cold immersion, while trying to massage the excruciating muscular pain from my legs.",

Then I got hired as a pot washer in a restaurant at the Twin Towns Services Club, a big casino just over the New South Wales border, fifteen minutes’ walk from our place. I told them my name was Fitzpatrick. The manager said that as a condition of employment I had to shave my beard, and so I did. When Bryan came home that night, he took one look at me and shrieked. He looked genuinely distressed. He said it looked like half my face had been burned off. I was pale where the beard had been, dark brown everywhere else.",

No dorsal fin rips through the water. Its long, sleek torso needs hardly move to thrust itself ahead. My heart pounds. I hold my spear tightly. If I shoot I will lose the arrow. I gaze at the shark sliding under me just below the surface. Making a smooth, tight corner, it circles back, faster now. As if accelerated by centrifugal force, it closes in on the raft. My mouth is dry, my arms shake; cold sweat streams from my skin. A complete circle executed, the beast thrusts into the wind and melts into the blue as quickly as it came. The vision will last forever. How often will they come? I will never dare to swim from the raft.",

It seemed characteristic of Sighet that they were always locked and no one knew how to contact the parties’ representatives. Then I noticed an angry-looking young man with long brown hair photographing the widely scattered contents of three outsize overturned dustbins. He spoke only Rumanian, but his message was simple enough to be easily understood. As a member of the local Front Committee, he objected to Sighet’s dustmen feeling free, post-revolution, to neglect their duty. If they didn’t get off their arses (his tone suggested that sort of phraseology), he would send his photographs to the Front Headquarters in Bucharest. So Sighet does have its political activists; I wished we had met sooner.",

There followed a series of crude bombs outside Coptic churches in Alexandria and Cairo.

The Asian tourists start at the crack of dawn and carry on sight-seeing until way past my bedtime. I have spoken to many who popped out of bed at 5am, did as many tours as possible in one day, went out to a nightclub, then came back for a brief sleep before doing it all again. Whether this is an enthusiasm for the place being visited or a burning need to get every penny’s worth remains a mystery. Fine with me since they keep the economy going. However, the general sense of personal space is somewhat different from mine, as is the omission of the queuing concept. As we load up, I flatten myself against the wall so I am not trampled and ponder the Scottish Government’s wisdom of subsidising the transport of the tourist industry. Pondering quickly changes to, “YIPPEE, ANOTHER FERRY RIDE.”",

The Chinese would say that the issues are related: Tibet is poor precisely because it devotes its time to gods and prayer and superstition. Many Tibetans might reply that karaoke parlors and industrial cranes look to them like what is truly barbaric. The traveler, anxious in most cases to see the particular beauty and dignity of an ancient culture preserved—yet in no position to suggest that its people live without the schools and hospitals he finds so essential himself—walks between the two sides as across one of the ropebridges that famously span the gorges of the Himalaya.

Others go out for more than one day—fishing or whatever—but they stay in one place, at an established camp or lodge. After that come the hikers and canoers, and from them you get many stories of, say, the boat that breaks up and the guy who sits on the gravel bar for two weeks and walks out in five miserable days. He makes it, though. It’s a rare day when somebody starves or bleeds to death. You’re just not going to make a trip perfectly safe and still get the kind of trip you want. There are no what-if types out here. People who come this far have come to grips with that problem.”",
