The trick worked for her, but I suspect it had nothing to do with arm placement and all to do with her glamour and perfume. I was five years old. My head barely reached the average commuter’s waist. No one gave way for me, leaving me struggling to keep up, face reddening with panic, rubbing my bruised elbows.",

The answer to the eight question is: this place serves as the launderette for all of Southern Scotland. Let me tell you what kind of dodgy people drive into the place. I am now afraid to pitch my tent but am assured they will all be gone at 9pm when the laundry is locked. There is no Plan B. I have checked to see if there is anyplace else to stay. The answer: no. I wait for a break in the rain that occurs for about ten minutes, find a tiny patch of ground that is not under water, pitch the tent, crawl into it, and wonder what I was thinking to do this stupid trip. I send a depressing email to my daughter who immediately responds with an experience of her own that makes me laugh hysterically and reflect that it could be worse. However, I also realise that I am depressed primarily from the lack of sunlight – or any kind of light. So something needs to happen in that department.",

He knew, and she knew, that, though the fascination which each had exercised over the other – on her part independently of accomplishments – would probably in the first days of their separation be even more potent than ever, time must attenuate that effect; the practical arguments against accepting her as a housemate might pronounce themselves more strongly in the cold boreal light of a remoter time. Moreover, when two people are once parted – have abandoned a common domicile and a common environment – new growths insensibly bud upward to fill each vacated place; unforeseen accidents hinder intentions, and old plans are forgotten.",

On an official level, the Banque de France was suspicious of Norman, believing that he would sell out the rest of Europe in an instant if it meant preserving London’s status as a global financial center. Britain, for its part, had just emerged from a costly general strike, and was pained and bewildered by its inability to regain its former supremacy in the world. Norman was personally furious with the French for engineering a quiet but insistent run on British gold reserves, and to show his displeasure was for the time being refusing to address any Frenchman in French. Germany was simply exhausted. Not only had it been landed with crippling reparations payments, but it had also been deprived of much of its capacity to earn foreign exchange. The allied powers had seized a good deal of its shipping, for instance. A fact largely forgotten now is that many of the great ocean liners of the twenties were actually German ships under new names. Cunard’s Berengaria, a vessel so splendid that Cunard made it its flagship, had originally been the German Imperator. The White Star Line’s Majestic had been the Bismarck. The American Leviathan, on which Commander Byrd and his team were about to sail home, had earlier sailed proudly as the Vaterland.",

He resembles a donkey, but will not be trained and cannot stand work; he runs wild like Thompson’s gazelle and eland and eats the same food, but his meat lacks even the doubtful succulence of horse. His hide, while striking in appearance, is only fairly durable and has made its greatest decorative triumph as panelling for the walls of a New York night club. Ostrich and civet cat have contributed more to the requirements of civilized society, but I think it not unjust to say that the zebra clan, in spite of it all, is unaffected by its failure to join in the march of time. I base this conclusion on a very warm friendship that developed, not too long ago to remember, between myself and a young zebra.",

There was Minta, wreathed, tinted, garish on the stairs about three o’clock in the morning. Paul came out in his pyjamas carrying a poker in case of burglars. Minta was eating a sandwich, standing half-way up by a window, in the cadaverous early morning light, and the carpet had a hole in it. But what did they say? Lily asked herself, as if by looking she could hear them. Something violent. Minta went on eating her sandwich, annoyingly, while he spoke. He spoke indignant, jealous words, abusing her, in a mutter so as not to wake the children, the two little boys. He was withered, drawn; she flamboyant, careless. For things had worked loose after the first year or so; the marriage had turned out rather badly.",

According to a count ordered by the VOC’s directors in the 1680s, in Asia alone the Company had more than 11,000 employees on land, as well as around 4000 sailors. Many were Dutch, but a large proportion were recruited from elsewhere in Europe: England, Germany, Poland and Scandinavia. Some of these men shared in the Company’s success, but many were less fortunate – around two-thirds of those who went to sea would never return home. VOC ships were deeply unpleasant places: freezing cold in winter and stiflingly hot in summer, infested with vermin and rife with yellow fever, malaria, typhus and dysentery. Sailors slept, worked and ate in tiny spaces stinking of vomit and urine, with little to eat other than dry biscuits and tough salted meat.",

By the mid-1600s there were hundreds of the things, including more than two hundred in the northern town of Alkmaar alone. The high concentration of mills quickly became an early Dutch tourist attraction. In 1697, Russian tsar Peter the Great visited Zaandam, just north of Amsterdam, to study the revolutionary wind-powered sawmills there. Disguised as a common workman, the leader of one of the world’s greatest empires stayed in a simple wooden cottage and worked as a carpenter in the shipyard.",

The narrow strand gleamed far ahead in a long curve, defining the outline of this wild side of the harbour. He flitted along the shore like a pursued shadow between the sombre palm-groves and the sheet of water lying as still as death on his right hand. He strode with headlong haste in the silence and solitude as though he had forgotten all prudence and caution. But he knew that on this side of the water he ran no risk of discovery. The only inhabitant was a lonely, silent, apathetic Indian in charge of the palmarias, who brought sometimes a load of cocoanuts to the town for sale. He lived without a woman in an open shed, with a perpetual fire of dry sticks smouldering near an old canoe lying bottom up on the beach. He could be easily avoided.",

From Secret Beach you can walk about 2 miles to the north before you hit a bay too large to traverse; you can wade just as far to the south. Look for feeding bonefish and cruising permit.

Long unpaved sections with many big rocks and yamy (holes) made for a bumpy and dusty ride. The van’s low clearance underneath, which I’d worried about before, now caused problems as we began to scrape, and we almost high-centered from time to time. A boulder in the path knocked away a foot or so of tailpipe. A worse bump on an uphill grade crushed and scraped away the remaining two or three feet, leaving no pipe extending from the muffler’s outlet to carry off the exhaust fumes. Immediately the air in the van, which had never been good, became unbearable. Now I could detect an actual blue fog. I tried to remember what the signs of carbon monoxide poisoning were. Sergei, as expected, refused to go to a garage or muffler shop and do anything about the problem. That was not necessary, Sergei announced, sitting beside his open window and its plentiful incoming dust. Finally Volodya, the swing vote among us, switched to my side and told Sergei that we had to fix the tailpipe right away or we’d all suffocate. Sergei said he would fix it, and with some annoyance he pulled over to the shoulder.",

But the years had changed all that. He had gone away, and she had taken charge of Randy when her parents died; she now kept house for him, and had never married. As he saw her standing there with the warm smile on her face, and with something vaguely spinsterish in her look in spite of her large, full-breasted figure and her general air of hearty good nature, he felt a sudden stirring of pity and old affection for her.",

There was a constant scurry of steam launches: many were privately owned – to possess a steam launch was already a sign of status in Hong Kong – many more flew the flags of the hongs, or of foreign consuls, or of hotels. There were the neat white paddle-steamers, like pleasure-boats on lakes, which maintained the ferry services to Macao and Guangzhou, and which the Chinese picturesquely called ‘outside-walkees’.",
