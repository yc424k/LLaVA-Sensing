When I politely declined to join them, though my mouth was watering, they both looked so upset that I had to accept an unwieldy but delicious sandwich; then only slanina made Rumanian bread edible. For pudding we had juicy apples with an old-fashioned flavour; the semi-sword was used to peel, core and slice mine, a superfluous concession to assumed foreign fastidiousness. Then father and son wiped their greasy hands on the window curtain and urged me to do the same; but, absurdly, my adaptability couldn’t stretch that far.",

Men took the canvas bags they’d used to transport the pemmican and repurposed the fabric to make repairs in frayed dog harnesses. Bartlett had planned for a small group to make an attempt back to Shipwreck Camp for more food and fuel, but the weather made it too risky and he called it off for now. Perhaps they could attempt it after he’d left. There remained some fresh bear meat, and everyone relished the savory flesh, knowing they’d be on a strict pemmican diet once the bear meat was gone.",

    "target_paragraph": "In the run-up to the 1952 Presidential election Batista was limping along in third place; it was time to give up pretending to play the democracy game. His coup in the small hours of Sunday 10 March was efficiently managed. At once the universally detested Prio became an asylum-seeker in the Mexican embassy and no guns were needed, except for show. Most Cubans felt relieved to have Batista again in control – never mind his not, this time, being elected. He soon ‘suspended’ most of the new constitution, yet diplomatic recognition came quickly from the governments of Latin America and Europe – and, not much later, from the US.",

I looked around for a bus or a taxi or even a donkey, but there was nothing, so I turned with a practised sigh and began the long trek up. It was a taxing climb, mollified by some attractive villas and sea views. The road snaked up the mountain in a series of long, lazy S-bends, but a mile or so along some steep and twisting steps had been hewn out of the undergrowth and they appeared to offer a more direct, if rather more precipitate, route to Capri town. I ventured up them. I have never seen such endless steps. They just went on and on. They were closed in by the whitewashed walls of villas on both sides and overhung by tumbling fragrant shrubs ? highly fetching, but after about the three-hundredth step I was gasping and sweating so much that the beauty was entirely lost on me.",

The only other border-crossers were local peasants; they had moved freely before the reconciliation but now were required to produce documents. As we huddled together in the shelter of the cliff there was a vague unease in the air. Then I hauled Lear into Passport Control where my health documents were checked, for the first and last time, and my cholera certificate found to be out of date; in London I had forgotten to replace the old with the new. From the Tanzanian point of view it couldn’t have mattered less; I was now leaving the country. However, I had broken the law and provided another bribe-seeking opportunity not availed of; the officer registered shock! horror! – then lectured me at length before accepting my grovelling apology and waving me on. While crossing no man’s land I paused to forge an up-to-date vaccination on my old certificate.",

Then I leaned into the wind and pushed on toward the tree line on the south side. Once I reached it I knew—despite the blocky summits of Mount Cube and Smarts Mountain between me and Hanover—I was essentially done with the technical trail of Maine and New Hampshire. I was almost to Vermont. After nearly two weeks of relentless eighteen-hour days bashing my feet and body against seemingly endless rocks, mud, and roots, the hardest terrain was now firmly behind me. So, I hoped, was the roller coaster of emotions I’d ridden while pushing myself to my absolute limit through Maine and New Hampshire. Now, I would simply do my best and set the fastest pace that I could to Georgia. I tucked my hands into my waistband, seeking the smidge of warmth seeping through the poncho.",

Interestingly, the advertisements for dog food were much the same, except that they weren’t usually chocolate-flavoured.

The mistaken creature saw them, and stalked towards the end of the barn into which they had fled. The girls doubled so adroitly that their pursuer was against the wall when the fugitives were already half-way to the other end. By the time that his length would allow him to turn and follow them thither they had crossed over; thus the pursuit went on, the hot air from his nostrils blowing over them like a sirocco, and not a moment being attainable by Elizabeth or Lucetta in which to open the door. What might have happened had their situation continued cannot be said; but in a few moments a rattling of the door distracted their adversary’s attention, and a man appeared. He ran forward towards the leading-staff, seized it, and wrenched the animal’s head as if he would snap it off. The wrench was in reality so violent that the thick neck seemed to have lost its stiffness and to become half-paralysed, whilst the nose dropped blood. The premeditated human contrivance of the nose-ring was too cunning for impulsive brute force, and the creature flinched.",

A line of clouds directly above the ridge I was following did little to diffuse the harsh UV, but it was something at least. I imagined my mom at home, washing dishes over the stainless-steel sink and looking out the window at the weeping willow tree swaying in the summer breeze. She’d be praying right now for shade over her baby girl. Tears welled up. I wiped them away and pressed on. It was only my second day on the trail and yet I felt exhausted from the emotional roller coaster I’d been on in the months leading up to that moment. Trying to maintain optimism when faced with something that was certain to be a complete failure was a tight-rope I was tired of balancing on.",

But the possibility which now suggested itself that one of the shapes might be the shape of Terence roused her from her melancholy lethargy. She became as restless as she had been before she sat down. She was no longer able to see the world as a town laid out beneath her. It was covered instead by a haze of feverish red mist. She had returned to the state in which she had been all day. Thinking was no escape. Physical movement was the only refuge, in and out of rooms, in and out of people’s minds, seeking she knew not what. Therefore she rose, pushed back the table, and went downstairs. She went out of the hall door, and, turning the corner of the hotel, found herself among the people whom she had seen from the window. But owing to the broad sunshine after shaded passages, and to the substance of living people after dreams, the group appeared with startling intensity, as though the dusty surface had been peeled off everything, leaving only the reality and the instant. It had the look of a vision printed on the dark at night. White and grey and purple figures were scattered on the green, round wicker tables, in the middle the flame of the tea-urn made the air waver like a faulty sheet of glass, a massive green tree stood over them as if it were a moving force held at rest. As she approached, she could hear Evelyn’s voice repeating monotonously, ‘Here then—here—good doggie, come here’; for a moment nothing seemed to happen; it all stood still, and then she realized that one of the figures was Helen Ambrose; and the dust again began to settle.",

So they had used what they did know: a ten-pound hammer from the blacksmith’s shop, not knowing even then the secret of the thing’s life beneath the hood and so over-finding it: the fine porcelain dust of shattered plugs and wrenched and battered wires and dented pipes and even the mute half-horse-shoe prints of the hammer punctuating the spew of oil and gasoline and even the hammer itself immobile against an overalled leg in plain view; and now the city man, cursing in his furious bitter voice, was scrabbling with both hands at the sheriff’s coat until the sheriff grasped both of them in his one and held the man so; and, facing them now across the ruined engine, again it was merely the valley facing itself. ‘The automobile dont belong to the government,’ the sheriff said. ‘It belongs to him.

He was familiar with every footpath and every side valley, and graded each according to the relative likelihoods of meeting settlers or soldiers. He liked to describe the geomorphology of each new area, and his language was unselfconsciously lyrical. He drew explanatory diagrams for me in quick black ink. I loved listening to him. He told me patiently about the ‘anticline cross-section’ of the West Bank and the location of the two vast and crucial aquifers which hydrate the dry land. He explained the colours of the landscape; how the loose iron in the soil is mobilized by the dry climate, such that it rusts the earth orange and brown. He pointed out the three main surface rock formations of the area: the plated limestone and marl horizons of the ‘Bethlehem’ formation, the marl of the ‘Yatta’ formation, and the karstified limestone of the ‘Hebron’ formation, with its Swiss-cheese holes, which Melville had disparaged.",

In addition, she stoutly refused to give permission for an autopsy, which is why the cause of his death has always been uncertain. All that can be said is that the president had been unwell ever since arriving in California from Alaska, where he had been on vacation. He seemed, however, to be rallying when at 7:35 p.m. on August 2, while in conversation with his wife in their room in the Palace Hotel, he shuddered and stopped talking.

The summer residence of Popes is on a ledge above Lake Albano, a lake intensely blue; and strewn on the slopes of the circular volcanic lake—on which pleasure boats, which from our rocky eminence look like plume-spraying toys—are wildflowers, especially poppies, and chestnut trees, white villas, olive trees, and roses: yellow, red. On a nearby terrace is a restaurant that juts out over meadows, vineyard, lake. It is vine-covered, and its red-and-white tablecloths flutter in the wind; but Jane, with whom I am spending this summer day in the Alban Hills—the Castelli Romani—says we must not go there, it is a tourist trap. . . . People are always trying to steer me away from tourist traps, it is a way they assert their superiority, but Jane has never done this before, the prince is making her cranky. . . .",

Oscar grabbed a sandwich and a beer, then walked through the crowded two-story indoor mall to the butcher shop at the far end, where a six-foot-high stack of frozen chicken boxes was rapidly melting. Such treasures usually were picked clean by the owners of private restaurants who paid tipsters to tell them when supplies arrived, then bought nearly the entire shipment, leaving little for ordinary Cubans. Oscar had his own informant who told him when the chicken had been delivered. After scanning the boxes, looking for one that was still frozen solid, he bought a thirty-pound box of drumsticks marked “Made in the USA” for twenty-eight dollars. He wanted to make sure that his parents’ freezer was full before he left.",

Our hope was that we were outside the downcoast current. We were certainly well offshore. Big swells passed beneath us, and then detonated, twenty or thirty seconds later, far inside. It was hard to tell if the village lights were getting closer. But then we noticed smaller lights, lower down, jittering—flashlights. So we were in fact getting closer, and people knew we were out here. There was no coast guard in these parts, but I took some comfort from the flashlights.",

There is a continual trafficking of objects, of stones. Other changes occur. A sudden rain-shower can transform a tiny tributary stream into an uncrossable torrent. The meltwater outflow from the mouth of a glacier will sculpt silt into ceaselessly changing patterns of abstract beauty. These are the dimensions of a landscape which go unindicated by a map.",

The way grew very steep, and each rider kept his eyes fixed on the hobbling curved form of the rider and donkey directly in front of him.

They added fabric sections to the spinning sails to increase their surface area on less windy days, and even used the stationary sails to communicate with one another. By setting the resting sails in a certain position, a miller could broadcast news of a wedding, birth or death in the family, with sections of sail removed to indicate the gender and age of the departed. As well as draining land, windmills were employed to grind grain, tobacco, mustard seeds and building stone, and to saw wood for the country’s rapidly growing shipbuilding industry. By the time Karl Marx visited the Netherlands in the 1830s, he could report some 12,000 windmills dotting the landscape. As another admiring visitor reported in 1836, the Dutch appeared to have found ‘the means for creating a paradise, a new superior world, to effect in one year more than hitherto could be done in thousands of years’.",

You see, in the archives of the Schloss* in that city there was a document which Florence thought would finally give her the chance to educate the whole lot of us together. It really worried poor Florence that she couldn’t, in matters of culture, ever get the better of Leonora. I don’t know what Leonora knew or what she didn’t know, but certainly she was always there whenever Florence brought out any information. And she gave, somehow, the impression of really knowing what poor Florence gave the impression of having only picked up. I can’t exactly define it. It was almost something physical. Have you ever seen a retriever dashing in play after a greyhound? You see the two running over a green field, almost side by side, and suddenly the retriever makes a friendly snap at the other. And the greyhound simply isn’t there. You haven’t observed it quicken its speed or strain a limb; but there it is, just two yards in front of the retriever’s outstretched muzzle. So it was with Florence and Leonora in matters of culture.",

And he gave orders that, when he so cried out, the page at his bedside should wake him.\nFor then he was seeing the dreadful face of his great master, Privy Seal, when the day of his ruin had come. Cromwell had been standing in a window of the council chamber at Westminster looking out upon a courtyard. In behind him had come the other lords of the council, Norfolk with his yellow face, the High Admiral, and many others; and each, seating himself at the table, had kept his bonnet on his head. So Cromwell, turning, had seen them and had asked with his hard insolence and embittered eyes of hatred, how they dared be covered before he who was their president sat down. Then, up against him in the window-place there had sprung Norfolk at the chain of the George round his neck, and Suffolk at the Garter on his knee; and Norfolk had cried out that Thomas Cromwell was no longer Privy Seal of that kingdom, nor president of that council, but a traitor that must die. Then such rage and despair had come into Thomas Cromwell’s terrible face that Cranmer’s senses had reeled. He had seen Norfolk and the Admiral fall back before this passion; he had seen Thomas Cromwell tear off his cap and cast it on the floor; he had heard him bark and snarl out certain words into the face of the yellow dog of Norfolk.\n‘Upon your life you dare not call me traitor!’ and Norfolk had fallen back abashed.\nThen the chamber had seemed to fill with an awful gloom and darkness; men showed only like shadows against the window lights; the constable of the Tower had come in with the warrants, and in that gloom the earth had appeared to tremble and quake beneath the Archbishop’s feet.",

Today we shall have carried loads from Cave Camp to the Kang, four thousand feet up through ice and heavy snow; two more loads apiece must come up from the Snowfields Camp tomorrow. Why aren’t GS and Jang-bu back today to help? Why are we setting our willow sticks for Tukten and Gyaltsen, when it is plain that the absent Sherpas will never get this far without a guide?

When he moved they fell silent (getting ready to spit, perhaps), when he became still again, they released the liquid flute-like monotony swelling in their throats, filling the night with the imminence of summer.

The bad news was that a visa can be extended only on the day it expires. And the worst news was that it can be extended only in Vientiane. This seriously restricts anyone planning a long trek. In Peru I dodged the same rule by simply disappearing from officialdom’s view for a few months – easy, in the high Andes, where officialdom doesn’t function. (Or didn’t, in 1978.) However, one is advised not to play visa games with the Laotian authorities; recently two Germans had been gaoled for an indefinite period, having entered illegally from China. Local authorities wield considerable power, especially in the remoter provinces. And where there is no legal system, in our sense of the term, travellers are helpless if by ill-luck some atypical official chooses to pounce on an expired visa. I therefore decided to spend my first fifteen days in Vientiane, then take a bus across the hot plain to cool Vang Vieng and from there walk north on footpaths through the mountains. At the end of that extension I could think again; bridges are best crossed when you come to them.",

When determining auspicious days for festivals and ceremonies, the Balinese look for coincidence days, such as those days when the last day of the three-day week falls on the last day of the five-day week — this particular example, an important one, is called Kajeng Keliwon, and the coincidence takes place every 15 days. Although there are ten distinct week cycles in the Pawukon, only three of them — the three-, five-, and seven-day weeks — are really important. The Balinese names for these are, respectively, Triwara, Pancawara, and Saptawara. Each of these has unique names for its weekdays:",
