Then, as though her heart had said, ‘Is coyness longer necessary?

    "target_paragraph": "Contrary to Sonny’s assertions otherwise, the world did not end at that traffic circle. We were perfectly safe, there was plenty to see, and we soon found the marina. A driveway sloped down the riverbank to a tree-lined promenade along the waterfront. There we found a fleet of dormant vessels tethered to the docks, five or six deep. We counted scores of decommissioned river cruisers, ferries, tour boats, and feluccas, but for all the watercraft moored at the docks, there were none on the river – none at all. The river was calm and lonely, and so, too, was the promenade. There were no captains or crews, nor were there any passengers to hire them. Vacant storefronts lined the boardwalk, but there were neither merchants nor customers to enjoy them. We peeked through dark windows and knocked on locked doors, but gathered no answers. For all intents and purposes, the river was closed, and had been for some time. Long-distance cruises between Luxor and Cairo were suspended, in the 1990s, we later learned, amid recurrent attacks by militant forces. Shorter trips, between Luxor and Aswan, were popular until the revolution, after which the scarcity of clients merited a proportionate scarcity of cruises. A few ferries and tour boats carried passengers across the river, but scheduled service was then unreliable at best. As for the feluccas, well, they were there, berthed by the dozen, their sails furled or stowed for the foreseeable future. Later on, in Aswan, we would encounter dozens of boatmen, but in Luxor, we found not one. Our sailing trip would have to wait.",

In obedience to those laws, Rodney disappeared; Cassandra was dispatched to catch the eleven-thirty on Monday morning; Denham was seen no more; so that only Katharine, the lawful occupant of the upper rooms, remained, and Mr Hilbery thought himself competent to see that she did nothing further to compromise herself. As he bade her good morning next day he was aware that he knew nothing of what she was thinking, but, as he reflected with some bitterness, even this was an advance upon the ignorance of the previous mornings. He went to his study, wrote, tore up, and wrote again a letter to his wife, asking her to come back on account of domestic difficulties which he specified at first, but in a later draft more discreetly left unspecified. Even if she started the very moment that she got it, he reflected, she would not be home till Tuesday night, and he counted lugubriously the number of hours that he would have to spend in a position of detestable authority alone with his daughter.",

Kabul is at 7,000 feet and, though I don’t know what the altitude here is, the air feels positively thick with oxygen after so long on the heights.

Her husband had not brought an evening paper home. At any rate she had not seen it. Mrs Verloc knew nothing whatever of any affair.

A black bear will run from a grizzly, too. Grizzlies sometimes kill and eat black bears. The grizzly takes what he happens upon. He is an opportunistic eater. The predominance of the grizzly in his terrain is challenged by nothing but men and ravens. To frustrate ravens from stealing his food, he will lie down and sleep on top of a carcass, occasionally swatting the birds as if they were big black flies. He prefers a vegetable diet. He can pulp a moosehead with a single blow, but he is not lusting always to kill, and when he moves through his country he can be something munificent, going into copses of willow among unfleeing moose and their calves, touching nothing, letting it all breathe as before. He may, though, get the head of a cow moose between his legs and rake her flanks with the five-inch knives that protrude from the ends of his paws. Opportunistic. He removes and eats her entrails. He likes porcupines, too, and when one turns and presents to him a pygal bouquet of quills, he will leap into the air, land on the other side, chuck the fretful porpentine beneath the chin, flip it over, and, with a swift ventral incision, neatly remove its body from its skin, leaving something like a sea urchin behind him on the ground. He is nothing if not athletic. Before he dens, or just after he emerges, if his mountains are covered with snow he will climb to the brink of some impossible schuss, sit down on his butt, and shove off. Thirty-two, sixty-four, ninety-six feet per second, he plummets down the mountainside, spray snow flying to either side, as he approaches collision with boulders and trees. Just short of catastrophe, still going at bonecrushing speed, he flips to his feet and walks sedately onward as if his ride had not occurred.",

It has in the Stray, a 215-acre sweep of parklike common land overlooked by solid, prosperous homes, one of the largest and most agreeable open spaces in the country. It has some nice old hotels, a pleasant shopping area, and, withal, a genteel and well-ordered air. It is, in short, as nice a town as you will find anywhere. It reminds me, in a pleasantly English way, a little of Baden-Baden, which is of course not surprising since it was likewise a spa town in its day—and a very successful one, too. According to a leaflet I picked up at the Royal Pump Room Museum, as late as 1926 the spa was still dispensing as many as twenty-six thousand glasses of sulfurous water in a single day. You can still drink the water if you want. According to a notice by the tap, it is reputedly very good for flatulence, which seemed an intriguing promise, and I very nearly drank some until I realized the notice meant it prevented it. What an odd notion.",

The bible says so.’ I took the opportunity of remarking airily to Matthew that she would approve of his attitude to drinking. The woman informed us, in parentheses, that she was a Seventh Day Adventist, and concluded a list of other biblically prohibited activities with ‘watching television’.",

To step, for instance, at the place under notice, from the edge of the plantation into the adjoining thoroughfare, and pause amid its emptiness for a moment, was to exchange by the act of a single stride the simple absence of human companionship for an incubus* of the forlorn.",

It was a sports car of a surfboard, and a nice change after months of riding my sturdy travel board. Bryan also got new, much smaller boards. The year-round neighborhood spot was called Duranbah. It was a wide-open beachbreak immediately north of the Tweed River mouth, very near my casino job. Duranbah always seemed to have waves. They were often sloppy, but there were gems scattered among the mush. On my twenty-sixth birthday, I got a sweet barrel on a shining right and came out dry.",

One morning, McKinlay awoke in the Cabin De Luxe to find “gleaming icicles hanging from above.” They looked like ice stalactites dangling down at him. The walls of his bunk were crystallized from frozen condensation. The room was, he said, “a miniature ice palace, crystals sparkling in the light. All along the outer side of my bunk was a sheet of ice.” Then the ice on the walls and ceiling would thaw with the heat of the warming cookstoves, wetting blankets and clothing and even pooling on the floors. It was happening in other cabins, too, so that everyone was sodden and cold and uncomfortable. About the situation, McKinlay lamented, “Never could there have been found a more dispirited and demoralized group of human beings.” The men of Cabin De Luxe showed the problem to Captain Bartlett, and he agreed to move one of the coal stoves in there to maintain a more consistent temperature and reduce the freeze-thaw effect.",

Men in gaiters were leaning against the walls; the shops had their awnings out; the pavement was barred with shadow. They had parcels to fetch. At the fishmonger’s they stopped; and a damp white parcel was handed out to them. At the ironmonger’s they stopped; and William came back with a scythe. Then they stopped at the chemist’s; but there they had to wait, because the lotion was not yet ready.",

A thirty degree sun beat down on the asphalt as we travelled through a scrubby, dun-coloured terrain, brightened by an occasional colourful splash of cacti and yucca. Rounding a bend into a downward slope, I caught sight of movement to my right, as a number of small rocks bounced down an incline onto the road. I had a split second to decide what to do, and calculated that I could probably outrun the landslide with a burst of speed. I increased pressure on the gas, and as we accelerated, heard a succession of thumps from beneath the vehicle, followed by an ominous bang. Karen and I cringed involuntarily in unison, and I brought the car to a halt. We got out to see a river of yellowy brown liquid slowly coursing from beneath the vehicle into the gutter. It was clear we wouldn't be meeting any beer drinking goats today.",

At last we had our bunks, our blankets, and Fong, our beloved Chinese cook. The car was switched up near in the railway station—in the very front rank of trains. And as we gathered in its grateful interior, hot, dusty and worn out, the Federals in Torreon dropped a few shrapnel shells right close beside us. I was standing in the door of the car at the time and heard the boom of cannon, but paid no particular attention to it.\nSuddenly I noticed a small object in the air like an exaggerated beetle, trailing a little spiral of black smoke behind it. It passed the door of the car with a zzzzzing noise and about forty feet beyond burst with a frightful Crash—Whee-e-e-eeaa!! among the trees of a park where a company of cavalry and their women were camping. A hundred men leaped for their plunging horses in a panic and galloped frantically toward the rear, the women streaming after them. Two women had been killed, it seemed, and a horse. Blankets, food, rifles—all were discarded in the panic. Pow! Another burst on the other side of the car. They were very close. Behind us on the track twenty long trains, laden with shrilly screaming women, were trying to back out of the yards all at once, with a mighty hysterical tooting of whistles. Two or three more shells followed, then we could hear \"El Niño\" replying.",

    "target_paragraph": "The night mist fell. From the moon it rolled, clustered about the spires and towers, and then settled below them, so that the dreaming peaks were still in lofty aspiration toward the sky. Figures that dotted the day like ants now brushed along as shadowy ghosts, in and out of the foreground. The Gothic halls and cloisters were infinitely more mysterious as they loomed suddenly out of the darkness, outlined each by myriad faint squares of yellow light. Indefinitely from somewhere a bell boomed the quarter-hour, and Amory, pausing by the sundial, stretched himself out full length on the damp grass. The cool bathed his eyes and slowed the flight of time—time that had crept so insidiously through the lazy April afternoons, seemed so intangible in the long spring twilights. Evening after evening the senior singing had drifted over the campus in melancholy beauty, and through the shell of his undergraduate consciousness had broken a deep and reverent devotion to the gray walls and Gothic peaks and all they symbolized as warehouses of dead ages.\nThe tower that in view of his window sprang upward, grew into a spire, yearning higher until its uppermost tip was half invisible against the morning skies, gave him the first sense of the transiency and unimportance of the campus figures except as holders of the apostolic succession. He liked knowing that Gothic architecture, with its upward trend, was peculiarly appropriate to universities, and the idea became personal to him. The silent stretches of green, the quiet halls with an occasional late-burning scholastic light held his imagination in a strong grasp, and the chastity of the spire became a symbol of this perception.\n“Damn it all,” he whispered aloud, wetting his hands in the damp and running them through his hair. “Next year I work!” Yet he knew that where now the spirit of spires and towers made him dreamily acquiescent, it would then overawe him. Where now he realized only his own inconsequence, effort would make him aware of his own impotency and insufficiency.\nThe college dreamed on—awake. He felt a nervous excitement that might have been the very throb of its slow heart. It was a stream where he was to throw a stone whose faint ripple would be vanishing almost as it left his hand. As yet he had given nothing, he had taken nothing.\nA belated freshman, his oilskin slicker rasping loudly, slushed along the soft path. A voice from somewhere called the inevitable formula, “Stick out your head!” below an unseen window. A hundred little sounds of the current drifting on under the fog pressed in finally on his consciousness.\n“Oh, God!” he cried suddenly, and started at the sound of his voice in the stillness. The rain dripped on. A minute longer he lay without moving, his hands clinched. Then he sprang to his feet and gave his clothes a tentative pat.\n“I’m very damn wet!” he said aloud to the sundial.",
