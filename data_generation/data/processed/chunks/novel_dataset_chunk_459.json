Through the roaring whirls of dust a thousand thin lines of sparks from the fires streamed southward. The coaling of the engines’ fire boxes made sudden glares along the miles of trains. At first we thought we heard the sound of big guns in the distance. But all at once, unexpectedly, the sky split dazzlingly open from horizon to horizon, thunder fell like a blow, and the rain came level and thick as a flood. For a moment the human hum of the army was silenced. All the fires disappeared at once. And then came a vast shout of anger and laughter and discomfiture from the soldiers out on the plain, and the most amazing wail of misery from the women that I have ever heard. The two sounds only lasted a minute. The men wrapped themselves in their serapes and sank down in the shelter of the chaparral; and the hundreds of women and children exposed to the cold and the rain on the flat-cars and the tops of the box-cars silently and with Indian stoicism settled down to wait for dawn. In General Maclovio\nHerrera’s car ahead was drunken laughter and singing to a guitar....",

Thousand.” Wild-eyed now, the Frenchman muttered something poisonous and scribbled down a few more figures. Again the girl shook her head no. Then, without a warning, the pilot broke off from his demented chant and tried to broker a four-part deal involving my watch, his watch, foreigners’ currency and people’s money. Foiled in an instant, he struck up again his terrible cry. “Thirty. Seven. Fifteen. Four.” The Frenchman and the girl huddled together. “Nineteen. Forty.

I guessed he was about forty-four, and he had lived on the island for twenty years. He had done all right; he had an entrepreneurial spirit, and the guesthouse supplemented an income from various agricultural interests. His wife, a figure of Chaucerian ribaldry and feisty spirits, presided over the household while knitting in her chair next to the wood-burning stove or pursuing her five-year-old son, Julio, a delightfully wicked little boy whom I took to greatly, though he allegedly told his mother at the end of the week that he didn’t like me. Entrepreneurial spirits have to be understood in context down there, and once the guesthouse had been set up it was clear that both Mario and his wife felt that they had discharged their responsibilities towards it. They were wholly disinterested in whether I intended to stay one night or one year and unembarrassed by the absence of any kind of heating in the bedrooms, which meant that they were like freezer rooms in meat-packing factories.",

Ballpoint pens and balloons for the kids were optional, but something for the chief or the coastal landowners really wasn’t. The best gift, the traditional offering, was an armload of the root from which kava is made. In Fiji it’s called waka. We had planned, leaving Suva, to buy a batch at a farmers’ market near the bus station, but suddenly our early-morning bus was leaving and, in haste, we dodged into a shop and bought a fifth of Frigate Overproof Rum instead. The rum would be welcome, we figured, and we were right. The problem was that when we reached Nukui, a village near the bay we wanted to check—this was after a long ride in an outboard-powered canoe through a maze of impressively dense mangrove swamps—the headman, Timoci, who greeted us warmly, insisted on opening the rum immediately and passing the flagon around the small circle of men who happened to be on hand. We polished off the bottle in fifteen minutes. It was still early afternoon. We were now kneewalking. We never made it to the beach that day.",

It was basically a kind of sophisticated filter. Carrel reveled in the publicity that Lindbergh’s involvement brought?it coincided very conveniently with the publication of Man the Unknown?and persuaded journalists that the pump represented a historic breakthrough in medical science. Time featured the two men on its cover, with the apparatus proudly displayed between them. Lindbergh’s perfusion pump was unquestionably a nifty device, but it is fair to say that it would never have attracted the attention it did if it had been invented by anyone else. In practice, it had few useful applications and no role in surgery. Although several perfusion pumps were built, it is believed that none were still in use by 1940.",

In the ensuing anarchy, Castro’s victims would surely rise up against Communism. This bombing was to be launched from Costa Rica, that favourite CIA base for covert activities. As Pepin Bosch’s second-hand B-26 lacked rockets, he visited Venezuela’s arms bazaar, found it temporarily out of rockets and hurried to Brazil where the dictatorship presented him with a pair of left-overs from a dodgy consignment. Back in Costa Rica, Nature intervened. Weather delayed the bombing run, some alert journalist investigated the mysterious B-26 with the uncommunicative pilot – and then spotted an international ‘celeb’ (as Pepin Bosch would now be known) lurking nearby. When the New York Times published a photograph of the plane, with a questioning caption, the Costa Rican government made haste to avert a major scandal by confiscating this embarrassing Bacardi possession.",

Kabul is wonderful from a visitor’s point of view, but if one had to live here for two years, and if one were accustomed to cars (which only senior officials can have) and to TV, daily papers, mod. cons, pubs, cafés, cinemas and theatres, life without them must seem rather monotonous. This is rated a ‘hardship post’ by foreign services and everyone is paid a twenty-five per cent bonus to come to Kabul. It’s funny to see the sedate Embassy staffs scooting round on bicycles or walking, but it does mean that for at least two years of their existence they lead healthy lives with daily exercise.",

Nevertheless, Raja still walked: a minimum of once a week, usually more. Sometimes only a couple of miles, sometimes ten or twelve if routes could be found that avoided difficulties. Paths that had connected village to village or village to town for many centuries had been closed by the Israelis; long diversions were often necessary. As walking had become less easy, it had become correspondingly more important to him – a way of defeating the compression of space of the Occupation; a small but repeated act of civil disobedience.",

I looked down between the slender stems of some silver birches that hung over the water; every now and then a tiny gust of wind came along and rippled their clear reflections, ruffling up half of each water-lily leaf, and losing itself somewhere among the reeds. Then when it had gone, the lily leaves dropped back one after the other on to the calm water, each with a little thud. On the west side the lake ends in a reedy marsh, very froggy that afternoon, and starred with the snowy cotton flower. A peculiarly fragrant smell like exceedingly delicate Russian leather hangs round the place, or did that afternoon. It was, I suppose, the hot sun bringing out the scent of some hidden herb, and it would not always be there; but I like to think of the beautiful little lake as for ever fragrant, all the year round lying alone and sweet-smelling and enchanted, tucked away in the bosom of the solitary hills.",

Every new arrival from Holy Russia, regardless of sex or age, spent some hours or days, as the case might be, alone with the Master in his apartment, in order to be initiated into the Law and impregnated with its full signification: such was the way of the New Jerusalem. By this system of spiritual control he could be sure of finding a successor sooner or later. Besides, the defection of this favourite disciple was only a drop in the ocean of his griefs. What secretly preyed upon his mind was that, on the verge of returning to his former state of worldly prosperity, he had been inspired to issue that Second Revelation regarding warm-blooded beasts. He ought to have known about the Grand Dukes, and what a sacrilegious hot-tempered clique they were! \"This comes,\" he would say, \"of placing the service of God above that of my earthly masters.\" It kept him in exile on this island—the deadlock in the matter of that Second Revelation. The expiatory period was not yet over, though Nepenthe, on the whole, would have been glad to see the last of him—particularly Signor Malipizzo.",

Souls sent from this place on earth go straight to heaven. A few weeks ago, on a hotel roof above India’s holiest city, Jonathan and I inhaled clouds of hash spiced with wafts of singed hair and burning bodies. We walked among Varanasi’s rats, dogs and street urchins as they competed for garbage in a maze of twisting dark alleyways and stained palaces that rot into the black mud. At dawn we floated in a wooden boat past candles, flowers and human ashes in holy waters littered with bobbing bloated bodies.",

    "target_paragraph": "Soon we heard distant, baffling sounds: hollow metallic bangings, much shouting, chanting and laughter. Then the first empty oil drum, battered and rusty, came over the dune top. Three triumphantly grinning children pushed it into waist-deep water where Kwang, the captain’s eldest son, stood ready. With difficulty he heaved it up to the starboard opening – opposite mine – and his two younger brothers dragged it into the hold. More drums came: ten, fifteen, twenty – after that I lost count. It seems this is a port of some consequence; the nearest ban must be the kerosene depot for quite a large area. I moved to where I could watch through my binoculars as three or four children rolled each drum from within the forest, the ‘teams’ racing each other down the dunes. No adult appeared, this was a job for juveniles and also a game – though pushing large barrels up slopes of loose sand is not easy. Bertie, a self-styled man of action, was now thoroughly enjoying himself – and, to give him his due, being constructive. He organized a falang team to take over from the little boys who then worked with their dad, helping him to stack the barrels, on their sides, aft of the passengers’ space. They filled half the hold and to reach the long-drop one had to crawl on hands and knees through a low, narrow tunnel between drums and roof. The more daring went outside and crab-walked aft, clinging to the roof, along a six-inch-wide ledge.",

Today, it looks considerably better than it did in 1977. Guests arrive and think, ‘Ah, a quaint country residence,’ but they can have no idea of the long years of toil it took to bring the house to its present state. At first there was not even running water; there was only a well, which dried up in the winter months. Although I don’t mind ‘run-down’, I do mind ‘dirty’. So I invited a group of friends from Oomoto over for a house-cleaning party. Carrying buckets of water from the well, we wiped the ceilings, pillars and tatami mats until they gleamed. Happily, the roof did not leak, so the tatami had not rotted and I did not face the horrific roofing problems which had colored my experience in Iya. Gradually, I brought in running water, repaired the doors and walls, and weeded the garden. The back garden which Ping and I had discovered that first day was an impenetrable mass of weeds and vines.

The vision of it used sometimes to rise before Lewis Raycie’s eyes in outlandish foreign places; for though not a large or fastidious eater when he was at home, he was afterward, in lands of chestnut-flour and garlic and queer bearded sea-things, to suffer many pangs of hunger at the thought of that opulent board. In the centre stood the Raycie épergne of pierced silver, holding aloft a bunch of June roses surrounded by dangling baskets of sugared almonds and striped peppermints; and grouped about this decorative “motif” were Lowestoft platters heavy with piles of raspberries, strawberries and the first Delaware peaches. An outer flanking of heaped-up cookies, crullers, strawberry short-cake, piping hot corn-bread and deep golden butter in moist blocks still bedewed from the muslin swathings of the dairy, led the eye to the Virginia ham in front of Mr. Raycie, and the twin dishes of scrambled eggs on toast and broiled blue-fish over which his wife presided. Lewis could never afterward fit into this intricate pattern the “side-dishes” of devilled turkey-legs and creamed chicken hash, the sliced cucumbers and tomatoes, the heavy silver jugs of butter-coloured cream, the floating-island, “slips” and lemon jellies that were somehow interwoven with the solider elements of the design; but they were all there, either together or successively, and so were the towering piles of waffles reeling on their foundations, and the slender silver jugs of maple syrup perpetually escorting them about the table as black Dinah replenished the supply.",

In the light it has a gold dazzle to it, while in the shadow it looks the creamy grey-white of cartilage. Rocks as big as buildings are scattered about, and throw complexities of blue shadow around themselves. The sound of distant thunder rolls in from the south, but the only thunderheads to be seen are thousands of feet beneath Burnet, massing over the Piedmont. He is, he realizes with delight, above the storm.",

    "target_paragraph": "Of the local Etruscan culture, an astonishing amount continues to be unearthed. Beside one of the local tombs, a seven-step stairway of stone flanked with reclining lions intertwined with human parts—probably a nightmare vision of the underworld—was discovered in 1990. Nearby Chiusi, like Cortona one of the original twelve cities of Etruria, only recently found its town walls. Both Cortona and Chiusi have extensive collections of Etruscan artifacts found both by archeological digs and by farmers turning up bronze figures in their furrows. In Chiusi, the museum custodian will take you out to see some of the dozens of tombs found in that area. The Romans considered Etruscans warlike (the Romans weren’t?), so they come down to us with that rap on them, but the tombs, enormous clay horses, bronze figures, and household objects reveal them to be a majestic, inventive, humorous people. Certainly, they must have been strong. Everywhere they’ve left remains of walls and tombs constructed of stupendous stone.",

This was an historic and fateful step … Any possibility that Clinton, or some future President, might order the lifting of economic sanctions now evaporated, to the irritation of America’s trading partners, notably in the European Union, and of the farmers and manufacturers within the US who hoped for eventual access to the Cuban market.

Next three men, representing the chief Tibetan provinces, stood silently in the centre of the stage holding the national flag with its fabulously colourful and intricate design. The spiritual symbolism of this design is too involved for me to understand, much less explain, but it struck me as very appropriate that whereas most countries are satisfied with a pattern of geometrically arranged colours Tibet must have an exuberant wealth of pictorial emblems. As the flag was being presented we heard from behind the scenes that most moving air, ‘Katatampa’ – a very ancient tune adopted as the national anthem in the reign of the thirteenth Dalai Lama, when its patriotic words were composed. Then, after the standard-bearers had marched off, the play began.",
