Ever since Australia, as a result of the occupational hazards of contrary winds and calms, engine problems and days often lost to my own reluctance to head back out to sea again, I had fallen further and further behind schedule. I had made a commitment to my father to do this trip in a certain amount of time and was determined to see it through as we had planned and get on with my own life. But now, over every move and every decision as Olivier and I prepared for the unpleasant trip up the Red Sea to Egypt, hung the omnipresent worry that time was quickly running out.",

I no longer feel odd man out. At least I am riding a normal bike. My tent goes up. I blow up the air mattress and fluff up the sleeping bag. I store panniers alongside the tent and make a nest inside. Dinner is nibblies because I am that tired. I am also terrified of lighting the stove. I can guarantee that will be an “event.”",

    "target_paragraph": "This was the casual and high-risk world in which Charles Lindbergh learned to fly. His first flight?indeed, his first experience of an airplane at close range?was at a flying school in Lincoln, Nebraska, on April 9, 1922, two months after his twentieth birthday. He was instantly smitten. Almost at once he embarked on a brief but perilous career as a stunt performer. Within a week he was wing-walking, and within a month he was?without any prior training?parachuting from giddy heights to the delight of watching crowds. In the course of these duties he also learned, in an entirely informal way, to fly. He proved to be unusually good at it. Like other young men, Lindbergh was capable of the most riveting foolishness. Part of the job of barnstormers was to impress the locals with their flying skills, and on a visit to Camp Wood, Texas, Lindbergh decided to do so by taking off from the town’s Main Street?an ambitious challenge since the street’s telephone poles were just forty-six feet apart and his wingspan was forty-four feet. As he sped down the street he hit a bump, which caused a wingtip to clip a pole, spinning him sideways and through the front window of a hardware store. That neither he nor any of the spectators were injured was a miracle.",

Over northwest Australia, along the Kimberley coast, they hit bad weather, grew hopelessly lost (not altogether surprisingly: for guidance they had only a couple of admiralty charts and a map of Australia torn from a standard Times Atlas), and made a forced landing on a coastal mudflat, with almost no fuel left and hopelessly short of supplies. Almost all they had was a Thermos of coffee and some brandy, which could be combined to make a drink called a coffee royal. Thus what followed became known, somewhat darkly, as the Coffee Royal Affair.",

Then he settled down in his chair and ate a kidney. The physical force present was no doubt enough to suppress Mr Duchemin should he become violent. And trained! It was one of the curious, minor coincidences of life that, at Cambridge, he had once thought of hiring this very Parry to follow round his dear friend Sim. Sim, the most brilliant of sardonic ironists, sane, decent, and ordinarily a little prudish on the surface, had been subject to just such temporary lapses as Mr Duchemin. On society occasions he would stand up and shout or sit down and whisper the most unthinkable indecencies. Macmaster, who had loved him very much, had run round with Sim as often as he could, and had thus gained skill in dealing with these manifestations … He felt suddenly a certain pleasure! He thought he might gain prestige in the eyes of Mrs Duchemin if he dealt quietly and efficiently with this situation. It might even lead to an intimacy. He asked nothing better!",

It had something of the air of a gold-rush town, as if it had sprung up hurriedly, and it looked poor and gray and spray battered. I hunted around for someplace to eat and happened on a nondescript-looking establishment called the Riverside Café. I opened the door and found myself in the most extraordinary setting. The place was heaving. The air was thick with shrill London-style chatter and all the customers looked as if they had just stepped out of a Ralph Lauren advertisement. They all had sweaters slung casually around their shoulders and sunglasses perched on their heads. It was as if a little piece of Fulham or Chelsea had been magically wafted to this godforsaken corner of the Dorset coast.",

Lou was now sitting up, but was still too weak to leave her bed, and the difficulties of getting away from Kashgar down the southern Silk Road remained intractable. A visit to the bus station confirmed that it was impossible for a foreigner to buy a bus ticket to Khotan without a permit, nor was it easy to find an English-speaking Uigur to buy one for us. The bus station was in complete chaos. Some buses were leaving empty (an unheard-of event in Asia) while others were packed full and surrounded by mobs of angry, fist-waving Uigurs. I circled among the crowds, jostled and shouted at, unable to find anyone who spoke English. Only the moneychangers showed any interest in me. They followed me around shouting ‘Change moneys? Change dollar?’; attempts to get them to go away only increased their enthusiasm. They were soon noticed by the bus station security guards. I and my suspicious-looking entourage were pursued around the bus station, in and out of bus queues, through ticket halls and waiting rooms until we eventually lost them in the mêlée outside.",

Walking through the first of these you clambered down some slippery stairs into what was once a breathless subterranean vault hewn out of the soft and dry pumiceous rock and used, as was customary, for storing barrels and other paraphernalia. In the course of time, as more barrels accumulated, the grotto was excavated further and further into the entrails of the island. There seemed no reason why it should ever cease growing when suddenly, one day, the perspiring workmen were struck in the face by a cool blast of wind laden with marine moisture. They knew what this meant. They had encountered one of those mysterious and dangerous fissures that lead down to unknown depths, opening upon the world of sunshine often at the water's edge, four hundred feet below. It was deemed prudent to suspend excavations. These rents in the interior of the earth had a knack of enlarging themselves, without a word of warning, from cracks of a few inches to black gulfs several hundred feet across. The cavern ceased to grow. As a matter of fact, it turned out to be just large enough.",

Ian knew everyone; of course he did. We moored up among that loose flotilla, and boat-hopped by dinghy. Down in the warm cabin fug of one of the yachts, we crowded round a table; hot food was served and whisky was passed about in a tin mug. Stories were told of the day, congratulations were extended to Broad Bay on her passage. ‘We never thought you’d make it!’ ‘Only two of you, and Ian a raw novice!’ Voices were raised in song, welcoming, happy. And a dog – no, two dogs – skittering about on the decks. After the long hours at sea, it all felt wonderfully hospitable: the sheltering arm of the island, the tittle-tattle of the birds, the good cheer in the cabin. I grinned and couldn’t stop grinning. Outside, dark fell, and the forms of the islands shifted. Slope became undetectable, fall-lines sheered, the islands turned to silhouettes, then vanished altogether.",

As we walked up-stream towards the lake it grew hotter and hotter. Aufschnaiter gave up first, but I kept on, hoping that the heat would be good for my sciatica. I wallowed in the hot water. I had brought with me my last piece of soap from Kyirong, and put it on the bank beside me, looking forward to a thorough soaping as the climax of my bath. Unluckily I had not noticed that a crow was observing me with interest. He suddenly swooped and carried off my treasure. I sprang on to the bank with an oath, but in a moment was back in the hot water, my teeth chattering with cold. In Tibet the crows are as thievish as magpies are with us.",

The sun had set fully and the city had grown darker, emptier and colder. I was hungry and made a brief diversion to a kebab shop, one of the scores scattered throughout the city. I ordered a Turkish pizza: flakes of lamb on a plate-sized flatbread, rolled up like a carpet. ‘Have you seen the march?’ I asked the young Turk behind the counter as he drizzled creamy garlic sauce. ‘The religious unity march, with the Muslims and the Jews together?’ No, he replied grumpily, handing me the rolled pizza and returning his attention to the Galatasaray game on the television above the counter. ‘I don’t like politics.’",

Preserving the past for its own sake doesn’t come into it much. There is little room for sentiment. When somebody comes along and offers a group of nuns good money for their staircase, they don’t say, ‘Certainly not, it is a hallowed shrine, built for us by a mysterious and rather hunky-looking courier of Jesus.’ They say, ‘How much?’ And if the offer is good enough they sell it and use the money to build a new convent on a bigger site, with airconditioning, lots of parking space and a games room. I don’t mean to suggest for a moment that nuns are worse than other Americans in this regard. They are simply behaving in the customary American way. I find that very sad. It is no wonder that so few things last for more than a generation in America.",

Sadly, the moment to go through security came all too soon and the rounds of hugs and kisses, with a few damp eyes, quickly passed with my last turn and wave to the group of warm faces enthusiastically returning the gesture from the other side of the metal detector. I had been lucky to find such friendship, to have stumbled on Calabria and its people.",

A shadowy figure emerged from behind the closed curtains and unlocked the door. I opened the driver door and climbed aboard. Once I entered the truck, I wasn’t able to get a strong first impression of Doug, since he simply receded mutely back into the sleeper.

The museum was small and airless and felt as if it hadn’t been opened for months—he told me that not many visitors asked to see it—but entirely charming. One room was devoted mostly to stromatolites. It had a fish tank with a stromatolite quietly bubbling away in it—the only one in the world in captivity, apparently. On an old TV and VCR he showed me a four-minute video, which gave a brief but concise rundown on what stromatolites were and how they were formed. Then he picked up a brick-sized fragment of old stromatolite and passed it to me and I made the appropriate expressions of surprise at how heavy it was.",

The Barcaccia fountain that it pleased him to hear under his window cannot be heard for the traffic or often seen for the crowd of idle or just weary young, spillover from the steps, packed around it eating lunch or cooling their feet. Horses and carriages must have made other pleasant sounds outside the window, though muted by mud; the piazza is such a tourist center now, and the stairs up to Trinità dei Monti had been such an elegance for quite a while then, it is odd to think of its having been left uncobbled, whether to spite the French or just because it was out of the way—not to the English though; it was their central hangout. A more practical question is how the apartment was heated. There seem to have been sunny days, while Keats was still ambulatory, to justify the great English dream of sunny Italy as the cure for all that ailed their bodies or minds, but the thought of a Roman winter as TB treatment is bound to appall anyone who has shivered through one in good health. Of course it was too late anyway; he could as well have died in Happy England among many friends instead of in a foreign place with a single one, and only Rome would have been the loser. No, Severn would have been that too, though he was half dead himself from the strain by the end.",

When I felt too weak to continue, I’d boil some rice, tuna and tomato paste and share it with Tarzoon. In the early mornings, I’d curl up on my damp bed, aching for some peaceful sleep, as Varuna lurched and thumped into brick walls of water. On deck, the spray was blinding as it flew off the crests of steep swells, mixing with the raging winds filled with sand. Sometimes visibility was good and other times, with landbound dust storms, the horizon was a burnt-yellow hue. We tacked east and west, coast to coast, through the north and southbound ships and, every so often, there would be the harrowing near miss. As the smokestacks paraded by, I saw the Russian Hammer and Sickle, the Japanese Rising Sun, and the red, gold and green colors of the African countries that we were passing to port and Arabia to starboard.",
