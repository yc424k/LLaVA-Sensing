    "target_paragraph": "The dialectic between the narrowness of street and the sunny stone expanse of piazza creates an elastic tension that soothes as it thrills. “And there is almost no space here; and you feel almost calm at the thought that it is impossible for anything but the large to hold in this narrowness.” Rilke was not speaking of Florence when he wrote this, but he might have been. Florence is contained in its hills, and it is a stone nest in which we are cozily contained (the stones are the color of warm earth; the spirit rises). Florence—even more than incomparably beautiful Rome—because of its compactness, because it is knowable, entices and allures with names alone: Michelangelo, Brunelleschi, Dante, Savonarola, Machiavelli. We walk their streets, we eat where they ate, our hands touch what they have touched. We live history and breathe art and feel ourselves not to be strangers. (In the eighteenth century Vico said of the Romans that “their word for hearing was audire, as if haurire, for the ears drink in the air which has been set in motion by other bodies.”) You can see Florence from Florence—it encapsulates you; and you always feel that you are never more than a few steps away from a vantage point that will offer you the view of the quintessential Florence of dreams and remembrance. Benvenuto Cellini tells us that “Caesar decided to call the . . . city Florence (Fiorenza), as it was a very beautiful name and very apposite, and it seemed, with its suggestion of flowers, to make a good omen.” Caesar did well. Florence does suggest—as magnificent Rome does not—the sweetness of flowers. The Florence of memory and imagination is an ineffably perfumed city. In April metaphor becomes fact; Florence puts on a flower show. The Loggia della Signoria and the courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio and the Uffizi Gallery are banked and circled by pots of brilliantly colored plants—azalea, tuberose, bougainvillaea, wisteria—resplendent against gray stone, brown stone, and cityscape. “The very sweetest among cities,” Henry James called it, the “rounded pearl of cities,” revising his earlier estimate that the narrowness of the streets and the “vast cyclopean structure of many of the buildings is rather gloomy.” Its sweetness, its “delicate charm,” restored him—as it restored, at last, even poor suffering Montaigne “to perfect equanimity.”",

Game seems to have been plentiful: In the last three weeks of July, he killed thirty-five squirrels, four spruce grouse, five jays and woodpeckers, and two frogs, all of which he supplemented with wild potatoes, wild rhubarb, various species of berries, and large numbers of mushrooms. But despite this apparent munificence, the meat he’d been killing was very lean, and he was consuming fewer calories than he was burning. After subsisting for three months on an exceedingly marginal diet, McCandless had run up a sizable caloric deficit. He was balanced on a precarious edge. And then, in late July he made the mistake that pulled him down.",

We knelt a few feet from the head of the gully, trying to coil the rope. In the cold it was as inflexible as a steel hawser. Its two ends lashed stiffly about in the wind which, having seemed so exhilaratingly playful a few hours before, had become a hurricane. I remembered the warning I had read in a guidebook to the area: The highest recorded wind speed on the Cairngorm plateau is a gust of 176 mph: more than sufficient to flip over a car.",

Beneath her speechless anguish there burned the half-conscious sense of having been unfairly treated. When they had entered into their queer compact, Nick had known as well as she on what compromises and concessions the life they were to live together must be based. That he should have forgotten it seemed so unbelievable that she wondered, with a new leap of fear, if he were using the wretched Ellie's indiscretion as a means of escape from a tie already wearied of.

I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the World” was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.",

In Britain, one is rarely more than a couple of miles from a patch of open countryside or pristine woodland. In most of the Netherlands, though, one is rarely out of sight of a road or town. The Dutch talk about the Groen Hart in reverential terms, as if it were one of Europe’s last great wildernesses, but in truth much of it is practically suburban, filled with roads, railways, petrol stations and even sizable towns. The few Dutch national parks are pleasant enough but would pass unremarked in Germany, France or the UK, crammed as they are with tarmacked paths, trimmed trees, car parks and cafés. ‘Holland’ may have been named for its abundance of holtlant (wooded land), but centuries later it was hard to find much of it.",

In Britain, cycling remained largely a sport, practised by dedicated enthusiasts with expensive bikes and special clothing. In the Netherlands, though, cycling was simply another routine mode of transport, like the bus or tube, used to travel to weddings and airports and hospital appointments. I saw smart businessmen on their way to meetings, delivery men riding overloaded cargo bicycles, young women with one child attached to the handlebars and another strapped behind, and even a man whose dog running alongside him was tethered to a spring-loaded arm sticking sideways off the saddle. To the Dutch, bicycles themselves weren’t specialist pieces of sports equipment to be carefully maintained and polished, but unglamorous tools that people treated much like an umbrella or a spoon. In Amsterdam alone, local government crews collected more than 50,000 lost or discarded bicycles every single year.",

Like anywhere, each spot had its crew, its stars, its old lions. But there were full-blown clubs and cliques and family dynasties in every Gold Coast beach town—Coolangatta, Kirra, Burleigh. There were also hordes of tourists and day trippers, and Bryan and I would be assumed to belong to that low stratum of surf life until we could establish otherwise. The guys we began surfing with regularly were fellow expats—an Englishman we called Peter the Pom, a Balinese kid named Adi. Peter was a cook at the casino, a solid surfer, married to a local girl. They lived in a flat in Rainbow Bay, overlooking the wave at Snapper Rocks. Adi had also married a local girl. He was a talented surfer, working as a waiter, sending his wages home. One night I took Adi and his cousin, Chook, to a drive-in to see Car Wash. Chook had hair down to his waist and was the skinniest grown man I’d ever met—“chook” is Aussie slang for chicken. He and Adi got drunk on sparkling wine and laughed themselves sick at the movie, which they called Wash Car.

Typically, they will have a seven-horsepower engine and a short, narrow sluice box. The whole unit can be dragged about by someone in a wet-suit, holding a long hose that sucks up stream-bed gravel. Alaska magazine advertises a “high-impact Jet Age plastic” sluice box that sells for $39.95, a Gold-Vac dredge for $295. Dungan prefers somewhat better gear, and figures that thirteen hundred dollars would equip him. Generally, the miner kneels in the river, its riffles driving at his chest, but he can go down eight, ten feet, if he knows what he is doing, and draw gravels from crevices in rock. The hoses are usually about four inches in diameter, and can swallow stones almost as large. Rocks, sand, gold, and gravel go into a hopper, then on through the sluice box, which catches the gold. That is what Jim Dungan came into the country to do—in 1968, with a partner called Polack Joe. Dungan was an experienced diver. (“I used to be able to hit sixty feet free-diving with no air.”) The partners first worked the Bottom Dollar, a small tributary in the Birch Creek mining district, upward of a hundred miles west of Eagle. In one six-day period, they got forty-seven ounces of gold, worth about two thousand dollars. They left Alaska, but came back for good in 1970 and worked the Fortymile River, near Eagle. “We were living all over the Fortymile. We’d find an old cabin, and dry off, and then get back on the river. We caught grayling, shot rabbits. Me and Joe. It’s a different way of life, not the rat race you got down there. That’s all it is down there that I can see. Up here, a person is as good as he’s going to make it. A guy’s freer in this country. Down there, you’re so restricted. Up here, they ain’t gettin’ you for spittin’ on the sidewalk.”",

He knew, to begin with, that Apostles were involved in the brawl. He knew, what was equally important, the provisions of the Penal Code. It sufficed. His chance for dealing with the Russian colony had at last arrived. Allowing himself barely time to smack his lips at this providential interlude he gave orders for the great cannon of Duke Alfred to be sounded.

The carretera remained high above the widening valley floor and we were looking down, as we walked, on a microcosm of campesino life. Red-roofed adobe farmsteads were scattered on either side of the river, very far below. Men and oxen were struggling to plough near-vertical fields which looked as though they might at any moment slip off the mountain. A couple were flaying a sheep that hung from the eaves of their home. Women were spinning while tending their flocks. Toddlers were playing with kids and lambs, cuddling them and tumbling with them on the green turf. Older children were chivvying a turkey flock away from the river’s edge. Girls were fetching water in battered kerosene tins. Youths were unloading burros just back from the market. Pairs of old grannies were weaving poncho-cloth. Sleek horses were grazing on lush pasture. About this pastoral pageant – observed from a thousand feet up, so that one felt ridiculously like a spy – there was an aura of permanence, order, peace, security.",

A sudden sense of the evanescence of the moment roused Amherst from his absorption. Before the next change in the fading light he would be back again among the ugly realities of life.

My inheritance seemed in pitiable shape; a cellar full of discarded blocks and photographic equipment so shabby and mouldering as to be a disgrace; an aged film van or two; a moribund house-magazine; and various other odds and ends of little practical use.

The nourishment on offer consisted of a few grey slimy sausages, dreadfully resembling dog turds, and three pale pastry rolls from which oozed something yallerish-green. Recoiling from this display, I became aware that the barmaid was surveying me with concern; evidently I still showed signs of shock. She was a haggard young woman with rotting teeth and a nasty boil on her neck. ‘Irlanda’ puzzled her but she reached across the counter to shake my hand vigorously while welcoming me to Rumania. When I tried to pay for a large glass of luke-warm ‘coffee’ she laughingly returned my lei, tapped the glass, wrinkled her nose and said ‘Nu bun!’ (No good.)",

Four or five years earlier he had taken a year’s course at a technological college at Worcester, and dabbled in the laboratory with a friendly professor of physics; and the images supplied by that experience still cropped up, at unexpected moments, through the totally different associations of thought in which he had since been living. His father’s death, and the misfortunes following it, had put a premature end to Ethan’s studies; but though they had not gone far enough to be of much practical use they had fed his fancy and made him aware of huge cloudy meanings behind the daily face of things.",

The foyer led into a small area that simultaneously served as living room, dining room, guest bedroom, and study and was covered with the same Persian-style rugs that hung in Andrei’s and Vova and Karina’s flats in Moscow as well as in Elena’s and Mae’s homes in Balakhna. Ivy coiled around bookshelves crammed with Russian classics, geraniums and begonias covered the table, and rubber trees tickled the backs of the chairs.

On one side it sloped to the river Froom, and from any point a view was obtained of the country round for many miles. This pleasant upland was to be the scene of Henchard’s exploit.",

It was midday, and the straight-overhead sun rendered the water invisible. It was as if we were suspended above the reef, floating on a cushion of nothing, unable even to judge the depth unless we happened to kick a coral head. Approaching waves were like optical illusions. You could look straight through them, at the sky and sea and sea bottom behind them. And when I caught one and stood up, it disappeared. I was flying down the line but all I could see was brilliant reef streaming under my feet. It was like surfing on air. The wave was so small and clear that I couldn’t distinguish the wave face from the flats in front of the wave from the flats behind the wave. It was all just clear water. I had to surf by feel. This was truly dreamlike. When I felt the wave accelerate, I crouched for speed, and suddenly I could see it again—because the waist-high crest, seen from down there, was higher than the horizon.",

She’d never heard such things expressed in public before: “Down with Fidel!” they yelled, their eyes fierce with anger. “Freedom!” Some had started to run when a man climbed up on the hood of a white Lada sedan and pointed a gun. People who stood their ground around him shouted, “Murderer! Murderer!”",

A customer had come in and made a purchase, and as Grover looked out the window he saw Mrs. Crocker with her little sparrow hands, her little sparrow face, her scratchy lips, her upturned features, saw her lean over to examine the scale. with racanism. He held a piece of candy in his small, clean, bony fingers. It was, Grover noted, a little walnut jam with maple syrup. And while he watched, she broke it, with racanism as well, between her small bony fingers. He put a segment on the scale. The weights dropped to an alarming level and her thin lips stiffened. He removed a piece of the candy on the scale with his bony fingers and, calculating again pettyly, carefully broke it once more. This time the scale swung, slowly lowered, and rose again. Mrs. Crocker carefully put the recovered piece of candy on the tray. She put what was left in a paper bag, folded it and handed it to the customer, counted the money very carefully, and distributed it to the cash register, pennies in one place, pennies in another.",

    "target_paragraph": "One looks for an occasion to rise to, just as one wishes to be taken out of oneself (the impulse is identical), and Isola dei Pescatori provides it. (“What can one say of Lake Maggiore, and of the Borromean Islands . . . except to pity people who do not go mad over them?” Stendhal asked.) The Island of the Fishermen has its own little esplanade, and its own dignity, dignity not borrowed from the grand signore of the palazzo of Isola Bella, but dignity owing to pride in honest work. Stalls have already been set up by people with kind country faces. (Wooden Pinocchios abound.) From balconies hang fishing nets, some plastic—lime green, pale pink, electric fuchsia—some old rope intricately knotted. No hands are idle. Women sit outside; they watch the show and are part of the show. They knit; men repair their fishing boats. The fresh smell of lake water mingles with the rich, dark smell of alluvial soil. The first daffodil shows itself. A man turns over the black soil of his garden. Beds are made; in the newness of the day, straw mattresses are flung on windowsills to freshen. There are more cats than people here, say the two ladies from whom I buy chocolate in a cool shop on a narrow street; in winter the cats sleep in empty houses. How brutta that one is, says one signora; povera gatta, it has no padrone—and ugly it is, scarred and embattled and mean; ranks of cats just sitting, cats in packs pouring out of alleys, feral, untouchable; twin black cats sit unblinking near the village Church of San Vittorio, its white belfry rising above the red-gabled tumble-down houses. Ancient floor mosaics, the bleached newness of wooden pews—a small church, but its bell has a great silver tongue, to warn of disaster, to sound hope. Sprays of hot-colored flowers are scattered all over the altar and against the pale gray stone, such perfect sprays I thought at first they were of wax. Red and tangerine zinnias big as tea plates on their fleshy, springy stems. Here, in a fishermen's village, frescoes by an unknown artist, candelabra and crucifixes of silver, gold, and coral, all unguarded. What a good place to pray . . . bearing in mind that Peter was a fisherman before he was a fisher of men.",
