Our traditional minds work another way – and a medicine man’s knowledge has gone from father to son, in total secrecy, hidden like an object sensitive to light. We’ve myths about knowledge being stolen, run away with as if it was a jewel! I don’t mean running away with medicine or charms, but with knowledge itself. The bush doctors’ secrets gave them such power they scared everyone, and got very rich. Those men working here have been clever enough to compromise. Diagnosis is their weakness, all guesswork when it isn’t something obvious, and they realise they can do better by collaborating with doctors who have the “magic” to get the diagnosis right. Then their cures can be more acceptable than expensive imported drugs. I’d guess this medicine man feared you were spying. We’re all afraid of that. Once our team has proved A, B and C can cure X, Y and Z it’s likely the transnational gangsters will move in. Herbal medicines, scientifically developed in Africa, by Africans, for Africans, would wreck their profits unless they took over the marketing. But in my lifetime we’ve learned a lot, we’re no longer so easily fooled by fancy packaging and mumbo-jumbo leaflets in scientific jargon. It’s a big step forward to have those teams working in the bush. Villagers seeing a modern doctor approving of herbal medicines don’t feel it’s “primitive” to use them. They can believe their own medicine is as good or better “magic” than the White man’s – and cheaper, so they don’t have to borrow, or get sicker while saving up for a cure.’",

There was the tale of the Japanese admiral who requested the French admiral to remove his gunboat from its place in the river, so as to be out of danger of gunfire and bombs. The French admiral is supposed to have agreed with the utmost alacrity. \"On one condition,\" he added.

Above the arc lamps rose shafts of darkness. Although it was close on midnight, it scarcely seemed to be night; but rather some ethereal disembodied day, for there were so many lamps in the streets; cars passing; men in white mufflers with their light overcoats open walking along the clean dry pavements, and many houses were still lit up, for everyone was giving parties. The town changed as they drew smoothly through Mayfair. The public houses were closing; here was a group clustered round a lamp-post at the corner. A drunken man was bawling out some loud song; a tipsy girl with a feather bobbing in her eyes was swaying as she clung to the lamp-post… but Kitty’s eyes alone registered what she saw. After the talk, the effort and the hurry, she could add nothing to what she saw. And they swept on quickly. Now they had turned, and the car was gliding at full speed up a long bright avenue of great shuttered shops. The streets were almost empty. The yellow station clock showed that they had five minutes to spare.",

The shepherd of each flock marched behind, a bundle containing his kit for the week strapped upon his shoulders, and in his hand his crook, which he used as the staff of his pilgrimage. Several of the sheep would get worn and lame, and occasionally a lambing occurred on the road.

There are roughly maintained trails that lead off into the forest, and I feel a sort of pressing at the back of my neck where the trees lean in. Old tools, planks and rusty fencing are knotted among mud, loose bricks, decaying leaves, crumbling cement, and puddles. It looks as if there’s been some attempt to make the place cheery—the dorm building was once decorated with bright pictures of jungle creatures, but now it’s more peeling paint and cobwebs than toucans and parrots. When I look closely, I see thousands of tiny pink eggs nestled in the grout. I give an involuntary shudder, trying not to imagine what kinds of heartbeats are gestating in those eggs. Everything smells overwhelmingly of wet earth and rotting fruit.",

The signal went from me to one of the system’s sixty-six satellites in low-earth orbit about five hundred miles above. The satellite passed the signal to another satellite, which passed it to another, and so on, until it was relayed down to the Iridium “gateway station” in Tempe, Arizona, which then sent it along regular long-distance routing to my house. In about a second and a half, our downstairs phone rang. Looking at each other through the back window, my wife and I kept our conversation brief, because rates for this kind of phone are in the $4-per-minute range.",

So they got out and he stood with the grapevine painter in his hand while the launch purred again and drew away, already curving; he did not watch it. He laid the bundle down and made the painter fast to a willow root and picked up the bundle and turned. He said no word, he mounted the levee, passing the mark, the tide-line of the old raging, dry now and lined, traversed by shallow and empty cracks like foolish and deprecatory senile grins, and entered a willow clump and removed the overalls and shirt they had given him in New Orleans and dropped them without even looking to see where they fell and opened the parcel and took out the other, the known, the desired, faded a little, stained and worn, but clean, recognisable, and put them on and returned to the skiff and took up the paddle. The woman was already in it.",

Torn-open trash bags spilled their contents on the hard-packed street snow, attracting the customary businesslike ravens. Nothing about the exterior of this establishment identified it as a hotel, but inside it was warm and clean, and laid out more like a rooming house than a hotel. Men slept in one big room, women and young children in another. Each of these rooms had five or six narrow beds. A kitchen next to the men’s sleeping room provided refrigerator, stove, and cookware. The hotel also offered one or two single bedrooms, but they had already been taken, so Sergei and I put our stuff in the men’s bedroom and claimed beds. We found nobody in there except a Yakut teenager drinking a Coke and playing a Game Boy as he sat cross-legged on his bed.",

One of these, a child of eight or nine years, called Olioll, lay upon his back looking up through the hole in the roof, through which the smoke went, and watching the stars appearing and disappearing in the smoke with mild eyes, like the eyes of a beast of the field. He turned presently to the Brother who wrote in the big book, and whose duty was to teach the children, and said, 'Brother Dove, to what are the stars fastened?' The Brother, rejoicing to see so much curiosity in the stupidest of his scholars, laid down the pen and said, 'There are nine crystalline spheres, and on the first the Moon is fastened, on the second the planet Mercury, on the third the planet Venus, on the fourth the Sun, on the fifth the planet Mars, on the sixth the planet Jupiter, on the seventh the planet Saturn; these are the wandering stars; and on the eighth are fastened the fixed stars; but the ninth sphere is a sphere of the substance on which the breath of God moved in the beginning.'",

When two hours were up, the empty tin would fall and wake them up with a bang. Nobody ever missed a shift.\n\n‘Here was the kitchen.’",

And cold too: he lay shaking faintly and steadily in it, rigid save for the shaking. This Delta, he thought: This Delta. This land which man has deswamped and denuded and derivered in two generations so that white men can own plantations and commute every night to Memphis and black men own plantations and ride in jim crow cars to Chicago to live in millionaires’ mansions on Lakeshore Drive, where white men rent farms and live like niggers and niggers crop on shares and live like animals, where cotton is planted and grows man-tall in the very cracks of the sidewalks, and usury and mortgage and bankruptcy and measureless wealth, Chinese and African and Aryan and Jew, all breed and spawn together until no man has time to say which one is which nor cares.… No wonder the ruined woods I used to know dont cry for retribution! he thought: The people who have destroyed it will accomplish its revenge.",

Apart from bunches of brilliant chiles colorados draped on roadside stalls, the color scheme was a wash of khaki and olive. Low, gnarly creosote shrubs and spiny mesquite trees dotted the parched landscape, interspersed with organ pipe cactus and the towering saguaro, its branches upraised as if in prayer.

One went to Antoine's, of course, and bought some, but to buy hair, to buy hair, when one had had such heaps of it till only a few months ago, did seem most dreadful. And it put a stop to so many things, too, once one had got something on one's head that didn't really belong. For instance, poor Dwight, the latest, and also the youngest of her adorers--for some time now they had kept on getting younger,--a Rhodes scholar fresh from Harvard, and worshipping her with transatlantic headlongness, wouldn't be able to touch it reverently any more, as she used sometimes to allow him when he had been extra sweet and patient.

I tried to imagine the conversations the monks would have had with one another about the places in which they dwelled: their discussions, implicit and explicit, about what it meant to be in affinity with the land they occupied. I admired the ways in which their spirituality found expressions and correlations in the physical world. In the view over a low-misted sea from a headland. In the fall of light upon the margin of a page, or a bay. In feathers rocking down through still air like snow, or snow rocking down through still air like feathers. Of course there were physical discomforts to their lives in these places; of course there would have been disagreements, dislikes, currents of bad feeling between the men themselves. But these ascetics had desired and celebrated an affluence which was beyond the economic, and which found its forms in the clearness of the air over the sea, or the shoaling patterns of a flock of seabirds in flight. Henry David Thoreau had written about such ideas of value. A lake, he said, a hill, a cliff, or individual rocks, ‘a forest or ancient trees standing singly’, ‘such things are beautiful, they have a high use which dollars and cents never represent.’",

Our instructions were to drive to Menindee, 110 kilometers to the east, where we would be met by a man named Steve Garland. In the event, the drive to Menindee was something of an anticlimax. The landscape was shimmering hot and gorgeously forbidding. We were gratified to see our first willy-willy, a column of rotating dust perhaps a hundred feet high, impressive but harmless, moving across the endless plains to our left. But this was as close to adventure as we got. The road was newly paved and relatively well traveled. While Trevor stopped to take pictures, I counted four cars pass. Had we broken down, we wouldn’t have been stranded more than a few minutes.",

Two hours later, the ravens were gone, the remains inherited by hooded crows. They fluttered up like butterflies to reveal clean bones, only the tiniest remnants of meat remaining, a skeletal form lying prone where earlier had been a still-warm creature.

    "target_paragraph": "Following the stories is for Ian a way of mapping the routes of the roads, and sailing the roads a way of mapping the routes of the stor-ies. He has tracked mutations of sea tales – ‘Three Knots of Wind’, ‘The Blue Men of the Minch’, the ‘Selkie’ and the ‘Fin-Men’ legends – as they have been carried about over the centuries, making their landfalls here and there, finding retellings in different accents and different places. In 2007, he helped to sail three traditional boats along routes suggested by three Gaelic songs and stories, one of which was the ‘Fraoch à Rònaigh’, a song based on the air of a pibroch whose lyrics consisted mostly of the place names of the graveyards in North Uist. It was an exile’s song, a lament that lists the places where the writer’s ancestors lie. To Ian, traditional stories, like traditional songs, are closely kindred to the traditional seaways, in that they are highly contingent and yet broadly repeatable. ‘A song is different every time it’s sung,’ he told me, ‘and variations of wind, tide, vessel and crew mean that no voyage along a sea route will ever be the same.’ Each sea route, planned in the mind, exists first as anticipation, then as dissolving wake and then finally as logbook data. Each is ‘affected by isobars, // the stationing of satellites, recorded ephemera / hands on helms’. I liked that idea; it reminded me both of the Aboriginal Songlines, and of Thomas’s vision of path as story, with each new walker adding a new note or plot-line to the way.",

She’d like the porcelain sink, big enough to bathe a baby in, its drain board and the curved chrome faucet. I imagine her with a pointed chin and shiny black eyes, her hair swept up and twisted in a comb. She’s in sturdy shoes that tie and a black dress with the sleeves pushed up, ready to roll out the ravioli. She’d be ecstatic, no doubt, to see appliances—the dishwasher, stove, and frost-free fridge (still a novelty in Tuscany), but otherwise, she’d feel quite at home. In my next life, when I am an architect, I always will design houses with kitchens that open to the outdoors. I love stepping out to head and tail my beans while sitting on the stone wall. I set dirty pots out to soak, dry my dishcloths on the wall, empty excess clean water on the arugula, thyme, and rosemary right outside the door. Since the double door is open day and night in summer, the kitchen fills with light and air. A wasp—is it the same one?—flies in every day and drinks from the faucet, then flies right out.",

    "target_paragraph": "An even closer coincidence between medium and message can be found in the ‘scholar’s rocks’ which became popular in the T’ang and Sung dynasties of China. Seven centuries before Romanticism revolutionized Western perceptions of mountains and wilderness, Chinese and Japanese artists were celebrating the spiritual qualities of wild landscape. Kuo Hsi, a celebrated eleventh-century Chinese painter and essayist, proposed in his Essay on Landscape Painting that wild landscapes ‘nourished a man’s nature’. ‘The din of the dusty world,’ he wrote, ‘and the locked-in-ness of human habitations are what human nature habitually abhors; while, on the contrary, haze, mist and the haunting spirits of the mountains are what human nature seeks.’ This venerable Eastern esteem for wilderness explains the popularity of scholar’s rocks, single stones which have been carved into intricate, dynamic shapes by the powers of water, wind and frost. They were harvested from caves, river-beds and mountainsides, and mounted on small wooden pedestals. The stones – which scholars kept on their desks or in their studies, much as we might now keep a paperweight – were valued for how they expressed the history and the forces of their making. Each detail on a rock’s surface, each groove or notch or air-bubble or ridge or perforation, was eloquent of aeons. Each rock was a tiny, hand-held cosmos. Scholar’s rocks were not metaphors for a landscape, they were landscapes.",

Here the contrast button was set to high. Overnight rain had washed the scenery clean and now the grass gleamed beneath a Riviera-blue sky and bundles of blossom throbbed with colour. As fast as the train left one town, it came upon another until it began to squeeze through the tightest of passages, pushing by the backs of homes as children grimaced on doorsteps, their mothers oiling their hair. Men in vests read the morning papers and women aired laundry, ignoring the voyeurs peering over their walls. Hooting and clanging, the train curved around a row of houses coloured like jelly beans, below which sat an amputee on the edge of the track selling fruit in twists of paper. He waved up at the windows as the train thundered past, inches from his face. For all the talk of the new India, the old is never far away.",

We hoped for their deliverance and prosperity. But there is a wide difference between this and accepting such a nation in our country ruling over us and disposing of our affairs … We expect that a power like Great Britain well known for justice and progress will put a stop to the Zionists’ cry … In conclusion, we Muslims and Christians desire to live with our brothers, the Jews of Palestine, in peace and happiness and with equal rights.
