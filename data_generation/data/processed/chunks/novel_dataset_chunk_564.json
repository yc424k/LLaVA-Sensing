    "target_paragraph": "In retrospect, the Mariel exodus is easily explained. A decade of increasing prosperity ended abruptly when plant diseases and bad weather wrecked the 1979 cane and tobacco crops. Belts had to be tightened while suspicions grew that too many Cuban pesos were being spent on Central American interventions. Also, the island had recently been exposed to a different way of life. In November 1978 Fidel decided, for multiple reasons, to allow Cuban-American families to visit their relatives (a freedom later limited by Washington) and restrictions on Cubans travelling abroad were eased, though never abolished. More than one hundred thousand Cuban-Americans flew into José Martí airport in 1979, injecting millions of dollars into the Cuban economy. They bore gifts of consumer durables, and circulated US magazines aglow with seductive advertisements, and showed photographs of their sleek new cars, parked outside brightly-painted homes surrounded by shiny swings and slides. Not all those photographs were genuine but that didn’t lessen their unsettling effect.",

Then she sat down on a heap of stones by the wayside to think. There she remained long. The dark rotundity of the earth eclipsed the foreshores and promontories of coppery cloud which bounded some green and pellucid expanses in the western sky. Amaranthine glosses came over them then, and the unresting world wheeled her round to a contrasting prospect eastward, in the shape of indecisive and palpitating stars. She gazed upon their silent throes amid the shades of space, but realized none at all. Her troubled spirit was far away with Troy.",

It was rich enough in 1973, but now ? golly. Even prosperous Flanders paled beside this. Here, almost every store looked rich and busy and was full of stylish and expensive goods like Mont Blanc pens and Audemars Piguet watches. Even the stores selling mundane items were riveting ? J. von der Driesel, for instance, a stockist of kitchenware and other household goods at the top of a hill near the old market square. Its large windows displayed nothing more exciting than ironing boards, laundry baskets and pots and pans, but every pan gleamed, every piece of plastic shone. A little further on I passed not one but two shops selling coffins, which seemed a bit chillingly Germanic to me, but even they looked sleek and inviting and I found myself staring in admiration at the quality of the linings and the shine on the handles.",

It’s a pleasant and gentle stroll from the city centre and Østre Anlaeg is the best park in the city, in my experience (which is short but in this case attentive), for seeing secretaries sunning their breasts, but even without these huge and novel inducements it is worth seeking out because it is such a terrific and little-visited museum. It contains 884 paintings, assembled over forty years by one man, almost all of them from the nineteenth-century Skagen school of Danish painting, and all packed densely into twenty or so mostly small rooms. The paintings are all concerned with simple themes ? summer landscapes, friends enjoying a casual dinner, a view of the sea from an open window, a woman at a sink ? but the effect is simply enchanting, and you come away feeling as if you have spent the afternoon in some kind of marvellous and refreshing ionizer.",

He appears to enjoy the position of a hereditary khan, and may perhaps be the last representative of those numerous independent rulers who flourished between the Oxus and the Hindu Kush till eighty years ago, when the Emir Dost Mohammad incorporated their dominions in the Afghan state. His son, who has the face of a Spanish nobleman and is dressed in top-boots, a shooting suit, trench coat, stiff white collar, and turban cocked over one eye, certainly does the honours with the air of a Crown Prince.

Being a maritime people they also used nautical terms in distinctive ways. For instance, “scud,” meaning to run before a gale with a small amount of sail, was employed for land-based movements, so that an Ocracoker might invite you to go for a scud in his car. Finally, just to make the bewilderment of outsiders complete, they absorbed a number of non-English words, like “pizer” (apparently from the Italian “piazza”) for a porch, and pronounced the lot in a way that brought to mind Ringo Starr doing a Dorset accent. It was, in short, an interesting dialect.",

She had been “after him” for the last two years, she hadn’t a rag of reputation to lose, and would jump at the idea of a few jolly weeks with a man like Heuston, even if he got away from her afterward. But he wouldn’t—of course he never would! Poor Stan—Cleo Merrick’s noise, her cheek, her vulgarity: how warm and life-giving they would seem as a change from the frigidarium he called home! She would hold him by her very cheapness: her recklessness would seem like generosity, her glitter like heat. Ah—how Nona could have shown him the difference! She shut her eyes and felt his lips on her lids; and her lids became lips. Wherever he touched her, a mouth blossomed . . . Did he know that? Had he never guessed?",

Thomas Cook have not utterly destroyed what was left of it. . . . I suppose, of course,” he went on with a slight choke, “that you’ll do all the things your compatriots usually do—sit twelve hours a day among the literati at Le Dôme, or on the terrace of the Café de la Paix, and come back at the end of your year having seen nothing of Paris, nothing of the French, nothing of the real life of the people, utterly, thoroughly convinced that you know all!” He laughed furiously, and said: “Really, it’s most amusing, isn’t it, the way all you young Americans nowadays flock to Paris? . . . Here you are—young people presumably of some intelligence, and, at any rate, of sufficient means to allow you to travel—and where do you go?” sneered Mr. Malone. “Paris!”—he snarled the word out as if the stench of it disgusted him—“Pa-a-ris, one of the dullest, dreariest, most expensive, noisiest, and most uncomfortable cities in the world . . . inhabited by a race of penny-pinching shopkeepers, cheating taxi-drivers and waiters, the simply appalling French middle class, and the excursions of Cook’s tourists.”",

They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\nTHE CALLS: Wait, my love, and I’ll be with you.\nTHE ANSWERS: Round behind the stable.\n(A deafmute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus’ dance. A chain of children’s hands imprisons him.)\nTHE CHILDREN: Kithogue! Salute.\nTHE IDIOT: (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles) Grhahute!\nTHE CHILDREN: Where’s the great light?\nTHE IDIOT: (Gobbing) Ghaghahest.\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pigmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbishtip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy grips with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey’s voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\nCISSY CAFFREY:\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly.\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.",

She had come to this dreadful place because she knew of no other way of making sure that she was not mistaken about her state; and the woman had taken her for a miserable creature like Julia….

This path was so rough that I urged Jock to go ahead and choose his own way, since my stumbling progress was making things more difficult for him, and on rejoining the main track he stood meekly waiting for me to catch up. All day his behaviour was angelic, apart from one slight aberration when he suddenly lay down beside a shallow river and attempted to roll in the fine sand; but the moment I tugged at the halter – exclaiming ‘Jock!’ in a horrified tone – he scrambled to his feet and consoled himself with a long drink. This docility was especially encouraging because I had by then removed the bit, which was obviously causing him great discomfort. At our next rest-halt I experimented further by letting him graze loose, and as a reward for my increasing trust he didn’t withdraw even a step when I went to catch him.",

As if he were a tourism veteran, he soon tired of the front of camp and only came to the back, where the staff lived and worked. He would raid the kitchen at will, arriving just after dusk. We had spent considerable time and energy hyena-proofing the kitchen building, which was a flimsy structure of canvas and eucalyptus poles. Thorny branches surrounded the building to a height and depth that normal animals couldn’t penetrate. The badger just put his head down and, seemingly oblivious to the pin-sharp and inch-long acacia thorns, plowed in, slashed an entrance through the canvas, walked straight to the garbage bin, hooked his back legs over its rim, and bungee-jumped in. At first the native staff would squeal and climb onto the benches, but soon they grew used to Badge, as we named him, and carried on with their business, stepping around him as they needed to.",

I squatted on the wet ground, in a litter of paper and wrappings and cigarette packets, beside a grimy skull-capped Kashmiri Muslim who was guarding the shoes of the Hindu devout at four annas a pair. He was doing good business. Slowly Aziz progressed. Now, at the gates, he was squeezed out of the crowd, like a pip out of an orange: fur cap, bewildered but determined face, Ali Mohammed’s striped blue jacket, hands clawing at the rails. Somehow, hands working, unseen legs no doubt also working, he managed to be squeezed through the narrow opening of the gate, and then disappeared, fur cap and all, once again.",

Pleasure is increased by sharing it. Does the same hold good of pain? she mused. Is that the reason why we all talk so much of ill-health – because sharing things lessens things? Give pain, give pleasure an outer body, and by increasing the surface diminish them… But the thought slipped. He was off telling his old stories. Gently, methodically, like a man setting in motion some still serviceable but rather weary nag, he was off remembering old days, old dogs, old memories that slowly shaped themselves, as he warmed, into little figures of country house life. She fancied as she half listened that she was looking at a faded snapshot of cricketers; of shooting parties on the many steps of some country mansion.",

Her great natural beauty was at last rendered full justice by her attire. She was loosely wrapped in a rich cashmere dressing-gown of gray-white, embroidered in half-mourning tints, and she wore slippers of the same hue. Her neck rose out of a frill of down, and her well-known cable of dark-brown hair was partially coiled up in a mass at the back of her head and partly hanging on her shoulder – the evident result of haste.",
