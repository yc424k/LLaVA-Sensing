It was well hidden at the bottom of a steep driveway, around a corner, and behind a grove of bushes. The hotel looked fine, but it lacked the fanfare or security of Mena House and the Hilton. Those hotels had heavy steel gates and bomb-sniffing dogs. The Novotel had two traffic cones, and they were small. A security guard smiled and pointed at his X-ray machine. I’m sure he was an absolute gentleman, but if terrorists attacked the hotel, which happens all too often, he would offer little deterrence. The desk clerk was very busy. He handled several calls while he sorted our reservation and passports. He was fluent in Arabic, English, French, and German, he proudly announced to us in Arabic, English, French, and German. He directed us to the elevator and explained the building’s unusual layout. The hotel lobby was on the ground floor, and the next few floors housed private office space, so even though our room was on the fourth floor of the hotel, it was actually on the eighth floor of the building. Our room had a great view of the Cairo Tower and its loudspeakers.",

From there they caused giant wooded mountains to come thundering down on to the enemy, crushing them and crashing into them and causing terror in their ranks. The earth shook from the pounding. The god Nara made the sky dark with his arrows that had golden tips. Pressed mightily by the gods, the demons finally were forced to flee into the sea or to dig into the ground.",

In the 1930s, stationed in Egypt, he led expeditions into the sand seas of Libya, and became fascinated by the abstract beauty of that arid world. Above all, he was interested in the migrations of the Libyan dunes - their slow martial processes of advance and retreat. To Bagnold, the dunes seemed to possess the wilful unpredictability of living beings. He loved, too, the eerie song of the dunes, made when wind played in a certain way on the sand slopes. This song had haunted his Libyan evenings; at times the dunes would emit a low-pitched sound so penetrating that normal speech could be heard only with difficulty. As he travelled more between deserts, he began to catalogue the different songs of the sand: the high keening of the slipfaces of the Libyan sword dunes, and the ‘white roaring’ of the Kalahari sands.",

No overhead lights were on, making it hard for them to see. Boxes were stacked haphazardly, and there were no signs to show where things might be located. Cary asked a man sitting at the entrance where to find fans. “What kind of fan?” he said, showing no interest. She said she was thinking of a stand-up fan.",

They wrote of the cool mist that settled into valleys at dawn, of bamboo groves into which green light fell, and of how thousands of snowy egrets would take off from lakes like lifting blizzards. They observed the way winter light fell upon drifted snow, and how shadows hung from cold branches, and wrote that such sights moved them to a ‘bright clear joy’. Night was especially marvellous to them, because of the clean luminous presence of the moon, and its ability to silver the world into strangeness. Beauty did not always connote benignity: Li Po so loved the moon, it is said, that he drowned while trying to embrace its reflection in a river. Nevertheless, reading the poems and viewing the paintings of the shan-shui tradition, you encounter an art in which almost no divide exists between nature and the human. Form imposes itself on content so absolutely that these artefacts do not represent the world’s marvels, but partake of them.",

The sand had dampened with cold and the air had turned sharp and icy. Clutching bowls of curry with near-gangrenous fingertips, I was thankful that it was so steeped with chillies, as the slightest increase in body temperature, even if it made my nose run into the bowl, was an improvement. Using the roti to warm my palms, I began to nudge the bits of meat to one side. It was marginally less stretchy than bubble gum and even in the dark, I could sense that it was grey. Sporadic tufts of hair found their way into my mouth, which I quietly spat out and then disposed of with hard but discreet throws into the darkness, flinging the fatty lumps across the sand. As I licked my fingers, Ali began to scream. He ran around in a circle, pointing at the shack, claiming that he had seen a snake track curling its way across the sand. His discovery triggered yelling and pot banging, generating enough drama for the other two musketeers to join him in running around, waving flames through the darkness. This was, presumably, included in the trek’s cost as after-dinner entertainment.",

Then his spirit flamed beyond the hills, beyond lost time and sorrow, to his father and his father’s earth; and when he thought of him his heart grew warm, the hot blood thudded in his veins, he leapt all barriers of the here and now, and northward, gleaming brightly there beyond the hills, he saw a vision of the golden future in new lands.",

A doorman pays his taxi for him, and nobody asks how long he will be staying. The final benefit, for a writer, is that “I have only to open the window, and the world steps in”.",

Fitzpiers, guessing nothing of the revelations in the wood, considered that Grace ought to have let him know her plans more accurately before leaving home in a freak like this. He went desultorily to the window, the blind of which had not been pulled down, and looked out at the thin, fast-sinking moon, and at the stalk of smoke rising from the top of Suke Damson’s chimney, signifying that the young woman had just lit her fire to prepare supper. He became conscious of a discussion in progress on the opposite side of the court. Somebody had looked over the wall to talk to the sawyers, and was telling them in a loud voice news in which the name of Mrs. Charmond soon arrested his ears.",

For while I sat the night through in the darkened rooms of German friends, behind the bolted doors and shuttered windows--while their whispered voices spoke to me of the anguish in their hearts, and I listened, stricken in my chair to see the tears and the graven lines of mortal sorrow form on faces which only a short time before, in the presence of others, had been masked in expressions of carefree unconcern--while I heard and saw these things my heart was torn asunder, and from its opened depths came forth into my consciousness a knowledge that I had not fully known was there. For then it was, most curiously, that all the grey weather of unrecorded days in Brooklyn, which had soaked through into my soul, came flooding back upon me. Came back, too, the memory of my exploration of the jungle trails of night. I saw again the haggard faces of the homeless men, the wanderers, the disinherited of America, the aged workers who had worked and now could work no more, the callow boys who had never worked and now could find no work to do, and who, both together, had been cast loose by a society that had no need of them and left to shift in any way they could--to find their food in garbage cans, to seek for warmth and fellowship in foul latrines like the one near New York's City Hall, to sleep wrapped up in old newspapers on the concrete floors of subway corridors.",

The cloister is divided by box hedges into four quadrangular plots of land in which grow irises and tulips and palm trees and white and yellow dandelions and pink and blue wandering flowers. . . . How sweet, these enclosures within an enclosed opening: open/close, close/open; a cypress punctuates each of four corners. A loggia—pots of yellow flowers and geraniums—looks out over a central cistern; the scent of lilacs is pervasive, the lilacs swarm with bees. The fragrance of lilacs mingles with the fragrance of woodsmoke. I walk beneath a tree the leaves of which are the color of China tea; a cobweb brushes across my forehead. A jet plane streaks across the fragrance of lilacs; an orange-and-black cat mews piteously in the garden.",

The village of Paul do Mar was long, narrow, dusty, and semi-industrial—nothing like the dense tile-roofed hamlet of Jardim up on its sparkling headland. Paul stank, for a start. At the east end of town, by the wharf, it had a strong fish smell. To the west, where the surf was, the stench was lavatorial—people used the shoreline rocks as an open-air toilet. There was primitive worker housing strung along the sea-facing road. Dirty, half-naked children jeered at strange cars. On certain afternoons, roughly half the adults in Paul do Mar seemed to be falling-down drunk. People in Paul, I eventually learned, considered the people in Jardim snobs. Jardimeiros considered Paulinhos riffraff. The two villages faced each other across a mile of sea, with a mountain between them and no other settlements in sight. Their rivalry went back centuries. I got to like them both.",

So now the donkeymen suggested ferrying their animals first, to reassure and lure Jock. But this stratagem also failed. Then at last the poor devil was so tormented that he plunged despairingly in – and, following the men’s advice, I rushed after him, seized the halter and swam beside him. When he broke away my efforts to head him off from the shore merely revealed the interesting fact that a mule swims faster than I do. Twice this happened, but the third time I quickly wound the halter round my shoulder and kept so close to him that I was in no danger of being kicked. Now another return to shore meant towing me, so he decided that crossing the river was the lesser of two evils and followed meekly – at which point even the sullen boatmen raised a cheer. Half-way across I noticed that the panic had gone from his eyes and when we scrambled on to the opposite shore he was looking faintly surprised. Probably he had just realised that swimming a cool river on a hot day can be quite pleasant.",

Dawa and the rest, says he, will no doubt turn up shortly, as indeed they do, with Chiring Lamo crying. While arranging for roof, firewood, and water, Tukten makes a place for me at the family hearth of Infected Eye, where I witness cooking rites so simple and certain in their movements that I sit marveling upon my goat skin, scarcely breathing. The cooking is done by the woman in black rags while Infected Eye lies glowering against the wall; the slow deft handling of burning twigs as tsampa and dried pumpkin squash are cooked on a brazier, the breadmaking, the murmuring, the love and food extended to the children without waste words or motion, the tenderness toward the sick husband—all has the pace and dignity of sacrament. Earlier, to impress his fellow villagers, Infected Eye had shouted senselessly at his woman, hurling my rupee note into her face; here by his hearth, where no one can be fooled, he is soft-spoken, humble, full of pain, and this good woman and his children tuck him up against the earthen wall in blankets, laying the infant in beside him. Under the black rags, filth, and brassy earrings of the valleys, she is young: I had thought her a crone. Now she eats the children’s leavings—and that only—and sighs and yawns and spreads herself a mat beside her husband. Remarkably, all this takes place as if my own big unfamiliar presence were not there, though I sit here like a Buddha by the hearth. For some time, I have been utterly still, and the children look right through me; it is very strange. Perhaps I have grown invisible at last.",

I got back to the ryokan at midnight to find that the woman had left a pile of comic books by my pillow – Comics for Men and Comics for Ecstasy. In Comics for Ecstasy naked women were having their breasts sliced off with garden shears, being torn apart by bulls, and rammed with red hot irons. In Comics for Men they were only being bound and raped. I lay awake for a long time, not really ecstatic, looking at the moonlight on the corrugated roofs.",

These are conducted as follows: heavily armed with rifles and swords they force their way into a nomad’s tent and insist on hospitable entertainment on the most lavish scale available. The nomad in terror brings out everything he has. The Khampas fill their bellies and their pockets and taking a few cattle with them, for good measure, disappear into the wide-open spaces. They repeat the performance at another tent every day till the whole region has been skinned. Then they move their headquarters and begin again somewhere else. The nomads, who have no arms, resign themselves to their fate, and the Government is powerless to protect them in these remote regions. However, if once in a way a district officer gets the better of these footpads in a skirmish, he is not the loser by it for he has a right to all the booty. Savage punishment is meted out to the evildoers, who normally have their arms hacked off. But this does not cure the Khampas of their lawlessness. Stories were told of the cruelty with which they sometimes put their victims to death. They go so far as to slaughter pilgrims and wandering monks and nuns. A disturbing conversation for us! What would we not have given to be able to buy our host’s Mannlicher! But we had no money and not even the most primitive weapons. The tent-poles we carried did not impress even the sheep-dogs.",

They had made it almost to the bottom of the island, circumnavigating the coastline for some fifty or sixty miles. When they got inside and tried to fire the tea boiler, it was leaking, and Bartlett discovered a small hole in the bottom. He sat and thought about how to fix it, and then it came to him: biscuits! Once, when he was a boy out berry picking with Grandmother Bartlett, the iron boiler they were using to cook their dinner cracked and was leaking water. Grandmother Bartlett soaked a few pounds of biscuit in water and mixed it up like cement, then plastered the wetted biscuit over the crack, sealing it tight. It worked. So now he dug into his bags and found some biscuit and chewed it until it was moist and pasty, then plastered it over the hole in the boiler, pressing it down flat with his thumb. In a few minutes, he and Kataktovik were sipping hot tea with sugar.",

Suddenly Campton noticed that the young man’s face, which had been too flushed, grew pale; but he continued to smile, and his eyes to move responsively from one illuminated face to the other. Campton, seeing that the others meant to linger, presently rose and slipping out quietly walked across the Rue de Rivoli to the deserted terrace of the Tuileries. There he sat for a long time, looking out on the vast glittering spaces of the Place de la Concorde, and calling up, with his painter’s faculty of vivid and precise visualization, a future vision of interminable lines of brown battalions marching past.",

No one ever saw us hopping up and down the walks, or galloping madly through the grass after dragon-flies. When we do want change of air, we send for the gardener, and he carries us to another bed. This is dignified, and as it should be. But birds and lizards have no sense of repose, and indeed birds have not even a permanent address. They are mere vagrants like the gipsies, and should be treated in exactly the same manner.' So they put their noses in the air, and looked very haughty, and were quite delighted when after some time they saw the little Dwarf scramble up from the grass, and make his way across the terrace to the palace.",

(Of course this also applies in the Pakistani Punjab, where unfortunate Pathan immigrants, like Farhat, simply can’t touch the regional dishes and have to prepare their own food.) I find it quite impossible to swallow the average meal here – though today I was ravenous and tried hard – because of the acute burning pain in my mouth and throat, however much cold water I drink between swallows.

Everything in Nanking closed at midnight, and so I wasn't surprised that the lights were all out, and we laughed heartily at a sign in the room: \"Visitors are warned that air raids are expected at any time; please keep lights off and shutters closed.\" I said, \"Lord, these diplomats get scared, don't they?\" We talked about the tiresome trip—we felt very ill-used—and gave Sweetie Pie a swim in the bathtub, and Navy invited us to lunch next day on his gunboat and left. Mary tried to call her friend, but couldn't get him. It seemed he had gone to Shanghai.",

Two years later it was bought by a descendant of Sir Walter Scott and developed into a ten-room bungalow, in a row of twenty such structures built along the seafront so British merchants could enjoy grand views and cooling breezes. In 1870, it fell into the hands of an Arab merchant and landowner, Syed Mohammed bin Ahmed Alsagoff, and in 1883 it became a boarding house for the city’s distinguished school for boys, the Raffles Institution.",

Toenails painted, yes, small shoulders, yes, but see—the ragged nails, tendons rigid on forearms, the calloused feet? Though nothing had changed, suddenly, I felt known. It’s because I can be quick to judge that I savor such upending of expectation. I relish the surprise—She’s a laborer?—because I also need constant reminding to look closer. The Euro tourist is a fly fisherman. That lady in the Nebraska RV loves Proust.

Between us is this line. But now, how comfortable, how reassuring to feel that alien presence removed, that scrutiny darkened and hooded over! How grateful to draw the blinds, and admit no other presence; to feel returning from the dark corners in which they took refuge, those shabby inmates, those familiars, whom, with his superior force, he drove into hiding. The mocking, the observant spirits who, even in the crisis and stab of the moment, watched on my behalf now come flocking home again. With their addition, I am Bernard; I am Byron; I am this, that and the other. They darken the air and enrich me, as of old, with their antics, their comments, and cloud the fine simplicity of my moment of emotion. For I am more selves than Neville thinks. We are not simple as our friends would have us to meet their needs. Yet love is simple.",

Of these only a rare few are too hot or too briny or too poisonous to support life – the great majority of them swarm with living things. Here you will see the rushes and willows and cottonwoods, and four-winged dragonflies in green, blue, scarlet and gold, and schools of minnows in the water, moving from sunlight to shadow and back again. At night the mammals come – deer, bobcat, cougar, coyote, fox, jackrabbit, bighorn sheep, wild horse and feral burro – each in his turn and in unvarying order, under the declaration of a truce. They come to drink, not to kill or be killed.",
