I explained this to the social security man when he came back on the line. He had, after all, just called me Bill, so I had reason to hope that we might get somewhere.",

It’s a fun place to stay with my local knowledge contribution being that no one should miss Cocoa Mountain. I visit the shop, many times since it is fifty paces from the bunkhouse. It has everything, including wine in little bottles, a size I adore and which keep me sober. I call and ask about the ferry ride to Cape Wrath, and it starts to sound like the boat to St Kilda. Can’t go. Too windy. Tide too low. So, I console myself by riding out to Balnakeil Craft Village, looking at half of the forty craft studios, having another hot chocolate, and finding Phil the Masseuse. As I enter Phil’s I reflect on what has become of me. Phil is fully studded and tattooed. He looks like a biker. I can’t see any credentials beyond the self-produced business card that says he is a masseuse. I don’t care. Who am I to contradict? I lie buck naked on his table and let him have his way with me.",

What people had shed and left—a pair of shoes, a shooting cap, some faded skirts and coats in wardrobes—those alone kept the human shape and in the emptiness indicated how once they were filled and animated; how once hands were busy with hooks and buttons; how once the looking-glass had held a face; had held a world hollowed out in which a figure turned, a hand flashed, the door opened, in came children rushing and tumbling; and went out again. Now, day after day, light turned, like a flower reflected in water, its clear image on the wall opposite. Only the shadows of the trees, flourishing in the wind, made obeisance on the wall, and for a moment darkened the pool in which light reflected itself; or birds, flying, made a soft spot flutter slowly across the bedroom floor.",

We quicken our pace and he limps behind us trailing a stump where his foot once was; a slipper around the raw flesh slaps against the pavement and he groans as it hits. Somehow he gains ground. We quicken our pace again. I look back at the sounds of the slap, stumble and groan—he has stumps for arms, one eye is falling out and he has no tongue. I mutter, “I feel like I’m in Michael Jackson’s Thriller film clip.” Matt recalls the Monty Python scene where the legless, armless knight keeps pushing for a fight. Suddenly we all start laughing. It sounds cruel and crass, and it is, but we are not laughing with joy, we are all cried out and nothing seems real. Within seconds Rebecca stops. She yells “fuuuuuuuck” at the world and the beggar and at us. She wheels, turns and tries to give the man some money. He has no hands so she shoves it in his pocket.",

In Chicago, during the Lindbergh parade armed gunmen strolled into a jewelry store on State Street and casually robbed it of $85,000 in cash and goods. Now came the dismaying news that souvenir hunters had broken into Lindbergh’s family home in Little Falls, unoccupied since C. A. Lindbergh’s death, and taken books, photographs, and other irreplaceable personal items. Perhaps for this reason, Lindbergh wore a look of grim resolve for much of his visit to his hometown, though it may have been simple exhaustion. In any case, he listened politely but without emotion as six long-winded speakers, including the Swedish consul in Minneapolis, heaped praise on him before he returned to his plane and with a look of clear relief took off for Fargo and points west. His trip was barely one-third over. Little wonder he looked dazed.",

He turned and rushed back towards the cage; but finding the gate barred, he skittered off towards the nearest group of spectators, hotly pursued by his enemy. At the edge of the ring the cock took off, flying up amid a shower of feathers into the lower branches of a nearby tree. There he remained, shrieking ‘Ti-lo!’, his chest heaving up and down in fright. The rival male, meanwhile, strutted around the deserted lady partridge in ill-disguised triumph. The hen averted her head.",

Across the street, red flags flutter from the local Communist headquarters, a storefront next to a pasta shop. On the corner is a three-story building, its discreet sign—HOTEL—designating a brothel. (I have learned to watch cabdrivers’ faces when I give them Bethany's street address. They know the hotel. Sometimes they smile; sometimes they smirk; sometimes they look bewildered; always they shrug.) Bethany and Giancarlo have painted their house according to city color specifications; gray and sooty-yellow houses line the street. With its coat of fresh yellow paint, the house is sweet and pretty; in its high-tech kitchen, designed by Giancarlo, we have a light lunch of mild cabbage soup, cold chicken cutlets, cheeses, and scotch. . . . We are going to the supermarket, Esselunga.",

From time to time he glanced toward Berkeley waiting there in suave dark-red reputability, an open book lying suggestively on his cushions. And then he found that his circuit of the floor was bringing him each time nearer to Hume. There was something about Hume that was strangely and inexpressibly different. The diaphanous form still seemed hovering near, and had Horace sat there he would have felt as if he were sitting on a lady's lap. And though Horace couldn't have named the quality of difference, there was such a quality—quite intangible to the speculative mind, but real, nevertheless. Hume was radiating something that in all the two hundred years of his influence he had never radiated before.",

The ground is grassed over here and glinting with golden wildflowersbird’s-foot trefoil, buttercup, silverweed, coltsfootwhile along the cliff’s edge the sea thrift is dying back: once cotton-candy pink, its outer stems are now fading and gray.

His climbers will establish a series of ascending camps: Camp III will be just below the North Col – where Mallory had spent such an uncomfortable night – and Camp IV on the col itself. The hope is that this will provide the support network needed for a strike on the summit itself. The weather doesn’t get any warmer, but three camps are successfully pitched up the valley, and then on 13 May, Mallory helps to establish a route from Camp III up to the North Col itself. For long sections he has to cut steps into the steep blue glittering ice. Swing, crash, step, swing, crash, step. An exhausting rhythm at sea-level; shattering up here. Shards of ice fly dangerously with each blow of the axe, like shrapnel. After a while Mallory moves across to the left of the col, and discovers that there is thick, stable snow, which makes the going much easier. In a single day he manages to fix 400 feet of rope to help those coming up afterwards. He also reaches the North Col. The wind is not as bad as the year before, and he makes his way over the dangerously broken ground of the crevassed north ridge, through the broken cubes of blue ice, and reaches safe ground near where the ridge begins. The view south opens out with every step he takes, and he sits down to look at it in awe: ‘the most amazing spectacle I have ever seen’. Camp IV is set at the North Col.",

By distributing a small amount of cash to the drivers immediately in front of and behind us, he held our place for tomorrow. Then he backed out of the queue, sped away from Chernyshevsk, and found us a place to camp beside a quiet and clear and relatively untrashed stream a few miles outside town. I was so grateful for this smart move that I put aside any beef I had against Sergei. We set up the tents, ate supper by lantern light, and turned in for a good sleep. In the morning I took out my fly rod and caught a couple of little fish in the stream. Volodya made breakfast, then drove to Chernyshevsk to monitor what was going on. He returned in haste, saying the train was about to leave and we must get back there begom—“at a run.”",

The jeep looked no less terrifying going up a stretch of track 800 feet above the Indus on a surface that was literally loose slabs of blasted rock. All the passengers had to get out and walk up, otherwise even a jeep couldn’t make this gradient.

I’d have liked to know how the house had come to be in such a parlous and neglected state, but there was no one around its brooding eminence and there were no cars in the parking lot. I followed some rickety wooden steps down to the beach. The rain had stopped in the night, but the sky was threatening and there was a stiff breeze that made my hair and clothes boogie and had the sea in a frenzy of froth. I couldn’t hear anything but the pounding of waves. Leaning steeply into the wind, I trudged along the beach in the posture of someone shouldering a car up a hill, passing in front of a long crescent of beach huts, all of identical design but painted in varying bright hues. Most were shut up for the winter, but about three quarters of the way along one stood open, rather in the manner of a magician’s box, with a little porch on which sat a man and a woman in garden chairs, huddled in arctic clothing with lap blankets, buffeted by wind that seemed constantly to threaten to tip them over backward. The man was trying to read a newspaper, but the wind kept wrapping it around his face.",

He was attempting to take charge of the pony he had abandoned two days before; there was nothing to stop him, but at every shout from Aziz he behaved like a man who was being restrained by physical force. Vengeance was now Aziz’s; this was the moment he had been waiting for; and his anger and contempt were frightening, except perhaps to another Kashmiri. For all its passion, in fact, the exchange had something of play. The ghora-wallah pleaded, but he seemed untouched by Aziz’s abuse. He wept. Aziz, astride his shabby little pony, his socked, sandalled feet hanging very low, refused to be mollified. Suddenly, no longer weeping, the ghora-wallah ran to the abandoned pony and made as if to seize the reins. Aziz screamed; the ghora-wallah stopped short, as though he had been surprised in a furtive act and struck a heavy blow on the head. Finally he ceased to weep or plead; he blustered; he became abusive; and Aziz replied. He hung back; he ran forward; he hung back again. Then he didn’t run forward, and gradually dwindled in the distance, a still, standing figure occasionally roused to frenzy, shaking a fist against the Himalayan skyline.",

The lineup, when it came into view, was an unexpectedly spacious field, quite uncluttered, at least during a lull, with a small clump of guys out at sea and another, smaller clump of guys maybe two hundred yards farther up the point. The near clump was gathered to ride the Makaha Bowl—an enormous end-section that was constantly featured in the mags and surf movies of my youth. The far clump was for Makaha Point, a rarely photographed wave. The two spots are connected, on big days, by an extremely long, hard-breaking wall that is rarely, if ever, makable all the way across. The Bowl lost its cachet long ago to hollower big waves that break closer to shore. The Point retains a strong underground rep. I took a cautious route to the Bowl, staying out in deep water to the south. Smaller waves, which were not small at all, were steadily breaking across the inside, obscuring the shore. I kept a wary eye on the horizon. The rain was light, the sea surface glassy and pale, almost white—the same pale gray as the sky. Approaching swells were darker. The darker they were, the steeper they were. It was all on an unusually precise black-and-white scale.",

The effects of this change are so obvious that even the state’s most anti-environmental politicians?a rather non-exclusive club?had to admit that something was going on. The same legislature that couldn’t agree on how to balance a budget without upsetting oil companies or reducing Permanent Fund dividend checks nevertheless established the Alaska Climate Change Impact Mitigation Program in 2008 to assist the state’s many communities dealing with erosion, flooding, and thawing permafrost. (As a sort of global-warming multiplier, thawing permafrost also releases huge amounts of CO2 and methane into the atmosphere when long-frozen organic matter decomposes. Methane has a more powerful effect on human-induced warming than CO2, but atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are much greater.) The growing season of interior Alaska expanded by 45 percent in the past century and is expected to continue lengthening. Plant and animal species have migrated north. The number and intensity of forest fires have increased. A patch of warm water nicknamed “the blob” has parked in the Gulf of Alaska, with devastating effects on the marine food web.",
