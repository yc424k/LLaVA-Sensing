Of the twenty-five souls who’d survived Shipwreck Camp, seventeen had made it alive to this desolate, forlorn place at Icy Spit, which they named Shore Camp. He knew in his heart that Dr. Mackay and Beuchat and Murray and Morris were dead. Based on their condition when they were last seen, that was all but certain.

It was 5:15 a.m. when they assumed their takeoff position. The runway at Le Bourget was two miles long, and they would need nearly all of it. The plane crossed the grass expanse with fearful sluggishness at first, but slowly it gathered speed. After some time it lifted briefly, but came down again and bouncily proceeded another three hundred yards before finally, agonizingly, and barely getting airborne. The chief engineer, who had run along beside the plane much of the way, fell to his knees and wept. Just taking off was a unique triumph. No plane in the Atlantic race had done even that before now. The crowd roared its approval. L’Oiseau Blanc climbed with painful slowness into the milky haze of the western sky and set a course for the English Channel. One hour and twenty-seven minutes later, at 6:48 a.m., Nungesser and Coli reached the chalky sea cliffs of Normandy at Etretat. A squadron of four escort planes tipped their wings in salute and peeled away, and L’Oiseau Blanc flew off alone in the direction of the British Isles and the cold Atlantic beyond.",

She forgot time, life, where she was, what she was doing. A slamming together of the coach-house doors in the yard brought her to herself again.

Then he caught the next trolley, and was carried as far as it went in the direction of Eaglewood. He meant to walk up there and leave the keys for her; after that he would see. The late August night was hushed but not oppressive; the stars already seemed to hang higher than in midsummer, as if receding to autumn altitudes; as he climbed there was a stir of air in the upper branches. The walk might help to clear the confusion from his brain; at any rate, it was out of the question to follow Mrs. Tracy home. First of all he had to be by himself, and in the open. . . .",

Hong Kong was unmistakably still Hong Kong – if anything, more so. Everything seemed to be in the usual condition of productive turmoil. Huge reclamation works were happening all around the harbour. Vast new skyscrapers had arisen. Out at Chep Lap Kok the stupendous new airport was nearing completion, together with the causeway for trains and motor vehicles, the enormous suspension bridge, the mesh of roads and railways and the two new harbour tunnels which would link it with the city. Three new container terminals were being built. Stonecutters Island was an island no more, and had a brand-new naval depot on it. After a couple of years away I hardly recognized parts of Central, and all over the New Territories complete new towns had appeared, thickets of white concrete filling every valley, overlooking every creek, and by now so nearly running into one another that virtually all the flat land was urbanized, leaving only the mountains, the marshes and the duck ponds in their natural state. The shops of Hong Kong were as dazzling as ever, the hotels as ostentatious, the ships still lay in their thousands in the roadstead.",

In the excitement and fatigue of the afternoon's event he had completely forgotten him, and the poor fellow had been waiting all this time there in his glittering chariot drawn up before Webber's modest door. It was not yet quite five o'clock in the afternoon, but dark comes early in the dismal wintry days of London's ceaseless fog and drizzle, and it was black as midnight outside. The street lights were on, and the shop fronts were shining out into the fog with a blurred and misty radiance. The street itself was still and deserted, but high up over the roof-tops the wind was beginning to swoop in fitful gusts, howling faintly in a way that promised a wild night.",

The hard wood had failed to catch; only a few steps at the bottom smouldered, with a creeping glow of sparks defining their charred edges. At the top he saw a streak of light from an open door. It fell upon the vast landing, all foggy with a slow drift of smoke. That was the room. He climbed the stairs, then checked himself, because he had seen within the shadow of a man cast upon one of the walls. It was a shapeless, high-shouldered shadow of somebody standing still, with lowered head, out of his line of sight. The Capataz, remembering that he was totally unarmed, stepped aside, and, effacing himself upright in a dark corner, waited with his eyes fixed on the door.",

Ahead of them, a long way off, a range of hills stained by mottlings of black forest flowed away in round white curves against the sky. The lane passed into a pine-wood with boles reddening in the afternoon sun and delicate blue shadows on the snow. As they entered it the breeze fell and a warm stillness seemed to drop from the branches with the dropping needles.

He had dined discreetly at his hotel the evening before; had breakfasted with moderation. And had he not voyaged in many parts of the world, in China Seas and round the Cape? Was he not even then on his return journey from Zanzibar? No doubt. But the big liner which deposited him yesterday at the thronged port was a different concern from this wretched tub, reeking with indescribable odours as it rolled in the oily swell of the past storm through which the MOZAMBIQUE had ridden without a tremor. The benches, too, were frightfully uncomfortable, and sticky with sirocco moisture under the breathless awning. Above all, there was the unavoidable spectacle of the suffering passengers, natives of the country; it infected him with misery. In attitudes worthy of Michelangelo they sprawled about the deck, groaning with anguish; huddled up in corners with a lemon-prophylactic against sea-sickness, apparently-pressed to faces which, by some subtle process of colour-adaptation, had acquired the complexion of the fruit; tottering to the taffrail….",

She walked the bankers through the process of approving a twelve-thousand-dollar, ten-year loan to cover equipment, material, and start-up costs. Then she signed a ten-year lease with a ten-year option to extend on a second-floor industrial space on Neptuno Street in central Havana.

As the legend goes, at the precise moment they walked in, an ivory-skinned devushka went down on a Nigerian male stripper atop the bar as the Soviet national anthem blasted from the speakers. According to former owner Doug Steele, the Hungry Duck was denounced on the floor of the Duma thirty times (one charge being the promotion of miscegenation) and declared an “enemy of the people.” Things went downhill from there. Within three years, the Duck racked up 256 criminal cases, eight police raids, and two bomb threats, and four of its original owners died. Steele himself received five death threats and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes. The Hungry Duck was finally shut down in 1999 by its landlady, an eighty-two-year-old prima ballerina who used to dance solo for Stalin. It eventually reopened under new ownership, but I hear it lost its zing.",

We found a little flood-flattened shore of rock-sand knitted over with grass, big enough for two tents. Jatso hobbled the horses and scavenged dead wood to build a fire, while we pitched the tents.

To the left, the scenery never changed. Rolling hills of brown rock and mounds of scree piled high against the horizon. To the right, we passed miles of verdant fields, a narrow stretch of green that ran between the river and the desert. Every few minutes, we passed by a small village of single-story brick houses painted in green or blue or beige. Some of the buildings had collapsed, or their roofs had fallen in. In one village, I watched two young boys roll truck tires down the dirt road; the boys looked quite happy. Every once in awhile, we passed small, single-story structures that I couldn’t identify. The buildings were square with flat roofs and round domes. The domes were dotted with tiny, open-air windows. I asked Mr. Hussan what they were.",

I’m fascinated, too, that they can navigate by the stars, though how they ever glimpse constellations from their usual homes in dusty corners of vacant houses, I don’t know. One scurries around in the bidet every morning. Several get sucked into the new vacuum cleaner by mistake, though usually they are luckier: I trap them in a jar and take them outside. I suspect every cup and shoe. When I fluff a bed pillow, an albino one lands on my bare shoulder. We upset armies of spiders as we empty the closet under the stairs of its bottle collection. Impressive, the long threads for legs and the fly-sized bodies; I can even see their eyes. Other than these inhabitants, the inheritance from the former occupants consists of dusty wine bottles—thousands and thousands in the shed and in the stalls. We fill local recycling bins over and over, waterfalls of glass raining from boxes we’ve loaded and reloaded. The stalls and limonaia (a garage-sized room on the side of the house once used for storing pots of lemons over the winter) are piled with rusted pans, newspapers from 1958, wire, paint cans, debris. Whole ecosystems of spiders and scorpions are destroyed, though hours later they seem to have regenerated. I look for old photos or antique spoons but see nothing of interest except some handmade iron tools and a “priest,” a swan-shaped wooden form with a hook for a hanging pan of hot coals, which was pushed under bedcovers in winter to warm the clammy sheets. One cunningly made tool, an elegant little sculpture, is a hand-sized crescent with a worn chestnut handle. Any Tuscan would recognize it in a second: a tool for trimming grapes.",

It’s a carapace on wheels, fenders and running boards bristling with chains, levers, and other mechanical bits that newer cars hide beneath the hood or under the body. It is so heavy and complex to drive I have to believe that, if they can do it in that car, we can handle Roxanne. The driver and his wife, a quiet pair, have dressed the part. Each wears a skull-fitting leather helmet, goggles, kneehigh lace-up leather boots, a long duster for chilly mornings, and a scarf wrapped around their necks, ready to pull over their noses if the dust gets bad. They’re signed off, and, with a faster series of pops and bangs, they head toward the desert. From there, the starter’s white flag drops once a minute, releasing one car after another into the wilds beyond.",

There is a tent pitched on a piece of open ground, and round it are stationed monkish guards, who as usual are engaged in keeping curious people back with their whips. This tent conceals a great mystery. In it the Dalama of Nechung is preparing to go into a trance. In the meantime the God-King is slowly approaching in his sedan-chair with his six-and-thirty bearers. Now the Holy One has halted before the tent out of which the god-possessed monk reels with staggering steps. His face is swollen, hissing tones proceed from his mouth, and the weight of his head-dress almost bears him to the ground. Waving the bearers aside, he breaks through the line and puts his shoulders under the shafts and runs for a few steps. He looks like upsetting his Holy Burden, but all is well. The other bearers take the strain, and the Dalama falls to the ground in a faint and is carried off in a litter, which is waiting to receive him. The procession then proceeds on its stately way. I have never been able to understand the exact meaning of this ritual. Perhaps it is meant to symbolise the subjection of the Protecting Deity to the higher powers of the Living Buddha.",
