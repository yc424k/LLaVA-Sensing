Boyne had felt a little resentful of the fact that only the Wheaters’ youngest-born was to share the luxury of their hotel; it seemed rather beastly to banish the others to frowsy lodgings around the corner. At the moment he had avoided Judy’s eye, fearing to catch in it the reflection of his thought: most of Judy’s feelings were beginning to reverberate in him. But now, in the leisure of their first talk since landing, he learned that no such feeling had marred the meeting of the little Wheaters with their parents.",

Later on, if Bascom had to consult him on any business, he would open his door abruptly, walk out into Brill’s office clutching his hands together at his waist, and with disgust still carved upon his face, say: ‘Well, sir, … If you have concluded your morning devotions,’ here his voice sank to a bitter snarl, ‘we might get down to the transaction of some of the day’s business.’",

Of course whoever was taking decisions at that time (Iliescu & Co?) erred badly by staging such a phoney trial and producing the absurd charge of genocide.

But what the trial lacked in legality, according to international law, it made up for in poetic justice. The Ceausescus had created a state in which ‘a fair trial’ could not even be imagined; it was a concept belonging to another world. And they died by the standards they had set. If it is true that they rejected the offer of a ‘civil trial’, in which their defence could have been insanity, that was the only constructive thing they ever did for Rumania.",

This is a red-rock landscape, deeply riven by irregular gorges below 2,000-foot precipices – a topographical chaos of visual splendour leaving little space for human habitation or cultivation. Yet in an emotionally muddled way I rejoiced to be in an area where some traces of ‘normal’ African life remain. Little herd-boys sat on high boulders guarding their pitifully small herds of cattle, others walked behind a flock of goats on a contour footpath, coloured blanket draped gracefully over a shoulder. Women were laundering blankets in scanty streams, then children carefully spread them to dry on tennis-court widths of smooth polished rock. Blanket-wrapped men rode small sturdy Basuto ponies up and down precipitous slopes – sitting straight-backed, their feet almost touching the ground. White South Africa’s landscapes, however beautiful, remain memorials to apartheid – their unpeopled spaces cruel, black activity channelled towards the baas’s enrichment.",

That self-contained position he had lately occupied, in which his whole attention was given to objects of the inner eye, all outer regard being quite disdainful, seemed to have been taken by insidious strategem, and for the first time he had an interest without the house.

The morning was hot and still. After breakfast they drew chairs together and sat in an irregular semicircle in the bow. An awning above their heads protected them from the heat of the sun, and the breeze which the boat made aired them softly. Mrs Flushing was already dotting and striping her canvas, her head jerking this way and that with the action of a bird nervously picking up grain; the others had books or pieces of paper or embroidery on their knees, at which they looked fitfully and again looked at the river ahead. At one point Hewet read part of a poem aloud, but the number of moving things entirely vanquished his words. He ceased to read, and no one spoke. They moved on under the shelter of the trees. There was now a covey of red birds feeding on one of the little islets to the left, or again a blue-green parrot flew shrieking from tree to tree. As they moved on the country grew wilder and wilder. The trees and the undergrowth seemed to be strangling each other near the ground in a multitudinous wrestle; while here and there a splendid tree towered high above the swarm, shaking its thin green umbrellas lightly in the upper air. Hewet looked at his book again. The morning was peaceful as the night had been, only it was very strange because he could see it was light, and he could see Rachel and hear her voice and be near to her. He felt as if he were waiting, as if somehow he were stationary among things that passed over him and around him, voices, people’s bodies, birds, only Rachel too was waiting with him. He looked at her sometimes as if she must know that they were waiting together, and being drawn on together, without being able to offer any resistance. Again he read from his book:",

A sadhu that smears himself with the ashes of the dead, drinks from human skulls and looks for salvation in stoned madness. His red eyes look straight at me and through me. It’s a look from another world, a window to nothingness, and a black hole of emptiness. My bones snap dry, my blood freezes, my breath is suspended. I’m being shot by a supernatural shotgun.

For the team to reach that section of the Tibetan border, we had to cross six landslide areas in complete darkness and once again, on our way back, carry out this feat, ideally while there was still some daylight left. Time was certainly of the essence on this next adventure but, after a reconnaissance trip the day before and an intense discussion about the calculated risks of crossing such an exposed and slippery facade, most of us felt confident that we would get across safely. I soon realized that, when walking across the side of a 45 mountain ridge, especially one that is quite slippery, the natural instinct is to lean into the mountain, which actually causes the climber to have less stability, and increases one’s chances of slipping down the mountain. I understood that the key to crossing these steep gradients safely was to maintain a low centre of gravity, by remaining as upright as possible and actually leaning away from the mountainside instead of in. The team and I, therefore, practised this a few times in daylight knowing it would be much harder in darkness the next day. After a few dry runs, we all felt fairly comfortable and confident that we could go ahead in the morning.",

He would have liked to see her again, to be with her just once on those rocks facing the sunrise. . . . Well . . . and how was he going to get his things down to the station? He guessed he was strong enough by this time to lug them down the lane to the trolley . . .

Nor is it easy to cook for five hundred people more than usual, and all the ordinary business of the farm comes to a stand-still while the hands prepare barrowfuls of bacon and potatoes, and stir up the coffee and milk and sugar together with a pole in a tub. Part of the regimental band is here, the upper part. The base instruments are in the next village; but that did not deter an enthusiastic young officer from marching his men past our windows on their arrival at six in the morning, with colours flying, and what he had of his band playing their tunes as unconcernedly as though all those big things that make such a noise were giving the fabric its accustomed and necessary base. We are paid six pfennings a day for lodging a common soldier, and six pfennings for his horse—rather more than a penny in English money for the pair of them; only unfortunately sheds and carpentry are not quite so cheap. Eighty pfennings a day is added for the soldier's food, and for this he has to receive two pounds of bread, half a pound of meat, a quarter of a pound of bacon, and either a quarter of a pound of rice or barley or three pounds of potatoes. Officers are paid for at the rate of two marks fifty a day without wine; we are not obliged to give them wine, and if we do they are regarded as guests, and behave accordingly. The thirty we have now do not, as I could have wished, all go out together in the morning and stay out till the evening, but some go out as others come in, and breakfast is not finished till lunch begins, and lunch drags on till dinner, and all day long the dining-room is full of meals and officers, and we ceased a week ago to have the least feeling that the place, after all, belongs to us.",

The far-off stars were an icy crust; the darkness beyond the stars was more than I could handle. The machinery that keeps me going is not geared to cope with infinity and eternity as so clearly displayed in that sky. After sunset, the Africans jammed into their round huts and closed everything to keep out the night; if I understood nothing else about them, I understood that.",

In one corner of the window was a poster for a concert by – you are never going to believe this – Paul Revere and the Raiders. Can you beat that? There they were, still dressed up like Continental soldiers, prancing about and grinning, just like when I was in junior high school. They would be performing at the Civic Auditorium in Dodge City in two weeks. Tickets started at $10.75. This was all becoming too much for me. I was glad to get in the car and drive on to Dodge City, which at least is intentionally unreal.",

Main Street was prosperous and tidy and the surrounding streets were mostly filled with large old houses sitting on ample lawns. Here and there church spires poked out from among the many trees. It was pretty well an ideal town – one of those rare American places where you wouldn’t need a car. From almost any house in town it would be a short and pleasant stroll to the library and post office and stores. My brother and his wife told me that a developer was about to build a big shopping mall outside town and most of the bigger merchants were going to move out there. People, it appeared, didn’t want to stroll to do their shopping. They actually wanted to get in their cars and drive to the edge of town, where they could then park and walk a similar distance across a flat, treeless parking lot. That is how America goes shopping and they wanted to be part of it. So now downtown Bloomsburg is likely to become semiderelict and another nice little town will be lost. So the world progresses.",

I have nothing particular to do. I came down here for a day or two to get away from some English people I was with at Binz who had rather got on to my nerves. And I have so much to say to you, and it will be a good opportunity. We can talk all day, while we are driving.'",

    "target_paragraph": "IT WAS REALLY home, if a hotel room can be so described. His pajamas were laid on the bed. There was a bottle of Valpolicella by the reading light, and by the bed a bottle of mineral water, in an ice bucket with a glass beside it on the silver tray. The portrait had been de-framed and was placed on two chairs where he could see it from the bed.\nThe Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune lay on the bed beside his three pillows. He used three pillows, as Arnaldo knew, and his extra bottle of medicine, not the one that he carried in his pocket, was beside the reading light. The inner doors of the armoire, the mirrored ones, were opened in such a way, that he could see the portrait from the side. His scuffed slippers were by the bed.\nI’ll buy it, the Colonel said, to himself, since there was no one else there except the portrait.\nHe opened the Valpolicella which had been uncorked, and then re-corked, carefully, precisely, and lovingly, and poured himself a glass into the glass which was much better than any hotel should use which was faced with breakage.\n“Here’s to you, Daughter,” he said. “You beauty and lovely. Do you know, that, among other things, you smell good always? You smell wonderfully even in a high wind or under a blanket or kissing goodnight. You know almost no one does, and you don’t use scent.”\nShe looked at him from the portrait and said nothing.\n“The hell with it,” he said. “I’m not going to talk to a picture.”\nWhat do you think went wrong tonight? he thought.\nMe, I guess. Well I will try to be a good boy tomorrow all day; starting at first light.\n“Daughter,” he said, and he was talking to her, and not to a picture now. “Please know I love you and that I wish to be delicate and good. And please stay with me always now.”\nThe picture was the same.\nThe Colonel took out the emeralds from his pocket, and looked at them, feeling them slide, cold and yet warm, as they take warmth, and as all good stones have warmth, from his bad hand into his good hand.\nI should have put these in an envelope and locked them up, he thought. But what the effing security is there better than I can give them? I have to get these back to you fast, Daughter.\nIt was fun, though. And they’re not worth more than a quarter of a million. What I would make in four hundred years. Have to check that figure.\nHe put the stones in the pocket of his pajamas and put a handkerchief over them. Then he buttoned the pocket. The first sound thing you learn, he thought, is to have flaps and buttons on all your pockets. I imagine that I learned it too early.\nThe stones felt good. They were hard and warm against his flat, hard, old, and warm chest, and he noted how the wind was blowing, looked at the portrait, poured another glass of Valpolicella and then started to read the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune.\nI ought to take the pills, he thought. But the hell with the pills.\nThen he took them just the same, and went on reading the New York Herald. He was reading Red Smith, and he liked him very much.",

Alva Johnston, writing in the New York Times from St. Louis, was struck by how unmoved Lindbergh appeared to be by the parade and other festivities laid on for him there. “Colonel Lindbergh never indicated by expression or gesture that he understood that the demonstration was for him,” Johnston wrote. “He did not smile or wave. Nothing moved him to admit that the glittering spectacle and the deafening uproar was a personal tribute.” The following day Lindbergh delighted a crowd of one hundred thousand in Forest Park with aerial acrobatics, but he underwent an abrupt mood change upon landing. “The holiday spirit deserted him when he touched earth again,” Johnston reported. “As soon as he left his own element, the stern and rather gloomy demeanor returned. He is not quite at his ease on land.”",

Twenty tanks also ringed it, belching black fumes, which one somehow felt was not what they should be doing if in good working order. There were no civilians visible and five or six hundred pairs of military eyes curiously followed my slow progress from the Metro exit across the empty, icy width of the Piata. Reminding myself that the army was, at least in theory, pro-democracy, I tottered boldly towards the centre of the cordon and casually said, ‘Permiteti-mi’, as though moving among a supermarket crowd. Without hesitation two bemused-looking soldiers stood aside to let me through. But as I made for the central entrance, some fifty yards ahead, a senior officer came hurrying after me.",

One acted perfectly correctly, and then a dirty little beggar like that put dirty little constructions on it and ran about and bleated. He added that he knew Sandbach was the General’s brother-in-law, but he couldn’t help it. That was the truth … The General said: ‘I know, my boy: I know …’ But one had to take society as one found it. Claudine had to be provided for and Sandbach made a very good husband, careful, sober, and on the right side in politics. A bit of a rip; but they couldn’t ask for everything! And Claudine was using all the influence she had with the other side—which was not a little, women were so wonderful!—to get him a diplomatic job in Turkey, so as to get him out of the way of Mrs Crundall! Mrs Crundall was the leading Anti-Suffragette of the little town. That was what made Sandbach so bitter against Tietjens. He told Tietjens so that Tietjens might understand.",

He was dressed all over in chocolate brown and never took off his hat. He had a knife made from a bayonet with a yellowing ivory pommel. He laid each sheep on a trestle and began undressing the carcass until it lay, pink and sheeny, legs in the air on the white inner lining of its own fleece. Then he slipped the knife point in where the skin stretches tight over the belly and the hot blood spurted over his hands. He enjoyed that. You could tell he enjoyed it by the way he lowered his eyelids and stuck out his lower lip and sucked the air in through his teeth. He pulled out the guts, skimmed them of liver and kidneys and threw the rest to the dogs.",

It certainly has a beautiful setting, in a bowl of jagged mountains, and is supposed to have some of the best skiing in the country. People like Clint Eastwood and Barbra Streisand have houses there.

Thousands of inaccessible gallons of water flowed through the pipe I walked along. Its presence messed with my mind. So I powered along the dirt roads, trying to keep my mind occupied with thoughts of anything and everything else. I thought of my ex and how he would soon be starting his own thru-hike in the opposite direction. I thought about our good-natured bet on who would make it to the Columbia River first.

Porters swooped down on those with smart luggage, barefooted kids were washed under drinking-water taps and the professor was standing in the middle of a group of students chattering like mynahs. When I was at school, Indian teachers, no matter how appalling, demanded by default a fearful respect from pupils as their God-given right. But on observation of the throng of young adults around their guru, it was clear that the aura of respect and admiration that hung around this gentle professor was well earned. He turned and saw us.",
