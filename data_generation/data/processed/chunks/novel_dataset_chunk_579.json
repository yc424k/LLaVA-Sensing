We were gathered in a tidy, air-conditioned hotel conference room with fifteen doctors, most in their forties or fifties. HIV experts led us through powerpoint slides showing the clinical stages of HIV and symptoms such as mucous, lesions and weight loss. We were treated to searingly unpleasant slides of gingivitis and other possible complications of HIV with horrible names like recurrent severe pneumonia cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis, chronic herpes simplex and something terrible called HIV wasting. An information sheet we’d been given showcased graphic photos and details of ulcers, skin conditions and something called ‘crust formation’. On the information sheet was the motto, ‘None shall be denied.’",

The unexpected success of Instead had been balm to Tarrant’s editorial vanity, and Halo had not suspected that there had been a subsequent difference between the two men till the evening, a few months previously, when Vance had told her of his asking Tarrant to raise his salary or annul their contract. She had suffered bitterly on hearing of this, but she had suffered in silence. She could not give Vance the clandestine help she would have wished to; she had neither money of her own, nor means of raising any. And she knew it would only injure him if she betrayed his confession and appealed to her husband’s generosity. Tarrant had no generosity of that kind; he would simply have said: “I suppose he’s been trying to borrow of you now, after failing to pull it off with Mrs. Pulsifer”; and if he had said that she thought she would have got up and walked out of his house--forever.",

The well-to-do among the women in the crowd were veiled in black or brown from head to well-shod feet; they were in groups of two or three, and through the grilled netting over their eyes we felt ourselves scrutinized.

In shirt-sleeves, bent above his table to meet the hard glare of a naked bulb, he sits with gaunt, starved face converging to his huge beaked nose, the weak eyes squinting painfully through his thick-lens glasses, his greasy hair roached back in oily scrolls above the slanting cage of his painful and constricted brow. And for what? For what this agony of concentration? For what this hell of effort? For what this intense withdrawal from the poverty and squalor of dirty brick and rusty fire-escapes, from the raucous cries and violence and never-ending noise? For what? Because, brother, he is burning in the night.

The houses are all glass, all festoons and glitter; now all front doors and lace curtains, all pillars and white steps. But now I pass on, out of London again; the fields begin again; and the houses, and women hanging washing, and trees and fields. London is now veiled, now vanished, now crumbled, now fallen. The carbolic and the pitch-pine begin to lose their savour. I smell corn and turnips. I undo a paper packet tied with a piece of white cotton. The egg-shells slide into the cleft between my knees. Now we stop at station after station, rolling out milk cans. Now women kiss each other and help with baskets. Now I will let myself lean out of the window. The air rushes down my nose and throat—the cold air, the salt air with the smell of turnip fields in it. And there is my father, with his back turned, talking to a farmer. I tremble. I cry. There is my father in gaiters. There is my father.’",

Through the cloth of his pocket his hand touched the pipe there, and he took it out and looked at it again, and it seemed to him that he could still hear old man Falls’ voice in roaring recapitulation: “Cunnel was settin’ thar in a cheer, his sock feet propped on the po’ch railin’, smokin’ this hyer very pipe. Old Louvinia was settin’ on the steps, shellin’ a bowl of peas fer supper. And a feller was glad to git even peas sometimes, in them days. And you was settin’ back agin’ the post. They wa’nt nobody else thar ’cep’ yo’ aunt, the one ’fo’ Miss Jenny come. Cunnel had sont them two gals to Memphis to yo’ gran’pappy when he fust went to Virginny with that ’ere regiment that turnt right around and voted him outen the colonelcy.

They wanted the truck to keep going down the road at a fairly quick pace. The sooner the week’s work ended, the sooner they could get home.

In this scene, he wore a dark sailor suit, and a dark look that was half comprehending, half blank. He was hugging the gravestone, holding tight to one side, while Anna leaned heavily on the other. Many years later, she would be buried there too, with Bertha. I suspect she decided this immediately after Bertha’s funeral. She’d join her baby girl. It was just the two of them, no Eugene.",

If it were up to her, we might have toured the plateau one more time that afternoon, but I complained that I was hot and thirsty and tired. Our tour was over.",

At the bottom of the charred stairs he had a fall, pitching forward on his face with a force that would have stunned a spirit less intent upon a task of love and devotion. He was up in a moment, jarred, shaken, with a queer impression of the terrestrial globe having been flung at his head in the dark. But it wanted more than that to stop Dr. Monygham’s body, possessed by the exaltation of self-sacrifice; a reasonable exaltation, determined not to lose whatever advantage chance put into its way. He ran with headlong, tottering swiftness, his arms going like a windmill in his effort to keep his balance on his crippled feet. He lost his hat; the tails of his open gaberdine flew behind him. He had no mind to lose sight of the indispensable man. But it was a long time, and a long way from the Custom House, before he managed to seize his arm from behind, roughly, out of breath.",

The forest dropped steeply for over a thousand feet, and down below, between its leaf-covered mountains, the Danube valley coiled upstream from the east. It turned south beyond the battlements and after a mile twisted westwards, still deep in shadow, and out of sight at last between further green shoulders of forest. The track, following a wall of fortification downhill through slants of beech and hazel, levelled out before a great tower on a knoll; and a final wet scramble brought me down into Visegrád.",

Our enforced leisurely pace allowed us to interact with locals carrying huge bundles of charcoal fuel on their heads, whole families on trundling donkey and bullock carts, and old men on rickety cycles who sometimes came close to overtaking us. As always, we stopped to take photos of children playing in rivers or walking to school in frayed, but lovingly washed and ironed uniforms. The sight of their own grinning faces reproduced on the LCD screen always caused squeals of delight and disbelief. On a long stretch of hot, decaying asphalt, we passed a teenage girl with a small baby carried in a sling on her back. We stopped to offer her a lift and she gratefully accepted. It was only when she quietly explained that both she and her infant were suffering from potentially deadly malaria, and were walking fifteen miles to see the nearest doctor, that we appreciated the importance of this crumbling road to the locals.",

The rock of the Tore is a soft Tertiary sandstone called ‘macigno’, which overlies the limestone in many places; all the lanes are paved with it, and often have I thanked Providence for causing Massa to be built in the neighbourhood of its quarries, for it is never slippery in summer and never wet in winter, whereas the limestone is objectionable at all seasons unless one goes barefoot or wears the corded shoes called ‘paragatti’ which were introduced from Spanish South America. The peasant, with characteristic anthropomorphism, calls this sandstone “pietra morta,” dead stone; as opposed to the “pietra viva” or limestone.",

But of course it was impossible for a stranger to buy food and by then I was ravenous, having walked twenty-one miles and eaten nothing since leaving Budapest. On the outskirts, I despairingly tried one last shop – much smaller than the standard alimentara – where an amiable woman behind the L-shaped counter took pity on me. Fumbling under the counter, she produced half a rock-hard loaf for which she would accept no payment. To make it chewable I bought a bottle ambiguously labelled ‘Aperitif’ and containing a mildly alcoholic red-brown liquid derived from who knows what. In retrospect, that ranks among my least palatable meals. Yet I was hungry enough to finish the loaf and empty the bottle.",

On reaching the glacier I shouted to attract the men’s attention, and then pushed Roz over at the steepest point. She shot down at a rate that would have dislocated any lesser bicycle and was stopped by the bed-rolls which the men placed in her path. Next, I pushed myself over, at the least steep point, and half-rolled, half-tobogganed down – a painful progress, but one which at least required no effort. The pony-men had heard of my proposed expedition and when I arrived at their feet, in a bruised and breathless ball, I was greeted with joyful acclamation. Their leader, a very old and dignified man – who in Europe would not be allowed by his daughter to go out on a showery day – was almost in tears of relief, and ordered one of the men to carry Roz across the nullah.",

The reason was a family tragedy for which he blamed himself. Three years earlier, on the last day of June 1924, Coolidge’s two teenage sons, John and Calvin Junior, had a game of tennis on a White House court. Calvin Junior wore sneakers without socks and thus developed a blister that became infected. Within a day or so, he was running a high fever and was drifting in and out of delirium. On July 3, the day before his father’s birthday, he was hurriedly admitted to Walter Reed General Hospital.",

There were willow armchairs, some disabled and mended with string, but all provided with gaily striped cushions which had visibly suffered from sun and rain; there were also long deck chairs with tattered plaids or Indian blankets on them, and more cushions strewn on the floor, among a litter of magazines and newspapers. In one corner stood a tall earthen jar with branches of blossoming plum and shadbush, in another an easel with a study blocked out in charcoal, and everywhere were trails of ashes, and little accumulations of cigar and cigarette ends.",

It’s warmer and more inviting. I can never put my finger on why that is. Maybe it’s the intimacy created by the scrub trees and low hills that dissipate any wind, and look lovely in so doing. Maybe it’s the water that is flat and calm because the coastline protects it. For whatever reason, I am grateful to have discovered it.",

But its real claim to fame is as the windiest place in America. It’s something to do with . . . well, with the way the wind blows, of course. Anyway, the highest wind speed ever recorded anywhere on earth was logged on the top of Mt Washington in April 1934 when a gust of – pencils ready? – 231 miles an hour whistled through. That must have been an experience and a half for the meteorologists who worked up there. Can you imagine trying to describe a wind like that to somebody? ‘Well, it was, you know, real . . . windy. I mean, really windy. Do you know what I’m saying?’ It must be very frustrating to have a truly unique experience.",
