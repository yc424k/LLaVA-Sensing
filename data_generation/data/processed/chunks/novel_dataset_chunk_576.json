Only one pilot planting had ended in tears; an extension-worker had neglected to demonstrate how artificial fertiliser should be applied so it was sprayed on to the bushes, killing all fifty. Another illiterate farmer had been persuaded by a travelling salesman to buy a pesticide he could ill-afford against a worm unknown in East Africa; that spray did the baby bushes only temporary harm but gave the farmer a chronic cough. A third ‘pioneer’ warmed my heart by declaring that he would never poison his beloved land with chemicals. He believed in natural mulch and shade trees (unusual here) and his coffee was thriving. The Entebbe agricultural officer, well tutored by chemical salesmen, objected that natural fertilising wastes a lot of time, whereupon the Green farmer retorted that chemicals waste a lot of money.",

A few phrases rang in his ear and touched a faint chord of memory. Where—? When—?\nThen he seemed to hear a voice whispering beside him, a very soft, vibrant voice: “Oh, I’m such a poor little fool; do tell me when I do wrong.”\nThe solution came in a flash and he had a quick, glad memory of Isabelle.\nHe found a blank space on his programme, and began to scribble rapidly:",

Janis had unlocked the rooms where Marie lived and idly I entered them to note how dusty the bookshelves had become, and to tell over the various treasures whose history I knew and which would one day find a place in the great house: the Spanish chest, Moorish lattice, Indian paintings and stuffs, Egyptian and Turkish lanterns, and books everywhere piled up in heaps, the rare companions of a solitude not self-imposed but sought. A mirror and comb from Bali, a Tanagra, an iron statuette of Krishna, a mandala painting – these things had caught the hem of her dress on some speedy emphatic journey across the world and had come here to take up a lodgement in the cool rooms of her house. These are the sort of things which the writer carries about like talismans, to remind him of lost experiences which he must one day re-evoke and refashion in words. This dancer from Bali echoes the past with all the fidelity of a seashell held to the ear … The sea-wind stirred the curtains, reminding me of the bathe I had promised myself.",

Indians make great use of cow dung in their constructions, coating the floor and walls with this sacred material that, once smoothed and dried, smells earthy and agreeable, and feels silky to bare feet. I decided to skip the cow poo in my imagined home, but in my warm nest, there would be walls of books and objects from my travels on display, and I’d build it close to my sister and best friend, Summer. There, in my little mud-brick nest, my sanctuary, I’d finally feel at home. We walked miles and miles as I created this visualization over and over, brick by brick.",

Did I raise my arm? Did I look? Did my yellow scarf with the strawberry spots float and signal? He has broken from the wall. He follows. I am pursued through the forest. All is rapt, all is nocturnal, and the parrots go screaming through the branches. All my senses stand erect. Now I feel the roughness of the fibre of the curtain through which I push; now I feel the cold iron railing and its blistered paint beneath my palm. Now the cool tide of darkness breaks its waters over me. We are out of doors. Night opens; night traversed by wandering moths; night hiding lovers roaming to adventure. I smell roses; I smell violets; I see red and blue just hidden. Now gravel is under my shoes; now grass. Up reel the tall backs of houses guilty with lights. All London is uneasy with flashing lights. Now let us sing our love song—Come, come, come. Now my gold signal is like a dragon-fly flying taut. Jug, jug, jug, I sing like the nightingale whose melody is crowded in the too narrow passage of her throat.* Now I hear crash and rending of boughs and the crack of antlers as if the beasts of the forest were all hunting, all rearing high and plunging down among the thorns. One has pierced me. One is driven deep within me.",

This time the tents were very basic, unlike the clam tents at Union Glacier, which now felt like the Hotel Shangri-La in comparison. We shovelled snow over the flaps all around the base of the tents to ensure the glacial wind would not get through as we prepared for our first night, out alone in the wild. In all this landscape, in this vast space, we were the only living things for miles around, with not a single animal in sight. Like tiny dots in the middle of nowhere, our location was the very essence of remote. I felt isolated but also filled with an incredible sense of freedom. The air was so pure and clean; I filled my lungs and was overwhelmed with a sense of gratitude to be able to experience such an adventure. Antarctica, being the only continent on earth without a native human population, allows you to disconnect like no other continent can. I could shout as loud as I wanted, and it wouldn’t matter; apart from my teammates, no one would notice because there is absolutely nothing alive out there, just snow and ice.",

A vespa brushes with a filobus and immediately the two drivers are at each other as if there had been a feud between their families for years. “HOO! LA! HO!” “Ignorante!” “Fesso!” “Coglione!” They gesticulate, point to their steering wheels and fenders, bring the city to witness; the buses run from overhead wires so soon twenty are held up. The owner of the vespa in his fury gets his front wheel stuck sideways and the motor going full speed makes the machine buck like a wild horse; so the bus moves on but he catches up with it a block later, plants himself square in front of it and begins shouting again. The scene is mandatory, if you were in the wrong it is even more necessary to make out that you were not; and inside the bus everyone is pleased, more than they were already at being transported like a shipment of eels; they would have been cheated if one of the drivers had not played his part. The most relaxed-looking people in Rome are the bus conductors, patrons all day of a kind of party that puts the public at its best and wittiest, because the lack is not of sensibility, only of nerves. The Roman form of serenade is to race a motorcycle motor under the girl’s window, but mufflers are not common in any situation; the only things as dearly loved as a good noise are breakneck speed and eye-splitting lights, preferably neon—all expressions of well-being, like a huge belly-laugh.",

He would say her name suddenly, as he had done last week at the dance, very low, half-turning towards her. She would be ready this time and say his name and move instead of being turned to stone. Confidently the music assured her of that moment.\nShe lay looking quietly into his imagined face till the room had gone. Then the face grew dim and far off and at last receded altogether into darkness. That darkness was dreadful. It was his own life. She would never know it. However well they got to know each other they would always be strangers. Probably he never thought about her when he was alone. Only of Shakespeare and politics. What would he think if he knew she thought of him? But he thought of her when he saw her. That was utterly certain; the one thing certain in the world. . . . That day, coming along Putney Hill with mother, tired and dull and trying to keep her temper, passing his house, seeing him standing at his window, alone and pale and serious. The sudden lightening of his face surprised her again, violently, as she recalled it. It had lit up the whole world from end to end. He did not know that he had looked like that. She had turned swiftly from the sudden knowledge coming like a blow on her heart, that one day he would kiss her. Not for years and years. But one day he would bend his head. She wrenched herself from the thought, but it was too late. She thanked heaven she had looked; she wished she had not; the kiss had come; she would forget it; it had not touched her, it was like the breath of the summer. Everything had wavered; her feet had not felt the pavement. She remembered walking on, exulting with hanging head, cringing close to the ivy which hung from the top of the garden wall, sorry and pitiful towards her mother, and everyone who would never stand first with Ted.",

The heat was oppressive, though we left the tent wide open, and at 5.30 the valley lay still and humid beneath an overcast sky. While striking camp we were attacked continuously and simultaneously by clouds of black midges, tiny grey flies and our old amigos the brown fruit-flies. They swarmed so densely on our faces that we could scarcely see what we were doing; and they even got me on areas not normally exposed when I was generously fertilising the hacienda. We were a burning mass of new bites as we continued through that sad estate, remarking on how lovely it must have been when well tended. Soon we came upon the melancholy ruins of the mansion and paused to admire its handsomely carved verandah pillars and the delicate floral frieze all around the balcony. Nearby a gigantic water-mill still revolves on a tumultuous tributary of the Rio Abancay. The simple chapel has been newly whitewashed and repaired; a few candles flickering in front of the Virgin’s altar represented the only sign of life about the place.",

He assured us, however, there were no jellyfish on the reef. Unaccountably he failed to mention reef sharks, boxfish, scorpion fish, stinging corals, sea snakes, or the fat and infamous grouper, a nine-hundred-pound monster that occasionally, through a combination of testiness and stupidity, chomps off a swimmer’s arm, then remembers that it doesn’t like the taste of human flesh.",

I realized it: I was the old girl now, the longtimer with a few tricks up her sleeve, aching joints, a chip on her shoulder. Holly was friendly and eager to please, much cheerier than my surly default, yet something about her—the hustle, the gusto, the wide eyes—reminded me of an earlier me.

Guiding me gently away from the mob, the Mongolian led me down long corridors and up stairs and across waiting halls and then out into the daylight and across another enormous square. Did I have a friend in Beijing? he asked. Not really, I gaspedjust a secondhand invitation to stay with a correspondent for Agence France-Presse, whom I had never met. His fiancée in Hong Kong had told me to stay with him, but he knew nothing about it. The Mongolian looked surprised, but guided me nonetheless to one of the city’s only public telephones and dialed the number I gave him. The phone crackled, he shot something out and then he was shot at in return. He put down the receiver with an air of anxious melancholy. It would not be easy, he said, to find my friend.",

The quiet holiness of that hour seems all the more mysterious now, because soon after breakfast yesterday the wind began to blow from the northwest, and has not left off since, and looking out of the window I cannot believe that it is the same garden, with the clouds driving over it in black layers, and angry little showers every now and then bespattering its harassed and helpless inhabitants, who cannot pull their roots up out of the ground and run for their lives, as I am sure they must long to do. How discouraging for a plant to have just proudly opened its loveliest flowers, the flowers it was dreaming about all the winter and working at so busily underground during the cold weeks of spring, and then for a spiteful shower of five minutes' duration to come and pelt them down, and batter them about, and cover the tender, delicate things with irremediable splashes of mud! Every bed is already filled with victims of the gale, and those that escape one shower go down before the next; so I must make up my mind, I suppose, to the wholesale destruction of the flowers that had reached perfection—that head of white rockets among them that washed my face a hundred years ago—and look forward cheerfully to the development of the younger generation of buds which cannot yet be harmed.",

Two weeks ago PAC kids burned a bread-van, though their own families need bread! Why? A white owns the bakery! Last week a good friend of ours was attacked, a white guy detained and tortured in the ’80s for helping us. He often visits and drove in to look for his plumber. They stoned his car to bits, all the windows smashed, sixteen gashes on his face. Before Hani, I would have introduced you to Matthew’s family – and maybe in the future?

Ah, a ‘sea trial’, how romantic! It went over my head when the surveyor warned me that the Gulf Stream was close in, the wind was howling at 25 knots gusting to 30 north by northwest, and the sea was 15 feet and confused. His further advice that we stay in the protected water of the Intracoastal Waterway went over my head as well.",

Ugwu wondered if it was because he did not want to admit that his hometown was about to fall, or if it was because Olanna had not been speaking to him. Ugwu did not know what had happened between them but, whatever it was, it happened after the village square meeting. Olanna had come home in a strange silence. She spoke mechanically. She did not laugh. She let him make every decision about the food and about Baby, spending most of her time on the slanting wooden chair on the veranda. Once he saw her walk over to the guava tree and caress its trunk, and he told himself he would go and pull her away, after a minute, before the neighbors said she was going mad. But she didn’t stay long. She turned quietly and went back and sat on the veranda.",

By God, she looked at me as if I were an invalid—as any kind woman may look at a poor chap in a bath chair. And, yes, from that day forward she always treated me and not Florence as if I were the invalid. Why, she would run after me with a rug upon chilly days. I suppose, therefore, that her eyes had made a favourable answer. Or, perhaps, it wasn’t a favourable answer. And then Florence said: “And so the whole round table* is begun.” Again Edward Ashburnham gurgled slightly in his throat; but Leonora shivered a little, as if a goose had walked over her grave.

One guy did, however, and he really glared.",

    "target_paragraph": "As we motor past the office dock I hold out the marina key that I need to return, looped on the end of my boat hook, trying to give it to the secretary as we drift by. But we are going a little too fast and she looks surprised as she jogs down the dock to keep up with us. Before she gets to the end of the dock she reaches out and grabs the key at the last second, before we drift out of reach. I wave goodbye and she waves too, with one eyebrow slightly raised. I am leaving as a novice sailor. Hopefully I’ll be an intermediate sailor by the end of this journey, or at least an advanced novice.\nWe motor out of the marina and into the bay, like I have done a dozen times before. But this time it is different; I will not be returning to my slip at the St. Petersburg Municipal Marina. The slip is no longer mine, and there is nowhere to go but home to St. Augustine, 1000 miles away.\nIn the bay, I shut off the engine and hoist the sails, catching the light wind. Silently we glide across the flat water, and I watch the St Petersburg skyline fade away one last time.\nThe breeze decreases as we approach the Sunshine Skyway Bridge and I watch the speed display drop. For the next hour we only sail at 0.5 knot, about the pace of a slow old man walking somewhere he doesn’t want to go. Movement across the water is barely perceptible and a red buoy we are approaching appears stationary. I don’t want to run the engine on the first day of the journey, not knowing when I will have an opportunity to fill up or how much fuel I might need. I also don’t want to start the journey giving in to the desire to move above a certain minimum speed. This is to be a sailing journey, and I am determined to use the engine minimally. I’m in no hurry.\nWith patience to spare, Sobrius and I sail across Tampa Bay, past Egmont Key, through the south channel, and into the Gulf of Mexico. The wind has increased a bit and we make all of 2 knots. We are now out farther than I have yet sailed and I experience the unique feeling of being on my first big sailing journey: freedom, adventure, anticipation, the unknown. I am on the edge of my comfort zone, but so far, I love it.",

Meanwhile, high on the Southeast Ridge, Ang Dorje and Lhakpa Chhiri pressed on resolutely through the intensifying storm toward Hall. At 3:00 P.M., however, still 700 feet below the South Summit, the wind and subzero cold proved to be too much for them, and the Sherpas could go no higher.

He saw houses made almost entirely of glass. He saw windows laced across with glittering streamers; heaped with gleaming mounds of pink, purple, yellow, rose. The carriage stopped. He entered mysterious arcades filmed with clouds and webs of tinted gauze. A million airs from China, from Arabia, wafted their frail incense into the remotest fibres of his senses. Swiftly over the counters flashed yards of gleaming silk; more darkly, more slowly rolled the ponderous bombazine. Scissors snipped; coins sparkled. Paper was folded; string tied. What with nodding plumes, waving streamers, tossing horses, yellow liveries, passing faces, leaping, dancing up, down, Flush, satiated with the multiplicity of his sensations, slept, drowsed, dreamt and knew no more until he was lifted out of the carriage and the door of Wimpole Street shut on him again.",

There was the vinegary smell of windfallen apples in my garden. Chestnuts bobbed like little mines in park ponds. I drove at first through the landscape of Essex - the poor mocked Essex of jokes and news items - passing chain pubs with pseudo-Tudor frontages, and business parks in ‘Phase II of Construction’: colonies of unfinished corrugated-steel hangars. I counted ten second-hand car dealerships: showrooms of metal and glass, blank-plated BMWs and Mercedes parked in obedient ranks on the outdoor lots, and red and white bunting strung between the arc-lights overhead. St George’s crosses were everywhere, snapping in the wind on domestic flagpoles, or hanging as air-fresheners from rear-view mirrors. Somewhere away to my south, I knew, was the industrial shoreline of Dagenham, and the oil refineries at Coryton, which at night released sudden air-balloon flares and licks of flame from their chimneys. Once I passed a roadside shop selling garden ornaments. Its forecourt was filled with gnomes, and Bambi-like deer, lying at rest with their legs crooked up beneath them. In pride of place at the front of the display was a plaster falcon of indeterminate species, perched on a polka-dotted toadstool twice its size.",

    "target_paragraph": "The chartplotter shows the yellow icon of a weather buoy northeast of us. This is the National Data Buoy Center Station 41009, accessible via the internet and regularly checked by surfers for wave data. I’ve consulted it dozens of times and wish to see it in person. It doesn’t look too far away on the little screen, and we continue tacking against the wind and the building waves. I am hand-steering, pushing the tiller as we go up a wave, pulling on the tiller as we go down the other side, trying to keep the hull in the water so we don’t slam in the troughs. The buoy is a nice distraction and a goal which gives me a mission for the rest of the day. It will be another milestone on a long journey home, and old inanimate friend to visit on the ocean. I’ve seen a photograph of the buoy, on the internet, but there is no way to tell its scale. I am curious to see how big it is; I really have no idea.\nAs we tack west, I see the inlet on the chartplotter and again it beckons.\n“Come on in, it’s nice and calm in here.”\nAnd again, I must resist its siren song. Sobrius and I press on instead, now trying to reach the yellow buoy. We tack to starboard and sail east for an hour. We tack to port and sail west.\nThe waves continue to build and the conditions worsen. The inlet continues to beckon, the yellow buoy mocks. I keep one hand on the tiller and one on a cleat, both feet are pressed to the backrest opposite my seat. Sobrius is heeling 10, then 15, then 20 degrees; white spray flies off the bow when breaking waves hit us. I turn my head when I see the flying water coming, taking it to the back of the head, to the face when I don’t see it in time to move.\nThe sky on the horizon is dark grey, changing to a lighter grey with distance from the horizon, patches of light grey and white poke through. The sea is a dark blueish-grey. There are wavelets on top of waves and the waves are very close together. The waves are relentless, colliding with Sobrius’ bow every few seconds, hour after hour, all day, all night. The boat rises, the boat falls. I’m wearing my red foul-weather coat, my lifejacket, doubly clipped in to the padeye on the floor and to a padeye on the bulkhead, black and white fingerless gloves from Home Depot, my yellow foul-weather suspenders, and red Nike shoes that don’t soak up water. The air is cold but not freezing.\nThe bow crashes into wave after wave, sending white spray flying off to port, blown by the wind, sometimes blowing into my face.\n“How tough are you?”\nI continue steering through the waves. “I’m OK with this but I’d rather the wind and the seas decrease a bit.”\nI get no response. The original question hangs in the salt air. The inlet beckons, the yellow buoy mocks. Northward progress is slow.\nAnother ship triggers the alarm on the AIS. This one is a towing vessel. I scan the horizon and eventually make out a cube. It grows larger, and its odd cube shape reminds me of the Borg spaceship on Star Trek. It is an anomaly on the ocean. Ships aren’t supposed to be cubes – rectangles maybe – but not cubes. I alter course to port, intending to give it very wide berth. I hope to see my old friend the yellow buoy, but its position relative to me has been very slow to change. The waves continue to increase and they make my progress even slower.\n“Canaveral Inlet is now behind you, but you could turn back, sail downwind to the inlet and go in for the night.”\n“No. I want nothing of the Intracoastal, its bridges, its traffic, its channel markers. I want to sail in the ocean. I will complete this journey without using the intracoastal waterway.”\n“How tough are you?”\n“I’m not that tough, but I’m going to continue around the cape.”\nThe tugboat comes into view. It’s pulling a huge barge loaded with shipping containers – train cars stacked 8-high in long rows above the sides of the vessel. As the angle between us changes, the cube becomes a rectangle, then, like a maritime shapeshifter, it becomes a cube again. An hour later as it recedes into the distance, still a cube.\nIt is 3:30 pm and we are almost past the yellow buoy, according to the chartplotter, and I tack us towards it, but I don’t see it. We are about 22 miles east of Cape Canaveral and just north of its point. Many obstacles surround the Cape, so prudence dictates that we stay as far away from it as possible.",

These can take up to four years to burn away, being extinguished each wet season, then reignited when November comes. Were such trees accessible, their cash value would be considerable. Here they are seen as a nuisance by peasants eager to cultivate the space they occupy and lacking the tools (or the will or the need?) to use them for fuel, furniture or building. It was distressing to witness their slow cremation; since they have to be killed, one would prefer them to be used, even by a logging company – if reincarnated as furniture, they could give pleasure for centuries. Or, if used as firewood, smaller trees would be spared. I felt that anything would be better than their futile smouldering away – though perhaps not entirely futile, if the ash is a good fertilizer.",

Even Lady Caroline, used all her life to beauty, who had been everywhere and seen everything, felt the surprise of it. It was, that year, a particularly wonderful spring, and of all the months at San Salvatore April, if the weather was fine, was best. May scorched and withered; March was restless, and could be hard and cold in its brightness; but April came along softly like a blessing, and if it were a fine April it was so beautiful that it was impossible not to feel different, not to feel stirred and touched.",

Ugwu watched her unpack foodstuffs from a bag: dried fish and cocoyams and spices and bitter leaf. “Have I not come from the farm?” she asked. “This is my rest. I have brought ingredients to make a proper soup for my son. I know you try, but you are only a boy. What does a boy know about real cooking?” She smirked and turned to the younger woman, who was standing by the door, arms folded and eyes still downcast, as if waiting for orders. “Is that not so, Amala? Does a boy belong in the kitchen?”",

Because I had been hiking in the Middle East, I had left the arrangements to a travel agent, and I was mildly surprised to find that the agent had plumped for an obscure local firm—Crocodile Car Hire or something similarly improbable and unpromising—whose office was little more than a bare counter on a side street. The young man in charge had a certain chirpy cockiness that was ineffably irritating, but he dealt with the paperwork in a brisk and efficient manner, chattering throughout about the weather. It was the worst wet in thirty years, he told us proudly. Then he led us out to the sidewalk and presented us with our vehicle—an aged Commodore Holden station wagon that seemed to have a decided sag about the axles.",
