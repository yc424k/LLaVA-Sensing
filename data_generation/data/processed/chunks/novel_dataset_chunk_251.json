From there the loads will be moved in relays, three hours downriver to Shey. At Snowfields Camp we shall leave a cairn with food for Tukten and Gyaltsen, and instructions to ignore advice from the denizens of Ring-mo and to push on to Shey; being lightly loaded, they might reach Shey from Snowfields Camp in a half day. If the pass is closed by blizzard, they should try to reach us by a long alternate route, from Murwa by way of Saldang; there are three high passes on that route, say the Shey women, but none of them is so formidable as this one. All else failing, they are to await us at Dunahi.",

Lacquered seats waited patiently to be filled and a woman sat reading in a corner. She looked up, acknowledged us and went back to her book. It was like being on a London Tube, but friendlier – and infinitely more hygienic. Train number 19 remained empty until it began to move, at which point a number of men leapt in with ninja stealth, slicked their side partings back into place and sat down clutching carrier bags. This was not how a Mumbai commuter train was supposed to be. Covering the roof was a series of hooked metal handholds that gave the creepy feeling of travelling in a human abattoir. Passepartout stood in the middle of the carriage, swinging from one and gazing at the slums rolling past the doorway. Our cold war had ended after he booked a surprise birthday apology at the Trident in Nariman Point, a victim of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. After five weeks, the first sight of a bathtub, the feel of fluffy robes and a flat-screen TV had calmed all anxieties and we left rejuvenated, taking the tea bags, apples and coffee and lingering in the lobby until the 24-hour internet had run out, along with the receptionist’s patience.",

All lights went off except the dim light in the pilot’s cabin and we crossed the Japanese lines, brightly lit far below. In half an hour, the storm hit us. I had been watching the flickering exhaust flame on a wing, but the wing vanished into cloud that looked grainy and hard as granite. Hail sounded like a threshing machine. Everything froze including the air speed indicator. Roy explained that if the speed dropped below sixty-three miles per hour the plane stalled and went into a spin, but there was no cause for anxiety; he opened his window a crack and judged air speed that way; he’d done it often. The wind-screen was a sheet of frost. Inside this cloud mass, elevator draughts lifted and dropped the plane, one’s stomach making the same vertical movements. I had untroubled confidence in Roy so the behaviour of the plane didn’t disturb me but I was perishing of cold. Behind in the cabin, the passengers vomited or hid beneath their blankets from the sound and the fury. This lasted for an hour and a half, after which Roy remarked that the rest of the trip would be easy. We were still flying blind in cloud but I thought it would be bad manners to mention that.",

The rattan screens were down, and through the strange greenish gloom made by the foliage of the trees outside a strong wind blew in gusts, swaying the long draperies of windows and doorways. Her white figure seemed shaped in snow; the pendent crystals of a great chandelier clicked above her head like glittering icicles. She looked up and watched my approach.

Here, sitting in the peace of her own cottage, quiet after her morning’s labours, she clearly perceived father’s real innocuousness, his fundamental simplicity, and felt very warm towards him. By his work he helped to make the beautiful world even more beautiful—for those, that is, who weren’t clergymen—and of how many people, she would like to know, could one say that? Undoubtedly he was a father to be proud of. When she came down here to live for good, she would bring the copies of his books he had given her on birthdays and at Christmas, and would put them, in a glorious row, on the window-sill. He had had them handsomely bound for her, and each contained a suitable autographed expression of paternal goodwill. They would lend a great air to the place. In that small, bare room, they would be the only things which were splendid. Yes, he was a distinguished father, and she did hope Netta would like him very much. Netta was so charming that he was bound to be happy, rid for ever of his taciturn, undecorative daughter. Happy and soothed herself, Jen wanted the whole world to be happy and soothed; and especially father—that queer recluse, that queer disliker of almost everything, and certainly, till Netta came, of quite everybody, whose fife, devoted entirely to perfecting his art, had been such a strange and solitary thing.",

    "target_paragraph": "Twenty miles to the south, where the Orontes once carried skiffs to the sea, the ancient port of Seleucia Pierea rears a ruined acropolis above the waves. The shore stretches empty now, and the Mediterranean opens beneath me with a leap of the heart, in a plain of glinting thunder.\nI circled the acropolis through dense undergrowth, wet with oleanders and young pines. Hewn blocks clung to the heights above me, or scattered the scrub-tangled earth. I mounted a stairway through a vanished gate. It was starting to rain. Within its ramparts the town had crumbled from the hill, leaving only the incision of cisterns and drains in its rock, wandering steps. A monolithic sarcophagus was filling with water.\nTwo thousand years ago the legionaries of Titus and Vespasian, with prisoners from their grim Judean campaign, carved out a fifteen-hundred-yard channel which split the acropolis in a precipitous ravine, to divert floodwater from the port. I entered it by a chilly rush of water. For two hundred yards it thrust clean through living rock, then opened in a defile that trailed a long, rain-misted skylight eighty feet above me. In and out of its darkness, it made a gauntly beautiful passage now. I followed it upstream, its torrent purling beside me. I heard nothing but the drip and splash of the breaking storm, and the downward rush of water. Chisel-strokes still cross-hatched the rock. At the end, beneath a blackened inscription to the deified emperors, towered the ivy-hung dam which had guided the floodwaters in. Beside it–sudden and enigmatic in the solitude–a copse of laurel trees bloomed with votive rags.\nI emerged from this twilight, close to the shore, where the port had left its wall in huge, disconnected stones. The inner harbour had been choked up long ago, and I found myself crossing an empty depression of silted earth where the portly Greek and Syrian merchant ships had carried in their Roman glass and metals, and taken west the silks of China.\nThe jetty had sunk to smothered stones. I tried to imagine the traffic floating here: the luxuries grown magic with distance, the wheat and hides of the unrecorded poor, the whole intricate caravan of the world. The goods were myth-bearers. They carried their own stories, their own ironies. There was a rumoured trade in unicorns. The silted harbour was noiseless under my feet.\nAnd still the Romans did not know the land the silks came from. Somewhere edging the easternmost sea, they heard, the country of the Seres escaped the influence of the stars, and was guided only by the laws of its ancestors. Mars never drove its people to war, nor Venus to folly. They had no temples, no prostitutes, no crimes, no victims. The king’s women–seven hundred of them–rode in golden chariots drawn by oxen. But this land of Serica, by some divine spell, was impossible to reach.\nMeanwhile the Chinese, in mirror-image, came to believe that in a great city to the west–Rome, Alexandria or Constantinople–the people were ruled by philosophers, peacefully elected. Their palaces rose on crystal pillars, and they travelled in little white-draped carriages, and signalled their movements by the shaking of bells.\nIt was as if the road between the two empires, quarter the length of the equator, had leached out in its passage all their trouble. For as they declined both China and Rome were racked by war.\nI walked along the black sands to the mole. Close inshore, the water shone brilliant turquoise. It came warm to my touch. But to west and east the sky was not the blue calm of my imagined homecoming, but a troubled cloudscape that swept the sea in moving gleams and shadows.\n*** END OF THIS TEXT Shadow of the Silk Road ***",

The driver seemed either drunk or high on ANC Youth League rhetoric – maybe both. At each corner we keeled over and our not crashing seemed impossible: yet the impossible repeatedly happened. Meanwhile the inflamed cargo was chanting non-stop, ‘Kill the farmer, kill the Boer! Kill, kill kill!’ The standing passengers were simultaneously stamping on the already decrepit floor and thumping the roof with their fists. Many more Comrades rode on the roof, also stamping and thumping. When we passed another bus, overturned on the verge with a huge angry crowd seething around prone bodies, I felt glad that I had left my affairs in order.",

Just to reach San Agustín required a twelve-day journey by steamer up the Río Magdalena to Honda, and from there a five-day trip by mule to Neiva, through a hot and barren landscape. Though not more than a hundred miles beyond Neiva, the wooded valleys and northern flanks of the Macizo Colombiano had not been colonized until the late nineteenth century. It, too, remained remote and wild country. The march south from Neiva consumed another three days. By the time Preuss and his small team reached San Agustín, he no longer questioned why so few had beheld the wonders of the ancient site. “One feels lost here,” he wrote home, “as on a dead-end street. Perhaps to this is due the oblivion in which the antiquities of this region have remained.” The expedition remained in the field for three months, photographing and taking precise measurements of the monuments, making molds of some, all the time doing their best to ignore the rain, the damp cold at night, the glaring heat by day, the clouds of insects, the lack of food, the malarial fevers that rose in the night only to break deceptively with the dawn.",

I paddled in, frantic, and found him on the beach, people standing around him. He looked bad—pale, in shock. Apparently he had gotten the wind completely knocked out of him. Little John Kaulukukui had saved him from drowning. Kevin was still breathing heavily, coughing, crying. We carried him up to the house. Everything hurt, he said, every movement. Mom cleaned him up, calmed him down, and put him to bed. I went back out surfing. I figured he would be back in the water in a few days. But Kevin never surfed again. He did resume bodysurfing, and as a teenager became one of the hotshots at Makapu‘u and Sandy Beach, two serious bodysurfing spots on the eastern tip of Oahu. As an adult, he has had back trouble. Recently an orthopedist, looking at a spinal X-ray, asked him what exactly had happened when he was a child. It looked like he had suffered a serious fracture.",

No two buildings were alike, each a higgledy mass of extensions that toppled dangerously close to each other, almost closing out the sky. Some were still partway under construction yet already inhabited—a town planner's nightmare. Everywhere I looked, pilgrims were in progress: robed at the wheel of cars; riding shotgun on motorcycles; perched on cycles; piled high on roof racks. Most, however, were now on foot, having left vehicles far behind them, or perhaps having arrived by sea. I was reminded of the famous verse in the Quran speaking about Hajj:",

With other hikers safely tucked into tents and shelters, I was at last alone with my fellow creatures of the forest. I pulled my dress even higher and walked faster down into the coolness of Sages Ravine—and the Connecticut-Massachusetts border. When I reached the river crossing, I put my pack on the ground and pulled off my dress. I swirled it in the water—wringing it out away from the creek— and repeated the process, freeing the fabric of salt and dirt. The burbling of the river comforted me as did the feel of the evening air on my naked body. I kicked my shoes off and stepped into the black water. Ripples illuminated by the light of my headlamp shimmered copper. The tannins of the East Coast waterways never ceased to fascinate me. I lowered my body into the iced tea.",

The sensation may be caused by the panoramic glide of the stars past earthly objects, which is perceptible in a few minutes of stillness; or by a fancy that the better outlook upon space afforded by a hill emphasizes terrestial revolution; or by the wind; or by the solitude; but whatever be its origin the impression of riding along is vivid and abiding. The poetry of motion is a phrase much in use, and to enjoy the epic form of that gratification it is necessary to stand on a hill at a small hour of the night, and, first enlarging the consciousness with a sense of difference from the mass of civilized mankind, who are horizontal and disregardful of all such proceedings at this time, long and quietly watch your stately progress through the stars. After such a nocturnal reconnoitre among these astral clusters, aloft from the customary haunts of thought and vision, some men may feel raised to a capability for eternity at once.",

It would be the date, six years later, of his unprecedented arrival, with associates and dogs, at the South Pole. Meanwhile, though, he had tales enough to tell. He had determined, on his voyage, the exact location of the North Magnetic Pole—the other, and more scientific, purpose of his trip. He had spent two winters frozen in ice. He had come near burning the Gjöa to a crisp. In August, less than four months before, he had been trying to pick his way westward through shallow water that had never been sailed, and he felt such stress that he could not eat or sleep. One sounding would be more discouraging than the last. The bottom was a lethal maze. The hull barely slid above it, once with an inch to spare. The Gjöa thus crept westward, and on the western horizon one day there was a sail. “A sail!”",

He is there beside his father and his father’s brothers in the darkness – waiting, silent, waiting – with an unspoken single question in their hearts. They are thinking of an older brother who that night is lying twelve miles away, shot through the lungs. He sees his father’s gaunt, long form in darkness, the big-boned hands, the gaunt, long face, the cold, green-grey, restless and weary eyes, so deep and untelling, so strangely lonely, and the slanting, almost reptilian large formation of the skull that has, somehow, its own strange dignity – as of some one lost. And the great stars of America blaze over them, the vast and lonely earth broods round them, then as now, with its secret and mysterious presences, and then as now the million-footed ululation of the night throngs up from silence the song of all its savage, dark and measureless fecundity. And he lies there in the darkness with his father and the brothers – silent, waiting – their cold, grey eyes turned upward to the loneliness of night, the blazing stars, having no words to say the thing they feel, the dream of time and the dark wonder of man’s destiny which had drenched with blood the old earth, the familiar wheat, and fused that day the image of immortal history in a sleepy country town twelve miles away.",

Distributors target certain intersections which students walk along during breaks between classes or lectures, and leave the scene as quickly as possible. ‘It is difficult to have any sense of achievement with these methods, because you get trapped in a vicious circle,’ said the former activist. ‘You distribute pamphlets, you organize hit-and-run demonstrations, you get arrested, you are severely tortured, and when you are eventually released you begin work again distributing pamphlets.’",

When we parted, we had no idea that we should not see one another for years. I took his baggage with me to Kalimpong and deposited it there. After that I did not hear from him for a year. It seemed as though he had completely disappeared. All sorts of wild rumours went round and many people believed he was dead. It was not until I was again in Europe that I heard he had gone to stay in our fairyland village of Kyirong and had waited there until the Chinese came. He stayed literally until the last minute and got out with even greater difficulty than I had. I was very happy to get a letter from him posted in Nepal telling me that he was alive.",

We had a Mongolian driver, Bata, who spoke no English, and Soko, our tour guide, who spoke excellent English, a fair amount of German, and was an excellent cook. But we were still two Americans alone, feeling like kids pretending to know what they were doing.",

By November the Unit was stationed at St. Quentin in a little hotel, which although very humble, seemed like paradise after the dug-outs.\nA morning came when a handful of the members were together in the coffee-room, huddled round a fire that was principally composed of damp brushwood. At one moment the guns could be heard distinctly, the next, something almost unnatural had happened—there was silence, as though death had turned on himself, smiting his own power of destruction. No one spoke, they just sat and stared at each other with faces entirely devoid of emotion; their faces looked blank, like so many masks from which had been sponged every trace of expression—and they waited—listening to that silence.\nThe door opened and in walked an untidy Poilu; his manner was casual, his voice apathetic: ‘Eh bien, mesdames, c’est l’Armistice.’ But his shining brown eyes were not at all apathetic. ‘Oui, c’est l’Armistice,’ he repeated coolly; then he shrugged, as a man might do who would say: ‘What is all this to me?’ After which he grinned broadly in spite of himself, he was still very young, and turning on his heel he departed.\nStephen said: So it’s over,’ and she looked at Mary, who had jumped up, and was looking in her turn at Stephen.\nMary said: This means…’ but she stopped abruptly.\nBless said: ‘Got a match, anyone? Oh, thanks!’ And she groped for her white-metal cigarette case.\nHoward said: ‘Well, the first thing I’m going to do is to get my hair properly shampooed in Paris.’\nThurloe laughed shrilly, then she started to whistle, kicking the recalcitrant fire as she did so.\nBut funny, old, monosyllabic Blakeney with her curly white hair cropped as close as an Uhlan’s—Blakeney who had long ago done with emotions—quite suddenly laid her arms on the table and her head on her arms, and she wept, and she wept.",

The episode became known as “the bellyache heard round the world.” The hospital was curiously vague about Ruth’s condition and treatment, which led others to suppose that he was being treated for syphilis or some other venereal embarrassment. It now seems evident that whatever ailed Ruth, it was seriously acute and almost certainly gastric. Ruth was in bed for a month and weak enough to need a wheelchair for several days beyond that. Altogether he spent almost seven weeks in the hospital. When he did return to the Yankees, he was sporting a fresh abdominal scar and was a ghost of his former self: he had lost 76 pounds during his illness, and was now a trim but feeble 180 pounds, compared with the 256-pound tub of joviality he had been less than two months earlier.
