When one looks at these hollows and recognises the expression of deep devotion on the faces of the worshippers, one understands why a Christian mission could never succeed in Lhasa. A Lama from the Drebung on a visit to Rome to convert the Catholics would recognise the futility of his mission when he saw the steps of the holy staircase worn down by the knees of countless pilgrims, and would leave the Vatican with resignation. Christianity and Buddhism have much in common. They are both founded on the belief in happiness in another world and both preach humility in this life. But there is a difference as things are today. In Tibet one is not hunted from morning till night by the calls of “civilisation.” Here one has time to occupy oneself with religion and to call one’s soul one’s own. Here it is religion which takes up most room in the life of the individual, as it did in olden days in the West.",

The man looked sixty; one had to explain somehow the fifteen years of white hair and lines he hadn’t really lived. He said again how happy he was; he hadn’t been able to settle in England, his wife was nervy, she had never been out with him, West Africa wouldn’t suit her, she was afraid of moths, and as he spoke, the moths flocked in through the paneless windows to shrivel against the hurricane lamp, the cockchafers and the beetles detonated against the walls and ceiling and fell on our hair. He didn’t mind insects himself, he said, leaping from his chair, hitting at the moths with his hand, squashing the beetles underfoot. (He couldn’t keep still for a moment.) The only thing he feared, he said, was elephants. He had been watching a shoot once beside his motor-cycle when an elephant charged him; it was a hundred yards away and he couldn’t start his cycle. When it was ten yards away he got his cycle started, and after a quarter of a mile at twenty miles an hour he looked back and saw that the elephant hadn’t lost a yard. He got up from his chair again and made for a beetle, but it was too quick for him, driving up against the ceiling. He said he wasn’t lonely, he didn’t know what nerves were—bringing his hand against the wall—he always believed in having one hobby; the last tour it had been the wireless, another tour butterflies, this tour it was his car.",

The nearer of the two is the grave of Emperor Sujin, surrounded by a wide moat of still water, before which stands a majestic torii gate. To either side are rice paddies, and farther back rises the Kushiyama mound. Visitors are rare here, so it is always quiet. In summer, the paddies are awash with green, the leafy boughs of the trees on the mounds reach far over the water in the moat and high up into the sky, while the air pulsates with the droning of cicadas. It is not known who is buried in the Kushiyama mound, and I have no idea who Emperor Sujin was, but walking around the moats I feel as though I have been transported back to Shinto’s legendary ‘Age of the Gods’. Accompanied by the throbbing sound of the cicadas, my heart roams in the distant past. Breaking out of my reverie with a start, I realize we have been standing in front of the graves for over an hour.",

I once went to see the great Vietnamese monk, poet and peacemaker Thich Nhat Hanh speak in New York. It was a characteristically hectic weeknight in the city, and as the crowd pushed and shoved its way into the auditorium, the very air in the place was whisked into a nerve-racking urgency of everyone’s collective stress. Then the monk came on stage. He sat in stillness for a good while before he began to speak, and the audience—you could feel it happening, one row of high-strung New Yorkers at a time—became colonized by his stillness. Soon, there was not a flutter in the place. In the space of maybe ten minutes, this small Vietnamese man had drawn every single one of us into his silence. Or maybe it’s more accurate to say that he drew us each into our own silence, into that peace which we each inherently possessed, but had not yet discovered or claimed. His ability to bring forth this state in all of us, merely by his presence in the room—this is divine power. And this is why you come to a Guru: with the hope that the merits of your master will reveal to you your own hidden greatness.",

By the light of her big square spotlights, which threw bursts of white reflection up from the wet grey stones, the puddled tarmac, I watched a fresh-faced young man in sweater and jeans and trainers catch the bow-ropes (thrown by Bryan and Robbie Mowat) and the stern-ropes (thrown, less accurately, by Sean and Jerry). He was obviously a trawlerman—even I was beginning to be able to identify one, generically: big shoulders, a flat stomach and, most apparent of all, massive leg-muscles: muscles so absurdly well developed that trawlermen seemed to have to buy their trousers many waist-sizes too big: their broad leather belts hold the extra cloth puckered tight.",

I think we all screamed, I know we all wept, but we were speechless, for a new glory and terror had been added to the earth. It is the most unutterable of wonderful things. The words of common speech are quite useless. It is unimaginable, indescribable, a sight to remember for ever, a sight which at once took possession of every faculty of sense and soul, removing one altogether out of the range of ordinary life. Here was the real \"bottomless pit \"-the \"fire which is not quenched\"-\"the place of hell\"-\"the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone \"-the \"everlasting burnings\"-the fiery sea whose waves are never weary. There were groanings, rumblings, and detonations, rushings, hissings, and splashings, and the crashing sound of breakers on the coast, but it was the surging of\" fiery waves upon a fiery shore. But what can I write! Such words as jets, fountains, waves, spray, convey some idea of order and regularity, but here there was none. The inner lake, while we stood there, formed a sort of crater within itself, the whole lava sea rose about three feet, a blowing cone about eight feet high was formed, it was never the same two minutes together. And what we saw had no existence a month ago, and probably will be changed in every essential feature a month hence.",

    "target_paragraph": "I sail my little ship through the morning and the cold, in the wind, through the waves – up the face, down the back, plow into the next face – tiller to port, tiller to starboard. The air is getting colder. I put a black beanie on my head and relish in the increased warmth it brings, like a cat caressing my head, like the embrace of a lover. I don’t need anything else. The clothes I wear and the boat in which I sit, the ocean on which we float and the wind that propels us. There is nothing else.\nBut Ponce Inlet beckons with its succulent hamburgers and dry hotel rooms, heated, clean, motionless. I can feel the warm shower and the soft and still bed. I can see buildings – or are they trees? Grey relief on the horizon. Grey waves, grey sky.\n“How tough are you?”\n“I’m not so tough.”\nMidway through the morning I notice that the waves are no longer sending cold spray into my cold face, and we no longer slam off one wave into the trough behind it. I smile at the realization. My prediction was correct, the decreased fetch produces smaller waves, and the conditions are dramatically better. However, now we are out of the warm Gulf Stream and the temperature has plummeted since yesterday. I now know that it is January, it feels like winter out on the water.\nThe waves have subsided, and so has the wind, yet still my progress is slow. We tack and we tack, sailing into the northwest wind. The city of Port Orange comes into view. Ponce Inlet shows on the chartplotter. I don’t even know if sailboats can navigate this inlet, yet still it beckons. In fact it beckons all day, as progress to windward is slow. We tack away from the inlet, we tack back towards the inlet, away, towards, away, towards. Perhaps Sobrius and I are in an eddy of the Gulf Stream, a reverse current flowing south next to the main current which flows north, caused by the current passing around Cape Canaveral, further pushed by the north wind. Regardless, I don’t want to go back out into the Gulf Stream today.\n“Come on in. How tough are you?”\nI need a weather report, so I get out my handheld VHF and find one. I always keep one of my two handheld radios in the cockpit while the other is on its charger. I hear the robot voice tell me that there is a small-craft-advisory for the Gulf Stream, but the wind should shift to the west later today, which would put us on a beam-reach to St Augustine, perfect.\nI will not go into the inlet, we are too close to give up now. Besides, my starboard bow light, mast tricolor lights, and depth sounder are all out of commission. Navigating the Intracoastal without the lights and the depth sounder would not be safe, and I don’t know where I would anchor for the coming night anyway. We stay in my old friend the mighty Atlantic. Respect.\nThe Atlantic approves.\n“Stay another day and night, you can be home tomorrow. It’ll be nice, don’t give up now.”\n“Thank you, I think we shall continue.”\nMovement in the water to starboard catches my attention – fins break the surface and roll. Dolphin swim up for a visit and then disappear. Two seagulls fly by. I see a white oval about 18 inches across approaching Sobrius, just beneath the surface. Behind the white oval is a large flat animal, gliding through the water without any perceptible movement. A manta ray it is; its wings protrude through the surface like shark fins – the huge white mouth open and taking in food. The bizarre creature swims by Sobrius, I scramble to get video but I don’t get my phone out in time. It glides effortlessly around the stern and out of view, swimming and eating, living its manta-ray life. This area seems to be teeming with wildlife.\nThe wind continues to decrease and the waves follow suit. It is still cold, probably in the forties, but I am relaxed, glad to be comfortable and not fighting the waves anymore. I have plenty of warm clothes, and the warm-stuff locker is my savior this morning. Another manta ray swims by, or perhaps it is the same one.",

As the light strengthened I wondered why sunrise retains the power, in certain surroundings, to awe human beings – to seem so wondrous despite being a daily event.

On my left rose green cliffs or rocky ledges and clumps of feathery bamboo overhung the track. Tall slender trees sported long scarlet blossoms, giving sustenance to the area’s only visible birds – two-inch blue and pink humming-birds, not worth wasting shot on. Some miles away, banks of silver mist drifted between rounded hills. This terrain was untouched, uninhabited; only the distant whisper of a river, far below in a jungly chasm, broke the silence. Beyond the chasm precipitous mountains, rising to pointed summits, wore seamless garments of primary forest.",

So the bus turned southward to run up this stairway slant, to get to the top of the sea's long table-land. So, we emerged: and there was the Mediterranean rippling against the black rocks not so very far away below on our right. For, once on the long table-land the road turned due north, a long white dead-straight road running between strips of moorland, wild and bushy. The sea was in the near distance, blue, blue, and beating with light. It seemed more light than watery. And on the left was the wide trough of the valley, where almond trees like clouds in a wind seemed to poise sky-rosy upon the pale, sun-pale land, and beyond which Orosei clustered its lost grey houses on the bluff. Oh, wonderful Orosei with your almonds and your reedy river, throbbing, throbbing with light and the sea's nearness, and all so lost, in a world long gone by, lingering as legends linger on. It is hard to believe that it is real. It seems so long since life left it and memory transfigured it into pure glamour, lost away like a lost pearl on the east Sardinian coast. Yet there it is, with a few grumpy inhabitants who won't even give you a crust of bread. And probably there is malaria—almost sure. And it would be hell to have to live there for a month. Yet for a moment, that January morning, how wonderful, oh, the timeless glamour of those Middle Ages when men were lordly and violent and shadowed with death.",

    "target_paragraph": "The work had been dilatory. The two end buildings, linking Bernini’s colonnade with the avenue, had stayed half finished for over two years and were not ready for the opening of Holy Year; it was something of a scandal, but a minor one in that particular picture. The architect was Marcello Piacentini, who in his earlier fascist role had destroyed the old crooked approach to Saint Peter’s and put through instead the present pompous avenue, the Via della Conciliazione, named for the Lateran Treaty of 1929. Suddenly Saint Peter’s had dwindled; the colonnade looked arbitrary and a little tawdry, without the old ragged asymmetry it had opposed and with its outer ends dangling. Even Piacentini himself seems to have been partly aware of the damage; all the proportions had been spoiled; the avenue was obviously too wide; he rectified it in time for Holy Year by lining it with two rows of imitation obelisks, the laughingstock of Rome, through which the most revered church in Christendom can now be approached like a pavilion at a World’s Fair. About the two end buildings, which finally did get finished and for the rest of the year housed two huge exhibitions of Catholic art from all over the world, there was nothing to be done. For what was to complete a picture made by Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael and Bernini at least some small talent would have been needed; not that it was lacking in postwar Italy—only the Vatican did not hire it. A further mistake was made in exhibiting, as part of one of the art shows, photographs of the old approach together with the new one.",

The farthest hut is the one to get if you can—another invaluable hint. It is very roomy, and has a sofa, a table, and a big looking-glass, and one window opening to the south and one to the east. Through the east window you see the line of low cliffs with the woods above till they melt into a green plain that stretches off into vagueness towards the haze of Thiessow. Through the south window you see the little island of Vilm, with its one house set about with cornfields, and its woods on the high ground at the back.",

And the great lathes who bought at Stein and Rosen’s must have felt a delicious sensation of comfort and mystery when they looked at him, for his dark, smiling face, with its perfection of large, pearl teeth, and full nose, with the wide, fleshy volutes of the nostrils, gave him a touch of Oriental wizardry.

The snow gets in everywhere, whirled in by the wind, a fine powder which settles on every surface. As comfort and consolation Mallory, Irvine, Somervell and Odell – those four men up there in their tiny shelters, perched precariously on the shoulder of their mountain, enveloped in a blizzard, separated from the nearest sea by a desert and a jungle, and separated from Britain by four more seas – read poetry to each other from Robert Bridges’s anthology The Spirit of Man. They find solace in Coleridge’s Kubla Khan – with its ‘sunny pleasure dome’, its ‘caves of ice’ – in Thomas Gray’s famous elegy, in Shelley’s poem ‘Mont Blanc’, and in Emily Brontë’s mournful lyrics (‘I’ll walk where my own nature would be leading – / Where the wild wind blows on the mountainside’). On their mountainside the snow continues to fall, and it clumps on the outside of the tent, muffling the sounds they make. After a fitful night, Mallory wakes to find himself mired in two inches of snow. Twitching back the tent door, he can see cyclones of ice crystals, gyring and twisting in the air. And beyond them just whiteness: whiteness and the scream of the wild wind.",

Boyne groped his way down the obscure wood-path from his hotel, and walked across the fields to the slopes which Judith and he had climbed on the day of his return from the Lido. It was from that day—he recalled it now—that Rose Sellars’s jealousy of Judith had dated; he had seen it flash across her fixed attentive face when, the next morning, Judith had blurted out an allusion to their ramble. Boyne—he also remembered—had given Mrs. Sellars to understand that on that occasion he had gone off for a walk by himself, “to get the Lido out of his lungs”; very likely his prevarication had first excited her suspicion. For why should he dissemble the fact that he had been with Judith, if Judith was only a child to him, as he said? Why indeed? It seemed as though, in concealing so significant a fact, he had simply, unconsciously, been on his guard against this long-suspected jealousy; as if he had always guessed that the most passionate and irrational of sentiments lurked under Mrs. Sellars’s calm and reasonable exterior. If it were so, it certainly made her more interesting—but also less easy to deal with. For jealousy, to excite sympathy, must be felt by some one who also inspires it. Shared, it was a part of love; unshared, it made love impossible. And Boyne, in his fatuous security, could not imagine feeling jealous of Mrs. Sellars. “Though of course I should hate it like anything, I suppose . . .” But the problem was one that he could only apprehend intellectually.",

The mast and rigging were shaking in the wind with the spinnaker pole and genny dragging in the water. The mainsail boom joined the gear party skinny-dipping over the lee side. I ran to the cockpit and freed the halyards to let the main and genny go, hastily pulling them down and securing them. The havoc finally subsided and I climbed back belowdecks to survey my wet bed and belongings strewn about the tiny cabin.

In that time, Anjali’s face became synonymous with the fight against Section 377. After all, it was her organisation that was the petitioner in the case of Naz Foundation v.

It crossed the room with minute, blundering sounds, preceded by a dry tapping. It emerged into the hall and she screamed, feeling her lungs emptying long after all the air was expelled, and her diaphragm laboring long after her chest was empty, and watched the old man go down the hall at a wide-legged shuffling trot, the stick in one hand and the other elbow cocked at an acute angle from his middle. Running, she passed him—a dim, spraddled figure standing at the edge of the porch—and ran on into the kitchen and darted into the corner behind the stove. Crouching she drew the box out and drew it before her. Her hand touched the child’s face, then she flung her arms around the box, clutching it, staring across it at the pale door and trying to pray. But she could not think of a single designation for the heavenly father, so she began to say “My father’s a judge; my father’s a judge” over and over until Goodwin ran lightly into the room. He struck a match and held it overhead and looked down at her until the flame reached his fingers.",

We wake up to the rumble of wooden wheels of vegetable carts, the clip-clop of cows, the ping of bicycle bells and the cry of “aiiiiiiiyeeeeeeee, aiiiiiiiiiiiiiyeeeeeee” (please come) from the garbage collector. We have breakfast to the sweet songs of the broom man and are further serenaded by the plant seller, the rug cleaner, the curtain maker and sometimes by the flutes of the snake charmers. Occasionally an elephant will clang its bell, or trumpet as it trundles past on its way to perform at a birthday party. By lunchtime the air is filled with the soft thud of ball on bat and cries of “howzat!” As summer builds, the afternoons grow so still that only the crackle of badly tuned transistor radios and the whisper of suburban snores carry through the thick air.",

We left our horses standing with downcast heads under the lee of the mound and picked our way up the sides between the trial trenches of the excavators.

He told me that he and his wife, Val—the cheery woman behind the counter—had been there just three weeks. They were novice gray nomads—retirees (often these days early retirees) who sell up, buy a motor home of some description, and spend their lives on the open road, stopping from time to time to earn a little money, but never tied to anywhere and essentially ever on the move. Six months earlier this would have seemed to me the dreariest punishment imaginable—endlessly driving across a landscape that is mostly hot and dry and empty. But now I understood completely. All that emptiness and dazzling light has a seductive quality that you might actually never tire of—an amazing thought. Besides, Australia is just so full of surprises. There is always something just down the road—a treetop walk, a beach harboring ancient life-forms, museums celebrating improbable Dutch shipwrecks or naked telegraph repairmen, really nice people like Mike and Val Cantrall, a fishing village turning out to see a stricken ship limp home. You never know what it’s going to be but it is nearly always pretty good. Maybe it was just my mood at the time, but I felt I could keep this up for a good long while yet.",

Last night the temperature fell to 38º below freezing, yet by ten o’clock this morning we were sitting in hot sun at 9,000 feet. We are not feeling this dry cold nearly as much as I had expected; Ireland’s penetrating damp cold is far less easy to combat. But our skins are suffering from the complete lack of moisture in the air, though I frequently plaster Rachel with high-altitude lotion. (My own tough old hide is past worrying about.)",

Italians love fireworks, particularly men and boys. The piazzas are full of young people shooting off all kinds of firecrackers that make a 6-year-old opening up a bottle of champagne seem quite safe. In towns and cities, I was told to stay away from windows that faced onto the street to avoid any stray projectiles from New Year’s Eve street shooting—pistols, rifles, and even bazookas. Happily, in my first year in Calabria, I spent New Year’s in a hillside town, ten kilometers from the sea, removed from the more aggressive celebratory bursts of firearms.",
