It was the same wagon drawn by the same mules which had brought Flem Snopes back from Texas in April, and the three men came and went between it and the house, Eck or the negro backing clumsily through the door with the burden between them and Lump Snopes scuttling along beside it in a constant patter of his own exhortations and commands, holding to it, to be sure, but carrying no weight, to load that into the wagon and return, pausing at the door and stepping aside as Mrs Varner bustled out with another armful of small crocks and hermetic jars of fruit and vegetables. The watchers along the fence checked the objects off—the dismantled bed, the dresser, the washstand with its flowered matching bowl and ewer and slop-jar and chamber-pot, the trunk which doubtless contained the wife’s and the child’s clothing, the wooden box which the women at least knew doubtless contained dishes and cutlery and cooking vessels, and lastly a tightly-roped mass of brown canvas. “What’s that?” Freeman said. “It looks like a tent.”",

Pride of place was given to an enormous stuffed crocodile named Sweetheart, who was for a time the most famous in Australia. Sweetheart—who was, despite the effeminate name, a male—had a passionate dislike for outboard engines and used to attack any boats that disturbed his peace. Unusually for a crocodile, he never harmed a person, but he crunched at least fifteen boats and their motors, bringing a certain unexpected liveliness to many a fisherman’s afternoon. In 1979 when it was feared that he would do himself some serious harm—he was constantly being clobbered by propellers—wildlife officials decided to move him somewhere safer. Unfortunately the capture was botched when a cable snagged and Sweetheart drowned. So he was stuffed and put on display in the Darwin museum, where he has been impressing visitors ever since with his very substantial heft: he stretches almost seventeen feet and in life weighed more than seventeen hundred pounds.",

That phrase “Parlay cheval ou” is in daily, hourly use in Haiti and no doubt it is used as a blind for self-expression. There are often many drunken people in the cemeteries who claim to be “mounted.” The way to differentiate between the persons really “mounted” and the frauds is to require them to swallow some of the drink of Guedé and to wash their whole face in it. The faker will always draw back because he fears to get that raw rum and hot pepper in his eyes, while the subject really mounted will do it. They do it without being told and it never seems to injure them. So one is forced to the conclusion that a great deal of the Guedé “mounts” have something to say and lack the courage to say it except under the cover of Brave Guedé.",

My heart is a pounding pile driver. The heavy work wrings the air from my lungs and my mind battles with my limbs for the opportunity to breathe. Terminal darkness and chaos surround me. Get out, get out, she’s going down! In one rhythmic movement I rocket upward, thrust the hatch forward, and catapult my shaking body onto the deck, leaving my package of hope behind.",

Of all the carriages that leave the arch of the Opera House, not one turns eastward, and when the little thief is caught in the empty market-place no one in black-and-white or rose-coloured evening dress blocks the way by pausing with a hand upon the carriage door to help or condemn—though Lady Charles, to do her justice, sighs sadly as she ascends her staircase, takes down Thomas à Kempis, and does not sleep till her mind has lost itself tunnelling into the complexity of things. ‘Why? Why? Why?’ she sighs. On the whole it’s best to walk back from the Opera House. Fatigue is the safest sleeping draught.",

    "target_paragraph": "THE DINING CAR looked more like a Chinese laundry than a restaurant—noisy, frenzied, boiling hot. Warm Chinese beer was being handed out and I grabbed one from a passing tray as everyone else seemed to do. The car was packed and I saw no seats, but then Pierre, the French saxophone player I’d met at the Mongolian Embassy, waved from across the room, pointing to half a seat. “So,” he said, putting an arm around my shoulder, “you made it.” He was sitting at a boisterous table of European travelers—Swiss, French, German and Dutch. They were all speaking assorted European languages, though French seemed predominant. When I joined them they switched to English but I told them French or German was all right.\nA small fan blew overhead, the kind a secretary might put on her desk, but the heat continued to rise. Everyone was sweating. Plates of delicious fried meats, sautéed vegetables, rice, were being passed. “Open the window,” Pierre shouted in French. Someone who spoke broken Chinese shouted the same thing. The soaking waitress ignored our pleas. Someone opened a window and the cook went wild, screaming in Chinese, slamming it shut. “Dust,” he yelled which someone translated, “dust.” We drank our warm beer and ate hot food as we baked in the sun.\nThe heat did not let up and felt close to a hundred and twenty at times. None of the Chinese porters would permit windows to be open. “The desert,” our porter explained to me. But finally in our car protests were mounting. At last he let us open the windows in our individual compartments if we kept the doors shut. Cecilia had gone to the dining room to sit, for I don’t believe she actually ever dined, and left me alone at the open window, dust blowing in my face.\nThe landscape had altered. From the farmlands and rice paddies we moved into a mountainous, more arid terrain as we crossed the Northern Chinese province of Inner Mongolia. Though we had yet to reach the desert, a scrub grassland reached to the horizon with occasional sheep grazing. I sat as the day shifted to evening and the heat subsided.\nAt eight-forty that evening we reached the outpost of Erhlien, the border town between Inner and Outer Mongolia. It was the gateway to Russia, Mongolia being a Soviet protectorate. The station was old-fashioned, like something out of the American West—a small, wood-slat structure. Chinese border guards came onto the train. After checking our passports and visas, they told us we could leave the train.\nI stood on the platform, breathing the cool evening air. It was unclear how long our stop was, but to my surprise and almost fear, suddenly they took the train away. I watched as it receded, disappearing behind us. The Chinese Muslim men smiled benignly, but the Europeans seemed dismayed. Then I recalled the words of a friend who’d taken this trip before. “At the borders,” he’d told me, “they take the trains away.” They have to change the wheels because the track has a different grade, which in part makes international hijacking impossible across Asia and Europe. Also they take the train away because each country has its own dining car and now for Mongolia the new car must be attached.\nI was happy to leave the train and walk in the cool night air. It was a lovely night now and a foil moon shone overhead. All the travelers went into the station house, but I walked the platform. Chinese Muslim men strolled, but their women were nowhere in sight. In fact the Chinese Muslim women would never leave the train. They would not be seen in public. Instead they remained in their compartments, facing Mecca, eating from the giant sacks of food they had brought and cooking on small portable stoves in their compartments. I always knew where East was and roughly the time of day because the Muslim women would be facing East at specific times.\nI went into the station where a small postal service was open. I bought stamps and began to write postcards from the border of Inner and Outer Mongolia, to many people seemingly the most remote place on earth, though in fact it was fairly accessible. I bought a bag of stewed apricots and a warm orange soda from a small stand. I sat in the station on a wooden bench, writing cards while border guards patrolled around me and a bolero of bullfighting music played incongruously on the overhead speakers.\nOn the platform an hour or so later, I ran into the Chinese Muslims I’d sat next to on the floor of the Chinese International Travel Services office. We greeted one another like long-lost friends. They laughed, happy to see me, and pointed to my pen which remained in my hand. One made a sweeping motion as if to wipe sweat off his brow, indicating how hot they had been. Then they pointed to the yellow moon over Mongolia, clasped their hands as if in blessing, and smiled.\nAt about midnight the train returned with new wheels and a Mongolian dining car and we crossed into the People’s Republic of Mongolia. The temperature had dropped considerably and it was actually cool. I grabbed a sweater from my compartment. Then after perhaps half a mile the train stopped and Mongolian passport officials boarded. They had wide bronze faces, reminiscent of the indigenous peoples of America. Some theories of human migration say that these ancient Central Asian peoples crossed the Bering Strait and were the first inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere, the people from whom all the Native Americans descended.\nBut now their being part of the police state was clear. The train was thoroughly searched. Beneath bunks, overhead racks, suitcases were moved aside to search for contraband. Then, at 1 A.M., they left and we entered Mongolia.\nI found I could not sleep so I wandered to the darkened new dining car, which, with arching windows, scalloped seats, red curtains, looked more like a mosque than a dining car. Pierre was sitting with two Dutch girls. The Mongolian dining crew—a man and his wife—were already setting up for breakfast. They worked noiselessly in the background.\nPierre ordered a bottle of Mongolian vodka and poured drinks all around. The man, who wore a small, brightly colored skullcap, and the woman, with a scarf around her head, both with sharp Mongolian features, wide, flat faces, brought glasses out and joined us. They raised their glasses and we raised ours. Then we sat in the darkened car, watching the beginnings of a moonlit Gobi rush by, drinking Mongolian vodka into the night.",

Then, having crossed the river by a startlingly posh new bridge, we arrived at Trisuli Bazaar just as darkness fell and are spending the night in a ramshackle eating-house that calls itself an hotel – having evidently ‘got notions’, as we say in Ireland, since so many Indians came to work here. This small town is built on a steep slope directly above the river, and all the streets are smelly flights of steps. As usual in Nepal the men seem to spend most of their evening hours gambling intently, and it was difficult to get the hotel-keeper away from his cards for long enough to lead us to the top of a dark, narrow stairway. We have a most luxuriously furnished room to ourselves – with no less than three straw mattresses on the floor; but these are probably the headquarters of an army of bed-bugs so I have urged Mingmar to sleep on all three and am hoping that the army will concentrate on his impervious body. My own sleeping-bag has been laid in the centre of the mud floor, as far away as possible from the presumably infested walls.",

After that, for a week, he drove me over every morning to Corbury Flats, and on my return in the afternoon met me again and carried me back through the icy night to Starkfield. The distance each way was barely three miles, but the old bay’s pace was slow, and even with firm snow under the runners we were nearly an hour on the way. Ethan Frome drove in silence, the reins loosely held in his left hand, his brown seamed profile, under the helmet-like peak of the cap, relieved against the banks of snow like the bronze image of a hero. He never turned his face to mine, or answered, except in monosyllables, the questions I put, or such slight pleasantries as I ventured. He seemed a part of the mute melancholy landscape, an incarnation of its frozen woe, with all that was warm and sentient in him fast bound below the surface; but there was nothing unfriendly in his silence. I simply felt that he lived in a depth of moral isolation too remote for casual access, and I had the sense that his loneliness was not merely the result of his personal plight, tragic as I guessed that to be, but had in it, as Harmon Gow had hinted, the profound accumulated cold of many Starkfield winters.",

It seemed impossible to break the spell of quiet joy which his presence laid on her, and when he began to talk of the place they had just visited she answered his questions and then waited for what he should say next...No, decidedly she could not speak; she no longer even knew what she had meant to say...",

Her low rich laughter bubbled up softly from the vat of the dark. ‘Miss Brown’ rocked quietly and decorously by herself. She was a heavily built and quietly dressed woman of thirty-nine years, touched with that slightly comic primness – that careful gentility – that marks the conduct of the prostitute incognito. She was being very refined. She was a perfect lady and would, if aroused, assert the fact.",

So closely was Melville guarded that he never dreamed of the existence of this valley, though he must continually have met its inhabitants, for they belonged to Typee. We rode through the same abandoned pae-paes, but as we neared the sea we found a profusion of cocoanuts, breadfruit trees and taro patches, and fully a dozen grass dwellings. In one of these we arranged to pass the night, and preparations were immediately put on foot for a feast. A young pig was promptly despatched, and while he was being roasted among hot stones, and while chickens were stewing in cocoanut milk, I persuaded one of the cooks to climb an unusually tall cocoanut palm. The cluster of nuts at the top was fully one hundred and twenty-five feet from the ground, but that native strode up to the tree, seized it in both hands, jack-knived at the waist so that the soles of his feet rested flatly against the trunk, and then he walked right straight up without stopping. There were no notches in the tree. He had no ropes to help him. He merely walked up the tree, one hundred and twenty-five feet in the air, and cast down the nuts from the summit. Not every man there had the physical stamina for such a feat, or the lungs, rather, for most of them were coughing their lives away. Some of the women kept up a ceaseless moaning and groaning, so badly were their lungs wasted. Very few of either sex were full-blooded Marquesans. They were mostly half- breeds and three-quarter-breeds of French, English, Danish, and Chinese extraction. At the best, these infusions of fresh blood merely delayed the passing, and the results led one to wonder whether it was worth while.",

One of them was an adolescent female, possibly pregnant, whose curled toes indicate she may have been finding grip difficult on the slippery ground. Male footprints have been discovered following red- and roe-deer tracks, with deeper imprints and a purposeful line suggesting that the men were running, presumably hunting.",

As she was fully attired, and the interval since his calling her had been but two or three minutes, she must have been dressed or nearly so before he went to summon her. Her hair was twisted up in a large round mass at the back of her head, and she had put on one of the new frocks – a pale blue woollen garment with neck-frillings of white. Her hands and face appeared to be cold, and she had possibly been sitting dressed in the bedroom a long time without any fire.

In general, carers are confined to the children’s ward; a rare exception may obtain a concessionary permit to walk daily for half-an-hour in the hospital’s cramped and vehicle-polluted grounds. A second family member – even a mother – may not visit under any circumstances. Nor may different relatives share in the caring; whoever originally accompanies the child cannot be replaced. Few of these cases are short-term; many patients and carers are imprisoned for four, six, eight months or even longer. Yet no child may ever leave the ward, though their condition might benefit from fresh air ’n’ exercise. Anna knew of only a single easing of the ‘one carer’ rule; after a father had spent eight months tending a daughter blinded by a brain tumour, the mother was allowed a three-week visit. ‘Next month,’ Anna told us, ‘that father and daughter can go home to Gaza at the end of their thirteen-month ordeal. Braille schooling will be privately provided by a British NGO.’",
