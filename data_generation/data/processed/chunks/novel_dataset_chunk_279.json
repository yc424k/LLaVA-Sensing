D’Urberville’s knock, his walk up to the door, had some indescribable quality of difference from his air when she last saw him. They seemed to be acts of which the doer was ashamed. She thought that she would not open the door; but, as there was no sense in that either, she arose, and having lifted the latch stepped back quickly. He came in, saw her, and flung himself down into a chair before speaking.",

I have lost the hunger for the chase and have stopped seeing the world as a story; as something I can package, explain, reveal and talk about as if it’s distant and different from myself. It occurs to me perhaps that’s why I feel so sad and depressed—as a journalist and a broadcaster I was so busy regurgitating information and analyzing words and events I didn’t make the emotional space to truly process them and let them sit still with my soul. Now I am a citizen again and I’m viewing the current war as an ordinary human watching my species fail. I don’t want to go to war, to learn missile names or to be part of the action in a bubble of bravado. I feel more vulnerable to sorrow but more connected to humanity.",

Within seconds they step back over the border into Thailand, with another two weeks on their passports, or maybe more if they’re lucky.

I did feel, though, that all of Mr. Yorick’s capacity for boundless curiosity and high humor would have been stretched by the bar in Dallas City. Looking for something to fasten my affections on, I fastened them on the river. Myrtles were native to Florida, and there were no true cypresses this side of the Rockies. There were some willows out on Dallas Island, swirling from side to side and touching their toes like gymnasts, but they couldn’t match the dazzling motions of the water. Torn and furrowed, it was like streaky jade. It frothed on the shore in a long rime of cotton candy and shook the few still-standing piles of a smashed jetty. Thick white smoke from a factory on the Iowa bank was flattened by the wind and blown low over the river.\n“What’s that place over there where the smoke’s coming from?”\n“Huh?”\n“Over there. The factory …”\n“First Miss.”\n“Yes, but what does it do?”\nThe man stared out the window. He’d answered one question. He was damned if he could be bothered to answer two. The next man along the bar growled, “Makes nitrogen.”\n“Oh. Thanks.”\n“You’re welcome.”\nI didn’t feel it. I went back to Sterne.\nThe man who either difdains or fears to walk up a dark entry, may be an excellent good man, and fit for a hundred things; but he will not do to make a good fentimental traveller.",

Archer, remaining seated, watched the light movements of her figure, so girlish even under its heavy furs, the cleverly planted heron wing in her fur cap, and the way a dark curl lay like a flattened vine spiral on each cheek above the ear. His mind, as always when they first met, was wholly absorbed in the delicious details that made her herself and no other. Presently he rose and approached the case before which she stood. Its glass shelves were crowded with small broken objects—hardly recognisable domestic utensils, ornaments and personal trifles—made of glass, of clay, of discoloured bronze and other time-blurred substances.",

For he saw somehow that he was lost – that there was nothing for him now but shadows on the wall – Circean make-believe – that world of moonlight, magic and painted smoke that ‘the river people’ knew. For three days he himself had breathed the poppied fumes of all its glorious unreality, and in those three short days the world from which he came – his father’s earth of blood and sweat and stinking day and bitter agony – this world of violence and toil and strife and cruelty and terror, this swarming world of nameless lives and mongrel faces, with all its ugliness – had become phantasmal as an evil dream, until now he could scarcely endure the hot and savage swelter, the savage fury, of the unceasing city. To grope and sweat and thrust and curse his way again among the unceasing flood-tides of the grimy swarming pavements; to be buffeted, stunned, bewildered, deadened, and exhausted by the blind turmoil, the quenchless thirst and searching, the insatiate hunger and the black despair of all that bleak and fruitless struggle, that futile and unceasing strife – and to come to this! To come to this!",

No place in Colombia is more than a day removed from every natural habitat to be found on earth. Cities as cultured as any in the Americas were for most of their history linked one to another by trails traveled only by mules. Over time, the wild and impossible geography found its perfect coefficient in the topography of the Colombian spirit: restive, potent, at times placid and calm, in moments tortured and twisted, like a mountain that shakes, crumbles, and slips to the sea. Magic becomes the antidote to fear and uncertainty. Reality comes into focus through the reassuring lens of the phantasmagoric. A god that has given so much to a nation, as Colombians never fail to acknowledge, always gets his piece on the back end.",

Bamboo-covered ravines, flower-roofed heights, rich in green foliage, picturesque because of a rushing and winding stream, itself set in the midst of high mountains – such were the characteristic features of Pokhara. The stream’s waters are milky white, probably on account of their carrying in them particles of mountain clay. In all my travels in the Himalayas I saw no scenery as enchanting as that which enraptured me at Pokhara. Another thing notable about that place was that it was the cheapest spot in Nepal for all kinds of commodities.’",

By 1989 Pfütze was very high in the Stasi, answerable directly to the one man in East Germany who had a Roman emperor’s power over life and death – Erich Mielke, chief of the Stasi. East Germans joked grimly that their country was in the hands of two Erichs (the other one was Erich Honecker, leader of the GDR). In his memoir of his service for the Stasi, Pfütze didn’t mention any interrogation rooms or political prisoners. Instead, he recalled leisurely summers at Golden Sands, so leisurely that Erich Mielke himself, sunbathing with his wife on a politburo-only beach, looked up from his beach towel and sent Pfütze straight to the changing cabins to strip to his trunks before he reported again. The Stasi had their own chartered planes that took them to ‘special operations’ such as the surveillance of the Black Sea coast.",

There wasn’t a shred of skin left on my foot, and that wasn’t the worst of it. My toes were plastered together in a stinking pulp of blood, pus, and mud. My bare foot was so sensitive that the slightest breeze passing over it was like a thousand tiny needles stabbing into my festering flesh.

From this dark old aunt of doom, and from the drawling voices of his Joyner kin, a dark picture of his mother’s world, his mother’s time, all the universe of the Joyner lives and blood, was built up darkly, was wrought out slowly, darkly, with an undefined but overwhelming horror, in the memory, mind, and spirit of the boy. On Winter evenings, as Aunt Maw talked in her croaking monotone by the light of a greasy little lamp—they never had electric lights in his grandfather’s cottage—George heard lost voices in the mountains long ago, the wind-torn rawness, the desolate bleakness of lost days in March along clay-rutted roads in the bleak hills a hundred years ago:",

Then a hardwood lumber concern had bought up the cypress swamps nearby and established a factory in the town. It was financed by eastern capital and operated by as plausible and affable a set of brigands as ever stole a county. They robbed the stockholders and the timber owners and one another and spent the money among the local merchants, who promptly caught the enthusiasm, and presently widows and orphans in New York and New England were buying Stutz cars and imported caviar and silk dresses and diamond watches at three prices, and the town bootleggers and the moonshiners in the adjacent swamps waxed rich, and every fourth year the sheriff’s office sold at public auction for the price of a Hollywood bungalow. People in the neighboring counties learned of all this and moved there and chopped all the trees down and built themselves mile after mile of identical frame houses with garage to match: the very air smelled of affluence and burning gasoline. Yes, there was money there, how much, no two estimates ever agreed; whose, at any one given time, God Himself could not have said. But it was there, like that afflatus of rank fecundity above a foul and stagnant pool on which bugs dart spawning, die, are replaced in mid-darting; in the air, in men’s voices and gestures, seemingly to be had for the taking. That was why Belle had chosen it.",

Low circular tables, all ready laid with glasses and with communal dishes of roast and steaming lamb skilfully hacked from the carcases turning outside and sprinkled with rock salt, were being moved in and wedged among the company as tightly as jig-saw pieces. Glass jugs of wine were beginning to travel from hand to hand overhead. Glasses clashed convivially together, miraculously half-filling again as soon as they were drained; plates were returning again and again for second or third helpings. Outside the window a swarm of guests feasted under the trees. Whole lambs were being flourished sizzling and smoking on their spits and we could hear the crash of cleaver on block and the crunch of hewn bones as a sinewy nomad toiled like a headsman to keep pace with two hundred magnificent appetites. Nothing accompanied this delicious roast except for cross-sections of dark and excellent bread sliced from loaves like minor millstones hot from the domed ovens outside. It was, in a way, a Stone Age banquet. Strangers, on occasions like these, are the objects of eager solicitude: special titbits, forkfuls of liver and kidney, and yet more recondite morsels are constantly being proffered and helpings of brain are delved from heads which have been bisected lengthwise and opened like a casket, each half, sometimes, still equipped with a singed and twisting horn. Avoidance of the sheep’s eyes is a recurrent problem for outsiders. They are highly prized by mountaineers but for all but the most assimilated travellers the message they flash from the prongs is one of harrowing reproach.",

A normally severe hailstorm (not freakish) produces stones the size of cricket balls with jagged needle-sharp protuberances which shatter car windows and wreck the rest of the vehicle. In olden times travellers used their saddles to protect their heads and, if they were lucky, could afterwards crawl home – frequently leaving a dead horse behind. The unlucky were badly concussed and died hours later, where they had fallen, of hypothermia.",

Sometimes the flats and churches and hotels of Westminster are like the outlines of Constantinople in a mist; sometimes the river is an opulent purple, sometimes mud-coloured, sometimes sparkling blue like the sea. It is always worth while to look down and see what is happening. But this lady looked neither up nor down; the only thing she had seen, since she stood there, was a circular iridescent patch slowly floating past with a straw in the middle of it.

Filtered, diffuse daylight falls from above through small openings, making blue and yellow tracks and leaving all the depth of the mosque in shadow. On worn mats, the people of Kenadsa and the nomads pray. To the right, under a larger, dormer window, bathed in warmer light, the talebs, students and professors of the medersa, chant the Koran.

Royalist forces remained active in Peru; within a year, Lima would be back in their hands. San Martín, whose armies had liberated Argentina, Chile, and much of Peru, came north to confer with Bolívar. They met privately on July 26, 1822, in Guayaquil, on the Pacific coast of Ecuador. What was said will never be known; no secretaries were present, and no record of their conversation has been found. What is known is what came of the meeting: a stunning reversal of fortunes that has baffled historians to this day. Even as Bolívar accepted command of all republican forces, San Martín, a revered general, who had marched his Army of the Andes the breadth of a continent, lifting it to the heights of glory as they crossed the cordillera to liberate Chile, resigned his commission and walked away from war. Having made public a personal vow to never again engage in politics or military affairs, San Martín, still young at forty-four, abandoned the Americas altogether, moving to France, where he would die in exile. On the eve of final victory, with independence at hand, San Martín slipped off the stage of history.",

A small Nome airline, Cape Smythe Air, flies to Little Diomede in winter when ice conditions permit. Unfortunately, so far this year the ice hadn’t been thick enough to make a good runway, the person at Cape Smythe told me. She said she didn’t think they’d be flying to Little Diomede this winter at all. The other choice, Evergreen Helicopter, also in Nome, provides service to Little Diomede whether there’s an ice runway or not. Evergreen Helicopter is a two-person operation consisting of the pilot, Eric Penttila, and his mechanic.",

That day, I'd waited at home in vain for hours because he had faithfully promised that some proofs would be delivered before three o'clock. When I marched in on the peaceful scene in the smoking room, only a fit of sneezing prevented my delivering him a stinging scolding. At the sound of the sneezes, Pei-yu looked up at me sharply.
