They looked at one another with the sudden startled look of people who feel the interruption of an intense silence around them – for the Leopold for two hours had been steeped in this silence of sleep, and they now experienced its living and animate presence for the first time. A good many sensations of guilt – all but the real one – flashed through their minds: that they had been drinking and making more noise than they should, and that a guest had complained to the office about them; or that someone had discovered that Robert had a woman in his room, and that, in the interests of hotel decorum, she was to be commanded to leave and go to her own quarters. The rapping on the door was repeated, more brisk and loud. They were all very still, Robert looked at Eugene nervously, remembering, perhaps, the sum of his past errors at the hotel and his precarious standing there.",

I couldn’t see it. The little valley in which I was ran roughly east and west. I traveled westward, toward the sierra. But it was still too near the fatal path. I stooped low and ran up over the hill, without looking back. Beyond was another, higher, and then another still. Running over the hills, walking in the sheltered valleys, I bore steadily northwest, toward the always-nearing mountains. Soon there were no more sounds. The sun burned fiercely down, and the long ridges of desolate country wavered in the heat. High chaparral tore my clothes and face. Underfoot were cactuses, century plants, and the murderous espadas, whose long, interlaced spikes slashed my boots, drawing blood at every step; and beneath them sand and jagged stones. It was terrible going. The big still forms of Spanish bayonet, astonishingly like men, stood up all around the skyline. I stood stiffly for a moment on the top of a high hill, in a clump of them, looking back. The hacienda was already so far away that it was only a white blur in the immeasurable reaches of the desert. A thin line of dust moved from it toward the Puerta—the colorados taking back their dead to Mapimi.",

Two laid-back Dutch biker couples are finishing an English breakfast prepared by Sister Mango and Younger Cousin Mango, both of whom are very cheerful. Instant coffee is produced instantly, and my breakfast put on the grill. Too bad it’s English. They’re puzzled to be asked about rice vegetable soup, two beautiful bowls of which steam to one side, but to which I am not entitled. Younger Cousin gets the key and my bags while I dine amongst the tattooed. I’m feeling better already.",

I shall spend the months in the garden, and on the plain, and in the forests. I shall watch the things that happen in my garden, and see where I have made mistakes. On wet days I will go into the thickest parts of the forests, where the pine needles are everlastingly dry, and when the sun shines I'll lie on the heath and see how the broom flares against the clouds. I shall be perpetually happy, because there will be no one to worry me. Out there on the plain there is silence, and where there is silence I have discovered there is peace.\"",

It’s tinny and faint, but so lovely and out-of-place in this rapidly modernizing city that our feet are drawn toward it. As we amble along under gracious old trees, we come upon a tiny park, with rusting, rickety workout equipment dispersed around a concrete slab. It’s from decades ago, a Communist-era perk to spur public well-being. “Look Bernard, there’s no one on any of these things,” I say, so used to the masses at Beijing’s tourist spots that I can’t believe there’s no queue for this stuff. Bernard does a few chin-ups and sit-ups, while I wobble along the balance beam. It’s a balmy late-May night, and we’re not the only ones out taking advantage of it. Some young couples, pudgy and round-shouldered, stand nearby. Their kids pedal tricycles in between the rings and the parallel bars. Everyone eyes us with unabashed curiosity, perhaps amazed to discover these sculptural relics have a use. Bernard hoists himself higher and I’m more acrobatic to please our audience.",

It ran for almost twenty miles, and for four hours, all there were dead trees on either side of the channel. They looked like ghosts reaching up to the sky.

The great naturalist and his associate Aimé Bonpland, along with Simón Bolívar, had gathered to discuss colonial politics. As Bolívar made his case for revolution, he asked Humboldt whether the people of the Americas were ready to govern themselves. Refusing to take the bait, Humboldt agreed that the colonies were ready for freedom; what they lacked was a leader to show them the way.",

I have spoken in a soft soothing voice in her direction for weeks on end, but I remain a stranger, and whenever I come near her she races around her stake in the tight circles it prescribes, while from her throat comes a threat so guttural and wild that it calls into question the strength of the chain and the fence. Her mother was pure wolf, from Anaktuvuk Pass, dug out of a den by Eskimos. Tara—pale, silken, a flowing runner when she pulls a sled—has the long legs of the timber wolf, and they fairly whirl her around the stake, a flying blur, but, as fast as they move her, her eyes are always on mine. Her eyes are ochre. She once got out, and slit the throat of Andrea’s pet dog, Lazarus. Lazarus survived. But I have no doubt that if Tara were to come off that chain and out of that pen as I am passing by, there would be nothing much left of me but a rubber hoof and a little hair on the unencircled ground.",

I think the heat would have finished me today but for the fact that five nullahs appeared during the last twenty miles. Not that they made much difference to the temperature, as all were in deep clefts between mountains and there was no growth around them, but I got into them fully clothed and soaked myself for about fifteen minutes from head to boots. After another fifteen minutes I was bone dry again yet these immersions kept my temperature down somewhat. The water was just pleasantly cool, not icy as in the Gilgit Valley – otherwise I daren’t have plunged in when so over-heated. But as these nullahs are also from melting glaciers, this shows how hot the region is. Anyway heat shouldn’t be one of my worries tomorrow as surely even in June the Babusar Pass will be cool. Beyond a doubt I find such heat absolutely prostrating: maybe other constitutions can take it better.",

We were heading north across a plain bounded on either side by a range of hills. On either horizon, Louisa noticed that the mountain peaks were topped by cairns. The cadre saw her pointing it out to me and scribbled something on a sheet of paper. He handed it to her. He had written the numeral 108.

Indeed it is the sun and not the snow which is the chief peril this year. On the deserts near Kampa Dzong everyone’s face gets burnished to the colour of chestnut. Fissures open in Mallory’s lips and cheeks, and he keeps a pot of grease with him to rub into them. He walks with a shepherd’s crook, and grows a goatee beard. Irvine wears his motorcycle helmet and goggles in an unsuccessful attempt to keep out the wind and the sun. Despite the sunburn, Mallory feels fitter than in any previous year, and his guts are holding firm for once. The sense keeps growing in him that there will be closure this time, one way or the other. To Ruth he writes that ‘it is almost unthinkable that I shan’t get to the top; I can’t see myself coming down defeated’. To his friend Tom Longstaff he is even more adamant: ‘We are going to sail to the top this time and God with us – or stamp to the top with our teeth in the wind.’ There are other reasons for feeling good about it all: this year the quail are in foie gras, not aspic, and the champagne is vintage – 1915 Montebello.",

He squeezed my arm and wished me a safe journey. I watched his light disappear back toward Phantom Ranch and I shook my bottle of chlorine tablets, smiling as though it was a bottle of gold. My eyes adjusted to the darkness well enough to see the outline of the three-person tent that had taken me over an hour to set up. It seemed much smaller now that darkness enveloped it. The hair on the back of my neck prickled, and I hurried over to the tent and crawled in. I slipped the chlorine tablets into my backpack and closed my eyes.",

He is on the Bridge at night,’ and, handing him his cup, or whatever it might be, would run on to visions of shipwreck and disaster, in which all the passengers come tumbling from their cabins, and there is the captain, buttoned in his peajacket, matched with the storm, vanquished by it but by none other. ‘Yet I have a soul,’ Mrs jarvis would bethink her, as Captain Barfoot suddenly blew his nose in a great red bandanna handkerchief, ‘and it’s the man’s stupidity that’s the cause of this, and the storm’s my storm as well as his’ … so Mrs jarvis would bethink her when the Captain dropped in to see them and found Herbert out, and spent two or three hours, almost silent, sitting in the arm-chair.

Around midnight, Jean showed up on the jetty, his teeth chattering in his head, his eyes blood-shot. He was running a high fever; it was all he could do to walk to the harbour to tell me not to wait. Rescue was impossible, he would never be able to leave; he saw his fate with despair. Clearly he believed in black magic but I figured his demon lover could doctor his food with inedible mushrooms, snake venom, cat piss, whatever she found handy and bad for the digestion, every time he acted restless. I urged him to come anyway, sick as he was; perhaps the witch’s spell wore out by nautical miles. He wouldn’t risk my safety, the weather was uncertain enough without evil incantations.",

The lanes he followed ran pale between the broad spread of fields felt rather than seen, where the corn was beginning to fire and the cotton to bloom, then into tunnels of trees rising and feathered lushly with summer’s full leaf against the sky of August heavy and thick with stars. Then they were in the old lane which for years now had been marked by nothing save the prints of Varner’s old white horse and, for a brief time, by the wheels of the parasol-topped runabout—the old scar almost healed now, where thirty years ago a courier (perhaps a neighbor’s slave flogging a mule taken out of the plow) had galloped with the news of Sumter, where perhaps the barouche had moved, the women swaying and pliant in hooped crinoline beneath parasols, the men in broadcloth riding the good horses at the wheels, talking about it, where the son and perhaps the master himself had ridden into Jefferson with his pistols and his portmanteau and a body-servant on the spare horse behind, talking of regiments and victory; where the Federal patrols had ridden the land peopled by women and negro slaves about the time of the battle of Jefferson.",

Tall fir trees along the Hotel Sibir’s entryway had been covered in holiday lights of the same locally popular midnight blue, to which the mist had added its pointillism. Bounding from the car, Anatoly carried my bag into the intimately lit lobby and saw that I got checked in.

In the shaded north-east-facing corries and crags of that great mountain, old snow often lies all year round, sintering slowly into ice, sitting in cold stagnancy, the snow breeding its own little ice age. It’s a reminder that winter never really leaves the Cairngorms, or rather that this is the point from which the cold musters itself again each year, and out of which it pours. A reminder, too, that the summit of the Lairig Ghru was, 12,000 years ago, not a watershed but an ice-shed: the point from which glaciers crept seawards to north and south, scouring out the shape of the Highland landscape we now know, scavenging into the granite.",
