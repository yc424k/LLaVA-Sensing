And a list of less glorious projects: figuring out the septic system, which sends out a frightening turnip smell when lots of people are using the house; cleaning and repointing the stone walls of the cantina; rebuilding sections of stone walls that have collapsed on several terraces; retiling the butterfly bathroom. These would have seemed major once and now just seem like things on a list.

Daily invitations and visits and banquets that lasted for hours were our lot, as we were passed from hand to hand like a couple of animal prodigies. We were soon sick of this idle life and hankered for work and sport. Beyond a small ground for basket-ball Lhasa made no provision for games. The young Tibetans and Chinese who played basket-ball were very glad when we offered to play with them. There were also hot shower-baths in the square, but a single shower-bath cost ten rupees—an enormous price when one thinks that a sheep costs no more.",

    "target_paragraph": "Historically, the bergamot has been used by Calabrians for centuries. While the fruit’s bitter quality precludes eating it like an orange, the juice is traditionally used in cakes and cookies. The liquor Bergamino is also a classic, made from the bergamot’s peel. As the rind hardens to a wooden consistency when dried, the hollowed-out skin was also used to make small lanterns and snuff boxes. The fruit’s medicinal properties have long since been embraced by Calabrians as well. The oil was used as both insect repellent and as a cure for mosquito bites. To heal wounds, the fruit was cut open, gently heated and applied directly to affected areas. In the nineteenth century, the juice was used in the treatment of malaria. And as early as 1804, a Calabrian doctor presented his thesis at the University of Pavia documenting the bergamot’s reparative properties with regard to lesions.",

    "target_paragraph": "The English traveller the Hon. Robert Curzon is still considered one of the worst offenders: after a quick circuit around the monastic libraries of Athos in the late 1840s (in the company, I am ashamed to say, of my great-great-uncle), Curzon left the Holy Mountain with his trunks bulging with illuminated manuscripts and Byzantine chrysobuls; in his travel book Visits to Monasteries in the Levant he writes of buying the priceless manuscripts from the Abbot by weight, as if they were figs or pomegranates in an Ottoman market. Worse still is the memory of the German bibliophile Herman Tischendorff. Some twenty years after Curzon’s trip to Athos, Tischendorff left the Greek Orthodox Monastery of St Catherine’s in Sinai with the Codex Sinaiaticus – still the earliest existing copy of the New Testament – tucked into his camel bags. Tischendorff later claimed that he found the various leaves of the manuscript in a basket of firewood, and that he had saved it from the monks, who were intent on burning it to keep them warm in winter. The monks, however, maintain to this day that Tischendorff got the librarian drunk and discreetly swapped the priceless manuscript – which, like Curzon’s plunder, duly found its way into the British Library – for a bottle of good German schnapps.",

    "target_paragraph": "After high school, Clarence attended Iowa State College, as it then was called, and acquired a degree in engineering. He learned to fly while serving with the Signal Corps during the First World War. He became a flight instructor and never saw battle?indeed, never left America. Like most other pilots, after the war Chamberlin took whatever work he could find. For a time he was an aerial photographer. Several well-known photographs of important events as seen from the air, such as Yankee Stadium on its grand opening in 1923, were taken by Chamberlin. Like Lindbergh, he had also crashed a lot of planes?about ten, by his own estimation?and was involved in a fatal crash in an air race in 1925 when a passenger riding with him was killed. Chamberlin didn’t actually know the passenger?he was just a young man who had asked if he could go along for the ride. Oddly, Chamberlin seems never to have bothered to learn the man’s identity. In his autobiography, Chamberlin merely records that he himself was knocked unconscious in the crash and learned afterward “that my companion had been killed.” Chamberlin was seriously injured in the crash himself and was told by doctors that he probably wouldn’t walk again, but clearly he proved them wrong. He was, if nothing else, resilient.",

George said in England there was no summer, no winter, just one low mist that was fog, that was a low horizon, no thunder and snow blinding her and heat and cold that some Uncle Sam Gart sort of person brandishing sizzling lightning would force down, would force up to 200°, 300° or whatever it was Fahrenheit, to some odd centigrade she had forgotten. Super-boiling point, freezing below freezing on the thermometer. That is how we live here. On the other end of a thin wire, a thin telephone wire there was a long space of green grass and through it crocuses bloomed in February. In February, George said, the crocuses in Hampton Court made streaks of pale yellow like the flaming footsteps of some pale Aurora. George did not say like the flaming footsteps of some pale Aurora; Hermione said that saying hello, hello, hello mechanically.",

The whole quarter was deserted, and my usual companions had not appeared. Doubtless the press corps had hurried off to the scene of some new incident. As I turned off the tarmac on to the gravel I was even more alarmed to hear footsteps behind me, following me at a leisurely pace. Now the whole front of my little house was lighted, and offered an even better firing pos­ition than the bar-window might have done, surrounded as it was with scrub and orange-trees. I felt it wiser to face a possible attacker in the darkness of the lane, consoling myself with the reflection that even if I was unarmed he would not know it and would assume I was. And I had the powerful torch. I stopped now, and the footsteps stopped too in the darkness. Frightened as I was, I felt absurdly glad that my heart was not beating faster than normal – thanks to the excellent double brandy Cyril had given me. I held my right arm as far away from me as possible and started running back the way I had come, towards the invisible man; after five paces I switched on and picked him up, shouting: ‘Hands up.’ He had nothing in his hands and was smiling good-naturedly. ‘Mr Durrell,’ he said reproachfully. As I came up and searched him I recognized him, though by now I had forgotten his name; he was the taxi driver who had driven me across the island when first I arrived, the cousin of Basil the priest. He seemed surprised and delighted. Apparently he did not know me by my name either. ‘I am guarding you, sir,’ he said.",

Miles of red next to miles of pink next to miles of purple next to miles of yellow. Mike’s blue hair framed by all of those colors made him look like a character in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The goodwill from the drugs that had opened my mind and heart to all of humanity was still lingering, and it made me tolerant and peaceful when Mike asked stupid questions. Hope’s head was on her boyfriend’s shoulder, all forgiven there, too. In two years they would be married, and in five they would be divorced … because he still hadn’t grown out of raves and drugs.",

The requests were aggressive. Earlier, each had been referring to me as “Friend.” Now, one of them tried to stop me from walking away by addressing me as, “Hey, White Man.” That is not a moniker that I am accustomed to hearing. I will answer to “Hey Professor.” And, of course, I am more than willing to be known as Old Man With Big Stick. But “Hey, White Man”? No way. I took offense. So I turned, stuck out my chest like the hairiest of baboons, and shouted “NO!” I then proceeded to waddle aggressively back toward the car. The men followed me briefly but turned and departed when they saw Fabulous waiting nearby. I gave Fabulous a 200 Rand tip.",

Failing to come up with an answer to that question, I revisited my recollection of reading about it in the Lonely Planet. I struggled to visualise where I was when I'd read that passage, until slowly, a recalled image formed in my mind. I was sat, perusing the book on a hotel balcony. It was dusk, and I was enjoying an early evening beer. I conjured up an image of the hotel. It was in Flores, Guatemala.

Outside it sat a young woman and her small daughter, absorbed in a card game. Both these Japanese cameras (US$100 and US$150 respectively) were thickly covered in fine dust, having been displayed on top of their boxes. When I rejected them for this reason they were thoroughly wiped with a damp rag, then hopefully re-offered. I pointed out that one had been dropped – a corner was severely dented – but this damage was laughingly dismissed as unimportant. Finally Mr Un found an elderly woman trader just back from a trip to Yunnan and offering a $24 dust-free Chinese camera. It proved not quite up to Pentax standards but served its purpose.",

It had the murmur of a distant sea, the languorous lapse and flow of waters on a beach. It was elemental, detached, indifferent to the lives of men. They contributed to it as drops of rain contribute to a river that draws its flood and movement majestically from great depths, out of purple hills at evening.",

Amherst's absence, in particular, seemed to loose the thin current of Mr. Tredegar's eloquence. He was never quite at ease in the presence of an independent mind, and Justine often reflected that, even had the two men known nothing of each other's views, there would have been between them an instinctive and irreducible hostility—they would have disliked each other if they had merely jostled elbows in the street.",

Days before the old woman has prepared an extract from these roots in oil and it is at hand in a bowl. She begins and massages the girl from head to foot with this fragrant unction. The toes, the fingers, the thighs, and there is a special motional treatment for every part of the body. It seemed to me that the breasts alone were ignored. But when the body massage is over, she returns to the breasts. These are bathed several times in warm water in which something special had been steeped. After that they are massaged ever so lightly with the very tips of the fingers dipped in khus khus. This fingertip motion is circular and moves ever towards the nipple. Arriving there, it begins over and over again. Finally the breasts are cupped and the nipples flicked with a warm feather back and forth, back and forth until there was a reaction to stimulation. The breasts stiffened and pouted, while the rest of the body relaxed.",

So it was without premonition that he opened the door and peered out, bringing the torch’s beam on the knocker. It was the man called Harry. He stood there in the darkness, in the strong steady seawind filled with the dry clashing of invisible palm fronds, as the doctor had always seen him, in the soiled ducks and the sleeveless undershirt, murmuring the conventional amenities about the hour and the need, asking to use the telephone while the doctor, his nightshirt streaming about his flabby calves, peered at the caller and thought in a fierce surge of triumph Now I am going to find out what it is. “Yes,” he said, “you wont need the telephone. I am a doctor myself.”",

He began to talk of the whins on the links and the sanderlings along the flats, with such a Scots voice and in phrases so vivid that she saw her childhood again, and had in her eyes a wetness of a happier order. She released his cool hand after a long, gentle pressure. But when it was gone it was as if much of her life went. She said: ‘You’ll be knowing Kingussie House, just outside your town. It was there I spent my holidays as a child.’",

In 1898, according to Katmai historian John Hussey, a geologist visiting the area had “ascended the lush green valley of the Ukak River” and recorded “earthquakes and other evidences of volcanic activity” that included hot springs, tremors, and a report from local Natives that one of the mountains sometimes smoked. On June 6, 1912, a twenty-mile-high column of smoke began rising above Mount Katmai. Two hours later came an enormous explosion, heard as far away as Juneau, 750 miles to the east. A cloud of ash billowed in the sky and, carried by the wind, began to fall like snow over hundreds of square miles. Kodiak Island was paralyzed by sixty hours of darkness and a blizzard of ashfall deep enough to collapse roofs. (Harry Dodge described the dirt in his Kodiak garden as “four inches of topsoil above ten inches of ash.”) The blasts from Katmai continued for three days. By the time the violence ended, more than three cubic miles of ash and pumice had been ejected?thirty times the volume released during the Mount St. Helens eruption of 1980. When the air cleared, several hundred feet of Mount Katmai’s summit had vanished.",

The truth is, I’d tried on one of their synthetic hiking shirts—some stretchy, almost transparent fabric in a color called Blueberry Heather—and clingy did not even begin to describe that material. The shirt wrapped around my midsection making my gut jut out like an eight-month baby bump. Worse still, the fabric stuck so tightly to my upper chest that my normally invisible man boobs burst out like a pair of melons. The thin material highlighting the bumps of my areolae in a way that would make a milk-cow blush. There was no way I was wearing that thing, so I had simply packed a couple of my old cotton blend tees, mantra or no.",

And thinking, Ten Eyck craned his scrawny neck convulsively along the edges of his fraying collar, looked desperately at Professor Hatcher, who returned his gaze inquiringly; ducked his head quickly, bit his nails and craned again. Then, suddenly, seeing the cold patrician features of young Mr Grey, his blue shirt of costly madras, his limp crossed elegance of legs and pleated trousers, the little man half rose, scraping his chair back from the table round which the class was sitting, and with an inclusive gesture of his claw-like hand, screamed incoherently:",

I was bitterly disappointed when at first he didn’t seem to want to, protesting that he was too old for that sort of thing now. Besides, he didn’t have proper shoes, but that was no problem as I could easily get him a pair at the store. I did think he might be right about his age. He was very old, and I wondered if the twenty miles per day routine might prove too much for him. Of course, he could always ride Bub. When I voiced my doubts to Glendle, he laughed and assured me that Eddie could out-walk both of us. He also said he was certain the old man would come as he had noticed a definite twinkle in his eye at the suggestion, and he thought I was a most fortunate woman, as Eddie was a respected elder of the tribe. The next morning, Eddie came to tell me that he had decided to accompany me after all. He needed a few things so we went to the store to purchase them – new shoes and socks, and a tarpaulin for Winkicha while he was away. The store was typical, a small galvanized iron shed, selling the basics – tea, sugar, flour, the occasional fruits and vegetables, soft drinks, clothes, billy cans. It was refurbished with goods once every couple of weeks by a road-train or a light aircraft from Alice.",
