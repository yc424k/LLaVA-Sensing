In a minute or two her breathing became more regular, her clasp of his hand relaxed, and she fell asleep. The band of silver paleness along the east horizon made even the distant parts of the Great Plain appear dark and near; and the whole enormous landscape bore that impress of reserve, taciturnity, and hesitation which is usual just before day. The eastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against the light, and the great flame-shaped Sun-stone beyond them; and the Stone of Sacrifice midway. Presently the night wind died out, and the quivering little pools in the cup-like hollows of the stones lay still. At the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the dip eastward – a mere dot. It was the head of a man approaching them from the hollow beyond the Sun-stone. Clare wished they had gone onward, but in the circumstances decided to remain quiet. The figure came straight towards the circle of pillars in which they were.",

The waters of the swollen Arno came hurtling over bridges at fifty miles an hour and covered eleven and a half miles, spreading over two-thirds of the city. The Pitti Palace hotel, without electricity, got its water from the springs of the Boboli Gardens. Giulia—whom it is impossible to imagine having ever been young—carried the water up six flights of stairs in green hand-blown glass urns that were used to transport oil and cheap wine; they were half her height and must have been half her weight. (One seldom sees these elegant containers nowadays; they have been replaced by plastic. I owned two of them when I lived in Libya in 1961—I used to love to regard their beautiful imperfections—but then I moved to India and the servants didn't see the point of them and they got broken, and I was very sad.) In many shops there are plaques to indicate the waterline of the flood; in some it is over six feet from the ground. All over Florence there are plaques commemorating floods—in that dignified, decent, and delightful Italian way whereby everything public is publicly named and cataloged: the flood of 1333, the flood of 1547, and the flood of 1740 (and now the Arno is jaundice-yellow/green and sluggish). In the flood of 1966 lizard handbags and gold chains were embedded in the mud near the Ponte Vecchio. . . .",

On the pavement nearby, a kerosene lamp lit up a string of snacks in plastic bags hung along a bamboo pole. Out across the river there was nothing to see but darkness.

But who was Peter to make out that life was all plain sailing?—Peter always in love, always in love with the wrong woman? What’s your love? she might say to him. And she knew his answer; how it is the most important thing in the world and no woman possibly understood it. Very well. But could any man understand what she meant either? about life?

The ground was wet with fallen leaves and mud, and every half hour, one of us toppled, knee-deep in a hole, tripping over a concealed root, failing to notice that the ground, obscured by devil’s club, dropped out from under our feet. At first, it was funny to see a crewmate disappear suddenly, head and shoulders visible above the brush line and then nothing, like they’d fallen through a trap door. At first, we hollered, “Man down!” and tallied who’d taken a plunge. Soon it was old news. No one commented. Pick yourself up, pull the chainsaw dogs out of your neck, and move on.

He had, he said, taken three woodcock. They were stowed in the game pockets of his jacket; I could see the shapes of their long hard beaks showing through the cloth. Bright red domed beads of blood stood out on the waxy sleeves of his jacket, and in one I could see a fish-eye reflection of me and the land behind. He was a Clare man, he said, and had been shooting here for more than forty years. He spoke of the changes over the time he had known the area; of the return of the hazel scrub during the past decade, a sign that the land was not being farmed as hard, that more food was being transported into the area from outside. I asked him about the hares of the Burren, for we had seen several of them that day, long-legged and long-eared, sitting like sentries, or sprinting gracefully off around a hillside. He said that hares were a special animal here. Thirty years back, when times were hard, his father had shot hares, and they had eaten them as a family, but now no one did, because they were scarcer, but also because they were considered to be animals of poetry. There would be uproar in the gun clubs if anyone was heard to have shot a hare.",

Suddenly an open space not far from the Capitol was filled with rioting high school pupils. Scores of angry boys and girls were using boots and fists to attack one another, then threatening the few teachers seeking to quell the riot. This racing mini-mob knocked over one frail old lady and when a young man rushed to her assistance, shouting indignantly, he was kicked on the buttocks. I looked around: where were the police, moments before so obvious? They had vanished, chosen not to become involved. That evening I was told the school in question had become polarised, some pupils regarding their exam results as unfair (bribery!), others furiously denying this. Then, in a move that shocked everyone, both factions felt free to take their disagreement on to the streets.",

By an extraordinary effort he succeeded at last, though not until they had got far back against from the fatal door. In doing so Henchard contrived to turn Farfrae a complete somersault. Had Henchard’s other arm been free it would have been all over with Farfrae then. But again he regained his feet, wrenching Henchard’s arm considerably, and causing him sharp pain, as could be seen from the twitching of his face. He instantly delivered the younger man an annihilating turn by the left fore-hip, as it used to be expressed, and following up his advantage thrust him towards the door, never loosening his hold till Farfrae’s fair head was hanging over the window-sill, and his arm dangling down outside the wall.",

He and she loved each other, and their love arched over them open and ample as the day: in all its sunlit spaces there was no cranny for a fear to lurk. In a few minutes he would be in her presence and would read his reassurance in her eyes.

He looked to be in his early sixties, with a shock of white hair and festive, lushly overgrown eyebrows that rose in pinnacles, like the tips of whipped meringue. They looked as if somebody had been lifting him up by grabbing hold of them. “Doesn’t know his trains, you know,” he said.",

    "target_paragraph": "When Mrs Selborne first came to Dixieland from the hot South she was only twenty-three, but she looked older. Ripeness with her was all: she was a tall heavy-bodied blonde, well kept and elegant. She moved leisurely with a luxurious sensual swing of the body: her smile was tender and full of vague allurement, her voice gentle, her sudden laughter, bubbling out of midnight secrecy, rich and full. She was one of several handsome and bacchic daughters of a depleted South Carolinian of good family: she had married at sixteen a red heavy man who came and went from her incomparable table, eating rapidly and heartily, muttering, when pressed, a few shy-sullen words, and departing to the closed leather-and-horse smell of his little office in the livery-stable he owned. She had two children by him, both girls: she moved with wasted stealth around all the quiet slander of a South Carolina mill-town, committing adultery carefully with a mill owner, a banker, and a lumber man, walking circumspectly with her tender blond smile by day past all the sly smiles of town and trade, knowing that the earth was mined below her feet, and that her name, with clerk and merchant, was a sign for secret laughter. The natives, the men in particular, treated her with even more elaborate respect than a woman is usually given in a Southern town, but their eyes, behind the courteous unctions of their masks, were shiny with invitation.",

They were retired schoolteachers, none of them had married, and they referred to themselves as ‘our merry band of spinsters’. We sat in Beatrice’s front room—a simple space lit by a large church candle that stood in a surprisingly grand pewter candle-holder (from her English father’s family, Beatrice explained). Tea consisted of Burmese cold noodle salad with chicken curry. The women ate with their hands, apologizing graciously for doing so. ‘It just tastes so much better this way,’ said one. After supper Beatrice laid out a plate of peanut brittle and began pouring tea from a large teapot. The teacups were decorated with a fleur-de-lis pattern, but they were cheap reproductions from China and everyone commented on the difference. Beatrice explained how hard it was to preserve the old English porcelain. All her pieces had cracked during the past decades. All she had left from her childhood, she said, was the pewter candlestick and the plate with the waving girl.",

The beds—there were two—were made of iron, enameled black and painted with bunches of gay flowers. She lay putting off the great moment of going to the window as one puts off opening a precious letter, gloating over it. She had no idea what time it was; she had forgotten to wind up her watch ever since, centuries ago, she last went to bed in Hampstead. No sounds were to be heard in the house, so she supposed it was very early, yet she felt as if she had slept a long while—so completely rested, so perfectly content. She lay with her arms clasped round her head thinking how happy she was, her lips curved upwards in a delighted smile. In bed by herself: adorable condition. She had not been in a bed without Mellersh once now for five whole years; and the cool roominess of it, the freedom of one's movements, the sense of recklessness, of audacity, in giving the blankets a pull if one wanted to, or twitching the pillows more comfortably! It was like the discovery of an entirely new joy.",

No sooner has one person at a dinner party back east finished shaking his head over How can you live with that kind of insecurity? then another comes over to say she’d move to a park tomorrow if she could. Many of the envious have good careers, some even jobs that they love, but describe feeling restless. Or, they want to try something new but can’t because of the stability, the kids, the bills, the 401(k), the economy, the degree, the expectations. Oh, I couldn’t, they say when I offer to put in a good word for them at hiring time next season. My husband would never move there my folks paid for law school my kids are at a weird age we just finished the house.",

I lifted my head, gasped for air – a lot of air – before I would be pulled back under. Far behind me I could see the mountain of rock receding. I couldn’t believe it. I had passed it. But how?

Barnstaple used to be a major rail interchange, with three stations, but now there is just the one with its infrequent pootling service to Exeter, and a bus station overlooking the river.

Sarolta’s reply was to plunk the scoundrels on the next boat for New York, which of course needed people like them.

Then it seemed to Wilbourne that he had never been in his life, and would never be again, so aware of her as he was while she stood in the center of the dingy lobby raddled with the Saturday nights of drummers and of minor race-track hangers-on while he signed the two fictitious names on the pad and gave to the clerk the sixth two dollars which were to have gone to his sister but did not, waiting for him, making no effort for effacement, quiet, contained, and with a quality profoundly tragic which he knew (he was learning fast) was not peculiar to her but was an attribute of all women at this instant in their lives, which would invest them with a dignity, almost a modesty, to be carried over and clothe even the last prone and slightly comic attitude of ultimate surrender. He followed her down the corridor and into the door which the porter opened, he dismissed the porter and closed the rented door behind him and watched her cross the room to the single dingy window and, still in the hat and coat, turn without pausing and exactly like a child playing prisoner’s base and return to him, the yellow eyes, the whole face which he had already come to call beautiful, hard and fixed. “Oh God, Harry,” she said. She beat her clenched fists on his chest. “Not like this. Jesus, not like this.”",

Frankland National Parks. Within minutes I was in cool, green forests of erect and stately grandeur. This was very promising indeed. I was headed for a place called the Valley of the Giants, to a recently developed tourist attraction that I had been told not to miss. It’s called the Tree Top Walk, and as the name suggests it is an elevated walkway that wanders through the canopy of a grove of tingle trees—yet another of the rare outsized species of eucalypts unique to the region. I had assumed it was essentially a gimmick, but in fact I discovered that tingle trees, for all their immensity, are quite delicate and reliant on the few nutrients to be found in the soil at their bases, and that the constant trampling of visitors’ feet was interfering with the breakdown of organic matter, imperiling their well-being. The Tree Top Walk thus not only provided visitors with a novel diversion and an unusual perspective but also kept them conveniently out of harm’s way.",

In this godforsaken place, I felt disconnected from the climbers around me—emotionally, spiritually, physically—to a degree I hadn’t experienced on any previous expedition. We were a team in name only, I’d sadly come to realize. Although in a few hours we would leave camp as a group, we would ascend as individuals, linked to one another by neither rope nor any deep sense of loyalty. Each client was in it for himself or herself, pretty much. And I was no different: I sincerely hoped Doug got to the top, for instance, yet I would do everything in my power to keep pushing on if he turned around.",

There was even one small field of shimmering barley, looking incongruously domestic – almost demure – amidst the surrounding violence of nature. In this area the past year’s rainfall has been adequate, though not normal. Soon our path spiralled up yet another precipice, then wandered across gently undulating green pastureland. A large potato patch surrounded the first house we had passed since receiving guidance several hours earlier. Another stone dwelling was conspicuous ahead, on a grassy ledge directly below a long wall of jagged cliff; to its left, ending the ledge, a detached mini-mountain looked like a magnified grey-green plum-pudding. Our path led us onto this ledge, which is bisected by a swift stream, and Juana drank while we considered the cliff-wall. It is on the far side of a bridgeless ravine and we could see no alternative path off the ledge apart from the one we’d come on. ‘Here endeth the track for this day’, observed Rachel. It was only 4 p.m. but we’d covered some twenty miles of rough stuff and Rachel had walked at least half that; more and more, Juana is becoming a pack-mule. If the campesinos didn’t object to gringoes in their garden, this was an ideal site: grazing for Juana, water for all, resiliant turf on which to sleep. No firewood so no hot supper, but you can’t have everything …",

I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about… like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees.",

I went first to the Schatzkammer, the treasury, which contained the finest assortment of reliquaries I ever expect to see, including the famous life-size golden bust of Charlemagne, looking like a god; a carved sixteenth-century triptych depicting Pope Gregory’s mass, which I think I could look at almost for ever; and assorted other baubles of extraordinary beauty and craftsmanship.",

The melees were long, and I crept within my curtain and lay down, but the drowsiness which legitimately came over me after riding thirty miles and wading two, was broken in upon by two monstrous cockroaches really as large as mice, with fierce-looking antennæ and prominent eyes, both of which mounted guard on my pillow. On rising to drive them away, I found to my dismay that they were but the leaders of a host, which only made a temporary retreat, rustling over the mat and dried grass with the crisp tread of mice, and scaring away sleep for some hours. Worse than these were the mosquitos, also an imported nuisance, which stabbed and stung without any preliminary droning; and the heat was worse still, for thirteen human beings were lying on the floor and the door was shut. Had I known that two of these were lepers, I should have felt far from comfortable. As it was, I got up soon after midnight, and cautiously stepping among the sleeping forms, went out of doors. Everything favoured reflection, but I think the topics to which my mind most frequently reverted were my own absolute security-a lone white woman among \"savages,\" and the civilizing influence which Christianity has exercised, so that even in this isolated valley, gouged out of a mountainous coast, there was nothing disagreeable or improper to be seen. The night was very still, but the sea was moaning; the river rippled very gently as it brushed past the reeds; there was a hardly perceptible vibration in the atmosphere, which suggested falling water and quivering leaves; and the air was full of a heavy, drowsy fragrance, the breath of orange flowers, perhaps, and of the night-blowing Cereus, which had opened its ivory urn to the moon. I should have liked to stay out all night in the vague, delicious moonlight, but the dew was heavy, and moreover I had not any boots on, so I reluctantly returned to the grass house, which was stifling with heat and smells of cocoa-nut oil, tobacco, and the rancid smoke from beef fat.",

    "target_paragraph": "For a hero dead in the Philippines, the Army base was called Fort Egbert. Police work became the least of its preoccupations. The Army Signal Corps wanted to extend its great web to cover all America, including the upper Yukon. Communications in Eagle were nothing to write home about. After the Eagle post office was established, in 1899, the Post Office Department, in Washington, decided to establish a winter mail route across the Alaska Range from Valdez, on Prince William Sound, to Eagle, on the Yukon. A carrier, with eleven horses and a sack of mail, set out in October for the north. Eleven horses died. The carrier kept going, of course, and in the dead of winter he finally came walking into Eagle. The trip had cost the government three thousand dollars. In the sack were three letters. The Signal Corps meant to improve on that with instantaneous messages, by overland wire, from Eagle to all the world. Laying the wire was a project weirdly analogous to the building of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, in that it required the clearing of a tortuous route north from Valdez (now the pipeline’s southern terminus), with camps set up along the way and crews working the equivalents of overtime and double time. The crews were soldiers, earning thirteen dollars a month. Their boss was Lieutenant William Mitchell, twenty-one years old. He was on his way to fame in the air, to a court-martial, to a vindicating posthumous medal, but this was two years before Kitty Hawk, and all he had on his mind was how to move men and materials through several hundred wilderness miles where men and mules carrying heavy loads sank deep into muskeg. Mitchell’s solution was to transport in winter what he would build in summer—a procedure new to the Army, and requiring Mitchell to become an expert in everything from Arctic clothing to the efficacy of sled runners. To protect morale, he prohibited thermometers. Work proceeded even at forty and fifty below. Mitchell was not lacking in flair. He was a Crockett on snowshoes, a beardless Boone. Travelling the line from crew to crew, he wore fringed hide clothing trimmed with extensive beadwork. His rifle was kept in a beaded sheath. He devised a parka of stuffed mattress ticking. He wore a beaver hat.",
