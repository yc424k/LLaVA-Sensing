Now they pass through the true badlands of Tibet, a wilderness of sand dunes and mud-flats set in a bronze light. Here the wind is almost a blessing, for it keeps squadrons of voracious sand-flies pinned to the ground. The pack animals flounder in the mud, and have to be coaxed up steep sand cliffs. To Bullock it seems the most godforsaken, sterile region in the world. To Mallory’s alert eyes, however, it is not entirely bereft either of charm or colour. He notices miniature blue irises blooming leaflessly from the gravel, and a few vivid nasturtium-like plants with pink and yellow petals, and tiny green leaves. It is as though there is a trove of colour buried just beneath the desert surface, peeking through here and there.",

Grey hens followed by golden broods clucked under the twisted apple boughs, a cat dozed on the edge of an old well, and from tree to tree ran the network of clothesline that denoted Mrs. Hochmüller’s calling. Beyond the apple trees stood a yellow summer house festooned with scarlet runners; and below it, on the farther side of a rough fence, the land dipped down, holding a bit of woodland in its hollow. It was all strangely sweet and still on that hot Sunday afternoon, and as she moved across the grass under the apple boughs Ann Eliza thought of quiet afternoons in church, and of the hymns her mother had sung to her when she was a baby.",

Every sect of Christians shares ownership of this church, and they fight amongst each other over who gets to sweep which step as viciously as the Jews fight the Muslims. A Muslim family down the road is the keeper of the keys to the front door of the holiest church in Christendom, because none of the Christians can stomach any of the other Christians having it. The story goes that a ladder was once left on top of the church, and no sect would take responsibility for leaving it there. And so the ladder stayed on top of the church for sixty years.",

The weather cloths that I had laboriously measured, sewed and two days previously installed with new grommets were completely ripped out and gone. Forty liters of fuel in jerry cans that had been lashed in the cockpit were gone. The solar panel that had faithfully sustained my electricity supply since Tahiti was gone, as well as my foul-weather gear, which had been placed under the protection of the spray hood so I could grab it easily before going out on deck. A sailbag of sand for kitty litter that probably weighed about thirty pounds had been lifted from the cockpit floor and was now lying like a bag of wet concrete halfway overboard. Holding on as the boat rolled around and the wind blasted across the deck, I hastily hauled it in along with the spray hood and the dinghy.",

To be taken away from them for this one was more than annoying, it was gravely disturbing. Again that side-car; again that young man; as if a whole morning in it and with him were not sufficiently deplorable. No wonder his poor little darling at home was anxious.

They were close to the umbrella trees that lined the driveway when Richard saw the bearded man, in a severely smart, belted army uniform, striding across the corridor. A few reporters scrambled after him, holding out tape recorders like offerings. Students, so many that Richard wondered how they had congregated so quickly, began to chant. “Power! Power!” Ojukwu came downstairs and stood on top of some cement blocks on the grassy lawn. He raised his hands. Everything about him sparkled, his groomed beard, his watch, his wide shoulders.",

For the first time, next day, the ground was higher than sea-level and with every step the equipoise of the elements tilted more decisively in favour of dry land. A gentle rolling landscape of water-meadow and ploughland and heath, with the snow melting here and there, stretched away northward through the province of Guelderland and south into Brabant. The roadside calvaries and the twinkle of sanctuary lamps in the churches indicated that I had crossed a religious as well as a cartographic contour-line. There were farm-buildings which elms and chestnut trees and birches snugly encompassed and Hobbema-like avenues of wintry trees which ended at the gates of seemly manor-houses – the abodes, I hoped, of mild jonkheers. They were gabled in semicircles and broken right-angles of weathered brick bordered with white stone. Pigeon-lofts saddled the scales of the roofs and the breeze kept the gilded weather-vanes spinning; and when the leaded windows kindled at lighting-up time, I explored the interiors in my imagination. A deft chiaroscuro illuminated the black and white flagstones; there were massive tables with bulbous legs and Turkey carpets flung over them; convex mirrors distorted the reflections; faded wall-charts hung on the walls; globes and harpsichords and inlaid lutes were elegantly scattered; and Guelderland squires with pale whiskers – or their wives in tight bonnets and goffered ruffs – lifted needle-thin wine-glasses to judge the colour by the light of the branching and globular brass candelabra which were secured on chains to the beams and the coffered ceilings.",

In any case life is but a procession of shadows, and God knows why it is that we embrace them so eagerly, and see them depart with such anguish, being shadows. And why, if this and much more than this is true, why are we yet surprised in the window corner by a sudden vision that the young man in the chair is of all things in the world the most real, the most solid, the best known to us—why indeed?

Its fat grey-green body was about an inch and a half long, its hairy legs at least three inches long and its slowly waving antennae still longer. Even Rachel, who is abnormally well-disposed towards all God’s creatures, had to admit that it looked exceedingly disagreeable. Many Peruvian insects are of Andean proportions and peculiar aspect; my experience of them is wide as I often uncover specimens on lifting a big stone to hammer the picket.",

But once he came where the bullets were flying and the guns roaring, he steadied at once. Pure race, that horse.... His fathers must have been all warriors. Around ’Gino were four or five more heroes, with almost all their cartridges gone. They fought until on the front and on both sides double galloping lines of\ncolorados closed in. ’Gino was standing beside his horse—suddenly a score of shots hit the animal all at once, and he sighed and fell over.\nThe rest ceased firing in a sort of panic. ’We’re lost!’ they cried.\n’Run while there is yet a chance!’ ’Gino shook his smoking rifle at them. ’No,’ he shouted. ’Give the compañeros time to get away!’\nShortly after that they closed around him, and I never saw him until we buried his body this morning.... It was the devil’s hell out there.\nThe rifles were so hot you couldn’t touch the barrels, and the whirling haze that belched out when they shot twisted everything like a mirage....\"",

I wasn’t racing them, but it seemed like the only tangible measure of my progress. Alone, I had nothing to compare myself to except myself?and the damnable stack of maps merrily stating how far I would walk each day. Even though I was reaching those locations without fail, the milestones seemed to float without a reference point. I’m moving twice as fast as other hikers. Twice as fast as I did last time. Last time it took me over four months. Half that is a little over two. Will I be able to keep this up? Do I need to move even faster? I don’t think I can, but I am feeling stronger. I was demanding the impossible from my body every day with hardly any chance for recovery?and I was beginning to feel that it was rallying to the challenge.",

Loyal employees of the hotel had been quick to spirit away its precious silver—including the wagon in which the Sunday roast was delivered—and bury it so it could be excavated at war’s end. And after three and a half years in which the place became the Syonan Ryokan—the “Inn of the Light of the South” for occupying Japanese soldiers—it turned into a kind of transit zone and resting place once hostilities subsided.",

Tanzania’s main-road townships keep the mzungu at a distance, though one always meets a few welcoming individuals. Unlike homogeneous bush villages, these are mongrel communities of uprooted people from disparate regions – a bit of this tribe and that, everyone hoping somehow to scratch a living by selling something (food, charcoal, pombe, poultry, handicrafts, bodies) to the comparatively rich who pass that way. Even bus or matatu passengers are comparatively rich, otherwise they couldn’t afford a ticket. International truckers are very rich; their smuggling opportunities, if not their wages, see to that. Passing expatriates – rich beyond imagining – like to get a wayside handicraft bargain and boast to their neighbours who paid three times as much for the same thing in an urban market. And so on … Yet in my experience most Tanzanians, however poor, do not beg or seek sponsorship from the mzungu; their activities are proudly commercial.",

He learns these reflexive habits from Hazlitt, who embeds walking as prosody to the depth of grammar. From Hazlitt, too, he learns the epistemological power of the proposition that is made and then part retracted. Again and again in Thomas’s imagination, text and landscape overlap: ‘The prettiest things on ground are the paths / With morning and evening hobnails dinted, / With foot and wing-tip overprinted / Or separately charactered.’ The paths are sentences, the shod feet of the travellers the scratch of the pen nib or the press of the type. He understands that reading and walking expire into one another, that we carry within ourselves evolving maps of the world which are, as Wordsworth put it, ‘[o]f texture midway between life and books’.",

All her grandparents had come from Ruthenia when it was part of Czechoslovakia – ‘So I don’t look Rumanian, and sometimes I don’t feel it …’ She was small, plump, flaxen-haired and blue-eyed, with soft blurred features and a lot of sadness behind her good cheer.",

He did not succeed in saying anything. It was Mary who spoke for both of them. He was struck dumb by finding that Katharine was quite different, in some strange way, from his memory, so that he had to dismiss his old view in order to accept the new one. The wind was blowing her crimson scarf across her face; the wind had already loosened her hair, which looped across the corner of one of the large, dark eyes which, so he used to think, looked sad; now they looked bright with the brightness of the sea struck by an unclouded ray; everything about her seemed rapid, fragmentary, and full of a kind of racing speed.

The gulf is shallow and enclosed by land on three sides, with a very narrow passage through the Strait of Hormuz into the Gulf of Oman. With few rivers flowing into the Gulf—from Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia—it takes between three to three-and-a-half years for the Arabian Gulf to flush its contents. In 1995, we saw vestiges of the Gulf War. When 800 oil wells were blown up at the end of the war, over 600 caught fire and burned while oil gushed into the gulf. Ras Tanura lies just south of Kuwait, which suffered enormous ecological distress. Walking the beach that morning there was still evidence of that holocaust, with small- to medium-size tar balls along the water’s edge.",

If it had been, we could have clocked out early, simply receiving penalty minutes. As it is, we won’t be recorded as having clocked out at all. This is a grave matter, since only those recorded as leaving every morning, and of course passing through every time control and running every time trial, can stay in the running for Gold. I feel profoundly sad for Bernard. At the same time, I know that the decision to focus on fixing Roxanne at the expense of the Gold is the right thing, the practical thing, to do. In this sense, it, too, is the Bernard thing to do. I keep to myself how relieved I also feel that the competitive edge required of me if we’re going for a Gold is no longer expected.",

Her strawberry tresses (the closest shade in the Crayola palette would fall, appropriately, somewhere between Outrageous Orange and Radical Red) were held up by a pair of mirrored sunglasses, and she was wearing Stanford sweats (she had recently taught there) and an olive-drab military-style shirt that from twenty paces appeared to be emblazoned with that dewy-eyed portrait of Che Guevara.

To the right it rose inland, following the slope of the down. To the left it ran level under the low wall, then climbed higher yet to the brow of the headland. There it ended in a square recess, a small white chamber cut from the chalk and open to the sea and sky. From the floor of the recess the Cliff dropped sheer to the beach two hundred feet below.",

They provide no resistance or shelter from the cold fronts that sweep in from North America. The only consequential benefit of being at the mercy of every storm is that the cold front’s arrival is highly predictable. At exactly 1:30 AM the north wind slackened and then went dead calm. I woke and went on deck. The anchor chain was hanging loose. Quest was swinging in every direction. Within twenty minutes there was the slightest breath of air from the southeast coming straight from the entrance of the huge bay. Over the next two hours the wind increased to a steady 25 to 30 knots. Although the wind was formidable we had more than enough scope to handle the breeze. But as a result of the change in wind direction Quest’s stern had swung to within one hundred feet of the rock pile known as Goat Cay. We had little choice but to accept this lee shore scenario. I went back to my bunk and considered that within a couple of hours the ocean swell would be pushing right through the entrance making our anchorage a windy bumpy ride.",

    "target_paragraph": "Only the engine, a 223-horsepower Wright J-5 Whirlwind, was of a new design. It was the one thing on the plane that was unquestionably of the latest technology. The J-5 was air-cooled, which made it simpler, lighter, and more reliable than conventional water-cooled engines, and it had two additional benefits. It was the first machine in the world to incorporate Samuel Heron’s sodium-cooled valves, which eliminated the serious problem of burned exhaust valves, and it had self-lubricating rocker arms, which could putter along contentedly for hours without attention. The J-5 was first used on Richard Byrd’s North Pole flight in 1926 and did its job admirably. The irony, as we shall see, is that Byrd probably never got anywhere near the North Pole.",

He ran to the window to pull up the blind, and when he got back to the bed she lifted herself up to him with outstretched arms, and the unbearable look of terror in her face. “Vanny, I’m--” She dropped back and lay still. He knelt down beside the bed and took her hand; but presently she began to breathe in short racking gasps. A mortal chill stole over him. Those gasps were like the sound of something being wrenched out of its socket. Her eyes were shut and she did not seem to know that he was there.",

They had recovered life and hope, and on their faces was the proud and foolish look of sick men who have felt the hand of death upon the bridles of their hearts, and who now, with a passive and uncertain faith, renew themselves. Their bodies looked shrunken in their dressing gowns, upon their starved, pale cheeks a furze of beard was growing, the young wind fanned their lank, un-vital hair, their jaws hung open, and with foolish, happy smiles they turned their faces towards the light. One smoked a cheap cigar, his thin hand took it slowly and unsteadily to his lips, he looked about and grinned. Another walked a few steps back and forth uncertainly. They were like children who have been born again, and there was something foolish, puzzled, and full of happiness in their look. They drew the air and light into them with a thin, fond greed, their enfeebled flesh, reft of the coarseness of its work and struggle, soaked in the solar energy. And sometimes the brisk nurses came and went, sometimes their kinsmen stood beside them awkwardly, dressed clumsily in the hard and decent clothes they saved for Sundays, holidays, and hospitals.",
