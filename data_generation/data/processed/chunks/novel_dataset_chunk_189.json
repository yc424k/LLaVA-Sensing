Even after a day in Gatlinburg, the transition was dazzling. I remember reading once how some Stone Age Indians from the Brazilian rain forest with no knowledge or expectation of a world beyond the jungle were taken to Sao Paulo or Rio, and when they saw what it contained—the buildings, the cars, the passing airplanes—and how thoroughly at variance it was with their own simple lives, they wet themselves, lavishly and in unison.

There are moments in all long journeys when the whole business of travelling seems utterly futile. One feels homesick, tired and above all bored. Nothing pleases. Everything palls. For me that moment came in Tashkurgan. The town was ugly and cold, the people were gawping morons and the nearest off-licence was in Kashgar. The caravanserai looked and felt like a refugee camp, which indeed was exactly what it was. I wanted to be anywhere, anywhere but not Tashkurgan. Someone suggested that I pray.",

There is a magnificent procession in which the Dalai Lama takes part. Tsarong had promised us a window in one of his houses looking on to the Barkhor. Our places were on the ground floor as no one is allowed to be at a higher elevation than the heads of the grandees, who march with measured tread along the street. No houses in Lhasa may be more than two storeys high as it is considered a form of blasphemy to compete with the Cathedral or the Potala. This rule is strictly observed and the wooden shanties—easily taken to pieces—which some of the nobles put up on the flat roofs of their houses in the warm weather disappear like magic when the Dalai Lama or the Regent takes part in a procession.",

Half an hour later, blowing as loudly as they can, the band halts three doors from your own. The groom has come to collect his bride. Why this ceremony has to take place so early in the morning has never been explained to me, but it appears to be as essential a part of the nuptials as the Hindi movie music the night before.",

We drove out to a deep spot Peter knew, over dark gray water, a few miles northwest of Montauk Point. He told me how much line to pay out. The fish we wanted were on the bottom. The wind kicked up, and each lash of spray coming over the rail turned quickly to ice on the deck. Caroline and Alison huddled in the wheelhouse over a flask of hot spiked tea. Finally, just before dark, Peter and I each hooked up good-sized blackfish. My face was numb. Our hands were useless clubs. We got the fish aboard and then pounded, triumphant, back to Montauk Harbor. That night, at home, I cleaned my fish, which was still twisting and twitching. Too tired to cook, I put it in the fridge. Hours later, we heard the blackfish thumping inside the fridge.",

Papers were strewn on the floor; the fire was burning brightly; it was warm; it was cheerful. She felt very tired. She sank down into an armchair. Sara and Nicholas had lagged behind. The others were helping the nurse to carry the children up to bed, she supposed. She lay back in the chair. Everything seemed to become quiet and natural again. A feeling of great calm possessed her. It was as if another space of time had been issued to her, but, robbed by the presence of death of something personal, she felt – she hesitated for a word – ‘immune?’ Was that what she meant? Immune, she said, looking at a picture without seeing it. Immune, she repeated. It was a picture of a hill and a village perhaps in the South of France; perhaps in Italy. There were olive trees; and white roofs grouped against a hillside. Immune, she repeated, looking at the picture.",

There were possibilities, immense possibilities; but before he would talk over Cornelius’s proposals he demanded that some food should be sent up as a guarantee of good faith. Cornelius went off, creeping sluggishly down the hill on the side of the Rajah’s palace, and after some delay a few of Tunku Allang’s men came up, bringing a scanty supply of rice, chillies, and dried fish. This was immeasurably better than nothing. Later on Cornelius returned accompanying Kassim, who stepped out with an air of perfect good-humoured trustfulness, in sandals, and muffled up from neck to ankles in dark-blue sheeting. He shook hands with Brown discreetly, and the three drew aside for a conference. Brown’s men, recovering their confidence, were slapping each other on the back, and cast knowing glances at their captain while they busied themselves with preparations for cooking.",

Even under the most adverse conditions, that pleasure always made itself felt: she might hate him, but she had never been able to wish him out of the room. She was very near hating him now; yet the sound of his voice, the way the light fell on his thin dark hair, the way he sat and moved and wore his clothes – she was conscious that even these trivial things were inwoven with her deepest life. In his presence a sudden stillness came upon her, and the turmoil of her spirit ceased; but an impulse of resistance to this stealing influence now prompted her to say: ‘It’s very good of you to present yourself in that capacity; but what makes you think I have anything particular to talk about?’",

No line; in fact, only a half dozen young priests in long black gowns, following an older priest as he points and lectures about the Masaccio frescoes. I haven’t seen Adam and Eve leaving Eden since the vines over their genitals, painted during some fit of papal modesty, were removed and the frescoes cleaned and restored. Shocking to see them lifted out of the film of centuries of candle smoke: all these distinct faces and the chalky rose and saffron robes. Every face, isolated and examined, reveals character. “I wanted to see what made each one that one,” Gertrude Stein said about her desire to write about many lives. Masaccio had a powerful sense of character and narrative and a sharp eye for placing the human in space. A neophyte kneels in a stream to be baptized. Through the transparent water we see his knees and feet. San Pietro flings the basin, showering his head and back with water. All the symbolism of earlier art is abandoned for the cold splash on the boy. Another pleasure is Masaccio’s (and Masolino’s and Lippi’s, whose hands are apparent) attention to architecture, light, and shadow. Here’s Florence as he saw, or idealized it, with the sun falling logically—not the sourceless light of his predecessors—on this cast of characters who surely walked the streets of this city.",

Then I noticed Gheorghe, a well-built youth with light brown hair, dark brown eyes, rosy cheeks and an open expression. He worked in a shoe factory and had taught himself a rudimentary form of English. By one of those happy coincidences that littered my Rumanian paths, he lived in the bloc behind my friends’ – some two miles away – and was returning home. So he became my porter and we arranged to meet again at 7 a.m. next day. ‘Tonight I make a programme for you!’ said Gheorghe. ‘You are like the radio for me, giving a lesson in English!’",

They had a similar energy and restlessness, which caused a similar resentment. They were proud of their agricultural and mechanical skills, and they had the same passion for driving taxis and lorries. They too were accused of clannishness, while their internal politics were just as cantankerous. But the Sikhs were of India; beyond these similarities they were unreadable. The Sikh’s individuality appeared to be muffled by his beard and turban; his eyes were robbed of expression. His reputation in India did not make him easier to understand. There was his military tradition; his ferocity as soldier and policeman was known. Equally established, in spite of his adventurousness and obvious success, was his simpleness. The foolish Sikh is a figure of legend. The turban had something to do with it; it heated the Sikh’s uncut hair and softened his brain. That was what the stories said; and Sikh politics – consisting of temple plots, holy men, miraculous fasts, Wild West rivalries punctuated with gunshot on the Delhi-Chandigarh road – certainly seemed both comic and fierce. There was energy, no doubt. But perhaps it was too much for India: against the Indian background the Sikhs were always a little alarming.",

In the window, where the red slant of the sun already falls, Ben is moving quickly, slipping new placards into place, taking old ones out, scowling, snapping his hard, white fingers in command, speaking curtly, sharply, irritably to the busy figures, moving at his bidding on the floor. The game – the last game of the series – is sharp, close, bitterly contested. No one can say as yet which way the issue goes, which side will win, when it will end – but that fatality of red slanting light, the premonitory menace of the frost, the fatal certitude of victory and defeat, with all the sorrow and regret that both can bring to man, are in their hearts.",

Don’t let anyone tell you that you can ride a bike all day, hand wash your knickers, and that is going to work. Not unless you carry a giant container of bleach with you, it is not. Then, some knickers do not work for cycling. I hate cycle shorts because it feels like you have the Sunday Times jammed in your pants. Try hand washing those things. The result is a wet crotch the next morning. I am experimenting with other options. I learn that women’s knickers are designed by misogynistic sadists: how can we precisely align the seams on women’s underwear so that they chafe the tender bits and women won’t take up cycling? How about we design the leg openings with thin elastic garrottes to sever the leg? I have now gone through three of the five pairs I brought. They are useless. My other two pairs I will not exactly go into, but they look just like men’s boxers. (Because they ARE men’s boxers.) One pair was designed by a company that said: how do we design a pair of men’s boxers in such a way that Boyo here doesn’t feel unmanned? Should we double and triple up on the front part to give him some swagger? That pair hasn’t worked very well, either, because it feels like a sanitary pad.",

A trucker didn’t even have to drive over an animal to cause its destruction. Much later, when returning from a solo run to Tennessee I’d been driving along in eastern Arkansas and heard the thump of something running into the truck. I looked back in the driver side mirror hoping no motorist had bumped a trailer, a potential fatality for them. Instead, in the side mirror’s reflection I saw the disintegrated remains of a red-tailed hawk ricocheting onto the grass median. About thirteen feet from the ground the bird had flown too low and struck the small window at the top of the sleeper compartment. Hitting the edge of glass and metal that moved at over 70 mph had torn the living creature asunder, breaking the window and leaving a broad streak of dark red blood along the side of the truck’s cab.",

Today it came to my attention that Oswaldo Paya, founder of the Christian Liberation Movement and organiser of the Varela Project, congratulated Pedro Carmona in an open letter when it seemed Carmona had ousted the democratically elected President Hugo Chavez in a US-backed coup in 2004. The EU awarded Paya the 2003 Sacharov Human Rights prize and in December 2005 he was invited to London to attend a Foreign Office conference on human rights. Very sensibly, Havana denied him an exit visa. Would Washington allow a US citizen to travel to a foreign capital to encourage ‘regime change’?",

My being only glitters when all its facets are exposed to many people. Let them fail and I am full of holes, dwindling like burnt paper. Oh, Mrs Moffat, Mrs Moffat, I say, come and sweep it all up. Things have dropped from me. I have outlived certain desires; I have lost friends, some by death—Percival—others through sheer inability to cross the street. I am not so gifted as at one time seemed likely. Certain things lie beyond my scope. I shall never understand the harder problems of philosophy. Rome is the limit of my travelling. As I drop asleep at night it strikes me sometimes with a pang that I shall never see savages in Tahiti* spearing fish by the light of a blazing cresset, or a lion spring in the jungle, or a naked man eating raw flesh. Nor shall I learn Russian or read the Vedas.* I shall never again walk bang into the pillar-box. (But still a few stars fall through my night, beautifully, from the violence of that concussion.) But as I think, truth has come nearer. For many years I crooned complacently, “My children … my wife … my house … my dog”. As I let myself in with the latch-key I would go through that familiar ritual and wrap myself in those warm coverings. Now that lovely veil has fallen. I do not want possessions now.

She slipped, spun, held, ploughed slowly up, like a straining mule, into the dark. Content, he leaned far out the cab and looked: the starlight glimmered faintly on the rails. He ate a thick sandwich of cold buttered fried meat, tearing it raggedly and gluily staining it under his big black fingers.
