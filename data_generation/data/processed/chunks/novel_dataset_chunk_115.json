She had tried to organize her life in such a way that it should fit into Anne’s without awkward overlapping. Anne, nowadays, after her early canter, went daily to the studio and painted till lunch; sometimes, as the days lengthened, she went back for another two hours’ work in the afternoon. When the going was too bad for her morning ride she usually walked to the studio, and Kate sometimes walked with her, or went through the Park to meet her on her return. When she painted in the afternoon, Kate would occasionally drop in for tea, and they would return home together on foot in the dusk. But Mrs. Clephane was scrupulously careful not to intrude on her daughter’s working-hours; she held back, not with any tiresome display of discretion, but with the air of caring for her own independence too much not to respect Anne’s.",

Even with the security of Kreiz, I was nervous about this landfall. Wallis island would be the closest thing to an atoll that I ever had to deal with. The fringing reefs extended well beyond the limits of the coastline and there was only one cut large enough to enter the lagoon. The pilot books bore ill tidings for boats attempting Honi Kulu pass, and had warnings of nasty 5-knot contrary currents and huge waves. The lagoon filled up with the breaking Pacific swells that thundered over the reefs, but the water exited mainly through this one pass. Worried that it would be impossible to enter, we approached, Kreiz first and Varuna following sheepishly, engines idling.",

    "target_paragraph": "That prison, next door to our own bungalow, combined behind its thatch and whitewashed walls and tiny port-holes the sense of darkness and airlessness, and the kind of mindless brutality which sometimes vents itself in this country in the torture of a cat (the head warder was a moron and a cripple). Each port-hole, the size of a man’s head, represented a cell. The prisoners within, men and women, were tied by ropes to a stick which was laid crosswise against the port-hole outside. There were two or three men who were driven out to work each morning, two skinny old women who carried in the food and water, their ropes coiled round their waists, an old man who was allowed to lie outside on a mat tied to one of the posts which supported the thatch. In a dark cavernous entrance, where the whitewash stopped, a few warders used to lounge all through the day shouting and squabbling and sometimes diving, club in hand, into one of the tiny cells. The old prisoner was a half-wit; I saw one of the warders beating him with his club to make him move to the tin basin in which he was to wash, but he didn’t seem to feel the blows. Life to him was narrowed into a few very simple, very pale sensations, of warmth on his mat in the sun and cold in his cell, for Tapee-Ta at night was very cold. One of the old women had been in prison a month awaiting trial. She was accused of having made lightning in her village, and there was a pathetic impotence in her daily purgatory under the staggering weight of water from the stream half a mile away. If she could make lightning, why did she not burn the prison down or strike the dilatory Commissioner dead? Very likely she had made lightning (I could not disbelieve these stories; they were too well attested), but perhaps the natural force had died in her during her imprisonment, or perhaps she simply hadn’t the right medicines with her in that place. I asked the Quartermaster when she would be tried; he didn’t know.",

The imaginative light the mountaineers cast over me was like that cast by the polar expeditions – the beauty and danger of the landscape, the immensities of space, the utter uselessness of it all – but with high altitudes in place of high latitudes. To be sure these people had their faults. They were beset by the sins of their age: racism, sexism and an unflagging snobbery. And mingled with their bravery was an acute selfishness. But I didn’t notice these traits at the time. All I saw was impossibly brave men stepping out into the brilliant light of the unknown.",

My ears slowly adjusted to the humidity-soaked quietude. A squirrel scuffled to my left and a bird chirped in a tree behind me. There was also the nearly imperceptible murmur of moving water. I ran down the road beyond the gate. As I came around the bend, I saw a muddy stain running across the gravel. Black tubing protruded from the ground in a patch of trees above the road. Clear, cool water gushed out of it steadily. I scanned the area for snakes before getting down on my knees.

At our photocopying shop there is a table along one wall that is cluttered with free things to which you can help yourself— pots of glue, stapler, Scotch tape, a guillotine for neatening edges, boxes of rubber bands and paper clips. You don’t have to pay an extra fee for any of this or even be a customer. It’s just there for anyone who wants to wander in and use it.

Every time we walked down the private path to his monastery and Hiroko shouted, “Excuse me,” a responsive howl would sound from a junior monk within, and a shaven-headed figure in robes would appear to lead us down a series of narrow, polished corridors to the fourteenth-century audience room, where Fukushima-roshi, official Zen master, would emerge, a tiny, smiling figure in heavy orange silk robes, and take his place in a thick armchair. A young monk would be summoned to fetch us tea, and our friend would elucidate again the meaning of his calligraphy: “Every day is a good day.”",

His unprepared mind was unrooted by insane fear: the car rolled downward from one lighted cavern to another, and as his heart withered to a pea, he heard from the people about him loud gusty laughter, in which his sister joined. His mind, just emerging from the unreal wilderness of childish fancy, gave way completely in this Fair, and he was paralyzed by the conviction, which often returned to him in later years, that his life was a fabulous nightmare and that, by cunning and conspirate artifice, he had surrendered all his hope, belief and confidence to the lewd torture of demons masked in human flesh. Half-sensible, and purple with gasping terror, he came out finally into the warm and practical sunlight.",

There were traces of fine wrinkles at the corners of her eyes, and her face gave an impression of physical maturity and warmth, together with the wisdom that comes from experience, but it was also apparent that some of the freshness and resilience of youth had gone out of it. Her figure had an almost shameless sexual attraction, the kind of naked allure that one often sees in people of the theatre--in a chorus girl or in the strip-tease woman of a burlesque show. Her whole personality bore a vague suggestion of the theatrical stamp. In everything about her there was that element of heightened vividness which seems to set off and define people who follow the stage.",

Opening a plastic shopping bag, she removed a cardboard shoebox and gazed lovingly at the hideous pink sports shoes nestled inside. ‘Mooi, he?’ I asked, gesturing at the river and attempting to strike up a conversation. ‘Beautiful, isn’t it?’",

When Mr Bylen stood me a seventh I thought it impolite to refuse though the sixth had felt like enough. Eventually, in merry mood, I tottered off into the forest carrying a mini-lamp which soon expired. By an unfortunate (or incompetent) coincidence my pencil torch did likewise a moment later and somewhere I took a wrong turning – as I tend to do, even in daylight when sober. It was a moonless night and no starlight could penetrate the foliage: the darkness was total. Uncertainly I stumbled over tangled tree roots and into inexplicable shallow holes, then attempted to retrace my steps. I was not drunk enough to be reckless; when I seemed to be getting into denser forest, on a rougher path, I decided to stop and sleep on a root-free space. Luckily there was no dew (an ominous sign, as I realized next day when the temperature soared into the nineties) and I slept soundly, using my journal bag as pillow.",

Mile after mile these perfectly flat brown hard-baked Euclidean surfaces ran, without a blade of grass on them, without a tree or an animal or a clump of spinifex – nothing but towering, thin, crooked, brown pillars of whirling dust being sucked up into a burning, almost white sky. Looking at these claypans was like gazing at a calm ocean, only you could walk on this stuff. Right next to one huge pan was a dwarf replica, about a hundred yards across. A bush ballroom. An outback amphitheatre. I tied up the camels for their midday break and in that searing, clean, bright, dry heat, I took off my clothes and danced. I danced until I could dance no more – I danced out everything, Diggity, the trip, Rick, the article, the whole lot. I shouted and howled and wept and I leapt and contorted my body until it refused to respond any more. I crawled back to the camels, covered in grime and sweat, shaking with fatigue, dust in my ears and nose and mouth, and slept for about an hour. When I woke, I felt healed, and weightless, and prepared for anything.",

The woman carrying the child saw her and stopped. The second woman stopped too, though the others—an old man on a single crutch and carrying a small cloth-knotted bundle and leaning on the arm of an old woman who appeared to be blind—were still walking on when the young woman ran past them and up to the woman carrying the child and stopped facing her, her wan face urgent and frantic again.",

But there were only the rooks flaunting in the sky. A steel-blue plume from one of them fell among the heather. She loved wild birds’ feathers. She had used to collect them as a boy. She picked it up and stuck it in her hat. The air blew upon her spirit somewhat and revived it. As the rooks went whirling and wheeling above her head and feather after feather fell gleaming through the purplish air, she followed them, her long cloak floating behind her, over the moor, up the hill. She had not walked so far for years. Six feathers had she picked from the grass and drawn between her fingers and pressed to her lips to feel their smooth, glinting plumage, when she saw, gleaming on the hillside, a silver pool, mysterious as the lake into which Sir Bedivere flung the sword of Arthur.* A single feather quivered in the air and fell into the middle of it. Then, some strange ecstasy came over her. Some wild notion she had of following the birds to the rim of the world and flinging herself on the spongy turf and there drinking forgetfulness, while the rooks’ hoarse laughter sounded over her. She quickened her pace; she ran; she tripped; the tough heather roots flung her to the ground. Her ankle was broken. She could not rise. But there she lay content. The scent of the bog myrtle and the meadow-sweet was in her nostrils. The rooks’ hoarse laughter was in her ears. ‘I have found my mate,’ she murmured. ‘It is the moor.* I am nature’s bride,’ she whispered, giving herself in rapture to the cold embraces of the grass as she lay folded in her cloak in the hollow by the pool. ‘Here will I lie. (A feather fell upon her brow.) I have found a greener laurel than the bay. My forehead will be cool",

Silence and space. Water and air. In the ringing, silver purity of the streets, the abstract was brought close and given warmth. It was given further plangency by the country’s sense of exquisite agony, its appreciation of the way in which all the floating world is shadowed by mortality, so that loveliness is sad, and sadness lovely. Thus the bare rooms and sparse trees of the gardens were designed to register all the inflections of the passing seasons, and the gardens themselves became elegiac odes, haikus that arrest all the fugitive sensations that catch at the Japanese heart: longing and parting, the passage of time, the ache of recollection.",

    "target_paragraph": "Dutch football was not always so peaceful. As elsewhere in Europe, many games in the 1970s, 1980s and beyond had been marred by serious violence. Most notoriously, matches between Feyenoord and Ajax had often ended in bloodshed, thanks to a bitter rivalry between the two clubs resembling Britain’s ‘Old Firm’ rivalry between Celtic and Rangers. The first Klassieker (‘classic’) match between the two sides was held in 1921, ending in a 2–2 draw. Since then they had played more than 130 times, with Ajax winning roughly 60 per cent of the time. The rivalry really took off in the 1970s, when the two teams were among the best in the world, vying for dominance of the Eredivisie and of European tournaments. In Rotterdam, people still spoke proudly of famous victories over Ajax, such as the 9–4 drubbing handed out in 1964, or the 7–3 hammering in 1956. Recent years had seen a run of disappointing results for Feyenoord when it played Ajax, to the disgust of its supporters.",

    "target_paragraph": "Dick has sometimes handed the sled over to me for two and three miles at a time, he and Donna walking far behind. On forest trails, with the ground uneven, the complexity of the guesswork is more than I’d have dreamed. We come to, say, a slight uphill grade. I have been riding, standing on the back of the sled. The dogs, working harder, begin throwing glances back at me. I jump off and run, giving them a hundred-and-fifty-pound bonus. The sled picks up speed in reply. Sooner or later, they stop—spontaneously quit—and rest. Let them rest too long and they’ll dig holes in the snow and lie down. I have learned to wait about forty-five seconds, then rattle the sled, and off they go. I don’t dare speak to them, because my voice is not Cook’s. If I speak, they won’t move at all. There are three main choices—to ride, to run behind, or to keep a foot on the sled and push with the other, like a kid propelling a scooter. The incline has to be taken into account, the weight of the sled, the firmness of the trail, the apparent energy of the dogs, the time since they last rested, one’s own degree of fatigue. Up and down hill, over frozen lakes—now ride, now half ride, run. Ten below zero seems to be the fulcrum temperature at which the air is just right to keep exertion cool. You’re tired. Ride. Outguess the dogs. Help with one foot. When they’re just about to quit, step off and run. When things look promising, get on again, rest, look around at the big white country; its laden spruce on forest trails; its boulevard, the silent Yukon. On a cold, clear aurorean night with the moon and Sirius flooding the ground, the sound of the sled on the dry snow is like the rumbling cars of a long freight, well after the engine has passed. According to Harry David, dogs run faster in moonlight, because they are trying to get away from their shadows.",

The little boat churns up beside the stone-grey quays, he sees the people moving quickly along beside the ship, he sees the bright blue and flaming red stripe of a gendarme’s baggy trousers, then he touches land again, he passes down the gangway and surrenders his landing card, he is moving swiftly across the quay behind the brawny little blue-jacketed figure of a porter, a vital little French goat stepping along cockily with his baggage. At the customs counter the man is waiting, he shouts and beckons to the traveler, the fatigued officials mutter the usual formula, to which he replies swiftly, “Je n’ai rien, monsieur,” his baggage is swiftly chalked, the examination is over, he is passed.",

There was little movement; a few horses grazed, being deticked by egrets, a few oxen ploughed, a few carts were being loaded with machete-cut cane. Three narrow deep-set rivers were spanned by drearily utilitarian bridges; it’s sad that modern technology has killed bridge-building as an art.",
