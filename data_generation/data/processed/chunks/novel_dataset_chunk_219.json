He then walked backwards towards the boat, his face turned [towards the people] who were there, one hand holding the piece of flaming wood, the other covering his anus, for he was naked. Thus he set fire to the wood that had been set ready under the boat, [after they had placed the slave girl beside her master.] Then people came with wood and logs to burn, each holding a piece of a wood alight at one end, which they threw on to the wood. The fire enveloped the wood, [then the boat, then the tent,] the man, the girl and all that there was on the boat. [A violent and frightening] wind began [to blow, the flames grew in strength] and the heat of the fire intensified.",

Thin light, cold and watery. Burly clouds at 1,000 feet, the day forming from the dark. I left the little peninsula on which I’d slept the night and set off uphill and inland, onto the peat and into the wind, following the deer paths that laced the moor. The peat thinned as I gained height and rock began to show through the heather: Lewisian gneiss, the most ancient surface rock in Europe – 3.1 billion years old, zebra-striped, scarred and smoothed by multiple glaciations. The Pleistocene felt only a few weeks gone, the ice just recently retreated. The land dipped and cupped until I was walking up a mile-wide alley of rock, covered with fallen boulders and balanced glacial erratics. Ahead of me a great grey peak called Griomabhal lifted into the cloud. Half of its north face could be seen; the flank of a destroyer. A raven on a boulder croaked gorack, gorack; another rowed itself in high circles above my head. A grouse exploded away from the heather a yard from my feet, a drag-queen slur of red above each eye.",

He was a native of Rheims where his mother ran a wash-house known locally as ‘The Castle of Green Frogs’. He was a Bonapartist, a freemason, an ‘actionnaire’ of Möet and Chandon, an expert on barrage balloons (which he somewhat resembled) and an acquaintance of Verlaine. He financed his receptions with his commercial enterprise known as the Royal Society of the Constellation of the South, never removed his court from Paris, but did open consulates in Mauritius, Haiti, Nicaragua and Port-Vendres. When he made overtures to the Vatican, a Chilean prelate said: ‘This kingdom exists only in the minds of drunken idiots.’",

We bickered and, every few months, fought bitterly. I resented the fact that it felt dangerous to do anything out of the ordinary, anything outside the rut of habit. One morning at Cactus, when the wind was sideshore and the waves poor, I rose early and took a walk along the waterline, westward. The limestone tidepools were shiny in the rising light. The ubiquitous outback flies were absent, perhaps because of the hour, perhaps because of the wind. I ended up walking a long way, and saw not a soul. By the time I made it back to camp, it was midmorning and Bryan was pissed. Where had I gone? He had cooked and eaten breakfast without me. My oatmeal was stiff and curdled. I didn’t feel like accounting for myself. I was munching an apple. He continued to grouse. I exploded. How dare he tell me when I could go where? Unfortunately, I spat a mouthful of half-chewed apple onto our tent, more or less deliberately. Bryan stalked away in disgust. Thankfully, he never mentioned the Apple Spat (or Spat Apple) again. It was almost as bad as a similar row we had in Western Samoa, when I shouted at him to never again tell me what to do, and he seriously considered, he later told me, pulling the plug on our South Pacific trip, which was then barely two weeks old.",

In his world, first base was a blow job, second was anal, third involved a third, and a home run was pretty complicated but probably involved a swing and a go-go dancer. Obviously these definitions don’t apply to every gay man, but the takeaway is certainly that things get very advanced very quickly when women are not involved. Much like with other male-on-male activities, like, say, war, the escalation is fast and furious and often involves bleeding.",

There was not a souvenir shop to be seen, or an open-air café featuring ‘traditional’ music, or a tourist office or taxi rank. The long pine-lined main street, of red-tiled, one-storey, porticoed houses with deep verandahs, is being officially preserved as a classic example of a colonial agricultural settlement. As some guide-books complain, there is ‘nothing to do’ in Viñales. This suited me: I needed a ‘do nothing’ day and dawdled around enjoying the nearby mogotes and noticing an unusual concentration on the Miami Five; all over the town their photographs and protesting posters were prominently displayed. Also, with the assistance of a small boy I found the beginning of the track to La Palma: this halves the road distance, making for an easy day’s walk.",

Once more the searing pain shot down his leg, and he cussed and yelled, biting his lip until it bled.

    "target_paragraph": "Our friend’s wife was apparently used to her husband’s bad luck in the hunting-field. When she saw us returning without any game she received us with screams of laughter and her sliteyes almost disappeared in her merriment. She had carefully prepared a meal from the game her husband had killed a few days before and now got down enthusiastically to cooking it. We watched the operation and were somewhat astonished when she slipped off the upper half of her great fur mantle, round the waist of which she wore a bright coloured belt, without a trace of shyness. The heavy fur had hindered her movements, so she stripped to the waist and carried on happily. Later on we often encountered similar examples of natural simplicity. It was with real regret that we parted from this friendly couple, when fully rested and with our bellies full of good fresh meat we set out on our way. As we travelled we often saw the black forms of wild yaks grazing far away on the mountain-side. The sight of them prompted our donkey to make a bid for independence: he dashed through a widish stream and before we could reach him had shaken our packs off his back. We followed him cursing and swearing and eventually caught him. Then, as we were busy drying our things on the further side of the water, two figures suddenly came into view. We recognised the first at once from his regular, slow, mountaineer’s stride—it was Peter Aufschnaiter, with a hired bearer. It may be thought that such a meeting in such a place sounds far-fetched; but is it only by certain valleys and passes that one comes over the mountain ranges, and we and Peter had chosen the most well-trodden route.",

The tide had recently gone out, and we walked across the wet sand leaving footprints precise as pastry-cuts. Gulls stomped and yapped. Finlay’s ‘family’ turned out to be a colony of limpets that lived on the underside of a boulder which he had christened Phobus (the name of one of Mars’s moons). He visited them almost every day, and had done so for a year, noting their relative positions on the boulder, their daily migrations and returns. He’d sketched and measured each limpet, and to each he had given a name. For months he’d been mapping the short journeys the limpets made across the surface of Phobus. He had become intrigued by their ability to find their way back to their ‘home’ positions on the rock, which they did with extraordinary diligence and accuracy, as if following an invisible path or trail.",

Become one with him so you know him perfectly and can be one step ahead of his every movement.” The central notion of ki, or “spirit power,” like the guiding principle of judo, was similarly angled: “Make use of an opponent’s strength and yours will be doubled.”",

And the sight of all hands naked was enough to make a cat laugh. We were red as lobsters and our teeth chattering.’",

Half-an-hour’s ambling brought us to a sheltered hollow where we saw two Sherpa dwellings, with freshly-printed prayer-flags flying between them. There was a well here, beside the path, and pausing to drink from it I noticed something that almost paralysed me with astonishment – wrapping paper off a bar of Lifebuoy soap. I beckoned to Mingmar, and we stood staring at this baffling manifestation of ‘civilisation’ as though we were the first men on the moon and had found an empty matchbox there before us. Then, continuing towards the houses, we came upon two gorgeous silk saris spread on the grass to dry – and next we saw a most beautiful young creature, wearing a pink sari and golden slippers, with attractive bazaar jewellery in her glossy hair and on her slender neck and arms. This vision was leaning against a low stone wall, talking to an older woman with a weather-roughened face whose muscular body was clad in the filthiest of rags and who obviously had never washed in her life.",

He, too, was a would-be English-speaker, elated at the prospect of entertaining a falang. Up-ladder, on a long wide balcony, I was introduced to his father-in-law – sitting on a mini-chair, aged about fifty, looking sorry for himself. He showed me a deep, infected axe wound in the middle of his swollen right foot and pleaded for medicine. Explaining that I had none, I offered nursing care instead. His immediate reaction was fear but Mr Somsak persuaded him to take advantage of falang expertise – then fetched a basin of very hot water. The patient was admirably stoical as I cleaned the gash and poulticed it before squeezing out a scary amount of pus. His eldest granddaughter (aged nine) deftly applied a bandage made of woven banana fibre and a few hours later he was happily walking on his heel.",

In 1925, vapores and other commercial craft carried 100,000 passengers and 388,000 tons of freight, figures that by 1956 had increased to 363,000 passengers and 2.2 million tons of cargo. But then, even as the Antioquia Railway faced insolvency, came a second blow, the loss in 1961 of the David Arango, the legendary vessel that stood for all that was glorious and sublime in the life of the river. With this symbol in ashes, hearts broke and dreams died all over Colombia. Seven commercial vapores remained in service, but the magic was gone. By 1969, the total passenger count had declined to 22,688 and the era of river travel was essentially over.",

Nine hours by overnight bus didn't seem too bad when I was sat at home planning the trip. It seemed less appealing as we trudged back to our Chisinau hotel at 6pm, eager for a cold shower after a sweltering, thirty-two-degree day, spent exploring the intriguing city of Soviet architecture and pavement café's, peopled by an unusual mix of headscarf-clad babushkas and blonde barbie-dolls in hot pants.",

Undaunted, he shut his eyes and prayed three times to Khwaja Khizr, the Green Sufi who guards the Waters of Life. When Baha-ud-Din awoke, the bricks and mortar had disappeared; in their place—fully built—stood the step well brim full of fresh, cool spring water.

For a month or so prior to the ceremony, leaves of the peraksok have been soaking in mud and water. They are removed, dried, and combed, making the long hair for Barong's coat, which is patched and repaired on this day. Starting early in the morning, the entire sekan barong works very hard in Pura Pererepan to make sure that the leather is freshly gilded, and that all the decorations — such as flags, umbrellas, and spears — are in top shape. The barong costume is propped up on poles out in the sun, and the back pieces, tail, and so on are tied to the body with stout rope. A short ceremony, at about 3 P.M., ends the process.",

Hundreds of feet above them, like a fiery sheet of snow, spindrift is being rasped continually off the brink of the North Col. The wind down here, on the lee slopes, is almost impossible: up there it will be fatal. But Mallory, again, is keen ‘to push the adventure a little further’. So he and Bullock and Wheeler cut steps gradually upwards to the edge of the col. There, just for the sake of it, they step out on to the col and for a few minutes bear the full brunt of the wind. They gaze upwards at the ridge, angling thousands of feet up to the summit. The wind is cyclonic, apocalyptic – a wind, Mallory remembers later, ‘in which no man could live for an hour’. It is important that they have reached the col, though, because it means, as Mallory writes to Ruth afterwards, that the way to the summit has been established ‘for anyone who cares to try the highest adventure …’",
