In a small square hut with a verandah draped with the Liberian flag, a number of elderly natives were sitting with a half-caste. He was dressed in dirty pyjamas, he had a yellow face, a few decaying teeth, a glass eye; he was one of the ugliest men I met in Liberia, but there is no one there for whom I feel now a greater affection. He gave me a chair, he brought me the first fresh fruit I had seen for weeks, large bitter oranges and limes; he arranged a hut for me, and he expected no return.",

I like the consistency of the public health policy in southeast Asia. They meant what they said and they didn’t mess around or do anything in half measures. As a result, they were suffering less. Fewer people were dying. Despite all the confusion, arguing (internal) and ambivalence, back in my Hut was where I wanted to be at this moment in history, no vaccines in sight.",

A very thin line of shadow tapered on the horizon, scarcely thick enough to stand the burden of Paris, which nevertheless rested upon it. They were free of roads, free of mankind, and the same exhilaration at their freedom ran through them all. The ship was making her way steadily through small waves which slapped her and-then fizzled like effervescing water, leaving a little border of bubbles and foam on either side. The colourless October sky above was thinly clouded as if by the trail of wood-fire smoke, and the air was wonderfully salt and brisk. Indeed it was too cold to stand still. Mrs Ambrose drew her arm within her husband’s, and as they moved off it could be seen from the way in which her sloping cheek turned up to his that she had something private to communicate. They went a few paces and Rachel saw them kiss.",

He, who had been thinking with the unlimited time of the mind, which stretches in a flash from Shakespeare to ourselves, poked the fire and began to live by that other clock which marks the approach of a particular person. The wide and dignified sweep of his mind contracted. He became on the alert. I could feel him listening to sounds in the street. I noted how he touched a cushion. From the myriads of mankind and all time past he had chosen one person, one moment in particular. A sound was heard in the hall. What he was saying wavered in the air like an uneasy flame. I watched him disentangle one footstep from other footsteps; wait for some particular mark of identification and glance with the swiftness of a snake at the handle of the door. (Hence the astonishing acuteness of his perceptions; he has been trained always by one person.) So concentrated a passion shot out others like foreign matter from a still, sparkling fluid. I became aware of my own vague and cloudy nature full of sediment, full of doubt, full of phrases and notes to be made in pocket-books. The folds of the curtain became still, statuesque; the paperweight on the table hardened; the threads on the curtain sparkled; everything became definite, external, a scene in which I had no part. I rose, therefore; I left him.",

All was warmth, peace, intimacy. As she sat down by the fireside she seemed to see Fred Landers’s heavy figure in the opposite armchair, his sturdy square-toed boots turned to the hearth. She remembered how, one day, as he sat there, she had said to herself that it might be pleasant to see him there always. Now, in the extremity of her loneliness, the thought returned. Since then he had confessed his own hope to her—shyly, obliquely, apologetically; but under his stammering words she had recognized the echo of a long desire. She knew he had always loved her; had not Anne betrayed that it was her guardian who had persuaded her to recall her unknown mother? Kate Clephane owed him everything, then—all her happiness and all her sorrow! He knew everything of her life—or nearly everything. To whom else could she turn with the peculiar sense of security which that certitude gave? She felt sorry that she had received his tentative advance so coldly, so inarticulately. After all, he might yet be her refuge—her escape. She closed her eyes, and tried to imagine what life would be—years and years of it—at Fred Landers’s side. To feel the nearness of that rugged patient kindness; would it not lighten her misery, make the thoughts and images that were torturing her less palpable, less acute, less real?",

Reminding myself that I had come to Moscow for a cultural experience, I walked over to the buffet and picked up a tray. The special was bifshteks, missile-shaped meat chops served with your choice of cold beets smothered in sour cream or egg salad sculpted into phallic mounds by the cook’s bare hands and topped with a dollop of mayonnaise and a parsley sprig. Side orders included days-old baguettes and fuzzy cheese, burned rice or scorched potatoes, speckled sausages or greasy soups. Big tin spoons were the only silverware, heavily sugared tea was the sole beverage, and salt was the single spice. Keeping to my vegetarian diet, I asked the woman behind the counter to ladle me a bowl of soup (clear broth seasoned with cucumber slices) and some macaroni; the tea came scalding hot in a plastic cup with no handle. The cashier totaled the cost of my meal on an abacus: 75 cents.",

Henry Adams, who launched a famous broadside against Smith just after the Civil War, saw his salvo as “a rear attack on the Virginia aristocracy” he so despised. Though regional passions later cooled, many twentieth-century historians were just as harsh. In 1975, Edmund Morgan branded Jamestown a “fiasco” that endured despite the worst efforts of its colonists.",

Soon my carriage was full of characters recalling nineteenth-century illustrations of Balkan brigands – bearded men in heavily embroidered homespun clothes with long knives in their belts and huge gnarled hands and strong bony faces and deep-set eyes. They smelt even more pungently than I did; otherwise you couldn’t have more agreeable travelling companions – gentle and courteous and warm-hearted. They too ceaselessly talked politics, as the train very, very slowly climbed up and up and up, between snowy forested hills, stopping for fifteen or twenty minutes at every tiny village. Lacking an interpreter, I could only glean that they were unanimously pro-Iliescu, though far from unanimous about how he should run the country.",

In 1907, while searching for ways to boost telephone signals, De Forest invented something called the thermionic triode detector. De Forest’s patent described it as “a System for Amplifying Feeble Electric Currents” and it would play a pivotal role in the development of broadcast radio and much else involving the delivery of sound, but the real developments would come from others. De Forest, unfortunately, was forever distracted by business problems. Several companies he founded went bankrupt, twice he was swindled by his backers, and constantly he was in court fighting over money or patents. For these reasons, he didn’t follow through on his invention.",

    "target_paragraph": "Not far from our hotel we came on a scene of great activity around seven little watermills, now just beginning to work again, having been frozen since early December. Each consists of a low, circular, stone shelter built over the millstone, which is rotated by water from a nullah caught in a hollowed-out tree-trunk set at an acute angle to the wheel to increase power. Above the wheel hangs a conical wicker basket with an appropriate hole in its base. This contains a curious species of barley, without chaff, which grows from 8,000 feet upwards and at lesser heights resumes the characteristics of ordinary barley. Marco Polo mentioned finding this convenient variety in Afghanistan; no cleaning is necessary and the Baltis, like the Tibetans, parch the grain in special furnaces as soon as it has been threshed. Thus the flour is pre-cooked and an ideal form of nourishment for long journeys through terrain where no fuel is available. The Tibetans and Ladakis mix it with butter-tea to form a tasty and sustaining dough known as tsampa, which is their chief food; but in this region of meagre soil it is a delicacy, known as satu. It smells like toast and our mouths watered as we bent to peer through the four-foot high entrances into the noisy gloom. No doubt it was just a coincidence that each mill was being tended by an aged, bearded man and a young girl. The man supervised the flow of water into the tree-trunk, clearing away extraneous matter caught by a wooden grille, while within the shelter the girl crouched – a figure made ghostly by flour-dust – rhythmically gathering the precious satu into a dirty square of cloth. The mills of Gwali ground slowly today, for the thaw is only beginning, and every mill-watcher wore that look of pinched misery peculiar to those who accept that there is no alternative to being cold.",

She seldom went into society owing to some physical defect in her structure; she could only sit at home, like Penelope, weaving these and other bright tapestries—odds and ends of servants' gossip, patched together by the virulent industry of her own disordered imagination. It consoled Mr. Eames slightly to reflect that he was not the only resident singled out for such aspersions; that the more harmless a man's life, the more fearsome the legends. He suffered, none the less. This was why he seldom entered the premises of the Alpha and Omega Club where, quite apart from his objection to Parker's poison and the loose and rowdy talk of the place, he was liable to encounter the lady's stepbrother. Of course he knew perfectly well what he ought to have done. He ought to have imitated the example of other people who behaved like scoundrels and openly gloried in it. That was the only way to be even with her; it took the wind out of her sails. Keith often put the matter into a nutshell:",

Once an oil refinery and shipyardemploying nine thousand workers during the First World Warit has been abandoned now for nearly a century. Aerial photos offer a time-lapse of its ruination. In the 1930s it is still sharply delineated, like a navy vessel sitting low in the water. By 1940, the boats that huddle along its shoreline appear exhausted and drunken, and the clapboard shingle shacks along the quaysides are slumped and squinting. By 1969, corpses of boats are piled disorderly on its western shore; jetties reduced to a stubble of wooden posts emerging from murky depths, the island’s bare and muddy face wearing a thin sackcloth of rough grass. It was such an eyesore that a local politician suggested around that time that they should simply blast it out the water.",

Soon he was running to keep up and still shouting, and Bayard lifted his hands off the cowling and opened the throttle.

Bayard opened the throttle full and the machine lurched forward and when he passed the shabby man in midfield the tail was high and the plane rushed on in long bounds, and he had a fleeting glimpse of the man’s wild arms and his open mouth as the bounding ceased.",

We found the ticket booth behind a small cinderblock building (which housed a pair of aromatic water closets) and waited.

We let him rest for a few minutes until the chatter from the growing line of tourists behind us roused him from his slumber. He shuffled over to the ticket office and crept through the back door.",

It was one of those tragic loves doomed for lack of money, and one day the girl closed it out on the basis of common sense. During a long summer of despair I wrote a novel instead of letters, so it came out all right, but it came out all right for a different person. The man with the jingle of money in his pocket who married the girl a year later would always cherish an abiding distrust, an animosity, towards the leisure class – not the conviction of a revolutionist but the smouldering hatred of a peasant. In the years since then I have never been able to stop wondering where my friends’ money came from, nor to stop thinking that at one time a sort of droit de seigneur might have been exercised to give one of them my girl.",

In some ways it is the most interesting room of the house because it looks, with its open hearth, bellows, and spit, caldrons and looms and clay oil-burning lamps, its witty ceramic hand warmers in the shape of shoes, as if it were peopled still. (In the fourteenth century the spit was hand-rotated by means of pulleys; it wasn't until the fifteenth century that dogs were used to control the mechanism—which may have been bliss for the servants, but which seems like an evolutionary step backward into barbarism to me.)",

My high-ceilinged room had faded rose-and-silver embossed wallpaper, a tall, arched french window, leading onto a wide wrought-iron balcony, and a dehydrated en suite bathroom. Unfortunately the warped window wouldn’t quite close, the antique radiator didn’t work, and by 8.15 my hands were too numb to write. Then, just as I had thawed in my flea-bag, and was drifting towards sleep, the maze of archaic bathroom pipes began to shudder and growl and hiss. Moments later cold water came gushing in noisy spasms from all four taps, which could not be fully turned off. When I pulled the lavatory chain – its ivory handle was delicately carved – the cistern made a noise like a large animal in pain. Nothing else happened. Grumpily I dressed and went downstairs in search of plumbing advice.",

I thought of Pytheas, the Greek voyager who had sailed north from France in 325 BC, following established trade routes to begin with – the ‘tin road’, the ‘amber road’ – and then just kept going, pausing on Lewis to erect his gnomon and take readings of sun height and day length, before sailing still further north, until he reached a latitude where the sea turned gelid with the cold and the air palled with freezing mists, such that the atmosphere resembled what Pytheas enigmatically called a ‘sea-lung’ (pneumon thalassios).",

This marked a significant turning-point in the fortunes of poor whites, hitherto barred from public service by their ignorance of both English and Dutch. But then – as Karima dryly recalled – a mere fifty years later the attempt to impose Afrikaans on black pupils provoked the ’76 Soweto uprising, an event now identifiable as the beginning of the end for white supremacy.",

It became a stormy and demented kind of night, such as one sometimes finds in England in the winter. A man alone, if he had adventure in his soul, might have found it a thrilling and wildly beautiful night. But to this quiet little man, who was probably thinking bitterly of a glass of beer and the snug haven of his favourite pub, the demoniac visage of the night must have been appalling. It was one of those nights when the beleaguered moon drives like a spectral ship through the scudding storm rack of the sky, and the wind howls and shrieks like a demented fiend. They could hear it roaring all round them through the storm-tossed branches of the barren trees. Then it would swoop down on them with an exultant scream, and moan and whistle round the car, and sweep away again while gusts of beating rain drove across their vision. Then they would hear it howling far away--remote, demented, in the upper air, rocking the branches of the trees. And the spectral moon kept driving in and out, now casting a wild, wan radiance over the stormy landscape, now darting in behind a billowing mass of angry-looking clouds and leaving them to darkness and the fiendish howling of the wind. It was a fitting night for the commission of a crime, and the driver, it was plain to see, now feared the worst.",

However, the tranquil atmosphere inside the Basilica provided welcome relief from the unceasing drizzle and the thump of the carnival bands. Skirting the courtyard, I pushed open a heavy door and entered the church proper. It was a cavernous space, with a high dome above the altar and stained glass windows that cast weak kaleidoscopic beams onto the rows of wooden pews. Thick stone pillars reached upwards all around me, giving the impression of being in a forest of exceptionally sturdy trees. Towards the rear of the nave, a tight spiral staircase led down to the crypt. I descended into a small, murky chamber containing a few rows of wooden chairs and a cloth-covered altar. On one wall, a frame contained a printed copy of a speech given by Pope John Paul II when he visited nearly three decades previously. At the rear of the chapel, in an alcove protected by a sturdy metal grate, was the man himself: St Servatius, resting under a thick stone slab. A generous bunch of red flowers lay on top of the tomb, between a pair of ivory candles with flickering golden tongues.",

Maybe it’s always like that in cockpit and you just don’t know when you are in a separate compartment further back, but this was most assuredly unnerving. Worse, after a minute it became evident that Nino couldn’t see a thing. He began to move his head from spot to spot around the windscreen, putting his nose to the glass, looking for any tiny bit of visibility. I couldn’t understand why he didn’t put the windscreen wiper on, then looked more closely and saw there wasn’t a windscreen wiper. I glanced across at Nick and we shared a single telepathic thought: There’s no windscreen wiper!",

They were the Torlonias, immortalized over a century later by Ignazio Silone, in Fontamara, as the vicious landowners of his native countryside. Closer to Keats’s time they were noted by Stendhal as bankers, making huge profits through extortionate rates of exchange from the English in Rome. Their dealings with poor Severn, at his wits’ ends for money and trying to keep the fact from his friend, are told in the biographies; the Torlonias did nothing either technically wrong or humanly right in the affair, and on that latter score would seem to have been true to their history ever since.",

I hadn’t gone three steps when my feet skated and I fell painfully on my ass. I struggled halfway to my feet but slipped and fell again; struggled up, staggered sideways a yard or two, and pitched helplessly forward, breaking my fall with my hands and ending up in the water doggie style. As I landed, my pack slid forward and my boots, tied to its frame by their laces, were hurled into a kind of contained orbit; they came around the side of the pack in a long, rather pretty trajectory, and came to a halt against my head, then plunked into the water, where they dangled in the current. As I crouched there, breathing evenly and telling myself that one day this would be a memory, two young guys—clones almost of the two we had seen the day before—strode past with confident, splashing steps, packs above their heads.",
