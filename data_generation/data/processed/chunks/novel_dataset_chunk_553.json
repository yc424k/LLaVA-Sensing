A credit system for rearing pigs and poultry has been set up, with training for those who never before could afford to own livestock. The ‘development committee’ has also bought a bicycle for communal use and everyone was fascinated to hear that the grey-haired falang granny was travelling by bicycle. Leaping on to my soap-box, I asked Mrs Bounyong to translate a message from me: ‘Stick with your bicycle, or bicycles if possible – then when you’re old you will be healthy like the falang granny!’",

From the rooftop of the Eden, we could see the mountains bright in the clear distance, and, presiding over us from a nearby hill, shining in the clean winter light, the gleaming white stupa of Swayambhunath Temple. This, we decided, must be the site of our maiden pilgrimage. And so we headed off through a warren of dust-filled streets, past squawking, bright-eyed urchins, under lion-headed banners wishing everyone an auspicious New Year, and past the Jubilant Pre-Primary School. Soon, the noise of the city began to subside, and the air picked up an invigorating sharpness. We walked through an avenue of trees, past fields smothered with wildflowers. We passed a few local men going about their business, small but sturdy-looking fellows in the rough tunics and fezzes of the High Atlas Mountains. We walked over narrow bridges and across fields of yellow flowers and then, in the bright and cloudless winter afternoon, we began our ascent of the hill.",

An avenue of trees ran along the road, which was completely straight. The trees suddenly came to an end; the road turned a corner, and they found themselves confronted by a large square building. They had come out upon the broad terrace which ran round the hotel and were only a few feet distant from the windows. A row of long windows opened almost to the ground. They were all of them uncurtained, and all brilliantly lighted, so that they could see everything inside. Each window revealed a different section of the life of the hotel. They drew into one of the broad columns of shadow which separated the windows and gazed in. They found themselves just outside the dining-room. It was being swept; a waiter was eating a bunch of grapes with his leg across the corner of a table. Next door was the kitchen, where they were washing up; white cooks were dipping their arms into cauldrons, while the waiters made their meal voraciously off broken meats, sopping up the gravy with bits of crumb. Moving on, they became lost in a plantation of bushes, and then suddenly found themselves outside the drawing-room, where the ladies and gentlemen, having dined well, lay back in deep armchairs, occasionally speaking or turning over the pages of magazines. A thin woman was flourishing up and down the piano.",

She was recalling Mrs. Minity’s wrath when it had been announced that the reception for the new Bishop was to be given by Mrs. Parley Plush—Mrs. Plush, of all people! Mrs. Minity was not an active member of the Reverend Mr. Merriman’s parochial committees; her bodily inertia, and the haunting fear of what might happen if her coachman tried to turn the horses in the narrow street in which the Rectory stood, debarred her from such participation; but she was nevertheless a pillar of the church, by reason of a small but regular donation to its fund and a large and equally regular commentary on its affairs. Mr. Merriman gave her opinions almost the importance she thought they deserved; and a dozen times in the season Mrs. Merriman was expected to bear the brunt of her criticisms, and persuade her not to give up her pew and stop her subscription. “That woman,” Mrs. Minity would cry, “whom I have taken regularly for a drive once a fortnight all winter, and supplied with brandy-peaches when I had to go without myself!”",

After the sleepless journey from Jodhpur, we opted against the night train and chose the 11:10 am that arrived at 4:40 pm in Lalgarh Junction, a short ride from Bikaner. Only five others were on board: the ticket inspector and four members of the Indian Air Force, who boarded at Phalodi airbase. As we picked up speed, blood-red dust soared through the windows. Grappling at the shutter, we yanked it down. This was why everyone else travelled at night. It was the lesser of two evils. Slow-roasting for five hours at high temperatures, turning over once, we awoke fully cooked as train 41 pulled into Lalgarh.",

It is an agonizingly slow release method. The effects from Scopace are felt almost immediately. Within fifteen minutes I was feeling good enough to finish the kneading. But when I got back to kneading the dough ball it almost immediately began to swim about the kneading board. I was ready for the other half of the Scopace.

Frigid, gale-like winds toss around residents, sending pedestrians up to il Corso and the bit of protection its buildings furnish from the blasts of winter weather. Deceivingly, the official temperature reading may be a moderate forty-five or fifty degrees Fahrenheit, but with the cold air blowing down from snow-topped Etna and the humidity whirling off the sea, even Via Marina’s streetwalkers congregate in the somewhat protected cross streets.",

I forgot my pariah engine, whose starter once again refused to work and got to know my new friends through a constant stream of funny chatter that emerged from the little black box over my bed. Annatria and Tres Marias had SatNavs, which made life easier for the rest of us, although Franz and I would double-check the computer’s veracity by taking sun and star sights. Two or three times, while we were bobbing around during the intermittent calms that disrupted the feeble northerly winds, one of the boats would tow Varuna while it motored. It was a kind gesture because, with the additional dead weight, speed was greatly diminished, and the others could have very well left me to wait and fend for myself. And so we averaged 40 miles of progress per day, which was typical of sailing north on the Red Sea.",

Amber-colored vin santo is made from white grapes sun-dried on straw, stored in oak barrels under terra-cotta roofs, and allowed to go through four yearly cycles of hot and cold before it is bottled. There's very little I wouldn't give to have vin santo and biscotti under Florentine skies; I had my wine merchant get me some, and it was very nice indeed, but not so lovely as it had been in Florence, and I am inclined to think that that is not because some wines do not travel well but because we are transported when we drink them under their own skies.",

The ducal castle became the property of Corigliano Calabro in 1979, was restored from 1988 to 2002 with funds from the European Union, and subsequently opened to the public. On my visit, I discovered upon arrival to the ticket booth that a reservation had to be made in advance for a guided tour, which would have been contracted separately. Thus, I had to glean all I could from a simple handout of the castle’s history as I was escorted through the property by a city employee. The lanky, middle-aged man mutely executed his duties, patiently holding me under observation until I indicated that I was ready to be led to the next point of interest. I didn’t see much I could have picked up and walked away with.",

Wodehouse, and the faded glory of his diction somehow confers a gay Edwardian tilt on even the most everyday of transactions in India.

The young these days “air-dash” to what the newspapers typically call a “Mega Exhibition Showcase of Ideal Lifestyle,” but everything else proceeds as if nothing had ever changed; as if, in fact, everything is in the hands of some far-off gods who cannot always be relied upon.

    "target_paragraph": "Bodine’s Tavern, where the men of Martha went to vote on October 13, 1812, was a few miles south of Martha, on the Wading River. The jug taverns of the pines — so called because rare was the traveller who passed by one without going in to top up his liquor jug—were places of assembly for many public events, from elections and town meetings to community suppers and the regular drills of the standing militia. On election days, the suffrage was exercised with abandon. Not only was the bar open, but the local candidates were there, and the winner—as a rule—was the man who stood the greatest number of drinks for the electorate. The voters drank metheglin (mead and water with a zest of herbs), cider royall (highly concentrated cider), mimbo (rum and muscovado sugar), straight rum, whiskey, gin, beer. The same men drank the same drinks when they turned up at the same tavern as militiamen assembling for Training Day, an antecedent of what today would be a National Guard meeting. Training Days tended to mock rather than to improve military skills and procedures. While the tavernkeepers kept making rounds with mimbo and metheglin, drums rolled and fifes put a sense of celebration into the air. Officers, wearing stunning blue American uniforms that were braided in gold and studded with brass, rapped out sharp orders, which no one obeyed. After a little more mimbo, fights began to occur in the ranks. There were casualties. Some men fell as a result of blows received, and many more toppled over without assistance. Nonetheless, it was apparently important that there be some simulacrum of command, for Captain Townsend, of Martha, was summarily court-martialled at Bodine’s Tavern on April i, 1814, a Training Day, for being too drunk to give orders.",

Most lie crumpled in sleep on filthy blankets, some sit and stare, others hobble around in huge wooden chastity belts and a few perform austerities for the crowd to show their body means nothing. One young sadhu wraps his penis around a wooden stake and another, who has stood up for two years, leans on a swing showing off his gnarled thick legs.

He’s charging foreigners one hundred American dollars for a photo of the atrophied leathery limb with its closed claw of corkscrew nails.",

Shimmering heat waves make strange, blurry shapes along the road. Jungle meets above my head, thicker than I remember, knotting to block out the sky. I just stare for a moment. The muddy twisting track by the fumador has been widened, pressed down by footsteps. Coco’s sign is gone. A bright, beautifully painted banner now sits in its place, scrawled with the words BIENVENIDOS EL PARQUE. I think for a second that among the distorted shimmers, I see Coco feeling the breeze on his face. I shake my head, pulling myself in check. The jungle twists across the road and I can’t remember it being so green. Was it this green before? The sun shines white through the fanned, fluted leaves, reflecting emerald, olive, sage, lime, moss, jade, turquoise, viridian . . . colours I cannot name, across my face, across the silvery-gold branches of the trees. For a moment it is so beautiful, I cannot move. Too terrified to blink because if I do, maybe I’ll wake up and I won’t be here at all. I’ll have made a different choice. I’ll be in England behind a desk, nervous that my hair is out of place.",
