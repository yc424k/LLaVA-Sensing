So did DVDs of predatory gay men sucking off kidnapped and rope-bound ‘straight’ boys, and videos of boys so young, feminine, fine-featured and hairless that the images on the covers veered close to underage lesbian territory. There was also the infamous guro (gore) porn, an umbrella category of nightmarish stuff that involved blood, disfiguration, beatings, urine, enemas or faeces, as well as a generous and diverse bukkake selection, one of Japan’s more successful inter national exports.",

And if you’re a small pelagic fish at the surface you can’t escape, because these guys come after you, their tails whirring side to side in the water, the front of their bodies, their long beaks in the air, they skitter after you, a nightmare! And they can be a yard long! And their relatives—who are their relatives?”",

Her sitting room was walled in books from floor to ceiling, as were the short passages between bedrooms. The sitting room had much charm, a round table covered by a tasselled cloth under a hanging lamp, comfortable chairs in faded blue cotton brocade slips, long curtains of the same material, a good walnut writing table; a very French room. Madame Dupré led me down the hall to my bedroom where I spouted Gallic effusions to express my delight. A big brass bed with a white lace bedspread, a dressing table with a pink satin flounce, frilly white curtains, roses on the carpet, more books, and no hateful mosquito net, screens on the low windows. Madame Dupré hurried out and back, bearing a vase of flowers for the dressing-table. There was plenty of time for a bath and drinks before dinner. She dined at the civilized hour of eight-thirty.",

Finally we were let into the vagon and it somehow got hooked up to the train; and later, hours later, sprawled in the van, I felt the first few blessed inchings of forward motion.

When the train at last left the yards after all that time in Chernyshevsk, I relaxed as if the sedative had finally reached my veins.",

The rest of them filled her trim walks with their gleeful laughter and bright raiment; they devoured abundant wines and food at those refreshment tables which groaned under the weight of good things. One could trust Madame Steynlin to attend to the commissariat department. She knew how to gladden the human heart. That of Peter the Great was gladdened to such an extent that he soon began to perform a Russian peasant dance, A PAS SEUL, to the delight of the assembled guests. It was a cheery interlude with a disastrous ending, for the rough terrace being different from what he expected, he stumbled and fell full length upon the ground. There he lay, laughing, like a young giant refreshed with wine.",

Steady on!’\nThey were coming to a fence, and Stephen’s grip tightened a little. The pony took the fence in his stride very gaily; for an instant he seemed to stay poised in mid-air as though he had wings, then he touched earth again, and away without even pausing.\n‘All right, Stephen?’\n‘Yes, yes!’\nSir Philip’s broad back was bent forward over the shoulder of his hunter; the crisp auburn hair in the nape of his neck showed bright where the winter sunshine touched it; and as the child followed that purposeful back, she felt that she loved it utterly, entirely. At that moment it seemed to embody all kindness, all strength, and all understanding.",

He swung the fish to me, my knife in hand to kill it, bleed out the gills, descale, and get it on a stringer. The instant the net hit the water again, another fish. We hooted in disbelief. At first it was comical, then biblical (three in one net), and then ghastly, as I bludgeoned fish faster than I could bid them thanks. Fluids warmed my palms through gloves. I scooped handfuls of roe out of the females, brilliant pearly orange treasure heaped on the rock in a steaming pile. I tasted one, a salted burst, and the musky flavor courted my mouth for hours.",

Far along through the groves echoes the ancient song of the southern peasant, older than the trees, older than the soil, older than poor old Pompeii lying off there in the eternal ashes of her gorgeous sins. And ever the sapphire sea kisses the feet of the cliffs as though wooing the rocks to come down, and plunge in, and taste how good a thing it is to be cool and wet all over.",

If my navigation faltered one step, I could end up in the same position as many other sailors had already found themselves: shipless, homeless and wet. The problem with skirting the obstacle course was that it added 200 miles onto the trip and there was a plane to catch. I decided to sail the shortest route, directly through the Tuamotus Archipelago to Tahiti, behind Thea and her SatNav.",

He punctuates every sentence with three or four gestures—his body totally participates in every word he speaks. He practically stands on his head looking down the hole. “Molta acqua.” He points in both directions. We thought the well opened only in one, but because he is dangling upside down, he sees that the natural declivity of the rock extends in the opposite direction also. “O.K., yes!” These are his only English words, always uttered with arms wide apart, embracing an idea. He wants to install a new hand pump for garden use. We already have seen bright green pumps in the hardware store out in the Val di Chiana farm country. We buy one the next day, uncork the pipe, and place the pump right on the old hooks. Giuseppe teaches us to prime the pump by pouring water into it while pumping the handle rhythmically. Here’s a motion long lost to my gene pool, but the creaky-smooth movement feels natural. After a few dry gulps, icy fresh water spills out into the bucket. We do have the presence of mind not to drink untested water. Instead, we open a bottle of wine on the terrace. Giuseppe wants to know about Miami and Las Vegas. We’re looking out over the jungle growth on the hills. Giuseppe thinks the palm trees are what we really need to tend to. How will we ever trim them? They’re taller than any ladder. After two glasses, Giuseppe shimmies up to the top of the taller one. He has the biggest grin I’ve ever seen. The tree leans and he slides down fast, too fast, lands in a heap on the ground. Ed quickly opens another bottle.",

Not to be alone was the urgent thing; and Ursula, who had been forty-eight hours alone in London, at once exacted from her friend a promise that they should spend the rest of the day together. But once the bargain struck her mind turned again to her own affairs, and she poured out her confidences to Susy over a succession of dishes that manifested the head-waiter's understanding of the case.",

Nearly everybody you meet can tell you some unnerving story about visitors coming to an unhappy end. Before I even came to Kenya I was told three different versions of a story about a German tourist who was either walking on a beach, sitting at an outdoor café or in a car at a traffic light with his arm out the window when someone lopped the arm off with a machete and ran off with the attached Rolex. The story is untrue, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is that people believe it.",

But it was to be in chambers this time and what Judge Dukinfield called his chambers wouldn’t a helt us. So all we done this time was just to happen to be somewhere about the Square, in the store doors or jest looking by chance and accident out of the upstairs doctors’ and suches’ windows while old man Job, that had been Judge Dukinfield’s janitor for longer than anybody in Jefferson, including Job and Judge Dukinfield too, knowed, in a old cast-off tailcoat of Judge Dukinfield’s that he wore on Sundays, bustled in and out of the little brick house back of the courthouse that Judge Dukinfield called his chambers, sweeping and dusting it until it suited him enough to let folks in it.",

I mean the Long Island horse farm that Miss Melisandre Harriss Backus that was used to bring the two children (they were grown now; Gavin was marrying not step-children but in-laws) back home to now and then from Europe until the Germans began to blow up Americans in actual sight of the Irish coast. So after that it had to be South America, this last time bringing the Argentine steeple-chasing cavalry officer that that maniac boy of the two Harriss children (I dont mean that both Aunt Melisandre’s children were maniacs but that only one of them was a boy) believed was trying to marry the money his mother was still trustee of instead of just his sister who just had an allowance like him. So he (the maniac of course) set out to murder the Argentine steeple-chaser with that wild stallion of Rafe McCallum’s that he (the maniac) bought or tricked or anyway got inside that stall where the innocent Argentine would have walked up in the dark and opened the door on what he (the innocent Argentine) thought was going to be not only a gentle horse but a partly blind one too. Except that Gavin read his tea-leaves or used his second sight or divining rod or whatever it was he did in cases like this, and got hold of Rafe in time to reach the stall door first and stop him.",

What a piece of perfection it is, created in 1931 by a forgotten hero named Harry Beck, an out-of-work draftsman who realized that when you are underground it doesn’t actually matter where you are. Beck saw—and what an intuitive stroke this was—that as long as the stations were presented in their right sequence with their interchanges clearly delineated, he could freely distort scale, indeed abandon it altogether. He gave his map the orderly precision of an electrical wiring system, and in so doing created an entirely new, imaginary London that has very little to do with the disorderly geography of the city above.",

Sometimes I wonder if the Raffles Gift Shop is in place only to serve up golf towels and stuffed animals to my neighbours around Kyoto. Leslie also remembers how, at war’s end, “Raffles became a hive of activity, as British soldiers released from prison came there and prepared to go back to Britain”.",

Three of them, a Belgian lieutenant and two non-commissioned officers, advanced hurriedly and stopped the car.

Her hair oscillated across her face in black scythes.\n‘Oh, look at my daughter!’ Clara arrived in the doorway with a colander of rice and charred chicken. ‘Isn’t she wonderful? She’s such a daughter to me!’\nYulia stopped and dumped herself on a bed. Sasha was showing Igor his Chinese digital watch, which played a tinny march.\n‘I love dancing too.’ Clara gazed at me. ‘But do I look very bad?’ Her mouth opened on vanished teeth. She did look rather bad. But she went out and returned in a mask of rouge and lipstick, and plucked me from my stool. We began to waltz. My squeaky boots and her clashing buckles made a ghastly duet over the scuffed floor. She was solid, but light on her feet, her face suffused by the pleasure of it, while Yulia watched her with stormy eyes. Her cassette went on playing all the current Russian favourites–‘My Love’, ‘I’m Guilty’–and Clara’s words scattered and drowned under the din. ‘He’s divorced, you understand…Aleksei…suddenly…to reunite with his wife…. I don’t know…he loves me…. He wants to go to Israel….’\nBy the time we assembled round the chicken it was cold. And now it was Igor who rebelled. We had waited too long for Aleksei, he said, and Aleksei hadn’t come. So he refused to eat. Perhaps the photographs had resurrected some distress in him, I could not tell. ‘Aleksei just does what he likes,’ he said, and turned his back.\nBut Clara folded her hands before the chicken and kasha. ‘And now Yulia will say the prayer.’\n‘If you want it, you say it!’ Yulia shouted. ‘Stop getting me to do things!’\nSo Clara began stoically: ‘Lord, we thank you…’",
