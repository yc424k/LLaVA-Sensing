Hewet began to fill in words where Hirst had left spaces, but he soon ceased; his pencil rolled on deck. Gradually they approached nearer and nearer to the bank on the right-hand side, so that the light which covered them became definitely green, falling through a shade of green leaves, and Mrs Flushing set aside her sketch and stared ahead of her in silence. Hirst woke up; they were then called to luncheon, and while they ate it, the steamer came to a standstill a little way out from the bank. The boat which was towed behind them was brought to the side, and the ladies were helped into it.",

The slant steepened under the horse and even carrying double he essayed to run at it as was his habit at any slope, gathering and surging out until he checked him sharply back and even then he had to hold him hard-wristed in a strong lurching uneven walk until the first level of the plateau flattened and even as Aleck Sander said ‘Here’ again Miss Habersham stood out of the obscurity at the roadside carrying the pick and shovel.

If it were not for the water being too cold to swim in, they could be described as Carribbeanesque. The boat to St Kilda for the day has been cancelled because of the howling wind. As luck would have it, the day I went was the first and last day for another week. I am so grateful. I am not grateful to be blown off my bike, which is what is happening on a regular basis on this ride north. It’s hard to pay attention to the landscape. When I do, it is lovely farmland with fields, fences, and some cropping. This would be the farmland the crofters were kicked off and sent over to the rocky east side to become fishermen.",

A mirage of auspiciously-named Astakos, our journey’s end, began to dance in our brains like the thought of Mecca among pilgrims crossing the Empty Quarter. We began to describe to each other the cool anticipated town: the tables along the lighted waterfront, the jolly priest, the benign mayor, the schoolmaster versed in antiquarian lore, the friendly taverna-keeper emerging from a promising vista of barrels with a lobster clicking and snapping in either hand. . . . There were welcoming burghers and perhaps the twang of guitars and nimble fishermen treading out the Butchers’ Dance. . . . But the sunset guided us into a different kind of town. We swerved to avoid a dead dog which must have lain there for days and a cloud of flies swallowed us up. New houses of scorching concrete were already falling into ruin; others had been abandoned, half built. Huge cubes of cement littered the shore, destined to be assembled one day into a mole; they now sealed the sea from sight as though it were a drain. Surlier than a turnkey, a whiskered slattern showed us the dark chambers into which the melancholy little hotel was subdivided and we began to understand how wide of the mark our imaginary goal had been.",

Well, then, look to it; because father has been walking about with a loaded gun at night.”\n\n“It is not good for him. You must tell him not to, Linda. He will not listen to me.”",

And the specter of commercialism shadowed every visitor from his first step to his last: one might debate the issue or demean it, but one could not ignore it. Sightseers were inclined not to say that Bali was beautiful or terrible, only that it had been raped or was still intact. “ ‘Isn’t Bali spoiled?’ is invariably the question that greets the returned traveler… meaning, is the island overrun by tourists?” wrote Miguel Covarrubias. He had written that in 1937. “This nation of artists is faced with a Western invasion, and I cannot stand idly by and watch its destruction,” wrote André Roosevelt, in his introduction to a book on Bali, entitled (what else?) The Last Paradise. He had written that in 1930.",

Stories of campers who go for a stroll along sunny heights in shorts and sneakers only to find themselves, three or fours hours later, stumbling to unhappy deaths in freezing fog are the stuff of every campfire, but they are also true. It happened to us when we were a few hundred feet shy of the summit of Little Haystack Mountain. The sunshine abruptly vanished, and from out of nowhere a swirling mist rolled into the trees. With it came a sudden fall in temperature, as if we had stepped into a cold store. Within minutes the forest was settled in a great foggy stillness, chill and damp. Timberline in the White Mountains occurs as low as 4,800 feet, about half the height in most other ranges, because the weather is so much more severe, and I began to see why. As we emerged from a zone of krummholz, the stunted trees that mark the last gasp of forest at treeline, and stepped on to the barren roof of Little Haystack, we were met by a stiff, sudden wind—the kind that would snatch a hat from your head and fling it a hundred yards before you could raise a hand—which the mountain had deflected over us on the sheltered western slopes but which here was flying unopposed across the open summit. We stopped in the lee of some boulders to put on waterproofs, for the extra warmth as much anything, for I was already quite damp from the sweat of effort and the moist air—a clearly foolish state to be in with the temperature falling and the wind whisking away any body heat. I opened my pack, rooted through the contents, and then looked up with that confounded expression that comes with the discovery of a reversal. I didn’t have my waterproofs. I rooted again, but there was hardly anything in the pack—a map, a light sweater, a water bottle, and a packed lunch. I thought for a moment and with a small inward sigh remembered pulling the waterproofs out some days before and spreading them out in the basement to air. I hadn’t remembered to put them back.",

It is a ship with all its crew aboard. The timbers strain to hold the dead and the living, the ploughmen, the carpenters, the fox-hunting gentlemen and the farmers smelling of mud and brandy. Their tongues join together in syllabling the sharp-cut words, which for ever slice asunder time and the broad-backed moors. Plaint and belief and elegy, despair and triumph, but for the most part good sense and jolly indifference, go trampling out of the windows any time these five hundred years.",

The torsos of SS Agapios and Daniel the Stylites projected from boxes built on Corinthian capitals, and the beard of a naked hermit aproned in pale green leaves fell below his knees in a swaying white stalactite like melted sealing wax. The nakedness of the more fortunate Makarios, identically bearded, was covered with thick smooth hair growing all over him in a suit of silver fox. Only his hands and feet emerged and his knees, which had worn holes in the thick pelt by constant kneeling. The walls were devoted to wild scenes of martyrdom—inverted crucifixions, flayings, impalements, draggings by wild horses, tearings apart by bent saplings, brandings, mutilations and, above all, beheadings. Phalanxes of splendidly clad figures knelt or lay prostrate with blood gushing from their headless trunks while their heads, still haloed, rolled away over the sad plain.",

The glasses and bottles, their high lights exploding, rang like a battery of little bells when the bartender touched them together. He forgot that his heart was a bomb to remember an incident of his childhood. One winter evening, he had been waiting with his little sister for their father to come home from church. She was eight years old then, and he was twelve. Made sad by the pause between playing and eating, he had gone to the piano and had begun a piece by Mozart. It was the first time he had ever voluntarily gone to the piano. His sister left her picture book to dance to his music. She had never danced before. She danced gravely and carefully, a simple dance yet formal...As Miss Lonelyhearts stood at the bar, swaying slightly to the remembered music, he thought of children dancing. Square replacing oblong and being replaced by circle. Every child, everywhere; in the whole world there was not one child who was not gravely, sweetly dancing.",

    "target_paragraph": "Reading the history of Hong Kong, I sometimes get the feeling that the colony was ceded to Britain rather as a toy might be handed over to a recalcitrant child, merely to keep him quiet. Certainly for long periods the Chinese simply let things lie, without it seems much worrying about the status of Hong Kong. Often they were physically incapable of doing anything else, but at other times they seem to have exercised indifference as a matter of policy. When they did interfere in the affairs of the colony, they generally did so obliquely, but not always ineffectively. It happened first in the 1860s, with the so-called Blockade of Hong Kong. This was mounted because the Chinese resented the vast amount of contraband conveyed into China from the colony – as the British Minister in Beijing admitted at the time, Hong Kong had become ‘little more than an immense smuggling depot’.",

He shuffled over to Kataktovik and shook him enthusiastically in congratulations. The second stage of their odyssey from Wrangel Island was over. The first stage had been the trip from Icy Spit to Siberia. The next stage would be getting across the Bering Strait to Alaska, but he’d worry about that tomorrow. Bartlett pulled off his snow goggles and squinted as he smiled, the creases near his eyes deep and dark as leads in the ice. It was April 24, and they’d been trekking and sledding and marching for thirty-nine days, traveling over seven hundred miles, nearly all of it on foot.",

Below, workers in hoods, carrying scythes—like refugees from some biblical tale—were marching towards the fields, and schoolchildren too, in their traditional gray-and-purple jerkins. Around the golden stupa at the edge of town there was already a loud muttering of monks, and old women in turquoise beads and plaits circling around, counting their rosaries as they walked, and candles fluttering in musty antechambers.

In the sunshine Kansas seemed an altogether more agreeable place, which surprised me a little. I had always thought one of the worst things anyone could say to you was, ‘We’re transferring you to Kansas, son.’ Kansas calls itself ‘the Wheat State’. That kind of says it all, don’t you think? It really makes you want to cancel that Barbados trip, doesn’t it? But in fact Kansas was OK. The towns I went through all looked trim and prosperous and quintessentially American. But then Kansas is the most quintessential of American states. It is, after all, where Superman and Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz grew up, and all the towns I went through had a cosy, leafy, timeless air to them. They looked like the sort of places where you could still have your groceries delivered by a boy on a bike and people would still say things like ‘By golly’ and ‘Gee willickers’. At Great Bend, I stopped on the square beside the Barton County Courthouse and had a look around. It was like passing through a time warp. The place appeared not to have changed a fraction since 1965. The Crest Movie Theater was still in business. Nearby stood the Great Bend Daily Tribune and the Brass Buckle Clothing Store, with a big sign on it that said FOR GUYS AND GALS. Gee willickers. A man and his wife passed me on the sidewalk and said good morning like old friends. The man even tipped his hat. From a passing car came the sound of the Everly Brothers. This was almost too eerie. I half expected Rod Serling to step out from behind a tree and say, ‘Bill Bryson doesn’t know it, but he’s just driven into a community that doesn’t exist in time or space. He’s just embarked on a one-way trip into . . . The Twilight Zone.’",

On one side the red, white, and blue Cuban flag hung straight and tall. Beside it, the red and black banner of Fidel’s 26th of July movement sagged limply after one of the ropes holding it up gave way and no one bothered to fix it. It was a graphic sign that even with a new president, Guanabacoa wasn’t in much of a mood for celebrating. The cutting machines and stamping presses of the aluminum factory had been silent for months since Cuba had run out of money to import aluminum. Uncertainty about Díaz-Canel, shortages of everything from potatoes to ibuprofen, and an exceptionally warm late July kept the streets mostly empty even on July 26, the day that marked the beginning of Fidel’s revolution. Raúl was in faraway Santiago making an angry speech, but he could have gone to the moon for all that María del Carmen cared. She was busy preparing for one of the biggest days in her year, and it had nothing to do with the revolution. It was the graduation ceremony for the Spanish dance classes given by her good friend Tamara Rodríguez, with whom she’d shared a passion for dance since they were as young as the girls she was teaching.",

He stared into the fire for a time, rubbing his hands slowly on his knees, and for an instant he saw the recent months of his life coldly in all their headlong and heedless wastefulness; saw its entirety like the swift unrolling of a film, culminating in that which he had been warned against and that any fool might have foreseen. Well, damn it, suppose it had: was he to blame? had he insisted that his grandfather ride with him? had he given the old fellow a bum heart? And then, coldly: You were afraid to go home. You made a nigger sneak your horse out to you. You, who deliberately do things your judgment tells you may not be successful, even possible, are afraid to face the consequences of your own acts. Then again something bitter and deep and sleepless in him blazed out in vindication and justification and accusation; what, he knew not, blazing out at what, Whom, he did not know: You did it! You caused it all: you killed Johnny.",

This was done expertly and quickly with a minimum expenditure of energy. I think deft is the word. He would drag old trees into a semicircle or three sides of a rectangle, clear a space of prickles for us to sleep in, and build the warming fire. No matter how many blankets I gave him, he never put these over him, but underneath. And after our meal and our talk, he would make sure I was comfortable, virtually tucking me into my swag, then he would curl up, head on his hands and fall asleep. All through the night, he would wake up, check on me and restoke the fire. He accepted the junky food I had with me but would have loved, I know, a kangaroo half-cooked in the coals. This is a delicious meat, and it is cooked by first singeing the hair and rubbing it off, then burying it in a mixture of sand and coals and leaving it for an hour. The insides are still bloody and red, but the meat and the offal sweet and juicy. There are strict rules governing the killing and cooking of kangaroo, in fact of all desert foods. Stories abounded of people who broke the law, by not killing correctly, and suffered terrible accidents because of it.",

These rock-cut caverns with their flat limestone divans were feasting rooms where bereaved families would meet to toast the memory of dead relatives; though the catacombs were long forgotten, even to legend, the broken fragments of the pots and plates left over from these feasts have given the area its modern Arabic name, Kom el Shogafa, the Mound of Shards.",

She had fewer illusions about human nature than anyone else I knew. I later realized I was wrong about the war’s impact on her thinking. She just had uncommonly good sense and a deep, easily embarrassed modesty. What was important to her was making pictures—etchings, in particular. The copperplate process she used was elaborate and outrageously labor-intensive, almost medieval, and her classmates at the art institute seemed to be in awe of her draftsmanship, her technical knowledge, her obsessiveness, her eye. I certainly was. She often worked all night. She was tall, long-waisted, pale. She had a Pre-Raphaelite stillness to her, as if she had stepped out of a Burne-Jones painting into scruffy, postpunk San Francisco. With people she liked, she could be jolly, even bawdy, tossing a wicked impasto of British and African street slang. She knew, and found a surprising number of occasions to use, a Gujarati expression for masturbation. Muthiya maar!",

When he came, he helped get all the lines together and we did some last-minute repairs to the engine. At bedtime, I arranged his bedding up in the forepeak, we awkwardly said goodnight and I curled up in my own bunk. After a couple of hours of mutual tossing and turning, I heard Luc get up and quietly come over to my bed. Soundlessly, he caressed my head. I froze and pretended I was asleep. He didn’t try to awaken me, but just knelt there and then crept back to his bed.",

The time of our departure was not fixed, and no one knew when the train would arrive.\nThe railroad had just been repaired. In places where there had once been bridges we plunged into arroyos and snorted up the farther bank on a rickety new-laid track that bent and cracked under us. All day long the roadside was lined with immense distorted steel rails, torn up with a chain and a backing engine by the thorough Orozco last year.

It was needed to supplement the pemmican rations for the dogs, but there was an added benefit for the men. “Without fresh meat,” he logged in his journal, “there was always the danger of scurvy, that blight of so many earlier Arctic explorers.”* He sent the Eskimos out hunting for seals and urged any of the crewmen, scientists, and officers not engaged in specific duties to participate as well, since the expedition would need all the meat they could procure. Seals would be the most prized, as they could be used for food, fuel, clothing, and to repair the bottoms of damaged umiaks and kayaks once the skins were stretched and dried. There were other animals in the vicinity as well: polar bear tracks had been spotted in fresh snow near the ship, and a scattering of ducks migrating south were using the open water at the edges of the ice island and in some of the freshwater pools on the surface. Stefansson had them well supplied with rifles for the seals, bears, and foxes, and shotguns or “fowling pieces” for the birds.",

The deep snow on the pass had got into my boots so I quickly unpacked the stove, bared my agonisingly cold feet and sat on the food-sack to thaw my toes and dry my saturated socks. Meanwhile Rachel was crouching in a corner beside a candle as completely absorbed in William the Fourth as though she were sitting by the fire in her own home. The adaptability of the very young never ceases to astonish me. Often these days I have occasion to bless her abnormally small appetite. After riding eighteen rough miles through crisp mountain air most children would not unreasonably demand food, but she looks first for printed matter.",

During our climb, we confronted both the physical challenges of the adventure and our own human vulnerabilities. The scale of the emptiness was at times almost too much to absorb and the sense of isolation, overwhelming. I felt my emotions welling up to the surface and despite being aware of the feelings of happiness I was experiencing, tears would slowly course down my cheeks sometimes, while I was climbing, because I was so deeply touched by the enormity and beauty of this experience.",

Before this, however, a ceremony is held in Pura Pererepan called a marerauhang — rauh means \"come,\" and the name of the ceremony refers to the fact that the gods are invited to come and take possession of one of those present. The pemangkus do this by asking questions of a person who goes into trance and is possessed by a god. This is by no means a ceremony unique to Jimbaran, or to Dewa Ayu, or to barongs.
