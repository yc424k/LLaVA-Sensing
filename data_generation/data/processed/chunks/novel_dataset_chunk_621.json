But in Cordova, it fit. People leaned. They said, “Good enough for government work” and “We get paid by the hour” and “Job security.” Not that all the folks we worked with were lazy. Many of them worked hard, had solid skills and good spirits. Our foreman Steve busted ass when he joined us in the field, and seemed unaffected by the damp cold that made me whine. But crew chemistry is inexplicable; something was missing. That underlying adrenaline, the push that made you work till you couldn’t stand up, and the satisfaction that went with that kind of effort. I couldn’t find it. Sometimes, trying to infuse the morning, the day, with that kind of vigor, it felt like swimming upstream.",

Buster’s truck, like most, had small openings about the size of an envelope that didn’t even open all the way. They just provided an air vent, if opened while going down the road.",

About one-third of the dwellings are round thatched huts – the most skilful thatching I’ve seen since Cameroon – the rest are tiny oblong shacks, their tin roofs stone-anchored. Many are brightly painted – duck-egg green the favourite shade, but also lemon, pale pink, buff, sky blue. Some external walls are decorated with elaborate traditional designs in red, black, brown, white. Some minuscule windows wear incongruous suburban lace curtains tied back with pretty bows. Every few miles a tiny ‘café’ or huxter shop offers basic sustenance. The local litter consists almost entirely of plastic bags fluttering in the breeze on rusty wire fencing, itself a form of litter left over from the days when this land was white-owned.",

I say that you do not care for those that serve you. Look at me! After all these years, suddenly, here I find myself like one of these curs that bark outside the walls—without a kennel or a dry bone for my teeth. Caramba!” But he relented with a contemptuous fairness. “Of course,” he went on, quietly, “I do not suppose that you would hasten to give me up to Sotillo, for example. It is not that. It is that I am nothing! Suddenly—” He swung his arm downwards. “Nothing to anyone,” he repeated.",

The subway began to operate, rumbling under the square’s emptiness, but the few dark-clad passengers who emerged seemed to dissipate and become microscopic as soon as they did. Two or three widely separated women in city-employee garb were picking up trash, sweeping snow from the subway entrance steps, and scraping at scabs of ice with shovels. In the rotary zone around the square where occasional cars and buses passed, men in orange jumpsuits near vehicles with blinking lights were scraping also. Russia does not use salt on its roads. Another ambient sound came from the square’s billboards, which changed their advertising every few minutes with a rustling of metal as the vertical panels turned. At the tops of buildings, a few international commercial logos in neon lights—NOKIA, SAMSUNG, DOUBLETREE HOTELS—added their usual cold comfort.",

The house – which they named Torrans – was set amid pine forestry above the River Avon, which has its source under the Cairngorms themselves. Until his last few years, when failing sight and lameness kept him from the mountains, he walked the paths that led around his home and through the mountains. On one wall of the house hung a large 1:50,000 map of the massif on which the footpaths were marked in Ordnance Survey candy-pink, whose lines we would trace with our fingertips while planning expeditions.* It was the influence of my grandfather and my parents which had drawn me to mountains as a child; it was my grandfather who had helped high country and wild places to cast their strong spells over me.",

It was while walking this path daily that Darwin did much of his thinking, and he came to refer to it as the ‘Sandwalk’ or ‘the thinking path’. Sometimes he would pile a series of flints in a rough cairn at the start of the path, and knock one away with his walking stick after completing each circuit. He came to be able to anticipate, Finlay explained, a ‘three-flint problem’ or a ‘four-flint problem’, reliably quantifying the time it would take to solve an intellectual puzzle in terms of distance walked.",

He was a black man and he was lying among a crowd of legs in what appeared to me at the time to be a pool of oil, but which was of course the blood that was draining out of the hole in his head. My parents hustled us past and told us not to look, but we did, of course. Things like that didn’t happen in Des Moines, so we gaped extensively. I had only ever seen murders on TV on programmes like Gunsmoke and Dragnet. I thought it was something they did just to keep the story moving. It had never occurred to me that shooting someone was an option available in the real world. It seemed such a strange thing to do, to stop someone’s life just because you found him in some way disagreeable. I imagined my fourth grade teacher, Miss Bietlebaum, who had hair on her upper lip and evil in her heart, lying on the floor beside her desk, stilled forever, while I stood over her with a smoking gun in my hand. It was an interesting concept. It made you think.",

First though, I decided to head south by ferry to the seaside town of Vung Tau, later to become tabloid-infamous as the beast's lair of shamed seventies rocker Gary Glitter. The town and surrounding beaches were pleasant enough, but things were quiet midweek, so on my last day in town I rented a scooter and headed north up the coast. I set off early and made good progress on winding roads which snaked along the shoreline, with lush jungle to my left and the crashing waves of the South China sea to my right. There was little traffic and it was a pleasure to ride the quiet lanes, away from the constant horns and sweaty clamour of downtown Saigon. Occasionally I passed through a village where I would attract a tail of sprinting, squealing children playing 'catch the farang,' an ever-popular game in areas where foreign faces are a rarity.",

The tarn ice was the milky grey-white colour of cataracts, and rough and dented in texture. I padded out to its centre, and jumped gently a couple of times. It did not creak. I wondered where the fish were. The tarn was, if not a good place to wait out the storm, at least the best on offer. It was flat, and the two crags gave some shelter from the wind. My sleeping-bag and bivouac bag would keep me warm enough. And I liked the thought of sleeping there on the ice: it would be like falling asleep on a silver shield or a lens. I hoped that when I woke, the weather would have cleared enough for some night-walking.",

Please leave me here”). As we walked past the hotel gift shop, Joe let out a cry, and pointed to a picture of Deng Xiaoping on the cover of a glossy magazine: we went in to take a closer look, and there, to my companions’ delight and my amazement, was a Time cover story on China that I had written before leaving New York three months earlier. Impressed by this, my friends led me up to a lobby filled with huge armchairs, and as we munched on a selection of French pastries, they asked me to describe my impressions of a homeland that was still a little strange to them. In response, I rhapsodized at length about the sunlit lamaseries of Tibet, talked a little about the capital and then, by way of amusing parenthesis, mentioned some of the quirks of the fabled Black Coffee. At that instant, I happened to look across at Joe, my all-knowing guide to every deal in China. He was looking absolutely stunned. I stopped what I was saying. For many moments, he could not speak. Finally, he went on shakily: You mean that there were prostitutes there? I think so, I said; indeed, a colleague of mine had once been approached by a male prostitute on the streets of Shanghai. That left Joe quite devastated.",

The reputed victim, Bernard Neimeyer, claimed that on the evening of July 4 he had been walking near the Ansonia Hotel when a man accompanied by two women accused him of making an inappropriate remark and punched him hard in the face. Neimeyer said he didn’t recognize his assailant, but was told by onlookers that it was Babe Ruth. Ruth, in his defense, said that he had been having dinner with friends at the time, and produced two witnesses in corroboration. In court, Neimeyer seemed to be a little crazy. The Times reported that he frequently “rose excitedly to his feet, waving a book of notes which he added to from time to time as the hearing proceeded. He was often cautioned by the clerk of the court not to talk so loudly.” The judge dismissed the case to general applause. Ruth signed a bunch of autographs, then went to the ballpark and hit a home run, his 53rd.",

There was even every likelihood that he would beat Ruth’s home run record of 59. In the last 21 games?which is to say, since about the day that Lindbergh had failed to turn up at Yankee Stadium?Ruth had hit 5 home runs, a more or less normal pace for him. Gehrig in the same period had hit 14, including 3 in one game at Fenway Park in Boston?something that no one had ever done before. Gehrig’s pace in those 21 games would, if sustained, produce over 100 home runs in a full season.",

Enthusiasm ran high. These passages, so famous in England, were doubly charged with meaning for them, and their emotion was infectious. They seemed astonished – touched, too – that their tribal poetry enjoyed such glory and affection in the outside world; utterly cut off, I think they had no inkling of this. A feeling of great warmth and delight had sprung up and the Rabbi kept polishing his glasses, not for use, but out of enjoyment and nervous energy, and his brother surveyed us with benevolent amusement. It got dark while we sat at the table, and when he took off the glass chimney to light the paraffin lamp, three pairs of spectacles flashed. If it had been Friday night, the Rabbi said, they would have asked me to light it; he explained about the shabbas goy. This was the Sabbath-gentile whom well-off Jews – ‘not like us’ – employed in their houses to light fires and lamps and tie and untie knots or perform the many tasks the Law forbids on the Seventh Day. I said I was sorry it was only Thursday (the Sabbath begins at sunset on Friday) as I could have made myself useful for a change. We said goodnight with laughter.",

Strange how easily even the greatest men were moved by exteriors. She had seen with her own eyes Tennyson turn away from everybody—turn, positively, his back on a crowd of eminent people assembled to do him honour, and withdraw to the window with a young person nobody had ever heard of, who had been brought there by accident and whose one and only merit—if it be a merit, that which is conferred by chance—was beauty. Beauty! All over before you can turn round. An affair, one might almost say, of minutes. Well, while it lasted it did seem able to do what it liked with men. Even husbands were not immune. There had been passages in the life of Mr. Fisher . . .",

It was cold. As we passed\nCabrera’s door a hot, smoky, alcoholic breath smote us. Beyond that you crossed on stepping-stones the stream where the women wash their clothes. Climbing the other bank we saw the brilliant windows of Don\nPriciliano’s house, and heard the far strains of Valle Allegre’s orchestra.",

The walls were an immaculate new gray, with a reproduction of a Corot and two spidery dry-points in narrow frames, and it contained a new rug in warm buff tones and a bare table and four chairs in fumed oak—all impersonal and clean and inexpensive, but revealing at a glance the proprietor’s soul; a soul hampered now by material strictures, but destined and determined to someday function amid Persian rugs and mahogany or teak, and a single irreproachable print on the chaste walls.

The gallery stretched far away to a point where the light almost failed. It was as a tunnel bored deep into the past.* As her eyes peered down it, she could see people laughing and talking; the great men she had known; Dryden, Swift, and Pope; and statesmen in colloquy; and lovers dallying in the window-seats; and people eating and drinking at the long tables; and the wood smoke curling round their heads and making them sneeze and cough. Still further down, she saw sets of splendid dancers formed for the quadrille. A fluty, frail, but nevertheless stately music began to play. An organ boomed. A coffin was borne into the chapel. A marriage procession came out of it. Armed men with helmets left for the wars. They brought banners back from Flodden and Poitiers* and stuck them on the wall. The long gallery filled itself thus, and still peering further, she thought she could make out at the very end, beyond the Elizabethans and the Tudors, some one older, further, darker, a cowled figure, monastic, severe, a monk, who went with his hands clasped, and a book in them, murmuring——",

    "target_paragraph": "Cary had been involved in the textile industry for a quarter century and knew all about fabrics. Working with the designers at Puntex, she had acquired a sophisticated flair for fashion that she had honed on her trips abroad. She had overseen the production of hundreds of thousands of shirts, millions of pairs of socks and underwear, but she had never sewn together a single blouse on her own. She stared at Zenaida’s Union Special sewing machine. To operate it, she had to pump the pedal; that much she knew. And she understood the theory behind assembling individual elements of fabric and thread, zippers and buttons, into a finished piece someone might be willing to buy. If she could oversee the production of aluminum jugs and fancy cigar tubes, if she could deliver two hundred thousand printed T-shirts in a few weeks, if she could make factories all over Cuba run smoothly and safely, surely she could operate an old sewing machine, couldn’t she?",

He stared at her continuously, repeatedly asking if she spoke English, to which she shook her head and said “la,” meaning no. Michelle sensed that he could tell she was not Saudi, although she was fully covered head to foot. Ah, but what about the feet, she wondered? Perhaps the flip-flops she was wearing were a clue to her true identity. Saudis are rarely seen wearing flip-flops while covered. Or did he in fact somehow intuit her Western energy emanating from the outfit? Undaunted, this man stared at her all the way to Dhahran, and upon exiting the bus, he gave her a note with his telephone number.",
