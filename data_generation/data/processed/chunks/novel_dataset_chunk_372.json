You could see that something had hit him. If he goes on looking at the glass door of the shelves, above the old desk, where he keeps his pistol in the drawer, I will have to push his head round, I can’t have him go on looking at one thing like that. If he would close his eyes, it would be better, it would even be better if he fell down but we would not be able to get him up; do dead men sit in chairs?",

(The normal procedure on Japanese commercial television, where every program, including the news, corresponds in length to the amount of cash an advertiser has paid, is to cut games off when the sponsor changes – usually around the middle of the eighth inning with the score tied, two runners on base, two outs, and a full count.) But tonight the tensed nation was rewarded for its vigil. In the bottom of the third inning of a game against the Yakult Swallows, a visibly relieved Oh cracked the run that cracked the record.",

Most of the adults are employed in the Self-Help Handicraft Centre where they make – mainly for export to the West – carpets, coats, sweaters and boots in modified versions of the traditional Tibetan style. Both adults and children appear to be in reasonably good health, despite this relatively low altitude of 4,500 feet, and it does one good to see the families still united, instead of being split up as so often happens in India.",

Out comes the cheerful, cherry-red, new jack from the trunk. Bernard sets it up in front of Roxanne’s right rear tire. He starts pumping. The jack’s handle is flimsy and immediately bends. Roxanne rises centimeter by centimeter. Bernard glances up at me. It’s hot in the parking lot and beads of sweat are already dripping down his cheeks and neck. Finally, the jack has reached full extension, and it becomes clear that, regardless of the blithe promises on the packaging, this jack does not have the reach it’s supposed to have. Our lovely, lightweight jack is stretched to capacity, yet it barely creates enough clearance for Bernard to slide under the chassis on his back. There’s no room for him to lift his arms when under there, let alone wield any tools.",

He must have been tired and walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon. Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabouts, inquiring for a yellow car. On the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.",

Small, well-knit, fair, he sat stroking his slight blond moustache and looking at her with kindly, almost tender eyes; but he left it to his sister and the others to draw her out and fit her into the pattern.",

Mario could have won me over with his adventures alone, but he also had an aquiline nose, Che Guevara hair, disarmingly blue eyes, and hands that stayed warm even when it was cold outside (from milking so many cows as a kid, he said). Those hands were the first to ever undress me, to touch, stroke, palm, caress me. I used to imagine those beautiful hands slipping a ruby ring onto my finger at an altar someday.

From biscuit baking and pappadum making to pottery and leather tanning, visitors could observe the small-scale industries of an area whose annual turnover was approximately £410m. Eighty per cent of the profits after tax from the tour tickets went towards a community centre that provided schooling for Dharavi’s residents.

It was the birthplace of bingo, lettered rock (that is, a stick of candy with the resort’s name running through it; I don’t know how they do it), and the traditional seaside ride known as the helter-skelter. During the celebrated Wakes Weeks, when whole northern factory towns went on holiday together (they called Morecambe “Bradford-by-Sea”), up to a hundred thousand visitors at a time flocked to its boardinghouses and hotels. At its peak it had two main-line railway stations, eight music halls, eight cinemas, an aquarium, a fun fair, a menagerie, a revolving tower, a boating garden, a Summer Pavilion, a Winter Gardens, the largest swimming pool in Britain, and two piers. One of these, the Central Pier, was one of the most beautiful and elaborate in Britain, with fabulous towers and domed roofs—an Arabian palace afloat on Morecambe Bay.",

Neither was religious but they liked Safed because as residents you could hang out whichever way, just doing your own thing. Moshe added, ‘It’s changing, though – has been for a while. More of the Hairies, trying to bully everyone else. And someone has started a college for Arabs – we never had them around before. Why bother trying to teach them? Why they’ve never had a country?

He was twelve, and he was always working, ferrying pails of water from the well, peeling potatoes, sweeping, running errands – he worked until eleven or twelve at night. He was very shy, and tried to run away whenever I spoke to him. It turned out that True Light had taken him in when he was abandoned by his parents. He had a number of half-brothers and sisters, and one of the girls had just had a baby. She was ten. True Light told me all this as she sipped maté tea through a flat silver straw. Maté is a bitter infusion made from the leaves of a shrub tamped down in a wooden bowl like tobacco in a pipe. I had grown to like it. It always seemed as if the ceremonial and laborious tamping, sucking and water-replenishing were as much a part of its attractions as the refreshment of the beverage itself, like a Chilean version of the Japanese tea ceremony.",

When they operated on him she prepared him for the operating table, and they had a joke about friend or enema. He went under the anesthetic holding tight on to himself so that he would not blab about anything during the silly, talky time. After he got on crutches he used to take the temperature so Ag would not have to get up from the bed. There were only a few patients, and they all knew about it. They all liked Ag. As he walked back along the halls he thought of Ag in his bed.\nBefore he went back to the front they went into the Duomo and prayed. It was dim and quiet, and there were other people praying. They wanted to get married, but there was not enough time for the banns, and neither of them had birth certificates. They felt as though they were married, but they wanted everyone to knew about it, and to make it so they could not lose it.",

In one corner, on an upended packing-box, sat a water cooler of stained oxidized glass; in another corner leaned a clump of cane fishing poles warping slowly of their own weight, and on every horizontal surface rested a collection of objects not to be found outside of a second-hand store—old garments, bottles, a kerosene lamp, a wooden box of tins of axle grease, lacking one, a clock in the shape of a bland china morning-glory supported by four garlanded maidens who had suffered sundry astonishing anatomical mishaps, and here and there among their dusty indiscrimination various instruments pertaining to the occupant’s profession. It was one of these that Dr Peabody sought now, in the littered desk on which sat a single photograph in a wooden frame, and though Miss Jenny said again, “You, Loosh Peabody, you listen to me,” he continued to seek it with bland and unhurried equanimity.",

They received thousands of entries, each one naming a different city!”",

    "target_paragraph": "But in the beginning the obvious was overwhelming, and there was the knowledge that there was no ship to run back to, as there had been at Alexandria, Port Sudan, Djibouti, Karachi. It was new to me then that the obvious could be separated from the pleasant, from the areas of self-respect and self-love. Marine Drive, Malabar Hill, the lights of the city at night from Kamala Nehru Park, the Parsi Towers of Silence: these are what the tourist brochures put forward as Bombay, and these were the things we were taken to see on three successive days by three kind persons. They built up a dread of what was not shown, that other city where lived the hundreds of thousands who poured in a white stream in and out of Churchgate Station as though hurrying to and from an endless football match. This was the city that presently revealed itself, in the broad, choked and endless main roads of suburbs, a chaos of shops, tall tenements, decaying balconies, electric wires and advertisements, the film posters that seemed to derive from a cooler and more luscious world, cooler and more luscious than the film posters of England and America, promising a greater gaiety, an ampler breast and hip, a more fruitful womb. And the courtyards behind the main streets: the heat heightened, at night the sense of outdoors destroyed, the air holding on its stillness the odours of mingled filth, the windows not showing as oblongs of light but revealing lines, clothes, furniture, boxes and suggesting an occupation of more than floor space. On the roads northwards, the cool redbrick factories set in gardens: Middlesex it might have been, but not attached to these factories any semi-detached or terrace houses, but that shanty town, that rubbish dump. And, inevitably, the prostitutes, the ‘gay girls’ of the Indian newspapers. But where, in these warrens where three brothels might be in one building and not all the sandal-oil perfumes of Lucknow could hide the stench of gutters and latrines, was the gaiety? Lust, like compassion, was a refinement of hope. Before this one felt only the fragility of one’s own sexual impulses. One hesitated to probe, to imagine; one concentrated on one’s own revulsion. Men with clubs stood guard at the entrances. Protecting whom from what? In the dim, stinking corridors sat expressionless women, very old, very dirty, shrivelled almost to futility; and already one had the feeling that people were negligible: these were the sweepers, the servants of the gay girls of the Bombay poor, doubtless lucky because employed: a frightening glimpse of India’s ever receding degrees of degradation.",

The Intihuatana stone, carved out of solid granite attached to the Salcantay massif, connects Huayna Picchu to the main peak of Salcantay. Bingham’s Temple of the Three Windows looks due east toward the rising sun. The building that intrigued me most was the Torreon. The upper curved part seems to have been modeled on the Koricancha sun temple, the most sacred building in the city of Cusco. The cave below, with its psychedelic stonework and carved stone stepladder, faces the sunrise on the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year. One small east-facing window is positioned perfectly to observe the Pleiades cluster of stars, whose appearance heralded the turning of a new agricultural year. This was the same window that I’d been told cast a beam of light onto the carved rock within. (Reinhard had also heard of this phenomenon, but hadn’t witnessed it.) It occurred to me that making a return trip to Machu Picchu to see that solstice alignment?visible for only a few days in June?might be my one chance to see the sacred center theory in action.",

A dirt track continues past Feolin up the west coast of Jura for a way. Most of the west coast, though, is uninhabited and accessible only by foot.

The influence which that man, brought up in coast towns, acquired in a short time over the plainsmen of the Republic can be ascribed only to a genius for treachery of so effective a kind that it must have appeared to those violent men but little removed from a state of utter savagery, as the perfection of sagacity and virtue. The popular lore of all nations testifies that duplicity and cunning, together with bodily strength, were looked upon, even more than courage, as heroic virtues by primitive mankind. To overcome your adversary was the great affair of life. Courage was taken for granted. But the use of intelligence awakened wonder and respect. Stratagems, providing they did not fail, were honourable; the easy massacre of an unsuspecting enemy evoked no feelings but those of gladness, pride, and admiration. Not perhaps that primitive men were more faithless than their descendants of today, but that they went straighter to their aim, and were more artless in their recognition of success as the only standard of morality.",

A shout brought an agreeable soft-spoken young man to my side; he made friendly noises in Swahili while showing me into a cell. The door was half off its hinges and unlockable, the window’s wire mesh badly torn; the bed sagged like a hammock, neither food nor washing water was available. Then a clinking sound drew my attention to a shadowy corner of the patio where three men sat at a small table drinking, I hoped, beer. A quick nightcap was indicated in lieu of supper; I joined them and it became a multiple nightcap.",

After a two-hour wait it became clear that we had just missed it, and we decided to hitch. Our first lift – in the back of trailer with two fat Arabs and a pile of watermelons – took us only three miles, at a speed which never exceeded walking pace.

He was unwilling to let coldness grow up between himself and the Melburys for any trivial reason, and in the evening he went to their house. On drawing near the gate his attention was attracted by the sight of one of the bedrooms blinking into a state of illumination. In it stood Grace lighting several candles, her right hand elevating the taper, her left hand on her bosom, her face thoughtfully fixed on each wick as it kindled, as if she saw in every flame’s growth the rise of a life to maturity. He wondered what such unusual brilliancy could mean tonight. On getting in-doors he found her father and step-mother in a state of suppressed excitement which he could not comprehend.",

So today the promised sacrifice is made in a ceremony called megat sot, which refers to \"cutting\" an obligation. Cutting this tie involves seven pedandas — two are pedandas Buddha, five Siwa. By the time the chanting and praying begin, it is already dark. They dedicate a commemorative plaque, which announces the successful completion of the 1900 Eka Dasa Rudra. In a little pavilion at the top of the main stairs the governor and members of the Committee place offerings, coconut and white thread on the backs of their left hands. They are sprinkled with holy water. With a sudden toss, the offerings are thrown into the air and a large basket of offerings is torn open inside the pavilion. All present walk back to the Pura Panataran Agung across the debris of offerings.",

They even forgot his insignificant appearance in the virtuosity with which he ran and poised and swooped upon the cold inflectionless wire of his voice, so that at last, when with a sort of swooping glide he came to rest again beside the reading desk with one arm resting upon it at shoulder height and his monkey body as reft of all motion as a mummy or an emptied vessel, the congregation sighed as if it waked from a collective dream and moved a little in its seats.
