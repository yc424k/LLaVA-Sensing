Then he inserts the syringe into the first hole. I jerk as stinging iodine squirts into my flesh, staining my ragged skin orange. I watch, every muscle in my body shaking, because I cannot close my eyes. I bite down on my tongue so hard I taste blood. I feel dizzy, nauseous, for a moment I can’t see. Fire spreads up my arm. I lean my head back. It’s a mistake. This makes me feel worse. From a distance, I hear Faustino grunt and I try to speak, to tell him I’m alright, but I can’t make my mouth work. It’s only when I hear the clatter of the syringe being placed back on the table that I manage to sit back up, holding tightly to my shirt, ripped and stiff now with brown blood, as if this will keep me stable. Then Agustino reaches for his sutures kit.",

    "target_paragraph": "The high room, the bright light, the plentiful mirrors, the long sweep of lace curtains, the many faces—the girls seemed so much more numerous scattered here than they had when collected in the schoolroom—brought Miriam the sense of the misery of social occasions. She wondered whether the girls were nervous. She was glad that music lessons were no part of her remuneration. She thought of dreadful experiences of playing before people. The very first time, at home, when she had played a duet with Eve—Eve playing a little running melody in the treble—her own part a page of minims. The minims had swollen until she could not see whether they were lines or spaces, and her fingers had been so weak after the first unexpectedly loud note that she could hardly make any sound. Eve had said “louder” and her fingers had suddenly stiffened and she had worked them from her elbows like sticks at the end of her trembling wrists and hands. Eve had noticed her dreadful movements and resented being elbowed. She had heard nothing then but her hard loud minims till the end, and then as she stood dizzily up someone had said she had a nice firm touch, and she had pushed her angry way from the piano across the hearthrug. She should always remember the clear red-hot mass of the fire and the bottle of green Chartreuse warming on the blue and cream tiles. There were probably only two or three guests, but the room had seemed full of people, stupid people who had made her play. How angry she had been with Eve for noticing her discomfiture and with the forgotten guest for her silly remark. She knew she had simply poked the piano. Then there had been the annual school concert, all the girls almost unrecognisable with fear. She had learnt her pieces by heart for those occasions and played them through with trembling limbs and burning eyes—alternately thumping with stiff fingers and feeling her whole hand faint from the wrist on to the notes which fumbled and slurred into each other almost soundlessly until the thumping began again. At the musical evenings, organised by Eve as a winter set-off to the tennis-club, she had both played and sung, hoping each time afresh to be able to reproduce the effects which came so easily when she was alone or only with Eve. But she could not discover the secret of getting rid of her nervousness. Only twice had she succeeded—at the last school concert when she had been too miserable to be nervous and Mr. Strood had told her she did him credit and, once she had sung “Chanson de Florian” in a way that had astonished her own listening ear—the notes had laughed and thrilled out into the air and come back to her from the wall behind the piano.... The day before the tennis tournament.",

They were patterned in grey and black, so that it seemed briefly as though dozens of little maps were lifting off from the peat’s surface, and vanishing up into the darkness of the flue.",

At the top he paused, broad shouldered, narrow hipped and supple, looking at the large bed, like a white couch of state, with a profusion of snowy linen, amongst which the Padrona sat unpropped and bowed, her handsome, black-browed face bent over her chest.

Perfectly motionless in that pose, expressing physical anxiety and unrest, she turned her eyes alone towards Nostromo.",

Even in the eighteenth century British travellers to Paris were remarking on what lunatic drivers the French were, on ‘the astonishing speed with which the carriages and people moved through the streets … It was not an uncommon sight to see a child run over and probably killed.’ I quote from The Grand Tour by Christopher Hibbert, a book whose great virtue is in pointing out that the peoples of Europe have for at least 300 years been living up to their stereotypes. As long ago as the sixteenth century, travellers were describing the Italians as voluble, unreliable and hopelessly corrupt, the Germans as gluttonous, the Swiss as irritatingly officious and tidy, the French as, well, insufferably French.",

It is an odd sensation, when looking for lodgings, to go from door to door asking what the family religion is and receiving cold stares from the Hindus. The Tamangs here are very much poorer than the Chetris and are unmistakably the outcasts of the village; but equally unmistakably they are a far nicer group of people than their Hindu neighbours. I don’t resent being shunned by orthodox Hindus, who can’t reasonably be expected to fraternise with the likes of me, yet it is sad that Hinduism, despite the breadth of its basic philosophy, has in practice the effect of blighting many potentially valuable human contacts – whereas Tibetan Buddhism, however imperfectly understood by the masses, has the precisely opposite effect.",

The girl herself moved from one to another, pale, vigilant, radiant; Chris Fenno, in a distant corner, was settled with coffee-cup and cigarette at Lilla Maclew’s side; Mrs. Clephane found herself barricaded behind Hendrik Drover and one of the older Tresseltons.

Simi’s gentle, sweet and quiet brother sits on the floor with the pundit surrounded by trays of orange flowers and offerings of bananas, apples, dahl, rice, curd and pineapples. Sanskrit prayers fill the room and sandalwood and rice are applied to a huge garlanded photo of Simi’s “expired” dad. Simi is Bengali, so the women occasionally blow plastic conch shells and make a high-pitched ululation. Apparently all the married women are supposed to make the sound at certain moments but the younger ones are a bit too inhibited and don’t know quite when they’re meant to let rip. Simi’s mum and the grannies are in their element; screaming, berating and bossing everyone around one minute, and then collapsing into tearful laughter over chai the next.",

He got up and kicked at it. It moved back, but when he stooped and took hold of the legs and began to walk backward, the hound was beside him again. But it was intent on the body and as long as they were in motion, it did not howl. But when he stopped to get his breath, it began to howl again and again he braced himself and kicked at it and this time as he did so he discovered that he was actually seeing the animal and that dawn had come, the animal visible now, gaunt, thin, with a fresh bloody gash across its face, howling. Watching it, he stooped and groped until his hand found a stick. It was foul with slime but still fairly sound. When the hound raised its head to howl again, he struck. The dog whirled; he saw the long scar of the gunshot running from its shoulder to its flank as it sprang at him. This time the stick took it fairly between the eyes. He picked up the ankles, facing forward now, and tried to run.",

Women went about with uncovered heads and moved their limbs in a provocative and deliberately sensuous way. Young men grew effeminate and let their hair grow long. Indeed, complained the monk, some went so far as to decorate their boots. In such a climate even the bishops grew foppish. The Ecclesiastical History of Socrates talks of Bishop Sisinnios, who ‘was accustomed to indulge himself by wearing smart new garments, and by bathing twice a day in the public baths. When someone asked him why he, a bishop, bathed himself twice a day, he replied: “Because you do not give me time for a third.” ’",

I start to look for my house key, which I thought was in the zippered inside pocket of my bag. If I’ve lost it—what? Two friends and a neighbor have keys to my place. I imagine getting their answering machines, “I’m out of town until Friday…” We pass Victorian houses discreetly shuttered and curtained, porch lights shining on wooden banisters and pots of topiary. No one, not even a dog walker or someone running to the store for milk, is out. I feel a pang for the towns full of people who leave their keys dangling in their locks, for the evening passeggiata when everyone is out and about, visiting, shopping, taking a quick espresso. I’ve left Ed there because his university starts later than mine and the sandblasting still is a dream of accomplishment for the summer. The taxi lets me out and speeds off. My house looks the same; the climbing rose has grown and tried to wind around the columns. Finally I find the key mixed in with my Italian change. Sister comes to greet me with a plaintive meow and a quick brush of her sides against my ankles. I pick her up to smell her earthy, damp leaf smell. In Italy, I often wake up thinking she has leapt on the bed. She jumps on top of my bag and curls down for a nap. So much for having suffered in my absence.",

On these clothes are hung to dry, having been washed by laughing women in glacial streams with ice a foot thick along the edges. Most of the local women go unveiled – being Nurbashi rather than Shiah – and are remarkably good-looking. To everyone’s amusement Rachel is exactly the same physical type as the majority of the local children; they, too, have round faces, rosy cheeks – now somewhat the worse for windburn – dark brown eyes and straight, light brown hair. This afternoon some of the older boys tried to upset Hallam; obviously they long to see Rachel falling off. Their elders attempted to control them, but without much success. This sort of hooliganism is unexpected here.",

He replied that he thought so, and looked questioningly at the dapper young man in the corner. This young man now spoke up in somewhat broken German, saying that he believed the other seats were free, and adding that he had got on the train at the Friedrich-strasse station and had seen no one else in the compartment. The woman immediately and vigorously nodded her head in satisfaction and spoke with rapid authority to her companion, who went out and presently returned with their baggage--two valises, which he arranged upon the rack above their heads.",

The agent, on his third visit to Malana, was our leader – if so decisive a title may be bestowed on a man who viewed the whole performance with frank horror. As we struggled upwards I admitted to myself that the Jari chowkidar had been right. Guidance was indeed necessary for this track – to prove the human animal capable of following it rather than to show the way, which in most places could be lost only by falling into the nullah or scaling a 2000-foot cliff. Among the more stimulating diversions was a cow-hair rope hand-bridge which made me feel like a trapeze artiste without the net, as the torrent thundered hungrily down its bed of boulders beneath my dangling feet. After this came a brief respite – some hundred yards of firm silver sand on which we walked five abreast beside a shallow, more subdued nullah, where the clear green water was like a liquid jewel.",

Before dressing for school, Miranda’s daughters herded the sheep to their grazing while Raúl fetched the cows. Father and Miguel went first to the dam; twice-daily ablutions are de rigueur. Before following them Grandad fetched firewood while Miranda cleared the stove, dumping its ashes in the long-drop, an effective and environmentally sound ‘air freshener’.",

But she seemed so transubstantiated by her change of position, and held out her hand to him in such cool friendship, that he became deferential, and sat down with a perceptible loss of power. He understood but little of fashion in dress, yet enough to feel himself inadequate in appearance beside her whom he had hitherto been dreaming of as almost his property. She said something very polite about his being good enough to call. This caused him to recover balance. He looked her oddly in the face, losing his awe.",

But mostly I hung around the city centre, wandering back and forth between the railway station and the royal palace, peering in the store windows along Karl Johans Gate, the long and handsome main pedestrian street, cheered by the bright lights, mingling with the happy, healthy, relentlessly youthful Norwegians, very pleased to be alive and out of Hammerfest and in a world of daylight. When I grew cold, I sat in cafes and bars and eavesdropped on conversations that I could not understand or brought out my Thomas Cook European Timetable and studied it with a kind of humble reverence, planning the rest of my trip.",

Bedtime was approaching and they were preparing themselves for the ‘chilly’ night. Outside in the foyer Passepartout was in the middle of his own bedtime shenanigans. The linen cupboards had been emptied of bedding, now distributed to passengers. A few sheets remained, lining the base of the cupboard that resembled the kind of box magicians’ assistants were sawn in. His bag was already in one end and now he placed one foot on the edge of the door and tried to haul himself in without banging his head. He slotted one leg in, then carefully pulled in the other and lay down. He looked like he was in a coffin. I drew the door up to his neck just as an elderly man came to clean his teeth. He bent over the sink and cleared the back of his throat and nasal passages before hacking out the contents and gargling. As he looked up in the mirror he caught sight of Passepartout’s head poking out of the cupboard, where he was now propped up holding a torch and reading a copy of A Fine Balance in Norwegian. The man’s eyes flew out on stalks and he began to choke and laugh at the same time. I smiled politely and the man walked wordlessly towards the door, looking back over his shoulder until he was gone. The door flew open a second later and two children came tumbling through, looking for the Crazy White Man in the Cupboard. Once the show was over, Passepartout fished a warm Kingfisher out of his bag and waved me off to bed.",

The resorts would charge a fee for us to use them, and some might turn us away altogether. (Terrorists targeted at least two waterfront resorts in recent years, and in one attack, the killer swam from a public beach to a hotel where he stabbed several foreigners.) Instead, we followed the promenade, but, being in no hurry whatsoever, we dawdled and peeked and poked in all the storefronts we found on the way. We stopped at restaurants to read the menus, we stopped at real estate agencies to inspect the apartments for let, and we stopped at pharmacies to ask about antacids and mouthwash. Teresa admired the scarves on display at one shop, and I tried on a pair of plastic sandals at another. We listened, carefully, to a tout who tried, very politely, to sell something to us, what, we don’t know, because his Russian was far better than mine.
