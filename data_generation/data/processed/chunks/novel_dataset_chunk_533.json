When we first started coming to Italy, Ed was a tea drinker. As an undergraduate, he took a semester off to study on his own in London. He lived in a cold-water bed-sitter near the British Museum and sustained himself on cups of tea with milk and sugar while reading Eliot and Conrad. Espresso, of course, is pandemic in Italy; the whoosh of steam is heard in every piazza. During our first summer in Tuscany, I remember seeing him eye the Italians as they stepped up to the bar and ordered, in a clipped voice, “un caffè.” At that time, espresso was rarely seen in America. When he ordered like the Italians, at first the bartenders asked him, “Normale?” They thought surely a tourist was making a mistake. We require big cups of brown coffee, as the Italians, with a touch of wonder, call it.",

When a power failure left the street in darkness business continued to be brisk, by starlight, for half an hour, during which several newcomers somehow inserted themselves into non-existent spaces. By dawn-light I noticed a young couple embracing near the steps – he a handsome white policeman, trying to be cheerful, she a beautiful mulatta allowing tears to trickle. Twice she obeyed a female (maternal?) voice summoning her aboard, twice he successfully begged her to descend for another tight lingering embrace. She stayed with him until the departure signal, our ‘conductor’ rattling a thin chain; once it had been hooked across the steps no one was allowed to enter or leave.",

He was still fuming as he walked along, but then he noticed something up ahead, coming from a bare patch of ground in the snowfield: it was a splash of dazzling purple color. He stopped yelling and knelt to look at it. “It was a patch of lovely little wildflower … a purple patch striking in its contrast to the surrounding white wilderness.… The edge of the snow had been undercut by the wind and the little plants were alive with color for quite a distance under the snow.” McKinlay stared in awe at the beauty, the life springing forth from this lifeless place. He stopped arguing with Munro and was overcome with a feeling of profound calm. He thought for a moment of his late-night talks with Bartlett on the Karluk about roses and other flowers; he thought about Bjarne Mamen and the adage he’d heard him utter: “As long as there is life, there is hope.” McKinlay looked up from the gorgeous little flowers, smiled, and went forward, leading Munro and Clam straight into camp.",

The scion of a great corporate dynasty in Medellín, Juan Manuel had long ago defied family expectations by choosing the creative path. His most recent exhibit, one that had shaken the conscience of the nation, grew out of the seven years he devoted to documenting some eight hundred tombs in the Medio Magdalena, all holding the remains of those without names, the NNs. The exhibit had replicated the feel of the cemetery at Puerto Berrío. Mounted across a dark museum space were the illuminated photographs of the tombs, and running parallel to it were a list of names of all those who had been lost, the dead and the disappeared. In this spatial juxtaposition lay the answer we had hoped to find.",

Unfortunately this sartorial elegance is marred by his incredible facility for attracting vast quantities of filth to his person within minutes of the daily bath. Incidentally, he resents this unnatural intimacy with soap and water even more bitterly than does the average Tiblet and will only allow it on being heavily bribed in edible currency.",

It’s in the northeast of China, nearly straight north of Beijing. We have one more day in China before entering Outer Mongolia, which also sounds like it’s in Mongolia. And it is. The hills, farms, and coal mines of yesterday are all gone. In their place are windswept, featureless plains, which in summer must be green waves of grassland. Now, what grass there might be is just a brown stubble coming off a long cold winter. I’m not enthralled that the landscape has changed to brown stubble, but then I’m not yet aware that this is going to look like a tropical jungle compared to what’s ahead. Here, sand dunes rim the road. Objectively, this is evidence of desertification from the Gobi. Subjectively, I call it Mongolia’s revenge on China for taking so much of their territory. Perched on the dunes are bronze dinosaurs. Life size.",

A few minutes after we all arrived and got out in the parking lot, an old lady, the park’s lone guide, hurried up the hill toward us, breathing hard and striding briskly as if she feared we might escape. Still panting, she introduced herself as Galina. She seemed not to have guided anyone in a while. Her hair was long and gray and unrestrained, but her prim blue blouse with white lace at the collar and down the front offset this rather wild look, as did her matching blue skirt and brogan-style walking shoes.",

With its overwhelmingly Hindu population, New Delhi was quite unchanged by the onset of the Muslim month of fasting, but the Old City had been transformed since our last visit. There were now far fewer people about: many streets were deserted but for groups of tethered goats fattening for their slaughter on Idul-Zuha. Those Muslims who were out on the streets looked bad-tempered: they had not eaten or drunk since before dawn, and were in no mood for smiles or pleasantries. Even the endlessly patient bicycle rickshaw drivers muttered curses under their breath as they drove us uphill through the narrowing funnel of tightly-packed houses.",

Yet she had a stunning figure, and there was no suggestion of an ugly masculinity about her. She was as completely and as passionately feminine as a woman could be. Her somewhat stern and lonely face was relieved by its spiritual depth and feeling, and when it was lighted by a smile it had a sudden, poignant radiance, a quality of illumination which in its intensity and purity was different from any other smile George had ever seen.",

But there we were in spectacular coastal California, bummed out, burned out, shivering and, for the first time in our travel lives, bored. The dismal little cottage had a huge TV, and we torpidly watched actors, athletes, and advertisers prance, parade, run, walk, slither, leap, sell, fall in love, and jockey for power on the screen.",

The Tibetan Government has officially forbidden Tibetans to take honey, because their religion does not allow them to deprive animals of their food. However, here, as in most other places, people like to circumvent the law, and so the Tibetans, including the Pönpos, allow the Nepalese to have the honey they collect, and then buy it back from them.",

I’d developed the rolling hip-sway of a sailor on shore leave, brought about by fatigue and sore joints. The evening air was hot, still; the eastern sky an inky blue, orange in the west. The chalk of the path gathered the late light to itself, glowing whitely in the twilight. Pale trumpets of bindweed jumped forward to the eye. In the verge lay the part-eaten corpse of a blackbird, its scaly legs severed from its body and placed neatly alongside one another, like a knife and fork after a meal.",

The town’s Culture Officer was rumoured to hold the key and I not unreasonably expected to find him in the House of Culture – a bizarre 1911 hybrid, part Victorian gaol, part Loire château. Originally a Magyar theatre, it has long since been overtaken by silent, sad, damp-smelling dereliction. A white marble stairway, cracked and muddy, sweeps up to a circular gallery where the corpse of a grand piano – legs in the air – lay on a mound of rubble. Off this gallery, down high narrow creaking corridors, little girls were typing in little offices. My arrival caused them to crane incredulously over the tops of cumbersome (1911?) machines and then titter nervously. None made any attempt to communicate in any language.",

Nothing easier than to say, Have no fear! Nothing more difficult. How does one kill fear, I wonder? How do you shoot a spectre through the heart, slash off its spectral head, take it by its spectral throat? It is an enterprise you rush into while you dream, and are glad to make your escape with wet hair and every limb shaking. The bullet is not run, the blade not forged, the man not born; even the winged words of truth drop at your feet like lumps of lead. You require for such a desperate encounter an enchanted and poisoned shaft dipped in a lie too subtle to be found on earth. An enterprise for a dream, my masters!",

After striking a deal with a tourist from Colombia or Mexico, he’d have to wait outside the tourist’s hotel to get paid. Then, like a scene from a Cold War spy novel, he and the buyer walked toward each other. As they got close, Arturo grabbed an envelope from the buyer’s hand and kept on going. The tourists paid in American dollars, which gave Arturo access to all that the black market offered, even though any Cuban caught with even a few greenbacks at that time could be sent to prison. Selling his art eventually got easier after the government legalized the dollar. Following that big change, Havana immensely complicated the lives of ordinary Cubans by introducing the convertible peso, which was pegged to the dollar, while retaining the old peso for workers’ salaries and sales in libreta stores.",

It was a fine summery evening, with the kind of still air on which aromas hang ? in this case a curious but not displeasing mixture of vanilla, grilled meat and fish. Swifts circled and darted overhead and the masts of yachts rocked lazily on the water. It was such a pleasant spot and dusk was settling in so nicely that I sat for some time drinking Bips and watching the nightly promenade, the korzo.",

Through the half-closed jalousies we see breadfruit trees, delicate tamarinds and algarobas, fan-palms, date-palms, and bananas, and the deep blue Pacific gleams here and there through the plumage of the cocoanut trees. A soft breeze, scented with a slight aromatic odour, wanders in at every opening, bringing with it, mellowed by distance, the hum and clatter of the busy cicada. The nights are glorious, and so absolutely still, that even the feathery foliage of the algaroba is at rest. The stars seem to hang among the trees like lamps, and the crescent moon gives more light than the full moon at home. The evening of the day we landed, parties of officers and ladies. mounted at the door, and with much mirth disappeared on moonlight rides, and the white robes of flower-crowned girls gleamed among the trees, as groups of natives went by speaking a language which sounded more like the rippling of water than human speech. Soft music came from the ironclads in the harbour, and from the royal band at the king's palace, and a rich scent of dewy blossoms filled the delicious air. These are indeed the \"isles of Eden,\" \"the sun lands,\" musical with beauty. They seem to welcome us to their enchanted shores. Everything is new but nothing strange; for as I enjoyed the purple night, I remembered that I had seen such islands in dreams in the cold, gray North. \"How sweet,\" I thought it would be, thus to hear far off, the low, sweet murmur of the \"sparkling brine,\" to rest, and",

Not close enough to bolt for shore in these light conditions, certainly. And a storm was blowing in; it was already starting to snow. Best to ride it out as long as possible on the Karluk and continue preparing fur clothing, sleeping bags, and emergency food and sleds. He had the engineers store kerosene in one-pound tins for sledging and instructed them to trim down all the pickaxes so they weighed less than three pounds each. He worried about the group’s ability to move safely across the ice, especially given how much food they’d need to carry for everyone, as well as for the dogs. The Eskimos would be fine, he figured: they were hardened people, accustomed to such rigors. But when it came to the others, he harbored concerns. Only Hadley had extensive polar ice travel experience. The captain would need to count on Mamen, strongest of them all, and McKinlay, whose daily training regimen impressed him. He grinned, picturing the dutiful Scottish schoolteacher running laps around the ship. And Sandy, the first mate, also showed considerable pluck. The seaman would require it before long; of that, Bartlett felt sure.",
