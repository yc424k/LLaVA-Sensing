Saccharine melodies she played, from memory and in the current mode, that you might hear on any vaudeville stage, and with shallow skill, a feeling for their oversweet nuances. They sat thus for sometime while the light faded, Belle in another temporary vacuum of discontent, building for herself a world in which she moved romantically, finely and a little tragical; with Horace sitting beside her and watching both Belle in her self-imposed and tragic rôle, and himself performing his part like the old actor whose hair is thin and whose profile is escaping him via his chin, but who can play to any cue at a moment’s notice while the younger men chew their bitter thumbs in the wings.",

The small, spread-out white suburb looks surprisingly prosperous; the blacks and Coloureds look demoralized-poor. The Hotel Louis – long and substantial on a high stoep – seems superfluous; it was built during the diamond-rush, now this region experiences no rush of any kind. In the large foyer an elderly grumpy Afrikaner emerged from a sombre jungle of tall pot-plants. He could not or would not speak English. Having booked me in he watched, silently disapproving, as I wheeled Lear across a frayed dingy carpet towards a wide, dark, high-ceilinged corridor.",

By the evening of March 26, they were forced into the lee of a high hummock for shelter, and they spent the night crouched there, hugging one another for warmth until dawn. In the pinkening morning light, the winds subsided enough for them to brew some tea and they agreed to try for a high pressure ridge they could now see in the distance, hoping they’d be able to see something beyond it.",

    "target_paragraph": "FINDING RIDABLE WAVES with nautical charts was a long shot at best. We looked for south-facing island coasts that weren’t “shadowed” by any barrier reef or landmass farther south. We looked for points and bays and reef passes where the shallow water soundings showed, after one or two fathoms, a sharp drop-off to seaward—places where swells would come suddenly out of deep water into the breaking-wave zone, giving them extra power and hollowness. The angle of any promising patch of reef or beach was critical. The rough line along which waves might be expected to break needed to be canted away from, even curved away from, the open ocean to the south, giving waves a chance to bend, peel, and turn into the wind. We looked for offshore canyons that would focus long-interval swell, and the canyon walls that would cause waves to refract into shallower water. Many stretches of coast—most stretches—could be ruled out for one reason or another. But that left a huge number of places with some abstract surf potential, and actually settling on a spot worth traveling to was, in the end, just glorified guesswork. We had no local knowledge; our charts weren’t perfect, and their scale was always too big to account for the individual boulders and chunks of reef that would finally make all the difference. We tried to picture what the swarming numbers meant, as they fell into single digits in the pale blue ribbons of the inshore waters that surrounded the dull yellow splashes of dry land. Looking at the chart of a place you knew, particularly a place that you knew got waves, it was so easy. This is why that spot is good, under the right conditions. A two-dimensional chart suddenly became a multidimensional vision of ridable waves. You could isolate half a dozen factors on the chart alone. But studying charts of places we had never even seen? We were flying blind. This was decades before Google Earth. We had to trust in Willard Bascom, the great oceanographer, who wrote, in Waves and Beaches, “This zone where waves give up their energy and where systematic water motions give way to violent turbulence is the surf. It is the most exciting part of the ocean.”",

The worst of it was that he could never tell when these hot gusts of anguish would overtake him. They came sometimes just when he felt most secure, when he was saying to himself: “After all, things are really worth while——” sometimes even when he was sitting with Clare Van Degen, listening to her voice, watching her hands, and turning over in his mind the opening chapters of his book.",

The rag is dark grey from dirt and smells so putrid that you have to leave wherever it’s being used. If anything was not already filthy and germ-laden, it would be after the passage of the rag. There was nothing to eat. We bought oranges and hardboiled eggs (both safe) at a station. The country suddenly became beautiful as did the weather. It was very hot in the train. The blue and brown mountains were good to see. Without enough food, no drink except boiled water, with dirty lumpy itchy plush seats, and cinders in our eyes, it was still the most comfortable day we have had. That trip lasted 25 hours and covered not quite 400 miles.”",

An Argentinian with two Nikons round his neck made a fulsome speech thanking the crew for bringing us to this ‘unworldly’ place and then insisted that I make one too, ‘on behalf of the foreigners’. There are gradations of foreign, of course, and compared with me the Argentinians and Chileans felt united. The glacier experience had made me sentimental, and as I was the only fully qualified foreigner on board and no one understood English I recited Yeats’ ‘Had I the heavens’ as if it were a formal speech, which rather spoilt it, but everyone clapped. As we moved away from San Rafael the Argentinians took photographs of me on deck as if I were as rare a phenomenon as the glacier itself. I had been consorting with Norman for some time, and I lounged inscrutably against the rail in dark glasses as if I spent my life being photographed by tourists.",

There these tiny impurities would drift and float and mingle, like flaky poo in a goldfish bowl, awaiting summons back to someone else’s glass. If I am to drink dilute dribble and mouth rinsings, then I do rather wish I could do it in a situation of comfort and cheer, seated in a Windsor chair by a blazing fire, but this appears to be an increasingly elusive dream. As sometimes also happens in these circumstances, I had a sudden urge not to drink any more beer, so instead I hauled myself from my barside perch and returned to my seafront lodgings for an early night.",

Going to investigate, she found a large man?a “giant,” she told police?just outside her bedroom door. He was speaking in a foreign accent to another man, whom she could not see. Before Mrs. Snyder could react, the giant seized her and beat her so roughly that she was left unconscious for six hours. Then he and his confederate went to Mr. Snyder’s bed, strangled the poor man with picture wire, and stove in his head with a sash weight. It was the sash weight that fired the public’s imagination and gave the case its name. The two villains then turned out drawers all over the house and fled with Mrs. Snyder’s jewels, but they left a clue to their identity in the form of an Italian-language newspaper on a table downstairs.",

So I coaxed our ghora in, tethered him to a rafter and here we all are, very cosy and snug, our oil-stove boiling a kettle for chai, the window blocked with an old exercise book lent by Rachel and the chimney-hole also papered over. Outside the window is a snow-filled orchard of apricot saplings and beyond that a mighty display of mountains, less than two miles away. I fetch water from a stream near our neighbours’ houses: it is unfrozen at only one point, where housewives repeatedly break the ice. We shall continue to use candles. In theory Skardu is electrified but in practice the current flows only rarely and weakly despite – or because of – the many wires that drape the town. These run from tree to tree like tropical creepers, at just the level to strangle or otherwise dispose of unwary riders. Indisputably this is an endearing capital.",

I walked down the hill on unfamiliar legs that seemed to snap out in front of me like whipped lengths of rope. The Adelphi, glowing beckoningly at the foot of the hill, managed the interesting trick of being both nearby and astonishingly distant. It was like looking at it through the wrong end of a telescope—a sensation somewhat enhanced by the fact that my head was a good seven or eight yards behind my manically flopping feet. I followed them helplessly, and by a kind of miracle they hurtled me down the hill, safely across the road, and up the steps to the entrance to the Adelphi, where I celebrated my arrival by making a complete circuit in the revolving door so that I emerged into open air once again, before plunging back in and being flung with a startling suddenness into the Adelphi’s grand and lofty lobby. I had one of those where-am-I moments, then grew aware that the night staff was silently watching me. Summoning as much dignity as I could and knowing that the lifts would be quite beyond me, I went to the grand staircase and managed—I know not how—to fall up them in a manner uncannily reminiscent of a motion picture run in reverse. All I know is that at the very end I leaped backward to my feet and announced to the craning faces that I was quite all right, and then embarked on a long search for my room among the Adelphi’s endless and mysteriously numbered corridors.",

My flashlight swung from left to right, illuminating the path and anything that might be lurking beside it. Behind me another beam stayed resolutely at our feet, and I presumed this was the father’s. The last beam flitted through the night sky, whipped around and behind us, then up and down, creating a disco effect. Maybe one of the girls was looking for vampire bats.",

The traditional photograph holding a falcon was taken. A phalanx of retired and current vice presidents welcomed us in their pristine white thobes.

Under the Trading with the Enemy Act, any American caught spending money in Communist Cuba without Uncle Sam’s explicit permission could—in theory— be slapped with fines of up to $250,000 and ten years in prison. We were also a little nervous about losing our passports. We couldn’t expect much sympathy from the U.S. Interests Section (America’s version of an embassy in Havana) if we weren’t supposed to be there in the first place, could we? And what if we ran out of money? American traveler’s checks and credit cards don’t work in Cuba. We might have to sell our belongings (or our bodies) in a gutter somewhere.",

    "target_paragraph": "I picked Mrs Lewis off an overturned bookstall in Trieste. There had been a riot after a bomb-throwing, and I was hurry­ing back to my hotel from the observation-ward of the hospital. The street with its wrecked fruit-stalls and booths and smashed shop-windows was perfect illustration of my state of mind. The boat was to sail at midnight. A Lady’s Impressions of Cyprus stared up at me from a jumble of fruit and books, and a whole drift of smashed second-hand discs. There was no one about, though I could hear the grumble and crash of a crowd down towards the harbour. Military patrols kept roaring by. The gutters were running mournfully with wine which on the black tarmac looked like blood. The whole contents of a toy-shop had been blown into the street, giving it all a carnival air. I stopped guiltily, fearful of incurring the penalties of looting should the police return, and picked Mrs Lewis up. Her faded green cover with its floral device promised me a Victorian travel-account which might introduce me in a most suitable manner to the Crown Colony of Cyprus. But something more than this. I felt she was a sort of omen.",

    "target_paragraph": "Har Homa is to accommodate 30,000 and will include tourist hotels, already numerous in Bethlehem but the Israelis advise foreigners to avoid those. Nearby two more new settlements were growing, one on An-Nu’man land – what little is left of it, post-Barrier. This small Bedouin village, on a hilltop between Bethlehem and Jerusalem, has long been the victim of an Apartheid-flavoured error. In 1967, when Jerusalem illegally expanded its municipal boundary, An-Nu’man was placed within East Jerusalem – but another set of bureaucrats gave the villagers West Bank ID cards. Ergo: they couldn’t enter Jerusalem though the municipality said they lived in Jerusalem. Oddly enough, this anomaly went unnoticed until the 1991 closure policy exposed these villagers as ‘illegal residents’ in their birthplace. This made life very difficult and it became even more so during the second Intifada when the IDF blocked the roads from An-Nu’man to Umm Tuba and Sur Baher. The Jerusalem authorities then cut off the Bethlehem to An-Nu’man water and telephone connections because an Area A municipality was not entitled to service a Jerusalem village. In 2004 life became almost intolerable: the Barrier – with no gateway accessible to walkers – enclosed An-Nu’man, cutting it off from the West Bank and caging people unable legally to enter Jerusalem. An-Nu’man has no school or health services; the villagers were totally dependent on Umm Tuba, now beyond reach. In 2008 they took their case to the High Court – and lost. B’Tselem foresees: ‘In these circumstances it is likely that, sooner or later, the residents will be left with no option but to leave the village.’ The Israelis covet that hilltop for yet another outrageous development, as outlined in the Jerusalem Municipality Draft Master Plan. As Gideon Levy puts it:",

Only he and Top had to stay out in the cold now because they wanted to see it. Top said that when the wheels blew up, they would blow the whole automobile up.

Saturday afternoon is a gala-day here, and the broad road was so thronged with brilliant equestrians, that I thought we should be ridden over by the reckless rout. There were hundreds of native horsemen and horsewomen, many of them doubtless on the dejected quadrupeds I saw at the wharf, but a judicious application of long rowelled Mexican spurs, and a degree of emulation, caused these animals to tear along at full gallop. The women seemed perfectly at home in their gay. brass-bossed, high peaked saddles, flying along astride, bare-footed, with their orange and scarlet riding dresses streaming on each side beyond their horses' tails? a bright kaleidoscopic flash of bright eyes, white teeth, shining hair, garlands of flowers and many coloured dresses; while the men were hardly less gay, with fresh flowers round their jaunty hats, and the vermilion-coloured blossoms of the Ohia round their brown throats. Sometimes a troop of twenty of these free-and-easy female riders went by at a time, a graceful and exciting spectacle, with a running accompaniment of vociferation and laughter. Among these we met several of the Nevada's officers, riding in the stiff, wooden style which Anglo-Saxons love, and a horde of jolly British sailors from H.M.S. Scout, rushing helter skelter, colliding with everybody, be-striding their horses as they would a topsailyard, hanging on to manes and lassoing horns, and enjoying themselves thoroughly. In the shady, tortuous streets we met hundreds more of native riders, dashing at full gallop without fear of the police. Many of the women were in flowing riding dresses of pure white, over which their unbound hair, and wreaths of carmine-tinted flowers fell most picturesquely.",

She thought of enquiring for Mrs. Hochmüller at some of the neighbouring houses, but their look was so unfriendly that she walked on without making up her mind at which door to ring. When she reached the horsecar terminus a car was just moving off toward Hoboken, and for nearly an hour she had to wait on the corner in the bitter wind. Her hands and feet were stiff with cold when the car at length loomed into sight again, and she thought of stopping somewhere on the way to the ferry for a cup of tea; but before the region of lunchrooms was reached she had grown so sick and dizzy that the thought of food was repulsive. At length she found herself on the ferry boat, in the soothing stuffiness of the crowded cabin; then came another interval of shivering on a street corner, another long jolting journey in a “cross-town” car that smelt of damp straw and tobacco; and lastly, in the cold spring dusk, she unlocked her door and groped her way through the shop to her fireless bedroom.",

A mooring ball lay just offshore, set for the occasional supply ship.

The inconvenience these excavations caused was second only to that created by the dust storms. In Delhi the high summer is enlivened by the advent of the Lu, the hot desert wind which in May begins to blow in from Rajasthan, bringing with it much of the Thar Desert. Burning grit rains down on the city then blows gusting through the grid of scorching streets. At the road junctions, spiralling dust-devils replace the absent beggars.
