(An encomienda was an estate from which a Spanish settler was entitled to receive produce though the Indians continued to own the land.) Maldonado was born in Salamanca and achieved fame as the luckiest of the conquistadores. For helping to capture Atahualpa he was given a cavalryman’s reward (7,760 gold doubloons and 362 marcos of silver). As a gambler with dice he had soon won twice that amount in his spare time. After the murder of Atahualpa, when one of the Inca’s despairing and beautiful sister/wives wanted to be buried alive with her brother/husband, as was the custom, Pizarro instead gave her to Maldonado with the intention of cheering her up. Maldonado also won a major share of the loot taken from Topa Inca’s palace. And soon after being awarded the fief of Andahuayalas he chanced upon several bars of silver, which had apparently strayed from a nearby Inca centre for smelting silver, gold and copper ore in wind-ovens.",

However, in reality not nearly as many locals rallied to William’s cause as he had hoped. The Prince of Orange had expected thousands of people to join him in rising up against the King’s corrupt and heretical rule, but in practice their reception was decidedly lukewarm. Many Protestant nobles were hesitant about being seen to support William too early, lest his attempt to seize the throne fail. As a result, as Lisa Jardine has written, the Dutch resorted to carefully stage-managing William’s march on London, lining the streets with selected supporters in an effort to make his arrival seem more like a liberation and less like an invasion.",

The face she lifted to her dancers was the same which, when she saw him, always looked like a window that has caught the sunset. He even noticed two or three gestures which, in his fatuity, he had thought she kept for him: a way of throwing her head back when she was amused, as if to taste her laugh before she let it out, and a trick of sinking her lids slowly when anything charmed or moved her.",

The narrow road to the city of Murakami runs through tunnels hewn out of the naked cliffs, propped up with raw black timbers, and the Nippon Ichi signs stand half-buried in the piles of beer cans and broken bottles that Japanese visitors seem not to see.

Its activity in sucking the moisture from the rich damp sod was almost a process observable by the eye. The outskirts of this level water-meadow were diversified by rounded and hollow pastures where, just now, everything that was not a buttercup was a daisy, losing their character somewhat as they sank to the verge of the intervening river. This slid along noiselessly as a shade – the swelling reeds and sedge forming a flexible palisade along its moist brink. To the north of the mead were trees, the leaves of which were new, soft, moist and flexible, not having been stiffened or darkened by summer sun and drought, their colour being yellow beside anything green, green beside anything yellow. From the recesses of this knot of foliage the loud notes of three cuckoos were at the present moment resounding through the still air.",

Both of these rooms make living in the African bush more tolerable. Although we have never spent the night at the Protea, we have often retreated to the confines of the lounge and the television room on cold winter evenings when the temperature approaches 0 degrees Celsius. It’s one thing to sleep bundled up in the cold; it’s an entirely different story to sit in a jacket in a cold house waiting to go to sleep.

    "target_paragraph": "I had been to Hilltop the year before, so I wandered past it and up a little-known track to a tarn, or wild pond, on some high ground behind it. Old Mrs. Potter used to come up to this tarn regularly to thrash about on it in a rowboat—whether for healthful exercise or as a kind of flagellation I don’t know—but it was very lovely and seemingly quite forgotten. I had the distinct feeling that I was the first visitor to venture up there for years. Across the way, a farmer was repairing a stretch of fallen wall and I stood and watched him for a while from a discreet distance, because if there is one thing nearly as soothing to the spirit as repairing a drystone wall (and I speak here with proud experience) it is watching someone else doing it. What a wonderful feature of the landscape these old walls are. I remember once, not long after we moved to the North, going for a stroll and happening on a neighboring farmer rebuilding a wall on a remote hill. It was a rotten January day full of drifting fog and rain, and the thing is, there wasn’t any discernible point in his rebuilding the wall. He owned the fields on either side of it, and in any case there was a gate that stood permanently open between the two, so it wasn’t as if the wall had any real function. I stood and watched him awhile and finally asked him why he was standing out in a cold rain rebuilding the wall. He looked at me with that special pained look Yorkshire farmers save for recent arrivals from the South and other morons and said, “Because it’s fallen down, of course.” From this I learned, first of all, never to ask a Yorkshire farmer any question that can’t be answered with “pint of Tetley’s if you don’t mind,” and that one of the primary reasons so much of the British landscape is so unutterably lovely and timeless is that most farmers, for whatever reason, take the trouble to keep it that way.",

The lesser of two evils definitely was to have a working engine for the Red Sea, which was narrow and crawling with shipping and reefs. Again we re-created the block-and-tackle system and manhandled the engine out of the boat. Now all that was left was to find the real problem.",

What the world did not see was the spirit with which that brave young child lived, and the faith that carried her, ever hopeful, into a better world. Should she have died? No. Ought those responsible for all the failures that led to such loss of life at Armero be held responsible? Perhaps yes, though blame is always easy. Omayra Sánchez, in all her innocence and youth, displayed in her most perilous moments a strength and resilience that is found in all good Colombians, and it is surely this quality of character that will carry the country forward if it is to shed the shadows of the past and emerge into the light.",

Railroad yards are a ceaseless fascination. They satisfy every kind of nature. For the lazy man whose blood flows very slowly, it is a steady soothing world of motion which supplies him with the sense of a strong moving power. He need not work and yet he has it very deeply; he has it even better than the man who works in it or owns it. Then for natures that like to feel emotion without the trouble of having any suffering, it is very nice to get the swelling in the throat, and the fullness, and the heart beats, and all the flutter of excitement that comes as one watches the people come and go, and hears the engine pound and give a long drawn whistle. For a child watching through a hole in the fence above the yard, it is a wonder world of mystery and movement. The child loves all the noise, and then it loves the silence of the wind that comes before the full rush of the pounding train, that bursts out from the tunnel where it lost itself and all its noise in darkness, and the child loves all the smoke, that sometimes comes in rings, and always puffs with fire and blue color.",

I didn’t exactly fall, but then again I didn’t exactly walk down. It was more like surfing on the soles of my shoes, and was, I believe, not unimpressive.

One wonders how it ever got there. And it seems like Spain—or Malta: not Italy. It is a steep and lonely city, treeless, as in some old illumination. Yet withal rather jewel-like: like a sudden rose-cut amber jewel naked at the depth of the vast indenture. The air is cold, blowing bleak and bitter, the sky is all curd. And that is Cagliari. It has that curious look, as if it could be seen, but not entered. It is like some vision, some memory, something that has passed away. Impossible that one can actually walk in that city: set foot there and eat and laugh there. Ah, no! Yet the ship drifts nearer, nearer, and we are looking for the actual harbour.",

Professor G. has a little side-stepping to do to get this in his stride but he manages, that is he stays on his feet: he is willing, he concedes at last, to call the whole composition Pax; yes, that far he will go, but not the lady herself; on that he stands firm. He is not present when Professor Q. blows in from Oxford for his Christmas vacation and blasts even this edifice to smithereens. “Nonsense. She is Italia. Roma on one side, Italia on the other.

There are Chinese restaurants of subtle discretion, appreciated only by gourmets or valetudinarians, where they cook abalone, snake or shark’s fin in manners all their own, and make sure elderly customers are served only the bear’s left front paw – thought to be the best for rheumatism because it is the one the bear most often licks. There are restaurants which take especial care of foreigners, and restaurants which are more or less clubs, and trendy restaurants that offer a kind of nouvelle Cantonese, and famously expensive restaurants where plutocrats like to show off their wealth. For me though nothing can be much more fun than to walk blind into one of the great popular Chinese eating-places, places like carnival railway stations, emporia of eating, palaces of gourmandcy, which flourish in every part of the territory.",

He gave him some medicine from the diminishing stores in the kit, and Williamson calmed down. Hadley discovered that those in the other tent had consumed two crowbills apiece and shared a couple of gulls. Williamson’s attack of indigestion was likely from gorging too much, too fast with a severely shrunken stomach.",
