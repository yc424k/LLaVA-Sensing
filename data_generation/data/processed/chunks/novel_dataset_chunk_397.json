When he left the dining room, Gerard stepped from behind a pillar and opened fire, hitting William in the chest and stomach. The Prince fell and Gerard ran from the building, but was quickly captured. Several days of excruciating torture followed, during which he was propped naked next to a blazing fire, hung from a rack, beaten with rods, had boiling fat poured on him, burned with a hot grill, had salt rubbed in his wounds and had his genitals cut off. William, meanwhile, was carried by a servant to an adjacent room and laid on a couch, where he died. It was, according to the historian Lisa Jardine, the first time a head of state had ever been assassinated using a handgun. Legend has it that the Prince of Orange’s final words were: ‘my God, have pity on my soul; my God, have pity on this poor people.’ He is believed to have said them not in Dutch, but in French.",

    "target_paragraph": "the mighty Bahamian spider crab\n​At this point in my trip, I’ve heard of at least five pointbreaks in the area, but have only surfed one. Erick and his wife Jennifer, from Windsong, and I talk about going to James Point to surf. None of us have been there before, but we heard it was a good pointbreak, especially when the wind is south. A day comes with conditions that we think will favor this break, and the decision is made to go. We decide that we might have better luck hitchhiking if we go separately, since three of us together, all with surfboards, might not be able to get a ride.\n​I set out first, hiking south from Hatchet Bay. I walk a long way, perhaps for 45 minutes. At one point a small car passes with two surfboards sticking out of the windows. The car slows down, but keeps going. Soon after, a pickup truck stops and gives me a ride. We see Erick and Jennifer walking and the driver stops and picks them up. They get in the back and laugh and tell me that they were in the small car that passed me and wanted to stop, but the driver didn’t think they had any more room.\n​The truck takes us out of his way to the beginning of the dirt road leading to James Point, and we walk for the next half hour to the point. On the way there, we pass a house and outside a man is working on his truck.\n​“Y’all be careful out there,” he warns us, “be careful of the waves and the sharks.”\n​“Now, what kind of sharks are we talking about?” Jennifer says.\n​“Hammer,” he says.\n​“So the point has its resident shark?”\n​“Yes,” the man says as he looks at us and nods his head ominously.\n​We hike on past a brown salt pond with white foam blowing across the surface, piling up on the edges. A white, broken-down, Jeep Cherokee sits beside the road, long abandoned. Finally, we emerge from the bush and behold a small cove with a rocky beach and a wave breaking over a left point. There is no obvious way in or out of the water, except across the rocks. The sun is obscured by clouds and the water is grey and dark. Nobody else is here. It looks surfable but sketchy to me, and we decide to keep looking.\n​There is another larger cove to the right, and we stare at this for a while, not sure which cove is the one people surf, but the waves in this cove do not look as good, and we return to the first cove.\n​Erick and I paddle out and Jennifer stays on the beach and takes photos while we surf. When we first get out, I swim to the bottom and feel it with my hand. It is the same jagged rock often found on land that is hard to walk on while wearing shoes, and impossible to walk on barefoot. This makes me nervous, as does the fact that we are at a new spot, have been warned about sharks, nobody else is out, and we might not even be in the right cove.\n​Erick catches about four waves before I get my first. I surf very conservatively, but catch a few fun waves before going in and scrambling across the slippery rocks that make up the shore. Returning to dry land is a relief. The place sketches me out.",

    "target_paragraph": "Among the nation’s press, the question concerning the president’s announcement was not why he decided not to run, but why he chose such an ambiguous phrase as “I do not choose to run” as opposed to a more direct “I will not run” or “I have decided not to run.” Many saw it not as an outright refusal to run but almost as the very opposite?a reluctant willingness to be drafted if that was the will of the people. The humorist Will Rogers put it succinctly in his popular newspaper column: “I think Mr. Coolidge’s statement is the best-worded acceptance of a nomination ever uttered by a candidate. He spent a long time in the dictionary looking for that word ‘choose,’ instead of ‘I will not.’ It don’t take much political knowledge to know that a man can get more votes running on the people’s request than he can running on his own request. Mr. Coolidge is the shrewdest politician that ever drew government salary.”",

At night they sleep on skins spread upon the ground and, slipping out of the sleeves, use their sheepskin cloaks as bedclothes. Before they get up in the morning they blow up the still live embers of their fire with a bellows and the first thing they do is to make tea. The fire is the heart of the household and is never allowed to go out. As in every peasant’s house, one finds an altar in every tent; it usually consists of a simple chest on which is set an amulet or a small statue of the Buddha. There is invariably a picture of the Dalai Lama. A little butter-lamp burns on the altar, and in winter the flame is almost invisible owing to the cold and the lack of oxygen.",

The whole aspect of the place had changed with the changed conditions of Ann Eliza’s life. The first customer who opened the shop door startled her like a ghost; and all night she lay tossing on her side of the bed, sinking now and then into an uncertain doze from which she would suddenly wake to reach out her hand for Evelina. In the new silence surrounding her the walls and furniture found voice, frightening her at dusk and midnight with strange sighs and stealthy whispers. Ghostly hands shook the window shutters or rattled at the outer latch, and once she grew cold at the sound of a step like Evelina’s stealing through the dark shop to die out on the threshold. In time, of course, she found an explanation for these noises, telling herself that the bedstead was warping, that Miss Mellins trod heavily overhead, or that the thunder of passing beer wagons shook the door latch; but the hours leading up to these conclusions were full of the floating terrors that harden into fixed foreboding. Worst of all were the solitary meals, when she absently continued to set aside the largest slice of pie for Evelina, and to let the tea grow cold while she waited for her sister to help herself to the first cup. Miss Mellins, coming in on one of these sad repasts, suggested the acquisition of a cat; but Ann Eliza shook her head. She had never been used to animals, and she felt the vague shrinking of the pious from creatures divided from her by the abyss of soullessness.",

Cosima had found that many of her middle-class contemporaries longed to cycle and to swim but cycling was totally verboten and swimming only allowed in segregated pools ‘and Nablus has none’. She admitted that twice a year she needed to visit her parents in Hamburg ‘for conversation and bookshops’.",

Stop!” roared Basil, who I was beginning to suspect was a little deaf. “Bird!” he added unnecessarily, as the sound of his bellowing voice was driving a swarm of birds and other living things away from us, at speed. I’m convinced that even the earthworms dug deeper. We sat in the turning circle of the camp for the first hour of our drive, the engine off, recording the avifauna around us. Eventually I suggested that we move a little farther out and informed them that the other guides had seen and radioed in something interesting not far from where we were. I also explained that we would need to drive for about ten minutes without too many pauses, but I assured them that if I saw any birds they were unlikely to view again, I would stop.",

The Mogul one could accept, and the Hindu. It was this English presence which, though the best known, from books and songs and those pale hands beside the Shalimar – not a stream as in my imagining, but the grandest of the gardens – it was this English presence which seemed hardest to accept, in this mountain-locked valley, this city of hookahs and samavars (so pronounced) where, in a dusty square on Residency Road, was the caravanserai for Tibetans with their long-legged boots, hats, plaited hair, their clothes as grimy-grey as their weather-beaten faces, men indistinguishable from women.",

I hear the same story at all four public schools I visited, “The government mandates we give English lessons but doesn’t provide a teacher who speaks any English.”",

It seemed to him that such talk was false and dishonest, and against the true spirit of what the theatre should try to be; and because he had no words to answer to such cold, smart talk as this, he again felt baffled and infuriated. The remark about it’s being “a rather good O’Neill” angered him because of its implied patronage; and although he himself had been skeptical and critical of the playwright, he now found himself rushing hotly to the man’s defense, feeling that a genuine creative talent was being patronized and smoothly patted on the head and dismissed by some bloodless and talentless nonentity, whose only ability in life was to feed, to chew, to live upon the spirit and the life of better people than himself. This stiffened him with the feeling of cold insult and outrage, as if the attack had been made upon himself; and he found himself in a moment drawn fiercely in conflict with the people here.",

I took a day by myself wandering the Hermitage at random, and I decided that what makes that museum great is the bright, watery light from the Neva River that pours through its tall windows, and the endless profusion of paintings that were apparently acquired by wealthy, unschooled people who compensated for not knowing exactly what to collect by collecting everything. I checked out the Jordan staircase—the scene, I thought, of a struggle between Bolshevik supporters and palace guards during the October Revolution, and of Eisenstein’s recreation of that struggle for his movie October (based on John Reed’s Ten Days That Shook the World). Actually, the real-life struggle took place on a different, less-impressive staircase. For its cinematic reenactment Eisenstein instead used these more majestic stairs, and a huge cast of extras, some of whom carried live ammunition, with the result that more people were shot in the filming than had been shot in the event. The plasterwork I examined along the wall revealed no bullet holes.",

The Prio government, according to Julia Sweig, was Cuba’s ‘most polarised, corrupt, violent and undemocratic’. In August 1951, at the end of one of his weekly anti-Prio broadcasts, Chibas declaimed – ‘Sweep away the thieves in the government! People of Cuba, arise and walk! People of Cuba, awake! This is my last knock on your door!’ He then shot himself while still on air and died soon after. An accident, some said: but broadcasters don’t normally fiddle with loaded revolvers in an absent-minded way. One of the shocked listeners was a twenty-five-year-old law student named Fidel Castro Ruz.",

He had the wide mouth of a Celt, long-lipped, but\nbeautifully cut. His thick hair, his moustache, his close-clipped,\npointed beard, were dark and dry. His face showed a sunburn whitening.\nIt had passed through strange climates. He had the look, this poet, of a\nman who had left some stupendous experience behind him; who had left\nmany things behind him, to stride, star-gazing, on. His face revealed\nhim as he chanted his poems. Unbeautiful in detail, its effect as a\nwhole was one of extraordinary beauty, as of some marvellously pure\nvessel for the spiritual fire. Beside him, it struck Tanqueray that Nina\nshowed more than ever a murky flame.",

    "target_paragraph": "Thus it was in early March 1914 that George Herman Ruth, just turned nineteen, bade farewell to Brother Matthias and his St. Mary’s friends, and boarded a train and headed south to Fayetteville, North Carolina, for his first spring training and a new life as a professional baseball player. It was the first time he had been on a train, first time he had been out of Maryland, first time he had seen small towns and open countryside, first time he had stayed in a hotel or ordered from a menu. He could not have been greener. He didn’t even realize that the majors consisted of two leagues. The nickname his teammates gave him now, “Babe” (on account of his innocence and youthfulness), could hardly have been apter. Ruth was in every sense but the physical one a little boy. With his first paycheck he bought himself a bicycle. In hotels when there was nothing else to do, he rode the elevators for hours. His years of communal living left him wholly innocent of modesty when naked or on the lavatory, and with virtually no sense of private property. His first roommate, Ernie Shore, was dismayed to discover weeks into the season that throughout that period Ruth had been sharing his toothbrush.",

    "target_paragraph": "Gary and I walk down the streets of this shaken, battered, bombed, and resurrected town. “Ga-ry! Ga-ry!” the young girls call. We walk down a neat and tidy street, identical small houses, small front yards, orange street-lamps against a black sky. All is calm, it is as if agitation and nonconformity had been abolished by fiat; one's feet touch the ground very sure that it will rise to meet them, sure that betrayal does not lurk in inanimate things, that trust lies behind all walls. We open a gate, and (as in a fairy tale) one step and we are inside another's warm world. “Come in! Come in!” two voices cry. “Speak English to us, please. . . .” In the garden underneath their cherry tree, cords of firewood are stacked against the coming winter. Nina and Gina wait. Nina is a seamstress in Rome during the winter and Gina keeps the home fires burning, they are sisters, they have never married. This house received a direct hit during the War (the Germans used Avezzano as a headquarters), but it is nice, now, in this room with its tiled and open hearth, with its fat chairs and long table and their good china dishes on display—and on the wall a faded snapshot of an American soldier. They do not count themselves poor. Suddenly the memory of the Communion feast is burden-some to me, though how can one fault Angelo and Nicoletta, who act as if kindness and generosity were an ordinary thing? Nina and Gina have a First Communion present for little Angelo. “And how is the dear family?” they say. One sees the point—am I really seeing the point?—of feudalism.",

The movement seemed more feverish and uncertain than usual, and now and then the road was jammed, and curses, shouts, and the crack of heavy whips sounded against the incessant cannonade that hung its iron curtain above the hills to the north-east. The faces of soldiers and officers were unshaved, sallow, drawn with fatigue and anxiety. Women sat sobbing on their piled-up baggage, and here and there, by the roadside, a little country cart had broken down, and the occupants sat on the bank watching the confusion like impassive lookers-on.",

There is flying scud overhead, and I notice the stars being blotted out. Walls of darkness close in upon me, so that, when the last star is gone, the darkness is so near that it seems I can reach out and touch it on every side. When I lean toward it, I can feel it loom against my face. Puff follows puff, and I am glad the mizzen is furled. Phew! that was a stiff one! The Snark goes over and down until her lee-rail is buried and the whole Pacific Ocean is pouring in. Four or five of these gusts make me wish that the jib and flying-jib were in. The sea is picking up, the gusts are growing stronger and more frequent, and there is a splatter of wet in the air. There is no use in attempting to gaze to windward. The wall of blackness is within arm's length. Yet I cannot help attempting to see and gauge the blows that are being struck at the Snark. There is something ominous and menacing up there to windward, and I have a feeling that if I look long enough and strong enough, I shall divine it. Futile feeling. Between two gusts I leave the wheel and run forward to the cabin companionway, where I light matches and consult the barometer. \"29-90\" it reads. That sensitive instrument refuses to take notice of the disturbance which is humming with a deep, throaty voice in the rigging. I get back to the wheel just in time to meet another gust, the strongest yet. Well, anyway, the wind is abeam and the Snark is on her course, eating up easting. That at least is well.",

During a physical checkup, doctors told her that the battery in her pacemaker needed to be replaced, and they wanted to use that opportunity to move the mechanism from where it was, down near her abdomen, to where it should be, high on the left side of her chest. It meant yet another surgery, and another scar, but this time she didn’t care. She had already started wearing blouses that left no doubt about how disfigured she was. Harder to accept was the reality that the surgery would force her to rule out trips to Tacajó until she recovered. Then two events changed her life yet again.",

I no longer had to walk on the walls of a house that felt as if it had fallen over on its side. The sails didn’t have to be changed once on this entire trip other than for little tweaks and adjustments to the course. The wind remained steady and true at about 25 knots from east. For a couple of days the waves swelled and broke over the Monitor into the cockpit. But no matter what happened, I just rejoiced as the taffrail log ticked away the miles. “No more of this nonsense about beating into the wind anymore,” I thought. “Now, I’m just going to zoom my way around the world with the wind at my back.”",
