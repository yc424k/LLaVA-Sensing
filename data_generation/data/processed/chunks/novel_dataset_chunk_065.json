His eyes were bright, and, indeed, he scarcely knew whether they beheld dreams or realities. All down the street and on the doorstep, and while he mounted the stairs, his dream of Katharine possessed him; on the threshold of the room he had dismissed it, in order to prevent too painful a collision between what he dreamt of her and what she was. And in five minutes she had filled the shell of the old dream with the flesh of life; looked with fire out of phantom eyes. He glanced about him with bewilderment at finding himself among her chairs and tables; they were solid, for he grasped the back of the chair in which Katharine had sat; and yet they were unreal; the atmosphere was that of a dream. He summoned all the faculties of his spirit to seize what the minutes had to give him; and from the depths of his mind there rose unchecked a joyful recognition of the truth that human nature surpasses, in its beauty, all that our wildest dreams bring us hints of.",

Mrs.— is not a bold horsewoman, and preferred to keep to a foot's pace, which fretted my ambitious animal, whose innocent antics alarmed her in turn. We only rode seven miles the first day, through a park-like region, very like Western Wisconsin, and just like what I expected and failed to find in New Zealand. Grassland much tumbled about, the turf very fine and green, dotted over with clumps and single trees, with picturesque, rocky hills, deeply cleft by water-courses were on our right, and on our left the green slopes blended with the flushed, stony soil near the sea, on which indigo and various compositae are the chief vegetation. It was hot, but among the hills on our right, cool clouds were coming down in frequent showers, and the white foam of cascades gleamed among the ohias, whose dark foliage at a distance has almost the look of pine woods.",

As soon as the animal is dead, the hide is meticulously removed and kept in one piece to be used for clothing. Then the feasting begins, and everyone starts to tear out pieces of kidney, liver, heart, or whatever parts they most enjoy, occasionally dipping and swirling the bits in the open carcass, which still holds the reindeer’s warm blood. Usually, a small saucepan containing blood is passed around and each one takes a turn to have a drink. When it was my turn to take a sip, I hesitated for just a moment. I grabbed the dripping saucepan, took a couple of small gulps and swirled the warm blood around my mouth to show that I appreciated the full flavour. It tasted salty and not at all unpleasant. I’m certain my eagerness to try these new-found treats was fuelled by the fact that my WOAM teammates and I felt extremely privileged to accompany these exceptional people during a portion of their epic, yearly, winter migration across the frozen gulf of Ob, in northern Russia.",

How is this is going to play out because even with the wind at my back, it periodically gusts and provides “toppling over” excitement? The climb goes on forever but involves minimal pushing. I have discovered that low gear on my bike is slower than walking so I can make it up just about any hill. That being said, low gear is a long, tedious affair. The counterpoint is the elevated views over the Sound of Mull, ships and boats plying back and forth, as well as Morvern Peninsula, the wilderness opposite.",

A ghost of desperation and loss wafts across my vision. What happened to you, Solo? Did I make you too tender, my pet? Did you run over a log or strike a truck container? It is unlikely that my fast-moving boat ran into any flotsam. The collision came from the side, not forward. Solo stopped and I was on deck quickly. I’d have seen any floating debris big enough to cause such devastation. Something big, moving fast, must have run into us. No ships were visible from the deck. It was something from the sea itself.",

Descents are always more difficult and Akbar had gone far ahead with a Mendi friend. Holding Rachel’s right hand (the drop was on our left), I moved down slowly and steadily, trying to keep my eyes off the river – which was not easy, since its noise and movement had an hypnotic effect. All went well until we came to a point some 250 feet above the water where the path simply ceases to exist. For a distance of perhaps two yards – only two brave, carefree steps! – one has to negotiate a cliff-face on which a bird could hardly perch. The rock has been worn smooth by generations of brave, carefree Mendi feet and this bulge overhangs the river so prominently that it is impossible not to look down, and my giddiness was increased by the sight of all those lumps of icy snow swirling and whirling below us. To circumvent the bulge one has to arch one’s body outwards, while keeping one’s head lowered to avoid the overhang, and there is no handhold of any kind.",

The porter just smiled and led us to a golf cart parked under the porte cochère. Our seats faced backward, and we loaded our backpacks across our laps. The porter threw the cart in high gear, and we sped across the compound to a distant wing of the hotel. We traveled down a long concrete driveway past palm trees and sweet-smelling lawns. The compound was much larger than I expected, and it took several minutes to cross. When we reached the far side, the porter parked the cart and rushed up the stairs to open the door for us. A uniformed guard sat next to a small card table and a metal detector, but the porter walked around the checkpoint and so did we. We traveled up one flight and down a wide and brightly-lit corridor decorated with fine art and decked with spotless, white marble tile. The porter unlocked the door to our room and waved us inside.",

Forehead too high, hair too lank, eyes that stared and stared, blobs of inconsequent blackness. A face foreshortened in a slightly rippled surface may give back poor reflection. She did not consider this, remembering only that this summer was to have been her glory. This summer was to have been the summer, the summer for reflection, for a drawing together . . . the hard-earned olive chaplet. Nike, Athene gave her nothing . . . Love had not yet touched her.

Beyond lay the stony little hill. We got off our horses, and throwing the reins over their heads, climbed on foot. About a dozen men already lay there, shooting spasmodically in the direction of the green bank of trees behind which lay Lerdo. Unseen scattering shots ripped from the blank desert between. About half a mile away small brown figures dodged around in the brush. A thin dust-cloud showed where another detachment was marching slowly north in their rear.",

It is scarcely surprising that he was thrown off his balance. A Howard or a Cavendish set down among a swarm of natives in mud huts can hardly be blamed if now and again he remembers Chatsworth and muses regretfully over red carpets and galleries daubed with coronets as the sunset blazes down through painted windows. There was an element, it must be admitted, of the snob in Flush; Miss Mitford had detected it years ago; and the sentiment, subdued in London among equals and superiors, returned to him now that he felt himself unique. He became overbearing and impudent. ‘Flush has grown an absolute monarch and barks one distracted when he wants a door opened’, Mrs Browning wrote. ‘Robert’, she continued, ‘declares that the said Flush considers him, my husband, to be created for the especial purpose of doing him service, and really it looks rather like it.’",

The coral heads thinned out and the open spaces between them got bigger. A dolphin streaked out of nowhere, cut across our bow and leaped in a spinning arc. It cut back sharply and shot in front of us again and then started zigzagging between the two boats, leaping and spinning, again and again. Cheryl climbed down from the rigging, leaned across the lifelines and reached her arm out toward the dolphin. Dolphins playing around the boat always excite her. The dolphin raced straight toward us again and veered away at the last possible second. Exuberant playfulness like this is not unusual; several times in the past dolphins had played in our bow wake, sometimes for more than an hour. What was unexpected was to see a single one acting this way, and doing it in shallow water. They’re typically seen playing offshore in pods. When you do see individuals or pairs in bays and inlets, they tend to be concentrating on fishing.",

Such a day is called ngunalatri, from the Sanskrit for \"minus one night.\" The paper calendar indicates this day by printing 2 lunar day numbers, separated by a slash, to the right of the date number. Currently this double lunar day is set always to fall on a Wednesday. If you look at the calendar and run horizontally along a Buda/Wednesday line, you will find such a ngunalatri every 9 weeks. In the past, the ngunalatri did not always fall on a Wednesday, and it may not do so in the future. According to the officials at the Department of Religion in Denpasar, and according to those at the Central Hindu Dharma Committee, the ngunalatri day of the week should change every century. It did not change at the end of the Saka 19th century in 1979, but serious consideration is being given to changing it now.",

    "target_paragraph": "I wonder what my friends at home would have said could they have seen me then. No shelter; no refuge; no rest. These three negatives, I take it, sum up fairly accurately a holiday in a caravan. You cannot get in, for if you do either you find it full already of your wife, or, if it is moving, Jellaby immediately springs up from nowhere and inquires at the window whether you have noticed how your horse is sweating. At every camp there is nothing but work,—and oh my friends, such work! Work undreamed of in your ordered lives, and nothing, nothing but it, for must you not eat? And without it there is no eating. And then when you have eaten, without the least pause, the least interval for the meditation so good after meals, there begins that frightful and accursèd form of activity, most frightful and accursed of all known forms, the washing up. How it came about that it was not from the first left to the women I cannot understand; they are fitted by nature for such labour, and do not feel it; but I, being in a minority, was powerless to interfere. Nor did I always succeed in evading it. If we camped early, the daylight exposed my movements; and by the time it was done bed seemed the only place to go to. Now an intelligent man does not desire to go to bed at eight; yet in that cold weather—we were, they said, unusually unfortunate in the weather—even if it was dry, what pleasure was there in sitting out of doors? I had had enough during the day of out of doors : by the time evening came, out of doors and fresh air were things abhorrent to me. And there were only three comfortable chairs, low and easy, in which a man might stretch himself and smoke, and these, without so much as a preliminary offering of them to anybody else, were sat in by the ladies. It did seem a turning of good old customs upside down when I saw Edelgard get into one as a matter of course, so indifferent to what I might be thinking that she did not even look my way. How vividly on such occasions did I remember my easy chair at Storchwerder and how sacred it was, and how she never dared, if I were in the house, approach it, nor I firmly believe ever dared, so good was her training and so great her respect, approach it when I was out.",

Much of the land was cultivated: long, low ridges with shallow dips between. Yet if transported to Ireland those ‘low’ ridges and ‘shallow’ dips would themselves seem a respectable mountain range … Our path sloped to level stretches of thirsty pasture and withered maize fields scattered with adobe hovels too far apart to be called a pueblo. A few campesinos were driving bony cows or ponies, or small flocks of sheep, to their non-grazing. From our height they seemed to be wandering aimlessly, toy figures emphasising the vastness of their world. When it rained heavily for twenty minutes we rejoiced – and shivered, for suddenly it was very cold. We often hesitated at path junctions but when we sought directions the campesinos looked blank or uneasy or sulky and nobody answered. Amidst all this drought and privation, we were moved to hear poignant bamboo pipe melodies drifting out from several hovels at 9.45 on a cold wet morning. The Indians find much comfort in their music, which has remained almost totally ‘pure’.",

    "target_paragraph": "Mohamed leapt to his feet and led us across an ancient plaza, between the visitors’ center and the temple complex. He launched into a practiced lecture, and he described what we would find inside the complex. Karnak, he explained, was the religious center of the ancient city of Thebes. The Egyptians didn’t call it Thebes then, the Greeks came up with that name much later. The complex, he explained in exquisite detail, is divided into four precincts, each dedicated to a particular god: Aten, Mut, Montu, and Amen-Ra. Amenhotep IV worshipped Aten, an obscure sun god, and built temples and shrines in his honor. He even changed his name to Akhenaten, an homage to the new religion that he, and he alone, professed. Aten’s precinct included a colonnade, courtyard, and colossal statues of the pharaoh and his queen Nefertiti. Atenism, a form of monotheism, was very unpopular among Egyptians, most of whom practiced polytheism, and the precinct was disassembled shortly after Akhenaten died. Mohamed also described the other three precincts in great detail. He rattled off names, dates, occupations, and features like a walking encyclopedia. I listened and scribbled notes while Teresa skimmed our guidebook to confirm the details. Mohamed spoke and walked quickly. Teresa and I had trouble matching his pace. He wasn’t in a hurry, he apologized, there was just a lot to see.",

Tourists were scarce in Camaguey but two fat elderly Irishmen and one trim white-haired Canadian sat at this bar and had each acquired an early teenage jinetera – slim, honey-skinned, glossy-haired girls wearing very short shorts and bikini tops, expertly stroking and nuzzling their sex-peditioners. Why can’t I ever take this commonplace scene in my stride? Am I laughably out of synch with the real world? Those six were the only other customers. Then I saw Juan’s face as he came through the vine-draped entrance archway to find himself beside them. Obviously he, too, was out of synch. Grimly I remarked that we were looking at part of the cost of Cuba’s recovery from the Special Period – a part overlooked the day before as Juan dwelt on the island’s self-sufficiency.",

She had been a big woman once but now her skeleton rose, draped loosely in unpadded skin that tightened again upon a paunch almost dropsical, as though muscle and tissue had been courage or fortitude which the days or the years had consumed until only the indomitable skeleton was left rising like a ruin or a landmark above the somnolent and impervious guts, and above that the collapsed face that gave the impression of the bones themselves being outside the flesh, lifted into the driving day with an expression at once fatalistic and of a child’s astonished disappointment, until she turned and entered the house again and closed the door.",

The poor taste of the people was corrected, and Tancred Auguste became their ruler. The sight of the explosion must have affected him deeply if rumor is true that he took to talking to himself. Also, they say he disliked to pass the ruins and avoided doing so until one day he attended a wedding and the carriages were passing the ruins before he realized it. The sight of the tragic spot must have touched his compassion too deeply, for he began to mutter aloud and almost left the carriage. At any rate, the palace food proved too rich for him, for less than a year after he had taken office he died of a digestive disturbance that his enemies called poison. So God must have changed His mind about him also. And while he was being buried, even before his body left the Cathedral for the cemetery, the mourners heard shots being fired from different parts of the City of Port-au-Prince. The successor to Tancred Auguste was being “elected.”",

I took to relaxing in the sauna of a five-star hotel with a copy of Business Week only three years old, and to inching through the side streets on a Saturday night in a ’72 Chevy, which gave out at every corner, all the warning lights on its dashboard flashing at once and parts of the car rolling around beneath me while the radio throbbed, “Gonna take you into the danger zone!” And as I started to talk to foreign experts on the place, I began to find that Paraguay was a kind of cult favorite among many old Latin American hands, the hidden (costume) jewel of South America. “Oh, Paraguay, my favorite country in the continent!” said Laura López, the longtime Time bureau chief for the whole of South and Central America. She liked it? “I love it—the way you’d love an orphan, or a bird with a broken foot.” Paraguay was something of an Ur-land, untamed, undeveloped, abandoned by history, wood-paneled streetcars still clattering through its streets, and electricity and running water arriving only a president ago. “It’s a crazy country, wistful and surreal and forlorn,” said a highly engaging American journalist who had lived there for three years. “But it’s magical—like Macondo in Gabriel García Márquez.” “The air is so pure,” added her husband, a Spanish writer. “And the streets are full of orange trees and jacarandas and lapachos. When you arrive in Stroessner Airport, you feel as if you are in one of the last corners of the world.”",
