He knew them, felt them, lived among them with a familiarity that had no need of sight or word or speech. And the memory of that house and of his silent fellowship with all the people there was somehow mixed with an image of dark time. It was one of those sorrowful and unchanging images which, among all the blazing stream of images that passed constantly their stream of fire across his mind, was somehow fixed, detached, and everlasting, full of a sorrow, certitude, and mystery that he could not fathom, but that wore for ever on it the old sad light of waning day – a light from which all the heat, the violence, and the substance of furious dusty day had vanished and which was itself like time, unearthly-of-the-earth, remote, detached, and everlasting.",

A black tarpaulin is tied down over a swelling load of gold. Avalanches of coal glitter blackly. As usual, painters are slung on planks across the great riverside hotels, and the hotel windows have already points of light in them. On the other side the city is white as if with age; St Paul’s swells white above the fretted, pointed, or oblong buildings beside it. The cross alone shines rosy-gilt. But what century have we reached? Has this procession from the Surrey side to the Strand gone on for ever? That old man has been crossing the Bridge these six hundred years, with the rabble of little boys at his heels, for he is drunk, or blind with misery, and tied round with old clouts of clothing such as pilgrims might have worn. He shuffles on. No one stands still. It seems as if we marched to the sound of music; perhaps the wind and the river; perhaps these same drums and trumpets—the ecstasy and hubbub of the soul. Why, even the unhappy laugh, and the policeman, far from judging the drunk man, surveys him humorously, and the little boys scamper back again, and the clerk from Somerset House has nothing but tolerance for him, and the man who is reading half a page of Lothair* at the bookstall muses charitably, with his eyes off the print, and the girl hesitates at the crossing and turns on him the bright yet vague glance of the young.",

Wherever I look,’ she continued, looking, ‘I see nothing but order and harmony in the universe. I lift my eyes unto the stars,’ she said majestically, at the same time lifting her face in a movement of rapturous contemplation toward the ceiling of the hotel lobby, ‘and feast my soul upon the infinite beauties of God’s heaven, the glorious proportion of the sidereal universe. I turn my gaze around me, and everywhere I look I see the noble works that man has fashioned, the unceasing progress he has made in his march upward from the brute, the noble aspiration of his spirit, the eternal labour of his mighty intellect towards a higher purpose, the radiant beauty of his countenance in which all the highest ardours of his soul may be discerned!’",

I went back to Varuna, penned a note and went out for ceviche with a kindly ship agent named Adrian who had adopted me soon after my arrival. Together, as we feasted on the spicy raw fish, Adrian shared with me his knowledge of the canal, and he gave me the book The Path Between the Seas, which recounted the story of the canal from beginning to end. As we ambled back to Varuna, I saw Luc waiting on the dock. “We must be ready at five in the morning,” he said. “I come for you with my dinghy.”",

    "target_paragraph": "The Moonlight Sonata tinkled away; the waltz crashed. Although young men still went in and out, they walked as if keeping engagements. Now and then there was a thud, as if some heavy piece of furniture had fallen, unexpectedly, of its own accord, not in the general stir of life after dinner. One supposed that young men raised their eyes from their books as the furniture fell. Were they reading? Certainly there was a sense of concentration in the air. Behind the grey walls sat so many young men, some undoubtedly reading, magazines, shilling shockers, no doubt; legs, perhaps, over the arms of chairs; smoking; sprawling over tables, and writing while their heads went round in a circle as the pen moved—simple young men, these, who would—but there is no need to think of them grown old; others eating sweets; here they boxed; and, well, Mr Hawkins must have been mad suddenly to throw up his window and bawl: ‘Jo—seph! Jo—seph!’ and then he ran as hard as ever he could across the court, while an elderly man, in a green apron, carrying an immense pile of tin covers, hesitated, balanced, and then went on. But this was a diversion. There were young men who read, lying in shallow armchairs, holding their books as if they had hold in their hands of something that would see them through; they being all in a torment, coming from midland towns, clergymen’s sons. Others read Keats. And those long histories in many volumes—surely someone was now beginning at the beginning in order to understand the Holy Roman Empire,* as one must. That was part of the concentration, though it would be dangerous on a hot spring night—dangerous, perhaps, to concentrate too much upon single books, actual chapters, when at any moment the door opened and Jacob appeared; or Richard Bonamy, reading Keats no longer, began making long pink spills from an old newspaper, bending forward, and looking eager and contented no more, but almost fierce. Why? Only perhaps that Keats died young—one wants to write poetry too and to love—oh, the brutes! It’s damnably difficult. But, after all, not so difficult if on the next staircase, in the large room, there are two, three, five young men all convinced of this—of brutality, that is, and the clear division between right and wrong. There was a sofa, chairs, a square table, and the window being open, one could see how they sat—legs issuing here, one there crumpled in a corner of the sofa; and, presumably, for you could not see him, somebody stood by the fender, talking. Anyhow, Jacob, who sat astride a chair and ate dates from a long box, burst out laughing. The answer came from the sofa corner; for his pipe was held in the air, then replaced. Jacob wheeled round. He had something to say to that, though the sturdy red-haired boy at the table seemed to deny it, wagging his head slowly from side to side; and then, taking out his penknife, he dug the point of it again and again into a knot in the table, as if affirming that the voice from the fender spoke the truth—which Jacob could not deny. Possibly, when he had done arranging the date-stones, he might find something to say to it—indeed his lips opened—only then there broke out a roar of laughter.",

One poster advertised: “F. U. Ramsay presents Tulsi Ramsay and Shyam Ramsay’s Saamri, with photography by Gangu Ramsay.” Another show was made by Ramesh Sippy, assisted by Vijay Sippy and Al Sippy and produced by G. R. Sippy (none of them, of course, related to Romu Sippy, the producer I met who financed movies directed by his brother). In Rajasthan a pair of voluble rickshaw drivers started reciting the names of the First Family of Indian cinema (their Redgraves or Carradines) as if they were the thousand names of God: “Shashi Kapoor, Shammi Kapoor, Anil Kapoor, Raj Kapoor” (mercifully, they left out Tiger Kapoor, as well as Prithviraj Kapoor, the patriarch of the clan, whose image was shown, reverentially, before every one of Shashi and Raj Kapoor’s movies). And so the list went on indefinitely—Satyajit Ray begat the director Sandip Ray, Dharmendra begat Sunny Deol, and Lata Mangeshkar’s only rival, and possible successor, as the voice of India, was her sister, Asha Bhosle. After Dimple Kapadia struck it rich as a seventeen-year-old actress, up popped a look-alike sister called Simple Kapadia. Before long, one of my young cousins dryly remarked, there would doubtless be a Pimple Kapadia.",

But Sergei had something better in mind. There was a guy he had heard about who had his own train car. The guy, a short, dark-haired, bushy-eyebrowed, villainous-looking party, appeared at the loading ramp surrounded by a small entourage. Yes, he did have his own vagon—a long, windowless boxcar with room inside for four ordinary-sized vehicles. This vagon represented the high end of Chernyshevsk vehicle transports. Sergei negotiated to ensure that our van would be one of the lucky four, and the guy agreed, for $200.",

Nearby was a rich inventory of caribou pellets and, in increasing quantity as we moved downhill, blueberries—an outspreading acreage of blueberries. Fedeler stopped walking. He touched my arm. He had in an instant become even more alert than he usually was, and obviously apprehensive. His gaze followed straight on down our intended course. What he saw there I saw now. It appeared to me to be a hill of fur. “Big boar grizzly,” Fedeler said in a near-whisper. The bear was about a hundred steps away, in the blueberries, grazing. The head was down, the hump high. The immensity of muscle seemed to vibrate slowly —to expand and contract, with the grazing. Not berries alone but whole bushes were going into the bear. He was big for a barren-ground grizzly. The brown bears of Arctic Alaska (or grizzlies; they are no longer thought to be different) do not grow to the size they will reach on more ample diets elsewhere. The barren-ground grizzly will rarely grow larger than six hundred pounds.",

Unlike more traditional versions, such as the one we had at Daphne’s, Jane’s is a creamed soup, and completely vegetarian. She came out of the kitchen after lunch and was happy to share her recipe—in reality, a skeleton of a recipe that I developed with a little trial and error. I borrowed the decadent crabmeat-and-cream garnish from another version that we also loved.\nA swizzle stick—like the one Ed gave us for mixing ’ti punch—is traditionally used to “purée” the callaloo. An electric hand mixer will give you the same texture. You can also use a blender or food processor, although this will create a smoother soup.\nAnd if you can’t find callaloo, Jane suggested spinach as a fine substitute.\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n1 large onion, chopped\n1 clove garlic, chopped\n1 stalk celery, with leaves, chopped\n1 small cubanelle or green bell pepper, chopped\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\n1 bunch callaloo, ribs removed and leaves chopped, or about 1 pound spinach, large stems removed\n2 cups evaporated milk\n1 cup (approx.) vegetable stock or water\n4 whole cloves\nDash hot sauce\nSqueeze lemon juice\n1 cup cooked crabmeat\n1⁄4 cup heavy cream or crème fraîche\n1. In a heavy saucepan, heat oil. Add onion, garlic, celery, and pepper and cook over medium heat until softened but not brown.\n2. Sprinkle with thyme and season with salt and pepper. Add chopped callaloo or spinach and stir to combine. Add evaporated milk, stock, or water, and cloves, and cook over low heat for about 45 minutes.\n3. Remove cloves. Purée soup until fairly smooth. (There should still be distinct pieces of callaloo or spinach.)\n4. If soup is too thick, thin with additional milk, stock, or water. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding a dash of hot sauce and a squeeze of lemon as desired.\n5. Pour soup into warm bowls. Sprinkle 1⁄4 cup crabmeat on each, and swirl in a spoonful of cream.\nServes 4",

The place was shady and cool, insects were minimal and not carnivorous; though I didn’t have a view of anything, waiting for aid wouldn’t kill me. Patience. No one came along. Since it had not rained any day on our long journey, I had forgotten the floods. I had also forgotten a newspaper story, casually noticed in Nairobi, about excessive floods in the Amboseli and airlifting stranded rhinos out of the water. The details of that improbable job made no impression and only now, as the solitary hours passed, I began to think that perhaps others knew more than I did and were giving Amboseli a miss. Perhaps the unusual rains accounted for this baby canyon, an earlier torrent having cut away the ground. I ate my picnic lunch.",

I sat up in my hollow and looked across to the huts. The bathing woman in the usual white calico sunbonnet was there, waiting on the plank bridge. No one was in the sea yet. It was a great bore that there should be any one else bathing just then, for German female tourists are apt to be extraordinarily cordial in the water. On land, laced into suppressive whalebone, dressed, and with their hair dry and curled, they cannot but keep within the limits set by convention; but the more clothes they take off the more do they seem to consider the last barrier between human creature and human creature broken down, and they will behave towards you, meeting you on this common ground of wateriness, as though they had known you and extravagantly esteemed you for years. Their cordiality, too, becomes more pronounced in proportion to the coldness and roughness of the water; and the water that day looked cold and was certainly rough, and I felt that there being only two of us in it it would be impossible to escape the advances of the other one. Still, as the cells were shut at five, I could not wait till she had done, so I went down and began to undress.",

    "target_paragraph": "Ed is 6′2″. I am 5′4″. He takes the ceiling I take the floor. Biology is destiny—but which is better? He actually loves finishing the beams. Painting the brick ceiling is less fun but is rewarding. Suddenly the gunky beams and flaking ceiling are transformed into dark substantial beams, pristine white-brick ceiling. The room is defined. Painting goes quickly with the big brushes made of wild boar hair. Pure white walls—white on plaster is whiter than any other white. As each room is finished, my job is to paint the battiscopa, a six-inch-high gray strip along the bases of the walls, a kind of pseudo-moulding that is traditional in old houses of this area. Usually it’s a brick color but we prefer the lighter touch. The word means broom-hit. The darker paint doesn’t show the marks of the mops and brooms that must constantly pass over these floors. Almost upside down, I measure six inches in several places, tape the floor and wall, then quickly paint and pull off the tape. Naturally, the tape pulls off some white paint, which then has to be retouched. Twelve rooms, four walls each, plus the stairwell, landings, and entrance. We’re leaving the stone cantina as is. Next, I decalcify the floor. The first step is to sweep up all the large chunks and dirt, then vacuum. With a special solution I spread, the residue from dirt, plaster, and paint drippings is dissolved. After that, I rinse the floor with a wet mop three times, the middle time with a mild soap solution. I’m on my knees. Next: mop again with water and a little muriatic acid. Rinse, then paint the floor with linseed oil, letting it soak in and dry. After it dries for two days, I wax. On the floor again, char style. My knees, totally unused to this, rebel and I suppress groans when I stand up. Last step: buff with soft cloth. The floors come back, rich and dark and shiny. Each room pops into place, looking very much as they did when we bought the house, only now the beams are right and the radiators are in place. “Brutto,” ugly, I said to the plumber when I saw them. “Yes,” he replied, “but beautiful in winter.”",

We arrived at the police station to find the windows shuttered and the door locked. It was ten o’clock in the morning. We knocked and waited.

The tinkling of voices carried softly on the languid breeze. The bastards were actually happy! Well, why not? They could just weigh anchor and sail away whenever they pleased, something we had taken for granted a few days earlier. I still remember wishing that we could trade places and just sail away while they were left up here in the hot, stinking rocks. It wasn’t a charitable thought and I quickly let it go.

He was a wealthy cattle herder with four thousand head of cattle. One summer while he was away grazing his herd on the Aegean plains, a band of rogues broke into his house and raped his wife and killed her, along with the young daughter. Someone got the news to him. He sold his cattle on the spot, gathered a band of trusty friends, and went on a mission of revenge. His band killed the guilty men, but then he couldn’t stop – he took to brigandage with such gusto that they started robbing and murdering all and sundry. The Sultan finally put a price on his head and when the army went after him, the brigand disbanded his men and skipped north to the Balkan range where the authorities couldn’t be bothered to look for him. He established himself in a place called Eagle’s Nest and remarried.",
