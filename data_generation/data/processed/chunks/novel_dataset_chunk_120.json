T. Jones. D. T.--sometimes known more familiarly as Delirium Tremens--was also a philosopher. And the moment I saw him approaching I knew that D. T. was in the throes. He came from a family of Primitive Baptists, and he was red-haired, gaunt, and angular, and now as he came towards me everything about him--hair, eyebrows, eyelids, eyes, freckles, even his large and bony hands--shone forth in the sunlight with an excessive and almost terrifying redness.",

She sat quiet, her lips parted by the stress of the ascent, her eyes wandering peacefully over the broken ranges of the landscape. Selden stretched himself on the grass at her feet, tilting his hat against the level sun-rays, and clasping his hands behind his head, which rested against the side of the rock. He had no wish to make her talk; her quick-breathing silence seemed a part of the general hush and harmony of things. In his own mind there was only a lazy sense of pleasure, veiling the sharp edges of sensation as the September haze veiled the scene at their feet. But Lily, though her attitude was as calm as his, was throbbing inwardly with a rush of thoughts. There were in her at the moment two beings, one drawing deep breaths of freedom and exhilaration, the other gasping for air in a little black prison-house of fears. But gradually the captive’s gasps grew fainter, or the other paid less heed to them: the horizon expanded, the air grew stronger, and the free spirit quivered for flight.",

I also read, ate Valentina’s good cooking, walked. Growing tired of my leaky Junior Outdoorsman tent, I asked Ivan if he had room for me in his tent, and he said sure. His was a two-man Russian army model of heavy canvas, which he had floored with furs artfully piled one upon another so that when you lay down your head was higher than your feet. It’s still the most comfortable tent I ever slept in. Another storm came, and the Russian flag he had erected on the beach nearby cracked like a whip as the wind swept by. I read by flashlight in the tent and drifted off.",

Please leave me here”). As we walked past the hotel gift shop, Joe let out a cry, and pointed to a picture of Deng Xiaoping on the cover of a glossy magazine: we went in to take a closer look, and there, to my companions’ delight and my amazement, was a Time cover story on China that I had written before leaving New York three months earlier. Impressed by this, my friends led me up to a lobby filled with huge armchairs, and as we munched on a selection of French pastries, they asked me to describe my impressions of a homeland that was still a little strange to them. In response, I rhapsodized at length about the sunlit lamaseries of Tibet, talked a little about the capital and then, by way of amusing parenthesis, mentioned some of the quirks of the fabled Black Coffee. At that instant, I happened to look across at Joe, my all-knowing guide to every deal in China. He was looking absolutely stunned. I stopped what I was saying. For many moments, he could not speak. Finally, he went on shakily: You mean that there were prostitutes there? I think so, I said; indeed, a colleague of mine had once been approached by a male prostitute on the streets of Shanghai. That left Joe quite devastated.",

How knowing it all was, the thrill, the attachment, the indignation, the Protestant malaise. Here Caesar fell, they said to themselves, holding his toga close for modesty; here splashed the blood of the martyrs, and the captive kings walked beneath the yoke; here or there the sunset is most peculiarly Roman—they knew what they were talking about; and Stendhal could be content for days to keep coming on still another canvas by “le divin Guercin.” It is delightful to think of them all.",

Peter spent ten years on Robben Island (1980– 90) and is now Peace Co-ordinator for the Western Cape. This oddly named job involves him in the worst township crises and requires patience, tact and extraordinary courage. Just now his main worry is a renewal of taxi warfare. Most Cape taxis wear a large blue-and-white sticker depicting a flying dove. (You avoid any that don’t.) This means the association concerned signed the truce ending the 1989–92 taxi war between Lagunya and Webta, a war that began as fierce competition for the most profitable routes but soon came to be manipulated by criminal factions from Crossroads and Khayelitsha. Within six months, in 1991, it led to sixty-seven murders, the burning of countless shacks and more than a million rands’ worth of damage to vehicles. The Rand, too, has its taxi wars; one such caused the murders of more than fifty people in 1990.",

The group of pemangkus prays in front of the masks. The lights go out. The three dancers silently enter the courtyard from the inner temple, maskless and dancing slowly and deliberately. They ascend the ramp to the platform and don their masks. They hold a short conversation in Kawi. The sekan barong takes up burning torches and gasoline pressure lanterns and heads for the cemetery, the three mask box bearers in the lead, most of the villagers following. The three dancers stop briefly at the main crossroads, then proceed to the center of a large circle that the villagers have formed in the cemetery, with the three mask boxes in the center. Again there is a long conversation between Rangda and Rarung in Kawi. All three masks are removed, and the entire group moves to the jeroan of the Pura Dalem. Here Sopir and his assistants cut the masks off the headdresses and put everything away. The dancers put on their regular clothes. All pray.",

The upper deck is crammed with passengers who have staked out plots on the hot metal floor by laying out plastic groundsheets and creating small shelters from baskets, buckets and burlap sacks of vegetables. The ticket I bought in Rangoon entitles me to inhabit plot #59 for the day-long journey to Myaungmya. Plot #59 is a piece of the deck about half the size of a suitcase, and when I find it I carefully arrange myself so that both I and my bag fit compactly within its faded white lines. But the hush of the river and the still, pre-monsoon air have a soporific effect on all of us, and any initial attempts at tidiness are soon abandoned. Sleepy legs slide off groundsheets, and drowsy bodies droop themselves languidly across bags and railings.",

In the centre one leans over a waist-high wall, also circular, to look far down into a dim cellar-like space surrounded by grey pillars, squat and square. There a granite cenotaph commemorates all who died during the Great Trek. At noon on 16 December, through an aperture in the remote dome, a sunray falls on an Afrikaans inscription. (Translation – ‘We for thee, South Africa.’) According to Riana Heyman’s 1986 booklet, this ray ‘symbolises God’s blessing on the work and aspirations of the Voortrekkers … The Monument was built as a tribute to those who brought civilisation to the interior. Order, geometrical precision and symmetry are therefore basic to its design.’ One page contains seven references to this ‘bringing of civilisation’. And we are informed that ‘the black wildebeest symbolises both the barbarism that yielded to civilisation and Dingane’s warriors’.",

The Transkei is superbly unpredictable. That climb led not to a pass but to the first of a series of high, broad ridges – all overpopulated. Probably many of the children seen here have been left with granny by young single mothers struggling for survival in urban townships where caring for a baby would be impossible. Not that these rural children have much to look forward to; some thin little faces are old – hunger-lined – some kwashiorkor bellies are grossly swollen.",

I’d gotten it in my head that election day would be my chance to witness Democracy In Action, but perhaps because we were so early, the line at the poll consisted of four people above the age of sixty-five. While Andrei registered, I walked across the empty room and sat at a table. A Russian flag hung on one wall; full-color posters of photographs and biographies of the presidential and mayoral candidates were tacked on another. Andrei soon joined me at the table, clutching his empty ballot. No way could I pass an opportunity to cast a Verdict on Democracy: I swiped the sheet of paper away from him, checked off Yeltsin for president and Luzhkov for mayor, and dropped it in the ballot box myself. (Only in retrospect did this disturb me. If I was able to vote in place of a Russian citizen at a polling station, it isn’t hard to imagine others doing it, too.)",

Once all were assembled, we'd set off for a very late breakfast, usually taken in one of the many British owned bars, showing violent action movies such as 'The Warriors,' or some gory horror flick like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' At around 7 pm we'd return to the hotel to 'get ready.' (Young men in the late eighties tended to cultivate elaborate hair styles, which required some serious groundwork before a night on the town). Ghetto blasters would be positioned on the balcony, considerately sharing our 'sounds' with other holidaymakers, and that patron saint of Spanish holidays, San Miguel, would be liberated from the room's ancient fridge to ease us into the evening. At around 10pm we'd head out, generally only walking a few feet before being coaxed into some neon-lit establishment by a bronzed cockney 'PR' rep with a permed mullet hair-do, assuring us of lethal Happy Hour measures of chemical grade spirits, and a surplus of inebriated members of the opposite sex.",

We had, after all, just driven thirteen hundred miles in two and a half days. If ever anyone was entitled to a little desert R&R it was us.

But an underground is said to exist, and I met a former member who now lives in exile in Thailand. He was involved in the protests during 1988, and when he learned that the Military Intelligence had plans to arrest him in the ensuing crackdown he ran. Instead of fleeing the country, as many thousands of students did, he went underground, spending some eight years trying to mobilize action against the government and engage people in politics. He described to me the immense difficulty of creating a space, be it mental or physical, which exists outside the government’s control.",

He laboriously crossed two dust ruts, the wheels squeaking indignantly at the encounter, and then with a terrifying expression he gave the steering-gear a final wrench and deposited self and car approximately in front of the Happer steps.

He strained to catch the faintest lingering echoes; for a moment the memory lulled him into peace; but soon it failed, and he paced the room so hungry for the sound to come again that he was conscious of no other desire left in life. She had gone without speaking; abruptly a chasm had been cut in his course, down which the tide of his being plunged in disorder; fell upon rocks; flung itself to destruction. The distress had an effect of physical ruin and disaster. He trembled; he was white; he felt exhausted, as if by a great physical effort. He sank at last into a chair standing opposite her empty one, and marked, mechanically, with his eye upon the clock, how she went farther and farther from him, was home now, and now, doubtless, again with Rodney. But it was long before he could realize these facts; the immense desire for her presence churned his senses into foam, into froth, into a haze of emotion that removed all facts from his grasp, and gave him a strange sense of distance, even from the material shapes of wall and window by which he was surrounded. The prospect of the future, now that the strength of his passion was revealed to him, appalled him.",

The farther downriver we went, the more streams ran into it, and the wider, deeper, and more powerful it became. Walking in the river was very difficult, more so for me because the wound on my hand was still painful. We chose each step carefully. Progress was slow. We came upon deep pools and waterfalls and had no choice but to climb up into the jungle and hack our way through the foliage until we came to a place where the river was shallow again.",

The Begich is still very much alive; it was getting a new boiler and a fresh paint job in cheerful pastel colors when I was there. The exterior could pass for one of the nicest buildings in Pyongyang; the interior is a 1950s time capsule. (The pink bathroom in the condo I rented was nearly identical to the one in my grandmother’s ranch-style house, except for the earthquake crack in one wall.) The Begich is also famous for being self-contained, and is home to not only most of Whittier’s population but its post office (where I inquired about sending a package Priority Mail and also the location of the laundry room), police department, mayor’s office, and medical clinic, plus a mini-mart and, in the basement, a church. The building is connected underground to Whittier’s school, to shield children from the snow and wind. In winter, it isn’t uncommon for everyone to stay inside for days at a time. Begich Towers is perhaps one-eighth occupied?it was built to house a thousand people, and Whittier’s current population is just over two hundred?and even on a busy day it’s eerily empty. One resident I met said she frequently runs for half an hour up and down its staircases and hallways without seeing anyone.",

He would read often six hours into the night; and when they came to him for orders about the slaughtering of cattle or the harvesting of wheat, he would push away his folio and look as if he did not understand what was said to him. This was bad enough and wrung the hearts of Hall, the falconer, of Giles, the groom,* of Mrs Grimsditch, the housekeeper, of Mr Dupper, the chaplain. A fine gentleman like that, they said, had no need of books. Let him leave books, they said, to the palsied or the dying. But worse was to come. For once the disease of reading has laid upon the system it weakens it so that it falls an easy prey to that other scourge which dwells in the inkpot and festers in the quill. The wretch takes to writing. And while this is bad enough in a poor man, whose only property is a chair and a table set beneath a leaky roof—for he has not much to lose, after all—the plight of a rich man, who has houses and cattle, maid-servants, asses and linen, and yet writes books, is pitiable in the extreme. The flavour of it all goes out of him; he is riddled by hot irons; gnawed by vermin. He would give every penny he has (such is the malignity of the germ) to write one little book and become famous; yet all the gold in Peru will not buy him the treasure of a well-turned line. So he falls into consumption and sickness, blows his brains out, turns his face to the wall. It matters not in what attitude they find him. He has passed through the gates of Death and known the flames of Hell.",

We go, some of us, to places where we can live, for a few weeks, by candlelight; we pick up a novel by a Chinese woman in San Francisco who reports that her mother saw the whistling of the wind as a wailing from her old nursemaid in Shanghai, many decades ago. Gods and ancestors are all mixed up in the old cultures—where grandmothers may be taken, as much as deer, to be messengers from somewhere else; a belief in ghosts, the shrine by the boom box says, is just, in effect, a way of having faith in what you can’t actually see.",

Rain; a dripping in the pool; little trees and plants well cared for; a Cosmatesque band around over the small arcade, not conspicuous. It is one of the smallest cloisters and after Michelangelo’s the best, without the variety of columns of the famous ones; these are all identical. In the big squares of the porch above, more plants and some nuns’ washing hung out; in a tiny round ruined chapel off the cloister, four chunks of Corinthian cornice hanging in the air, in the dark. It is a place, slowly, of extraordinary joy:—temptation? cowardice? fatigue of intellect? You are aware at the same time of the material of the nuns’ underwear, the cold in the halls in winter, the supreme selfishness of the abrogation of self. Yet the joy is more if you did not come from any failure and satiety; you were not tired of anything, not possessed or impressed by inadequacies in your own conduct or the world’s; your senses were never less tired. Everything is vibrant, and a gladness, of which the form for that little while is the contemplation for the rest of life of one small point in the world’s manifestations, to be known without distraction always, until death. You have known the release of the prisoner, from appearances. And if Christ and dogma were to serve for this, would it matter?. . . Whatever matters or happens, you have touched the quietness there is in all Rome, that has been built into it not only by monks and such, by many others too, poets and wonderers, building into the city from their solitudes this solid element, like the stone of its columns, its other permanence. They have walked there, thought, prayed, moved slowly in some small circle till they died and their faces perhaps in stone on the church floors were slowly trodden away, leaving a communal indestructible glory that informs even the marble and the gold.",

In 1680, Glacier Bay?today more than ten miles wide in some parts and more than a thousand feet deep?does not exist. Its upper two-thirds are covered by ice, and its lower third is a green valley bisected by a stream. By 1750, at the peak of the Little Ice Age’s effects in Glacier Bay, the ice has marched all the way down to the mouth of today’s bay and beyond, extending into Icy Strait. According to Tlingit oral history, Kim told me, the ice had advanced “as fast as a limping dog could run.” (Similar, more scientific, observations were also recorded in 1950 for the Muldrow Glacier, on Denali, which surged more than a thousand feet in a single day.)",

There was no distance and no horizon; there was only this howling welter of sea and sky in which that ship was struggling like an alien presence—in a hell of waters that smoked and boiled, and sent her into deep valleys and rushed down upon her terribly from great heights, that poised her on the Alpine peaks of waves, then fell away below her with the speed of an express train, as if the bottom had fallen from the universe and the sea was plunging down through space. The water was thick and green, and hissing with sheets of foam; and farther off it was grey-black and cold and vicious, and the tops of waves exploded into windy white.

    "target_paragraph": "The Burrell Collection is named for Sir William Burrell, a local shipping magnate who in 1944 left the city his art collection on the understanding that it be placed in a country setting within the city boundaries. He was worried—not unreasonably—about air pollution damaging his art works. Unable to decide what to do with this sumptuous windfall, the city council did, astonishingly, nothing. For the next thirty-nine years, some truly exceptional works of art lay crated away in warehouses, all but forgotten. Finally in the late 1970s, after nearly four decades of dithering, the city engaged a gifted architect named Barry Gasson, who designed a trim and restrained building noted for its airy rooms set against a woodland backdrop, and for the ingenious way architectural features from Burrell’s collection—medieval doorways and lintels and the like—were incorporated into the fabric of the building. It opened in 1983 to widespread acclaim.",

Delhi suddenly blossomed with little encampments: every traffic island had someone fasting to death; every day a new pressure group would march on Parliament. You could see them trotting along in a great crocodile, banners held aloft, or else sitting sweating under canopies in Rajpath: there were the teachers and the Tibetans, the blood donors and the dog owners; once, to Balvinder Singh’s delight, there was even a delegation of prostitutes from G.B.

His cousin Clare Dagonet, for instance: there had been a summer when her voice had sounded far down the windings . . . but he had run over to Spain for the autumn, and when he came back she was engaged to Peter Van Degen, and for a while it looked black in the cave. That was long ago, as time is reckoned under thirty; and for three years now he had felt for her only a half-contemptuous pity.
