No mention of Mr Kak’s visit was made that day or on subsequent days; and I learned of the outcome of his visit only when Mr Butt, accompanied by the secretary of the All Shikara Workers Union, came into my room one morning to ask me to type out the ‘particulars’ of the hotel for inclusion in the Tourist Office’s register of hotels. I had failed; even my final cowardice was irrelevant. Mr Butt was smiling; he was a happy man. Dutifully, I began to type.",

The weather had improved—as had, finally, Bartlett’s eyes—and for the first time since leaving Emma Town, he took in sweeping panoramic vistas of the wild country. The hills near the bay rose gradually, then flattened to immense plateaus, great expanses of ice and snow and stone. Between the flat, fast ice and the rises and descents into and out of the frozen bays, they averaged about five miles an hour. Bartlett rode along, taking it all in, marveling at the skill of the dog drivers as they navigated a severe decline into the mouth of the bay. The dogs ran well on the ice, and they crossed the bay over to the southern shore, where they climbed another steep grade and followed the mainland for some twenty miles until they reached a cluster of yarangas. Here they ate, and afterward Bartlett stripped from his soaked furs and wrapped himself in a warm, dry reindeer-skin robe provided by the hosts and then slept for a few hours.",

It was rather a sense, a quality as of the light itself, a reflection as of light itself from the massed faces below, refracted upward into the room through the open windows like light from disturbed water, pulsing and quivering faintly and constantly on the ceiling where nobody, not even the clerks and secretaries coming and going steadily on their endless minuscule errands, would notice it without they chanced to look up, unless like now, when something had caused the pulse to beat a little faster, so that when the division commander and the chief-of-staff entered, everyone in the room was looking at the door. Though almost as soon as they entered, that too died away and the refraction merely quivered again.",

Yet it was already hard for him to visualize the heart-whole boy who had stepped off the transport, passionately desiring the adventure of life. One night while the heat, overpowering and enervating, poured into the windows of his room he struggled for several hours in a vague effort to immortalize the poignancy of that time.\nThe February streets, wind-washed by night, blow full of strange half-intermittent damps, bearing on wasted walks in shining sight wet snow plashed into gleams under the lamps, like golden oil from some divine machine, in an hour of thaw and stars.\nStrange damps—full of the eyes of many men, crowded with life borne in upon a lull. . . . Oh, I was young, for I could turn again to you, most finite and most beautiful, and taste the stuff of half-remembered dreams, sweet and new on your mouth.\n. . . There was a tanging in the midnight air—silence was dead and sound not yet awoken—Life cracked like ice!—one brilliant note and there, radiant and pale, you stood . . . and spring had broken. (The icicles were short upon the roofs and the changeling city swooned.)\nOur thoughts were frosty mist along the eaves; our two ghosts kissed, high on the long, mazed wires—eerie half-laughter echoes here and leaves only a fatuous sigh for young desires; regret has followed after things she loved, leaving the great husk.",

What I really wanted was a little Italian place on a side street—the kind with checked tablecloths and Chianti bottles with candles and a nice 1950s feel about it. British cities used to abound in these places, but they are deucedly hard to find now. I walked for some distance, but the only restaurants I could find were either the kind of national chain with big plastic menus and dismal food or hotel dining rooms where you had to pay £17.95 for three courses of pompous description and overcooked disappointment. Eventually I ended up in Chinatown, which announces itself to the world with a big colorful arch and then almost immediately loses heart. There was a scattering of restaurants among big office buildings, but I can’t say I felt as if I had wandered into a little corner of the Orient. The bigger, better-looking restaurants were packed, so I ended up going to some upstairs place, where the decor was tatty, the food barely OK, and the service totally indifferent.",

They had opposite corners but even at that the two mattresses were not fifteen feet apart, so Wilbourne and Charlotte could not even talk, whisper. It meant less to the Buckners though, even though they seemed to have little enough of preliminary talking and whispering to do; at times and with the lamp not five minutes dark Wilbourne and Charlotte would hear the abrupt stallion-like surge from the other bed, the violent blanket-muffled motion ceasing into the woman’s panting moans and at times a series of pure screams tumbling over one another, though such was not for them. Then one day the thermometer reversed itself from fourteen below to forty-one below and they moved the two mattresses together and slept as a unit, the two women in the middle, and still sometimes before the light was scarcely out (or perhaps they would be wakened by it) there would come the ruthless stallion crash with no word spoken, as if they had been drawn violently and savagely to one another out of pure slumber like steel and magnet, the fierce breathing, the panting and shuddering woman-moans, and Charlotte saying, “Cant you all do that without pulling the covers loose?” and still it was not for them.",

Pitched battles between the Royal Navy and pirate fleets were not uncommon, and while pirate commanders could be unbelievably bloodthirsty, sometimes they saw themselves in a romantic light – ‘Chief of the Sea Squadron’, proclaimed the banner flying from the masthead of one such nineteenth-century bravo, ‘who takes from the rich and not from the poor’. As late as the 1930s the steamers for Guangzhou and other China ports went to sea with their superstructures fortified with barbed wire, machine-guns mounted on their bridges and passengers locked in their cabins. The last pirates were driven from these waters only when the Communists took over the mainland harbours, and by then the tradition had diversified: it was in the skies between Hong Kong and Macao, in 1948, that a Hong Kong-owned Catalina flying-boat became the first aircraft to be hijacked – four armed pirates took it over, but in a struggle the pilot was shot, the aircraft crashed, and twenty-six people were killed.",

He throws his boots inside, hangs the clothes, slaps his hands together, and says to my guest, “I don’t care what she does when I’m gone, but I’m back. She wasn’t expecting me.”",

I got a big basket and laid on a fall-back position with the Airforce if worst came to worst which it did. The little cat was terrified by the basket prison and scratched and howled and betrayed itself. PanAmerican refused to carry a cat.

The great tidal fluctuation of brief visitors – businessmen, salesmen, newly wedded couples on their honeymoons, people from small towns out for a spree or a week or two of bright-light gaiety – which swarmed in unceasing movements in and out of the city, had scarcely touched the life of the Leopold. The hotel, set in a quarter of the city that was a little remote from the great business and pleasure districts, depended largely for its custom on the patronage of a ‘permanent’ clientele. It was, in short, the kind of place often referred to as ‘a quiet family hotel’– a phrase which the management of the Leopold made use of in advertising the merits of their establishment, on the hotel stationery.",

My contacts, though numerically limited, represented various social layers, from the sporadically employed victims of industrial collapse to the tourism-connected resurgent bourgeoisie to the securely employed but impoverished intelligentsia. Predictable hopes and fears were expressed, varying with an individual’s circumstances, but everyone was quietly proud of the smooth transfer of power in August 2006, seen as a reassuring measure of national stability.",

Most landowners use such acreage for grazing cattle or, if they’re fortunate, harvesting oil and gas from beneath. Out in the distance oil wells that looked like bareboned hobbyhorses pumped up the dark fluid that made diesel and gasoline possible. Gradually, the land became more and more arid closer to El Paso. Then the desert of the American southwest extended pretty much all the way to the Pacific Ocean, though our run reached only to Phoenix.",

As he passed into their gloom he saw an indistinct outline just ahead of him.

Again the outline hastily disunited and the Varnum gate slammed on one half while the other hurried on ahead of him. Ethan smiled at the discomfiture he had caused. What did it matter to Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum if they were caught kissing each other? Everybody in Starkfield knew they were engaged. It pleased Ethan to have surprised a pair of lovers on the spot where he and Mattie had stood with such a thirst for each other in their hearts; but he felt a pang at the thought that these two need not hide their happiness.",

This sounds dire but it was in fact an enormous relief, because the gale-force wind was northerly and almost cool. Taking advantage of it I pedalled on through stinging whirls of dust that reduced visibility to about twenty yards, but even this seemed a cheap price to pay for the sudden drop in the temperature.

The only place where these two species met was in the garden at breakfast, where the air was thick with lilacs and cooing doves.

About a hundred of them flew overhead, clockwise, casting quick rustling shadows over the land where the Merlot grapes ripened. In reception was a glass cabinet that sold gold-plated Zippos and individually wrapped condoms. Everyone was welcome, no questions asked, and the tourist season was all year round, except August, when the Thracian plain became so sun-baked that those who could afford it went to cool down in one of the three available seas: the Aegean, Marmara, or Black Sea.",

Four small babies peered at us over her back with their tear-stained, slightly indignant little faces. After a while they gained confidence and began to move around, wandering a few yards away and then scampering back to climb on her and tug at her ears. At 6 or 8 weeks old, their coats were greyish and fluffy, with spots showing clearly on their legs and faintly on their bellies, with long pale grey hair running from between their ears to the base of their tails. These babies were hyperactive, wrestling with each other and exploring further and further afield while their mother lay in the grass, keeping one eye on them and the other on a herd of Grant's gazelles grazing nearby.\nEach time it seemed the cubs were finally going to settle down, one of them jumped up and bounded off, or bit its mother’s ears. She was incredibly patient, until at last all four curled up in a heap and fell asleep. She sat up slowly and studied the gazelles. Moving almost imperceptibly, she rose to her feet, and with lowered head walked a few paces forward, freezing every few seconds. The gazelles grazed peacefully as she slunk closer until she was almost within striking distance. Just as it seemed inevitable that she would make a kill and I was getting ready to look away, mother’s four little helpers sat up, saw that she had moved away, and bounded merrily over to her. The herd turned and stared at her, and casually moved away. Knowing that she had been seen, she lay down again, once more a motherly playground. Poor mother, how difficult it must be for her to feed her family if they won’t let her hunt in peace.\nDedan asked whether cheetahs belong to the cat family or dog family. I remembered many years ago being told that a cheetah did not belong to the cat family, because it cannot retract its claws, making it closer to the dog. However, it seems I was wrong",

It would in any case have been unwise to eat a big meal and we were happy to sit on the shop steps, surrounded by a riot of geraniums, slowly chewing ship’s biscuits. Each hard, dry mouthful seemed a divine experience. We miss a lot, in the pampered West, by never knowing real hunger. This may sound sadistic, but I’m glad that Rachel is occasionally having to endure extreme hunger, thirst, cold, heat and exhaustion. She will never again take First World comforts and conveniences for granted. And as she herself remarked last evening, she now knows how a large percentage of the world’s population feels all the time.",

That was the predicament of two friends of mine. Call them Curly and Moe. All their savings had gone into boards that were now suddenly obsolete—beautiful but embarrassing, no longer presentable at any self-respecting surf spot. Then somebody told us about homeowners’ insurance. A stolen surfboard could be claimed, it was said, and reimbursed at the purchase price, if your parents had homeowners’ insurance. Curly and Moe were fairly sure their parents had it. Nobody was going to steal their boards—they could not have given them away—but maybe, we thought, we could ditch them, report them stolen, and they could collect enough money to buy shortboards. It was worth trying. And so we drove out into the Santa Monica Mountains, far up a fire road, then carried the two boards on a trail deep into the brush until we came to the top of a cliff. There may have been some ritual mumbling. Certainly there were some strong emotions. Moe’s board, in particular, was immaculate—a Steve Bigler signature model, the deck a pale blue tint, the rails a solid copper—and I knew that owning and riding it had been his deepest desire for years. But he and Curly each stepped to the edge of the cliff and hurled their unfashionable boards into space. They hit the rocks far below, cartwheeling, snapping, settling horribly into gnarled manzanita.",

In these correspondences, Stefansson made certain to skirt any responsibility for their mishaps and the current disarray of the expedition, citing “the worst storm for that season which I have ever seen in the North” as the reason he’d become separated from his ships. The freak storm had certainly contributed to the Karluk’s drift, but it was hardly the whole story. He managed to gloss over his dubious decision to leave the ship in the first place, instead claiming that “our expedition was so thoroughly and efficiently organized” that it was only bad luck and unpredictable “Arctic problems” that had caused their present dilemma. He conveniently left out the truth: in his hurry to depart, the wrong men and scientific equipment were on the wrong ships; they’d been ill prepared—as far as clothing was concerned—for winter; and he had not considered the very real possibility that the ships might become separated.",
