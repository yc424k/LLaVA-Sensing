Every so often something shifted in the foliage and I caught sight of an armed soldier dressed in camouflage crouching uncomfortably in the bushes. The shrill scream of a distant siren rose to a climax as a cavalcade of military motorcycles and shiny black limousines with darkened windows zoomed past me. After twenty minutes or so I arrived at the wide promenade which serves as the park’s main entrance. Still there was nothing to see. I stuck my head through the bars of the closed gate and called to a soldier who stood on the other side. He wore brand-new olive-green fatigues and gripped a rifle across his chest.",

He mostly dined with the farmers at the market-room of one of the two chief hotels, leaving her in utter solitude. Could he have seen how she made use of those silent hours he might have found reason to reverse his judgment on her quality. She read and took notes incessantly, mastering facts with painful laboriousness, but never flinching from her self-imposed task. She began the study of Latin, incited by the Roman characteristics of the town she lived in. “If I am not well-informed it shall be by no fault of my own,” she would say to herself through the tears that would occasionally glide down her peachy cheeks when she was fairly baffled by the portentous obscurity of many of these educational works.",

In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries it was believed that sin made the body opaque; were it not for sin, the soul would perceive the blaze of divine love directly. Church teaching evolves, but it is always prompted by the same irresistible urges, one of which is the desire to bathe in the light of God, another of which is to return an answering spark to the heart of God, to ignite His warmth and love.",

The grey sky hung low and our ceiling has sprung so many leaks that there is hardly space between them for charpoys, while our floor has become a milder version of the ground outside; and poor Hallam’s ceiling is even worse. Four schoolboys spent the afternoon on the roof but I fear their shovelling will have further damaged the disintegrating mud. Many Skardu households have the same problem at present.",

Walking back, against the traffic, I shrank from the noise and vibration of vehicles speeding past, very close.

These regions were seen, essentially, as wastes of spaceunkempt ground, ill-suited to agriculture, difficult going for travelersand were targeted for “improvement,” so as to turn them into productive farmland. Now, seventeenth-century “wastelands” are considered invaluable wetland ecosystems bustling with rare species, which also play significant roles in flood control and carbon sequestration.

Because it is early in the morning, I miss the ferry traffic. Altogether, traffic is distinctly lighter. I get to the top of the hill, pitifully exhausted by the meagre 114m climb, and have fantastic views. It’s then a zoom down into Lamlash with views over Holy Island, home of the Centre for World Peace and Health, a Tibetan Buddhist Retreat.

For at the airport, we encountered the package tourists who had been staying at a luxury hotel on the Chinese side of Lhasa; it did not seem a coincidence that they had been permitted to spend their last night in town (where they were paying 100 yuan a night) and had been driven to the airport only that morning, while we (who were paying 5 yuan a night on the Tibetan side of Lhasa) had been compelled to spend the night together with other improvident locals at the relatively exorbitant Airpot Hotel. Only the 30 yuan that came from every member of a captive and otherwise unremunerative audience could explain the erection of a shiny new hotel in the midst of a windswept plateau three hours from the nearest town.",

Technically, any territory in Alaska that can be reached only by plane or boat can be considered “bush,” but the sparsely populated areas in the remaining 75 percent of the state are where the bushiest bush is. Reading descriptions in the journals of the Harriman Expedition members, one can almost sense that an invisible line is being crossed once they leave Kodiak and spot the smoking peak of Mount Iliamna. No more quaint towns or breathtaking glaciers lay ahead. The mountains set back from the coast, which reach heights of six thousand to ten thousand feet, are spectacular, but less impressive if you’ve just sailed beneath eighteen-thousand-foot Mount St. Elias. These are the volcanic peaks of the Aleutian Range, formed where the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the North American Plate, causing magma to rise toward the earth’s surface. The Aleutian Range’s growth has been stunted because its mountains occasionally blow their tops off.",

He explained, with chalk on a blackboard, the simple rules for running a line with a hand level. Then he announced, \"We will now go to the instrument room and take out our equipment. You people choose your partners for the term—surveyors always work in pairs. Go ahead and divide yourselves up.\"",

But it was no longer silent. He listened; there was no sound in particular; but, as he stood looking out, the building hummed with life. There was a sudden roar of laughter; then the tinkle of a piano; then a nondescript clatter and chatter – of china partly; then again the sound of rain falling, and the gutters chuckling and burbling as they sucked up the water.

I missed Olivier and wrote down little prayers in my logbook for him to have a safe trip while, over two weeks, we covered 600 miles, inch by aching inch. My hands developed an elephant’s hide pulling the sails up and down to grab every last gasp of breeze.",

Sometimes she kept walking past the bus stop to the chapel so she could chat with Padre Jacinto, the resident monk, before six o’clock mass started. She’d try to slip into and out of the chapel without anyone seeing her. She didn’t need another negative mark on her record. Then one day when she was heading to see Padre Jacinto, she spotted him speaking with someone else. Her first impulse was to run away, but when the priest heard the click of her heels, he turned around and saw her. So did the person to whom he was speaking. Mari recognized him. She had seen his wavy hair and rugged features on one of the tuna boats. He seemed just as surprised to see her there as she was to see him. Their eyes met, and when both realized that they had come to the same forbidden place for the same reason, an understanding arose between them.",

And it was there for the asking with a fabulous and stupefying plenty, golden and embrowned. They ate stacks of buckwheat cakes, smoking hot, soaked in hunks of yellow butter, which they carved at will with a wide, free gesture from the piled prints on the table, and which they garnished with ropes of heavy black molasses, or with maple syrup. They ate big steaks for breakfast, hot from the pan and thick with onions; they ate whole melons, crammed with the ripeness of the deep-pink meat, rashers of bacon, and great platters of fried eggs, or eggs scrambled with calves brains. They helped themselves from pyramids of fruit piled up at intervals on the table—plums, peaches, apples, cherries, grapes, oranges, and bananas. They had great pitchers of thick cream to pour on everything, and they washed their hunger down with pint mugs of strong, deep-savored coffee.",

Something had happened that only happens in stories. The Arabian Nights had a picture of a lady whose head might be cut off but it wasn’t, because she went on telling a man in a turban, who was a Turk (or did they say he was Arabian?), a new story. This was a picture in that book or it was the Bible picture when we spread the illustrated Bible open on the floor, before we could read the writing. He was on the stairs, too. On the stairs, He was looking and looking and never shutting his eyes and the thorns made great drops of blood run down his face and Mama thought it was a beautiful Guido Reni.",

From four tall poles, blue and white prayer flags—the celestial colors—snap in the crisp wind, sending OM MANI PADME HUM to the ten directions. The skies are shifting, and at dusk a peak of Annapurna rises, far away over the eastern end of the valley. On recent mornings, the low mountains all around this valley have turned white.",

There were heavy draperies that gave off a faint muskiness when touched. There were white brocade tablecloths, carefully darned. For every stalk of blanched asparagus served, there appeared another battery of silverplated flatware and platters and vinaigrette sauceboats, and also another battery of “waiters”: little boys, twelve or thirteen years old, dressed in tailcoats and white gloves and taught to serve as if this small inn on an Andean precipice were Vienna under the Hapsburgs.\nI sat there for a long time. All around us the wind was sweeping the clouds off the Andes and across the savannah. Four hundred and fifty feet beneath us was the cathedral built of salt in the year 1954. This house, this pioneer democracy, built on foundations, not of rock, but blood as hard as rock. One of the little boys in white gloves picked up an empty wine bottle from a table, fitted it precisely into a wine holder, and marched toward the kitchen holding it stiffly before him, glancing covertly at the mâitre d’hôtel for approval. It seemed to me later that I had never before seen and would perhaps never again see the residuum of European custom so movingly and pointlessly observed.",

And horribly, somehow, to these odors were always added the death-evoking smells of turpentine and camphor—which were a lost memory of infancy, when his mother had taken him, a child of two, to such a room—warmth, apples, Joyner room, and all—to see his grandfather the night before he died.",

There was an expert on Chinese music called R.I.P., who dressed from dawn to midnight in a heavy forest-green poncho and a dark brown gaucho hat, and told me, somewhat airily, that he came from nowhere, but commuted between Soho and Beijing—whenever, that is, he wasn’t living in South America and there was a soi-disant free-lance photographer who had been traveling for two years without deadline or destination. There was a Cambodian refugee in a chic Parisian leather jacket and a soft sweater with sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and by his side a blowsy American redhead who confessed that eighteen months of budget traveling had cured her for life of a love for vagabondage.",

One or two stories tall, the mud brick structures, painted in light blues and beiges, had seen better days. Mohamed said the government refused to help the residents with repairs or services; they were squatters who would never leave. I later read that the Egyptian government, a decade earlier, habitually bulldozed the old buildings, forcibly relocating the residents. That was under Mubarek’s regime. I wanted to ask Mohamed if he thought things would change since the revolution, but he busily described our next stop: Deir el-Bahari (Monastery of the Sea).",

The tune said, more or less, how Eve, gathering her robes about her, stands reluctant still to let her dewy mantle fall. The herded flocks, the tune continued, in peace repose. The poor man to his cot returns, and, to the eager ears of wife and child, the simple story of his toil relates: what yield the furrow bears; and how the team the plover on the nest has spared; while Wat her courses ran; and speckled eggs in the warm hollow lay. Meanwhile the good wife on the table spreads her simple fare; and to the shepherd’s flute, from toil released, the nymphs and swains join hands and foot it on the green. Then Eve lets down her sombre tresses brown and spreads her lucent veil o’er hamlet, spire, and mead, etc., etc. And the tune repeated itself once more.",

On one long steep hill, during the hottest part of the afternoon, I walked behind a middle-aged man pushing an old man – who looked at death’s door – to the nearest hospital, ten miles away. I marvelled at the skeletal patient, his eyes glazed with suffering, being able to balance on the carrier. Then an FAO Land Cruiser overtook us, empty but for the expatriate driver who sped past, unseeing, vividly illustrating the reality of Western ‘aid’ to Africa. Hundreds of such vehicles, normally carrying only one or two expatriates, zoom around rural areas; but the locals, to whom transport would be a boon, know better than to expect a lift. Ten minutes later, near the top of the hill, a Toyota pick-up stopped and a well-dressed Tanzanian got out to rescue the old man. A front-seat passenger moved to the back and the patient – too weak to walk – was lifted into the vehicle. His son cycled on, there being no room for a bicycle in the crowded back. Following him, I mused on the manifold uses of bicycles in Africa – as carts, ambulances, bath-chairs, hearses (the rigid corpse, wrapped in sacking or bark-cloth, is laid across the carrier), as mobile dairies and dispensaries and of course as vehicles for a family outing. Later that same day I saw a father transporting two small sons on his cross-bar while his pregnant wife rode side-saddle behind him, with baby on back and toddler in lap.",

It was the house of Sergei Volkonsky, whose importance to the Decembrist movement and nobility of birth almost equaled Trubetskoy’s. The Volkonsky family descended from a prince, later a saint of the Orthodox church, who fought the Mongols in the fourteenth century; Sergei Volkonsky’s mother, Alexandra Repnina, also happened to be the tsar’s mother’s highest-ranking lady-in-waiting and closest friend. Like Ekaterina Trubetskaya, Maria, the young wife of Sergei Volkonsky, voluntarily shared his exile. Nikolai Nekrasov’s poem “Russian Women,” in praise of the Decembrist wives, compared Maria Volkonsky to a saint. Pushkin rhapsodized that her hair was more lustrous than daylight and darker than night. Tolstoy, whose mother was a Volkonsky and who came from the generation that followed the Decembrists, thought so highly of Sergei Volkonsky that he is said to have based the character of Prince Andrei Bolkonsky in War and Peace on him and to have used the letters and journals Volkonsky wrote during the Napoleonic Wars to help create the character.",
