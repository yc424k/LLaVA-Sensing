It was the last part of continental Chile to be colonized, so the wandering local tribes had a long reprieve. Ninety years ago the government encouraged settlers by granting concessions to three animal-farming companies, though these isolated settlements didn’t coalesce into villages until the 1920s. Even Coyhaique, now the capital of the Eleventh Region, wasn’t founded until the end of that decade. Sheep and cattle still constitute the economic base. Mark the fisherman had told me, ‘Civilization is a thin veneer down here.’",

My favorite of the moment concerned a German man, recently detained outside Cairns, who had arrived on a tourist visa in 1982 and spent the past seventeen years wandering on foot through the northern deserts living primarily off road-kill. I was also extremely partial to the story of a group of illegal immigrants who were brought from China on an old fishing boat, which dropped them in shallow water a hundred yards off a beach near Cairns. They were caught when one of their members, carrying a suitcase, dripping water conspicuously from sodden trousers and squelching with every step, presented himself at a newsagent’s shop and politely asked the proprietor if he would order a fleet of taxis to take him and some associates to the railroad station at Cairns. Nearly every day, it seemed, the papers had a story of arresting improbability under a Queensland dateline.",

I sat on a rock pushed there by a glacier and stared down the fjord. The ravenous midges had been joined by swarms of Alaska’s state bird, the mosquito, and both swirled around my head like commas and periods in the sort of bad punctuation nightmare a grammarian might have after eating hallucinogenic rye grass.",

He is a young schoolmaster, sel­dom in the village except during the holidays; but he is a poet and timidly showed me some verses which proved to have promise enough to be printed in the Cyprus Review. When I told his old father that his son, unknown to him, was a writer and had had his first verses printed he raised his dusty cap high in the air and exclaimed: ‘Then praise be to the mother who bore him.’",

They were patiently awaiting their monthly ration of government-subsidised wheat, which they grind themselves in their village water-mills. When a man’s share had been carefully weighed – with stones as weights – the precious grain was poured into sacks of sheep- or goatskin, some still with the wool on. Each man then sat on the ground and when a friend had harnessed him to his heavy load, with hide thongs, he struggled to his feet, grasped his stick and set slowly off on the long trudge home to some hidden hamlet in a crevice of the mountains. Watching them go – bent under their burdens and flayed by that savage wind – I remembered Sir Francis Younghusband’s summing-up: ‘Baltis have a careworn, depressed look at first sight. But they are a gentle, likeable people, and whenever the care of feeding themselves is off their minds they brighten up and unloose their tongues.’",

I climbed up to the cozy platform she had built for me over our walk-in closet, and hugged her cats, Bumblebee and Bula. Bumblebee put her nose up in the air, delicately licked my face and pranced off. Bula scratched and hissed at me for the last time. I took mental snapshots, trying to savor for the last time every essence that was New York.",

Sadhus, the ascetic Hindu holy men, wrapped in blankets or sometimes naked and coated in ash, wander the mud and cobble lanes and may stop you to discuss English cricket in cultured tones, or gibber incoherently with manic, fevered eyes. Horrifically mutilated beggars tug at your clothes, begging for alms. Shifty, furtive fixers hiss and offer illicit beer concealed in a tea pot, intoxicants being banned in the area close to Mother Ganges. Sacred cows squeeze past slow-moving cycle-rickshaws in the narrow alleyways. Then suddenly, the usual honking, chattering buzz of backstreet India is shattered by a fast approaching jangle of bells, shouts and chanting as a funeral cortege approaches. A group of twenty men, wild eyed in grief and ecstasy, lurch and jog towards you, bearing the shroud-wrapped corpse of a family member, destined for the burning ghats.",

McConnell had received no invitation from Bartlett to come along—the Bear was not, after all, under Bartlett’s command; he was only a passenger. But McConnell had an idea. While in port he’d learned that the King and Winge was headed back to Nome, and then was scheduled to head to the Siberian coast on a walrus-hunting trip. McConnell discovered that the King and Winge had on board two motion picture photographers from Los Angeles who were filming for the Sunset Motion Picture Company. Perhaps the captain would not mind having a journalist along, at least as far as Nome. McConnell managed to talk his way on board. Maybe he could convince the captain, or the owner of the ship, to join in the rescue, and if so, he’d have professional filmmakers there to document the historical event for posterity—and profit.",

My mother never got cross. She didn’t exactly do cartwheels, you understand, but she didn’t shout or snap or look as if she were suppressing apoplexy, as I do with my children when they step in something warm and squishy, as they always do. She just looked kind of tired for a moment, and then she grinned at me and said it was a good thing she loved me, which was very true. She’s a saint, my mother, especially where horse shit is concerned.",

Each dynasty built their own city, and splendid buildings rot in ruins, except for the still vibrant Mogul center now known as Old Delhi, and the planned British parliamentary and diplomatic areas of New Delhi. The streets have run with blood several times, including when modern India was created in 1947. Yet the violent past is not as past as I would like. In 1984 two Sikh bodyguards shot Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, unleashing a wave of anti-Sikh violence; hundreds were bashed, shot and necklaced with burning tires. A mob armed with knives and guns even came to the gates of genteel West End and rattled for entry. The General huffed up to the gate and faced the madmen alone.",

Buddhist Tibet, for instance, is mentioned and certain Muslim minorities in the northwest. We closely follow China’s constant harassment by the West. Of course, the Chinese are wise politicians … They would not invade a country to take it over. They are, indeed, very zealous in matters relating to their own affairs. They strictly follow the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.",

I fell asleep with my glasses on and awoke at some indeterminate hour to find the TV screen a frantic, noisy blizzard. I got up to switch it off, tripped heavily over some unyielding object, and managed the interesting trick of turning off the TV with my head. Curious to know how I had managed this, in case I decided to make it a party piece, I discovered that the offending object was my stick, which was not in Newmarket after all but on the floor, lodged between a chair and a bed leg.",

It then created a series of superb waterfalls, so close to the path that we were spray-drenched and so noisy that conversation became impossible. Where we turned onto the steep flank of a grassy mountain our rio also swung right and calmed down to wind through a broad, placid, fertile valley. These level paths are usually restful, but recent rainstorms had reduced this one to greasy red mud and provoked several mildly hazardous landslips.",

I sit, have a beer at the pub, and sit some more. I approach the barmaid and ask about a room. As luck would have it, there is one. At night, the tourists depart and the Port Askaig Hotel asserts more of its historic, local character. I can see Jura across the Sound as quiet descends.

It must have been the depth of this disappointment; or it might have been my two days in bed. I jumped up, pushed Aziz aside, ran to the window, threw it open and heard myself shouting to Mr Butt in a strange insincere-sincere voice, the result perhaps of remembering, even while I shouted, that I had to speak clearly, as to a child, and to use words which he would understand: ‘This is not good, Mr Butt. Butt Sahib, this is not honest. Mr Butt, do you know what you have done? You have hurt me.’",
