    "target_paragraph": "We had been on the Camino almost a week, and I hadn’t bonded with anyone, not in the sense of sharing secrets or having a steady walking companion or snagging bunk beds next to each other. The others had. Slow-walking Georgina had teamed up with one-legged Sally; the two nurses—Kate and Beth—were constant walking companions; Theresa had hit it off with Cathy and Joanna; Greta and June, who knew each other before the Camino, always walked together or shared bunk beds; critical Colleen, shit-disturbing Susie, red-haired Trish, and Serena, the gal with memory loss, traveled as a pack; and Lucy had taken off with the Spanish Doctor and his friend. I wanted desperately to feel part of the group, but at the same time I didn’t want to feel pinned down. I intuitively felt something awaited me on the Camino, something that lay beyond the group.",

In the Asan Bazaar I keep an eye out for Ongdi the Trader, and encounter instead the sheepish Dawa in a new red plastic jacket. From a thief I buy an antique image, in painted clay, of an eleven-faced Avalokita, head split apart in His great distress at the debased condition of mankind. I meet Pirim and Tulo Kansha, last seen as they skipped away with their goat and chang into the pine forests at Phoksumdo Lake; the Tamangs greet me with their fresh, wild smiles, as enchanted with their meager life as ever. Jostled by throngs of northern Bhotes down off the mountains, we stand there grinning and exclaiming, slapping one another on the shoulder for want of other means of communication. And then Pirim’s English is all gone, we slap and grin again, and part as suddenly as we have met.",

At sundown settler children piled up stones at strategic points, ready for the morning. While going into action those children, with their older siblings and mothers, formed howling mobs, the sound quite terrifying. Sometimes babes in arms and toddlers on paternal shoulders contributed their piercing decibels; one toddler became hysterical with fear as the mob seethed around him. A woman taunted two brave mothers who had come to collect their offspring; the words ‘bitches and whores’ were clearly audible. The attacks on pupils and teachers caused many minor and a few major injuries. Homes, too, were attacked; a soldier could be seen relaxing on a balcony, arms outstretched, while five yards away adolescent girls were shattering windows as their fathers shot holes in water tanks. Fahdi’s sitting-room featured; large stones lay on the floor below a broken window. The headmistress was insulted and kicked, then told by a soldier to ‘Get out of the way!’ The female settlers’ garb adds to the air of unreality; one expects women wearing long skirts and sleeves and flowing headscarves to remain in the background, behaving demurely.",

On a rock not thirty feet away, an accipitrine hawk sits in silhouette against the mountains, and here it hunches while the sun goes down, nape feathers lifting in the wind, before diving after unseen prey over the rim of the ravine. Then the great lammergeier comes, gold-headed and black-collared, a nine-foot blade sweeping down out of the north it passes into the shadows between cliffs. Where the river turns, in a corner of the walls, the late sun shines on a green meadow, as if a lost world lay in that impenetrable ravine, so far below. The great bird arcs round the wall, light glancing from its mantle. Then it is gone, and the sun goes, the meadow vanishes, and the cold falls with the night shadow.",

She had this inward happiness, for she had Christopher to love her, to comfort her, to feed her with sweet names; and she flowered in his warmth into a beauty she had never possessed in the tepid days of George.

The sound of the drums drew men and women, children of all ages, seemingly from every corner of the town. The maestro wrapped his shoulders in a large Colombian flag; a mochila decorated with the same national colors hung from his left shoulder. Women from the neighborhood appeared, each more lovely than the last, with beautiful dark hair pulled back and adorned with flowers, all wearing long, flowing dresses as colorful and luminous as the sun. Boys and girls scarcely old enough to walk moved boldly to the beat. Teenagers hung on the maestro’s every phrase, ready to echo his passion and cadence in the call and response that is the essence of tambora. Our new friend Martín knew every song; without a word being said, he slipped into the role of a drummer, taking his place beside the others, revealing himself to be, among his many gifts, a true master of rhythm. All around us, men and women spun in a whirlwind of joy.",

Place the semidry pasta sheet in the lightly oiled baking dish and cover it with a layer of béchamel sauce, a layer of sautéed mushrooms, and a sprinkling of the cheese. Continue cooking the next pasta sheet as you prepare each layer. Add a spoonful or two of the pasta water to the sauce if you’ve used too much on the first layers. Tuscan cooks usually use some of the pasta water in their sauces. Top the dish with buttered bread crumbs and more parmigiano. Bake, uncovered, at 350° for 30 minutes. Serves 8.",

They got the three big sail bags up on deck and then the Big Dink pack, outboard motor, and fuel tank. With those items out of the cabin, Gillian was able to set to work below while he hooked up the new ratchet straps over Baby Dink. It was then on to getting Big Dink inflated and launched, and the main, Genny and staysail hoisted, unfurled, re-furled and folded and then put under the sail covers. That took hours.",

The cross was made from a type of stone that didn’t exist in sixteenth-century St. Augustine. The original saltcellar, since vanished, was decorated with an Indian wearing a nineteenth-century Plains headdress.",

As mentioned earlier, some of these experiences invite or even force you to re-examine fundamental beliefs. In fact, sometimes a humbling experience in the African bush makes you realize that the way you have looked at the world for thirty, fifty, or seventy years may be the polar opposite of the way others see it. And with true humility, you have to acknowledge the possibility that the other view has validity.",

It was a lineal descendant of the old American parlour that used to be closed except on Sundays. But it was exactly the room for the occasion, and I hoped that whatever happened would give it character and make it henceforth part of our house.",

Undulating red ridges of sand covered in stunted khaki-coloured scrubby trees called wanyu – a kind of mulga that was meant to be reasonable camel fodder, but which mine refused to touch. They had never seen it before. Within days they lost all the condition they had built up at Dalgety. I tried to convince them it was delicious but they didn’t believe me. Didn’t trust me. And there was virtually nothing but wanyu. By the time I reached Callytharra, the last station before Woodleigh, I was again worried about them.",
