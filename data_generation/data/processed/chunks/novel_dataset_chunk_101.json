On suffocating nights in Guanabacoa when the electricity was out and fans didn’t work, Jorge García dragged mattresses onto the roof of his house on San Sebastián Street so his family could catch a breeze as they slept in the open air. He had learned how to bread the skin of plantains and fry them to have something to eat when there wasn’t enough food.

I’d separated the dreads with vicious tugs as I walked across the monotonous miles of Oregon, but they’d grown thicker as I’d grown stronger.

They said hello, and walked out without another word, scarcely a glance – yet before they reached the curb Stahr knew: this was just exactly a pretty American woman and nothing more – no beauty like Minna.",

Several men smoked while they waited, but many others skipped the line and shit or pissed in the dust behind the outhouses. There was no door to the main building in the rest area, just a large open arch in the wall. Inside, there were several small restaurant counters along one wall; twenty or so tables filled the center of the room; the concrete floor was covered in dust. The strong scent of shisha smoke and grilled meats filled the air. My mouth watered, but I couldn’t risk the food. I left empty-handed.",

    "target_paragraph": "It was no longer, however, from the vision of material poverty that she turned with the greatest shrinking. She had a sense of deeper empoverishment – of an inner destitution compared to which outward conditions dwindled into insignificance. It was indeed miserable to be poor – to look forward to a shabby, anxious middle-age, leading by dreary degrees of economy and self-denial to gradual absorption in the dingy communal existence of the boarding-house. But there was something more miserable still – it was the clutch of solitude at her heart, the sense of being swept like a stray uprooted growth down the heedless current of the years. That was the feeling which possessed her now – the feeling of being something rootless and ephemeral, mere spindrift of the whirling surface of existence, without anything to which the poor little tentacles of self could cling before the awful flood submerged them. And as she looked back she saw that there had never been a time when she had had any real relation to life. Her parents too had been rootless, blown hither and thither on every wind of fashion, without any personal existence to shelter them from its shifting gusts. She herself had grown up without anyone spot of earth being dearer to her than another: there was no centre of early pieties, of grave endearing traditions, to which her heart could revert and from which it could draw strength for itself and tenderness for others. In whatever form a slowly-accumulated past lives in the blood – whether in the concrete image of the old house stored with visual memories, or in the conception of the house not built with hands, but made up of inherited passions and loyalties – it has the same power of broadening and deepening the individual existence, of attaching it by mysterious links of kinship to all the mighty sum of human striving.",

    "target_paragraph": "The possibility of a miscalculated blast turning one of the presidents into a noseless sphinx kept interest high, and the fact that Borglum looked and acted at least slightly mad, and was always difficult to work with, ensured constant press attention. In fact, mistakes did happen. Jefferson’s nose developed an ominous crack, so the face had to be “reset” at a different angle and many feet farther into the stone. Finding sufficient runs of good stone was one of the biggest challenges. The orientations of the four heads?each looking in a different direction, Jefferson tucked almost impishly behind Washington?was dictated by the availability of workable stone. Most of Washington’s face is about thirty feet in from the original surface; Jefferson’s is twice that. Altogether, Borglum and his workers removed four hundred thousand tons of rock to create their heroic composition.",

Next I slung the shower bag over one shoulder and walked quickly toward my truck, trying to be inconspicuous as possible. First I crossed the truck stop’s fuel lanes. After waiting for traffic, I crossed the busy street into the muted light of the gravel parking lot.

He knew every particle of that country as well as he knew his own body. He was at home in it totally, at one with it and the feeling began rubbing off on to me. Time melted – became meaningless. I don’t think I have ever felt so good in my entire life. He made me notice things I had not noticed before – noises, tracks. And I began to see how it all fitted together. The land was not wild but tame, bountiful, benign, giving, as long as you knew how to see it, how to be part of it. This recognition of the importance and meaning of Aboriginal land strikes many whites who work in that country. As Toly wrote in a letter recently:",

With what fierce joy he welcomed those long walks together in the night, along the quiet streets of Cambridge, or by the marvellous river that wound away small and magical in the blazing moonlight into the sweet, dark countryside! What other pleasure, what other appeasement of his mind and sense had been so complete and wonderful as that which came from this association as, oblivious of the world, they carried on their fierce debate about all things under heaven; his own voice, passionate, torrential, and wild, crying out against the earth, the moon, invoking all the gods of verse and magic while his mind played rivers of lightning across the vast fields of reading and experience!",

So independent was he, and so sensitive, that, while he was always courteous and cheerful, his tone when he responded to a greeting was a little cold and distant, lest anyone should think he was too forward and eager. But, once satisfied of one's friendliness, no one could respond more warmly or more cordially than old man Wakefield.",

If his father hadn’t owned stock in the newspaper Vance knew he could never have held down even his insignificant job there. But there was nothing to regret in all that. He was going to be a writer now: a novelist. A New York review had opened its doors to him; he had only to reread the editorial letter for his brain to hum with new projects and ambitions. “A big novel--I’ll do a big novel yet,” he thought; but meanwhile he would give them all the short stories they wanted. Subjects were swarming about him, opening paragraphs writing themselves on the curtains of his sleeper. All night he lay awake in an ecstasy of invention, rocked by the rhythm of the train as if the great Atlantic rollers were sweeping him forward to his fate.",

She wasn’t really angry at all, and she knew she ought to be. Christopher ought to be sent away at once and for ever, but there were two reasons against that–one that he wouldn’t go, and the other that she didn’t want him to. Contrary to all right feeling, to all sense of what was decent, she was amazingly glad to be with him again. She didn’t do any of the things she ought to do–flame with anger, wither him with rebukes.

Staring at the cows, he exclaimed: ‘Jeez! You get the feelin’ this place ain’t really knit together!’",

Eighteen miles up the valley a handwritten sign told us we couldn’t go any further: the road was under construction right up to the Argentinian border. A man came out of an operations hut, and once we forced him to admit that it was in fact possible to continue some way further up this road, he was persuaded to radio the chief in Coyhaique and let us petition our case. The chief was cross because we interrupted his dinner. ‘You can go through,’ his voice eventually crackled, ‘at nine o’clock tomorrow morning.’",

I resolutely shouldered my pack and walked out of the house. I was astonished that the crowd collected round the door did not interfere with me. They said “He’s going, he’s going,” but no one touched me—they must have noticed that I really meant business. A couple of young men called to one another to stop me, but they got no further than saying it. I walked untouched through the crowd which gave way before me.",

The sides were blasted in but people in the neighborhood knew of the event, and a few weeks later when the Germans had retreated the bodies were dug out and could still be identified.

He could hear the sled’s brake pole grinding against rock and ice as they plunged downward, the sled jerking from side to side as if on a bobsled run. Bartlett held his breath for the last of the harrowing descent, and they spilled out onto the flats and pulled up in front of Baron Kleist’s house at seven in the morning on May 16. The 175-mile trip from East Cape had taken six days.",
