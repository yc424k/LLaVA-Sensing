    "target_paragraph": "Le Lavandou, September 10, 1902\nWe came to Lavandou chiefly because we could not find anyone who had ever been here, and because in Paris people seemed never to have heard of the place. It does not exist on the ordinary map of France, and Baedeker, in his Southern France, merely mentions it. Lavandou is a fishing village of less than a hundred souls, that lies in a beautiful little bay of the Mediterranean. Its score or so of houses are built on the narrow strip of beach between the steep hillside and the sea. They are scarcely more than huts, built of mud and stone on either side of one narrow street. There is one café, and before it is a little square of sycamore trees, where the sailors, always barefoot, with their corduroy trousers and tam-o’-shanter caps, play some primitive game of ball in the afternoon. There is one very fairly good hotel, built on the sea, and from the windows of our rooms we have the whole sweep of ocean before us. There is a long veranda running the full length of the house on the side facing the sea, straw-thatched and overgrown by gourd vines, where all our meals are served to us. The fare is very good for a semi-desert country, though the wine here is thin and sour and brackish, as though the sea-wash had got into the soil that grew it. The wine of the country just here is all red, for the white grapes which flourish about Avignon grow poorly here. We have good fish, however, excellent sauces, plenty of fresh figs and peaches, and the fine little French lobster called langouste. Every morning the one little train that rattles in over the narrow-gauge tracks from Hyères brings us our piece of ice, done up in a bit of sailcloth, and we watch for it eagerly enough. This little train constitutes our railroad service, and it comprises a toy engine, a coal car, a mail and baggage car, and two coaches, one for first and one for second class.\nThe coast for a hundred miles on either side of us is quite as wild as it was when the Saracens held it. It is one endless succession of pine hills that terminate in cliffs jutting over the sea. There are no cattle or pigs raised here, and the people drink only goat’s milk besides their own wines. The gardens are for the most part pitiful little hillside patches of failure. Potatoes, figs, olives, and grapes are almost the only things that will grow at all in this dry, sandy soil. The sea is an even more uncertain harvest, as, with the exception of the lobsters, the fish of the Mediterranean are not particularly good, and bring a low price in the market. The water, indeed, is not cold enough to produce good fish. How the people live at all I am not able to discover. They burn pine knots and cones for fuel—the thermometer never goes down to freezing-point—and they are able to make a savoury dish of almost anything that grows. They are very fond of a salad they make of little sea-grass, dressed with the oil they get from their olives. But never imagine they are not happy, these poor fishermen of this smiling, niggardly sea. Every day we see them along the road as we walk back to the village; before every cottage the table set under an arbour or under an olive tree, with the family seated about, eating their figs and sea-grass salad, and drinking their sour wine, and singing—always singing.",

We were staying with a family, the Savaiinaeas, who had several adjoining fales—open-walled, thatch-roofed traditional houses. Staying with a family was a delicate business. We had showed up in Sala’ilua one afternoon, after a long ride in the back of a dump truck. The truck, with a bed of old rubber sandal forms recycled as padding, doubled as an open-air bus. Our boards were jammed between baskets of taro and fish. The truck dropped us next to a cricket pitch covered with green cocoa beans laid out to dry in the sun. The village was neat, all thatched roofs and well-spaced breadfruit trees, and very quiet. It felt shy. We couldn’t quite see the waves. We had a letter of introduction to the Savaiinaeas from a cousin of theirs whom we’d met in Apia, the Samoan capital. We could hear children yelling, then see them gathering at a safe distance. Finally, a young man wearing a black lavalava approached. We murmured our business, and he led us to Sina Savaiinaea. She turned out to be a handsome woman in her thirties. She read our letter, ignoring a breathless crowd that had gathered around us. Sina glanced at the long, filthy canvas bags under our arms—they contained our surfboards—but did not miss a beat. “You are welcome,” she said, taking the wraps off a thousand-watt smile.",

It was now approaching 6pm. We had around an hour of light remaining, and a two hour walk back to the car. The safe choice would have been to bed down as best we could in the refuge, and light a fire to dry our clothes. The lure of a warm hotel bed, and more importantly, a few bottles of Trapella beer in front of a roaring log fire were too great to resist though. With an added spring in our step, we set out on the path back, which we managed to cover in half an hour less than on our outbound leg. We reached the car in darkness, and breathed a huge sigh of relief as we dumped our rucksack on the rear seat. It was at this point that I realised that the walking book was missing, lost somewhere on the mountain.",

Its only beauty besides the water is the four Egyptian lions, comically excruciated as usual by their crystalline vomit; you have to imagine your favorite dog in this position; the only other fountain lions as handsome are the four facing out from the corners of the basin in Piazza del Popolo. But the worse brutality here is the angry blown-bellied dwarf-legged Moses, which met with such howls in its day the sculptor committed suicide; he had been telling everybody he was going to outdo Michelangelo. In fact the figure is so good a caricature of that other Moses it is as though it were meant as a tribute in satire, the deepest tribute Rome can offer, to the great artist of the cupolone. Something of the same self-mockery, the ultimate brutality, runs in all the fountains; there is always a catch; the most lyrical of them will always be made fun of somehow a little farther on; and the most ribald of all, the one in Piazza Esedra, so stunningly lit up at night, is really a satire on the whole idea of fountains.",

Then he drew a dagger from a belt of white leather, and stabbed the Nubian in the throat lest the slave should tell of his dishonour.

In the cold dawn, when the river pools were filmed with ice, a trooper would gallop into the great square with a plunging steer at the end of his rope. Fifty or sixty ragged soldiers, only their eyes showing between serapes and big sombreros, would begin an amateur bull-fight, to the roaring delight of the rest of the compañeros. They waved their blankets, shouting the correct bull-fight cries. One would twist the infuriated animal’s tail.\nAnother, more impatient, beat him with the flat of a sword. Instead of banderillas, they stuck daggers into his shoulder—his hot blood spattering them as he charged. And when at last he was down and the merciful knife in his brain, a mob fell upon the carcase, cutting and ripping, and bearing off chunks of raw meat to their cuartels. Then the white, burning sun would rise suddenly behind the Puerta, stinging your hands and face.

The cruising guide had said it was an ancient Mayan shipping port, and all that was left were the remnants of three stone structures – all in line, one above the other on the hillside. These were the lead lights the Mayans would use to sail in through a tiny gap in the reef. The Mayans ashore would light fires in each of the structures, and when a canoe at sea lined up all three fires, they could paddle through the narrow gap in the reef to shore. It was mind-blowing that they were using lead lights a thousand years ago, and we still use them today at almost every port around the world.",

Then he did something I hadn’t seen before. One of the reasons I love elephants so much is that they always show you something new, but this was a trick I didn’t appreciate.

Motionless, he could feel frost in the air. Above him the pines, though there was no wind in them, made a continuous dry, wild sound, as though the frost in the air had found voice; above them against the high evening blue, a shallow V of geese slid. There’ll be ice tonight, he thought, watching them and thinking of black backwaters where they would come to rest, of rank bayonets of dead grasses about which water would shrink soon in fixed glassy ripples in the brittle darkness. Behind him the earth rolled away ridge on ridge blue as woodsmoke, on into a sky like thin congealed blood. He turned in his saddle and stared unwinking into the sun that spread like a crimson egg broken upon the ultimate hills. That meant weather: he snuffed the still tingling air, hoping he smelled snow.",

He was, indeed, in Joel’s word, ‘stupendous’; a figure of leonine magnificence and gallant gentility, who might have stepped forth from a page of Thackeray. He was already past his seventieth year, but his body was still strongly, vigorously set: he was somewhat above the middle height, but his neck and shoulders had a kind of massive strength that suggested he had been a powerfully built man in his prime. His white mane of hair was soft as silk and gave his wide brow and ruddy, pleated old man’s face a kind of noble lion-like fierceness, and this impression was enhanced by his grizzled moustache and his old, rather growling voice, which had in it nothing surly or ill-tempered, but rather a kind of old and noble masculinity, an aristocratic kind of growl that seemed perfectly adjusted to a kind of Pendennis-like language, a ‘Dammit-all,-sir,-it’s-not-the-fellow’s-drinking-that-I-mind, it’s - only - that -he’s - proved - himself - incapable - of - holding-his-liquor-like-a-gentleman’ kind of voice.",

What am I to make of these waves of timidity, this hope of continuity, when at other moments I feel free as the bharal on those heights, ready for wolf and snow leopard alike? I must be careful, that is true, for I have young children with no mother, and much work to finish; but these aren’t honest reasons, past a point.

We entered the desert, winding over a series of rolling plains, sandy and covered with black mesquite and here and there an occasional cactus. Now we began to see beside the road those sinister little wooden crosses that the country people erect on the spot where some man died a violent death. Around the horizon barren purple mountains hemmed us in. To the right, across a vast dry valley, a white and green and gray hacienda stood like a city. An hour later we passed the first of those great fortified square ranchos that one comes across once a day lost in the folds of this tremendous country. Night gathered straight above in the cloudless zenith, while all the skyline still was luminous with clear light, and then the day snuffed out, and stars burst out in the dome of heaven like a rocket. Antonio and Primitivo, in that queer harsh Mexican harmony which sounds like nothing so much as a fiddle with frazzled strings, sang \"Esperanza\" as we jogged along. It grew cold. For leagues and leagues around was a blasted land, a country of death. It was hours since we had passed a house.",

As the thermometer drops, your breath freezes into crystals, and tinkles to the ground with a noise they call ‘the whispering of the stars’.\nAmong the native peoples a myth exists that in the extremest cold words themselves freeze and fall to earth. In spring they stir again and start to speak, and suddenly the air fills with out-of-date gossip, unheard jokes, cries of forgotten pain, words of long-disowned love.\nThe cries that might rise from this earth do not bear thinking on.\nIn a rare passage of despair, the poet Mandelstam, who died on his way to Kolyma in a transit camp near Vladivostok, imagined his meanings draining away in the deafness of Russia. No future would hear them.\nAt ten paces, our speech has no sound….",

The slamming stopped as Varuna spilled the air out of the sails and sat back up straight, gently riding the waves. The mind-numbing din of water rushing past the hull by the thousands of gallons stopped. Pumping the bilge, I searched for the leak’s source, and found nothing; everything seemed to be in order.",

On the doorsteps and stoops were shadows who cat-called without mercy. That night as I made my way through Colon, I didn’t get mugged, but I did observe the pathetic look of a city with a depressing history and dashed hopes.",
