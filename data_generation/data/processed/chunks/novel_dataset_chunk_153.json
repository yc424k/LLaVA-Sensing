    "target_paragraph": "Thirty years of memory had reduced the city to a few lantern-slides: a pony-trap pawing the ground outside my small hotel; sunbeams hanging in dust through the pines by the minarets of Gawhar Shad. But now a quarter-century of war had intervened. In March 1979, during the pro-Communist regime of Hafezullah Amin, a hundred Russian advisers and their families were hacked to death by militant Muslims and a mutinous garrison led by a young officer, Ismail Khan. A week later Soviet tanks and helicopter gunships pulverised the city, killing unknown thousands. Only after ten years of guerrilla resistance, and the exhausted withdrawal of the Russians, did Ismail Khan come back as the self-styled Emir of the West, to be ousted by the Taliban in 1995. But over this most cultivated of Afghan cities, the Taliban had hovered like a foreign occupation, despised for their ignorance, feared for their fanaticism. With the US-led campaign of 2001, Ismail Khan returned as warlord to a chastened city.\nNo memory surfaced from the place I had known. My hotel had gone. The streets laid out by the modernising king Amanullah in the 1920s, once jingling with pony-carts, now converged in a ramshackle cavalcade of trucks, motor-scooters, horses and cabs. Diesel fumes stank in the air I remembered pure. National militia patrolled the pavements–Ismail Khan had been deposed a few weeks before–or signalled hopelessly on traffic islands.\nBut beneath this clamour an old suavity and grace survived. Cut off from Kabul by five hundred miles of mountains, Herat belonged to the Iranian plateaux flowing in from the west. Its people looked sleek and fine-boned. Their spoken Dari was purer than Persian. Compared to the striding ruffians of Mazar-e-Sharif, they touched the streets with an urbane ease. Here the fantastically wound turbans belonged only to the villages and suburbs. Most Heratis went bare-headed. Their watches rattled like bracelets at their wrists. Among them bobbed the glittering skull-caps of Kandahar, and occasionally the face of a passing woman, framed only in the black Iranian chador–a returned immigrant, perhaps–sent out a brazen shock-wave.\nI settled into a hotel near the Old City. Time–even Afghan time–had run away from it. Its porters stared at me indifferently from a wooden cubicle, drowsing over stacked ledgers and a Bakelite telephone. Plastic sunflowers gathered dust along the stairs under loosening stucco friezes. My room overhung a swirling crossroads, where the Taliban had once hanged their victims on makeshift gallows.\nBut from its window, to the north, the isolated minarets of my memory reared up in golden pillars against a blurred sky, while to the west the fifteenth-century citadel perched like a fat toy over the inner city. By ten o’clock at night, when Mazar was a place of howling dogs, Herat still clattered with traffic and voices under my balcony. After the midnight curfew, I would be woken by the shouts of militiamen as they flagged down trucks on the haunted crossroads.",

Green forest covered the shadowed precipice, icy streams formed miniature waterfalls and whenever I stopped, to quieten my pounding heart, I began to shiver. From here it was impossible to see the summit – or indeed to see any distance ahead, through this dark tangle of trees – and poor Jock had to be urged on with vehement shouts, for which I had little breath to spare, and with occasional whacks across the hindquarters that almost reduced me to tears of remorse. Again the track had become elusive and sometimes we didn’t know which way to turn – though at least I realised that our general principle must be to move upwards, whereas Jock felt that whenever possible it would be much more rational to move across.",

The land itself has been easily forgotten (scurfed off as inconvenient or irrelevant) or dismissed (as lifeless and repugnant). Western pilgrims, surveyors and cartographers found the same qualities in the Palestinian hills: barrenness, the macabre. William Thackeray came to Palestine in the 1840s and rebuked the countryside as ‘parched’, ‘savage’, ‘unspeakably ghastly and desolate’, a place marked only by ‘fear and blood, crime and punishment’, a terrain of sustained sanguinary rites: ‘There is not a spot at which you look but some violent deed has been done there, or some massacre has been committed.’ To Herman Melville, a decade later, the limestone resembled an ossuary spread over thousands of square miles. He dashed down an appalled stream of impressions in his journal: the hills were ‘bleached’, reminded him of ‘leprosy’, of ‘encrustations of curses – old cheese – bones of rocks – crunched, gnawed & mumbled’.",

The next morning, my ankles are swollen and my first steps out of bed a painful hobble. I can’t know it at the time, but this injury will be the gift that keeps on giving.

And better still, I thought, Luke has lost his powers of speech—he keeps saying you know, doesn’t he? Hundreds and hundreds of times, over and over. So it’s obvious, he’s had it, he’s finished. Clapped out. So at once I forgave him for being such a hero, for being so alien-competent, for saving me, for fixing everything so that I could almost function in this world of his.

These designs meant, he said, that a child had just been born there, and any one seeing them would understand their glad import and keep clear of the house. I thought they were the work of uneducated peasants, but he said that the custom was quite general, and that if his own wife had a child these same designs would be scratched on the walls of his house. While we were looking at these things the barber who cuts my hair passed by. He smiled at me and salaamed, and then held out his hand towards me, palm down, with the fingers extended upwards.

A cool wind blows through almost empty streets lined with the humps of beggars under blankets. En route to the Golden Temple my rickshaw cyclist sings softly under his breath and a light mist swirls around his skinny ankles as the bitumen starts to warm with the early summer sun. We pass squat square shops paying tribute to the ten Sikh gurus who founded the faith. There’s a Nanak Tailor, a Har Krishnan Secondary School, a Hargobind Car Parts and a Tegh Bahadur Guest House. Nanak is the most popular name; he was the first Sikh guru. Born in 1469, when there was much violence between Hindus and Muslims, he urged Indians to worship one God whose name was truth.",

Most of the pens were empty, but some contained live rabbits that were scratching their way through a dusty carpet of straw. A black plastic monkey swung from the rafters overhead, and a pair of plastic rhinos thrust their horns menacingly in the direction of the ostriches and dodos. Elsewhere, a six-packed plastic Adam with a shaggy brown wig and amorphous genitals was ignoring a terribly sexy Eve, her generous breasts obscured by long blonde hair and a carefully placed plastic flamingo. Posters on the wall offered a creationist view of world history, implying that the Grand Canyon had been created by the same deluge that sent Noah to sea.",

The weakened spray hood had become more dangerous than none at all because I often relied on it for support while leaning against or on top of fabric that could no longer handle the pressure. With the help of a sewing machine belonging to some friends on another boat, I took the fabric from the old mainsail and measured and sewed up some weather cloths to tie in between the cockpit lifelines for protection from future cold spray and waves. The Monitor was greased and little parts that had shown fatigue were changed for new ones.",

Oriental scarves and American beer promos hung from its high ceilings, long wooden benches covered its floors, and scores of drunken Westerners, Arabs, and even the occasional affluent Han caroused in between. Waiters decked out in crisp black-and-white uniforms and Santa Claus caps acted as disco balls by dimming the lights and twirling their flashlights in the air. Depending on the music, Greeks in the audience would clamber on stage to perform impromptu circle dances, Brazilians would samba, or Americans would dance like go-go girls. And when the restaurant was jammed to its hilt, the deejay would blast the song that united us all: “The Macarena.” Dishes would break and beer would spill as tables were frantically cleared to be danced upon. With the possible exception of the pee-pee dance, the Macarena was at that time the world’s most international jig.",

One could well imagine the fanatical Dominican Savonarola lighting his Bonfire of Vanities—cosmetics, false hair, statues, paintings, books, jewels—in this piazza. On the night of the royal visit, that which was meant to be festive, but which inspired unreasonable awe, was in direct contradiction to the spirit of the lovely and serene fifteenth-century arcaded courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio, to enter which is to step into the Renaissance: its richly decorated gold-and-white columns; its charming fountain (designed by little Vasari) of a porphyry winged infant standing upon one foot, beatifically cuddling a baby dolphin with one hand. Florentines call him genietto (little genius), and, so sweet, he might be the genius of happiness.",

They were given special waiting rooms at airports, special reserved seats on buses, special carriages in trains. They traveled in their own taxis and sometimes their own planes, made merry in their own segregated discos. They paid specially marked-up entrance fees at monuments, and special 75 percent higher rates on trains. They even had their own kind of currency—the Foreign Exchange Certificate (FEC)—with which to pay for foreigners-only hotels and $50 foreigners-only taxis. And their only contact with the country came from Western-wise locals and jingle-singing children.",

A radiant warmth that produces energy and hope instead of dripping sweat and headaches. Everyone looked sunburned, bright, well-dressed, pleased with life. Everyone was going somewhere briskly. Stylish shops and gleaming cars. Jacaranda and flame trees and royal palms and dense dark green trees, perhaps live oak, much favoured by small birds. Narrow garden strips down the middle of clean streets, fountains of bougainvillea, white, purple, crimson, peach, and hibiscus and oleanders. A beguiling little city that felt rich and happy, made to order for white residents and high-class tourists. In the money-spending centre, Europeans crowded the streets, leavened by Asians; Africans were sparse on the ground, squatting beside pavement mats to sell tourist trinkets, hawking newspapers and lottery tickets, begging from polio-gnarled legs, driving taxis, fetching and carrying.",
