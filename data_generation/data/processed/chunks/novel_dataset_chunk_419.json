In every major city on the American east coast you can find glossy brochures touting another Island Paradise that is ready for you to live your dream. These are the Fabulous Vaporware Islands of the Exumas. Take perfectly rational northern urban dwellers that fight a blizzard to get to the airport, then three hours later drop them into a sun filled dream and it becomes an irresistible reality. Our favorite example of the ‘Perfect Paradise Island’ was Cave Cay. We anchored off the beach of Cave Cay to avoid an approaching storm. The following day we dinghied into a half completed dredged channel into a half completed marina only to be confronted by a one quarter complete project. We wandered around the skeleton of a club house and the half completed houses on the bluff. We wandered for a full hour before a sole watchman approached us.",

I thought of the slats in my spool bed when I was growing up, how the mattress, springs and all, collapsed when I jumped up and down on the bed. But this is securely made, the bed firm and comfortable. A very young woman with tousled black curls and black eyes sells old linens at the Saturday market. For Ashley’s bed I find a heavy linen sheet with crocheted edges and big square pillowcases of lace and embroidery. Surely these accompanied a bride to her marriage. The condition is so good I wonder if she ever took them from her trunk. They have dusty lines where they’ve been folded, so I soak them in warm suds in the hip bath, then hang them out to dry in the midday sun, a natural strong bleach that turns them back to white.",

My aging Crocs were slipping and sliding. Suddenly Ed appeared, leaping over the rocks, wearing nothing more than shorts and a T-shirt. Without saying anything, he held out an arm.

As a result, when things got choppy, we became very good at dropping from the standing to the kneeling position at lightning speed. Lowering our centre of gravity made us more stable and reduced our chances of falling off. Ultimately, we came to understand that a flowing river’s calm surface can be deceptive, and that currents should never be underestimated. Getting back on the board as soon as we fell into the flowing river while avoiding oncoming rocks was probably the most challenging task. Many of us got badly bruised and cut through our wetsuits; but we kept going, without losing momentum. Adrenaline was pumping and despite feeling exhausted, soaked and miserably cold at times, I was proud of the fact we were attempting such a unique and complex challenge.",

It looked like real cognac, and was warming, and tasted like a cocktail of poteen and arak. Everyone had ordered three or four glasses simultaneously, one of the many bizarre customs evolved in Ceausescu’s Rumania where supplies so quickly ran out. When I did likewise the genial waitress, while arranging my four glasses in a neat semicircle, murmured that I could have a bottle of cognac for one dollar. ‘Bun!’ said I. Moments later a newspaper-wrapped bottle was slipped into my Hatchards plastic bag – which by then looked not at all West End-ish.",

Once, on the winter hills, the temperature falls so low that he has to stop and warm himself in the moist breath of a flock of sheep. And one dawn, having walked in the mountains through the night, he comes to a narrow pass between two peaks, and stops for shelter in a little copse of oak and hazel. The mist has risen from the low ground around him, and in the dying moonlight, he wrote, he sees ‘a thousand white islands of cloud and mountain’.",

Climbing down from the truck, I pulled the bookbag over my shoulders and looked at the truck next to ours. Unfortunately, the only clear lane had been next to a truck hauling a trailer full of cattle. Livestock trailers are made of metal slats open to the outside so that the transported animals can breathe. A consequence thereof is that everyone in the vicinity also breathes in the perfume of their manure. As a result, truck drivers and motorists can often tell when a cattle truck is ahead on the highway before the vehicle even comes into sight. When it does one often can see the cowbell still dangling from the back bumper. Used to call cattle to feeding, loaders strike the bell to encourage the animals to walk up a ramp and go inside. The bell that had signaled food and comfort to the cattle continues to dangle and sound its peal, swinging back and forth with the sway of the truck’s movement.",

As a result, there exists in Burma a secret archive of unpublished books—stories that linger in writers’ heads, and finished manuscripts that have been hidden away. Some writers write stories they know cannot appear under the current regime. One friend of mine spent hours each day in front of a run-down computer recording the day’s events as he heard them through the grapevine. ‘I have to do this,’ he said. ‘Nothing is reported in the official news here, so, if I do not write these things down, tomorrow they will be forgotten.’ I also met a historian who is busy compiling a modern history of Shan State in eastern Burma. It is a history of the military occupation of the Shan lands by this government, he explained. ‘I know it will not be published, but I must write it. I must make a record. Then at least it is there, and maybe one day . . .’",

The guests watched in astonishment until the Higueras recollected their manners and introduced Monsieur Louis, a young Guadeloupe businessman with Vaselined hair, and Monsieur Jean, a blond French boy in his twenties who, Mr Higuera explained in Spanish, was a good one, he marched himself from France to Martinique when the shameless sons of whores, the German Fascists, took Paris.

The idea that the decisive moment was at hand was so agitating to her that when luncheon was over she slipped away to the terrace and thence went down alone to the garden. The day was grey but mild, with the heaviness of decay in the air. She rambled on aimlessly, following under the denuded boughs the path she and Darrow had taken on their first walk to the river. She was sure he would not try to overtake her: sure he would guess why she wished to be alone.

Finally, in despair, I dragged Chris across fields of cane towards the sea – an inspired move. But even on that old road traffic was heavy, servicing countless caravan parks and luxurious resorts with names like Westbrook Beach and Willard’s Beach. Between these excrescences the coast was very beautiful, the dazzling blue sea scarcely fifty yards away, its wavelets curling whitely onto golden sand. The dense subtropical vegetation on my left included mangroves and in the wayside grass a vivid abundance of wild flowers bravely bloomed amidst an equal abundance of tins, bottles and cartons. The strong headwind was welcome to temper the sun’s ferocity. Near here miles of road are being widened by the sadistically named Savage & Lovemore construction company. When will such funding be redirected towards the ex-‘homelands’ and townships?",

    "target_paragraph": "I’ve read them all, these old-way wanderers, and often I’ve encountered versions of the same beguiling idea: that walking such paths might lead you – in Hudson’s phrase – to ‘slip back out of this modern world’. Repeatedly, these wanderers spoke of the tingle of connection, of walking as seance, of voices heard along the way. Bashoˉ is said to have told a student that while wandering north he often spoke with long-dead poets of the past, including his twelfth-century forebear Saigyo: he therefore came to imagine his travels as conversations between a ‘ghost and a ghost-to-be’. In Thomas Hardy’s novels, stretches of path can carry memories of a person, just as a person might of a path. Richard Jefferies, in a notebook entry from 1887, described reaching a Bronze Age tumulus in Gloucestershire and feeling ‘[a]s if I could look back and feel then; the sunshine of then, and their life’. Paths were figured as rifts within which time might exist as pure surface, prone to weird morphologies, uncanny origami.",

It was the most extraordinary sight. The two towers are linked by a jagged wall which sweeps audaciously down in a near-vertical plunge to enclose the monastery’s great spread of turquoise domes and cupolas, balconies and cave-cells, staircases and platforms, all propped up on narrow artificial ledges by great ranks of heavy, stepped buttresses. Despite its massive rocky solidity, the monastery’s implausible position on a cliff-face in the midst of the wilderness somehow gives the whole place a fantastic, almost visionary appearance, like one of those castles in children’s fairy tales capable of vanishing in the blink of an eye.",

In spacious grounds, encircled by towering Norfolk Island pines and bluegums, it was the Houaphanh Hilton during Vieng Xai’s brief years of glory when foreign dignitaries and other distinguished visitors came to confer with the Pathet Lao. Since then, the veranda’s concrete pillars have half collapsed in what seemed to me quite a dangerous way. The restaurant with seating for a hundred was locked but through the door’s glass panel I could see chairs upside down on tables. No water was available in a large communal bathroom with many hand-basins and squat-overs. I shouted and rattled door handles to no effect. Perhaps Granny was right and the German wrong? I wandered up an outside staircase and along a balcony – the boards rotting. Only when I turned on my torch to descend did someone notice me and shout from a house on stilts behind the trees.",
