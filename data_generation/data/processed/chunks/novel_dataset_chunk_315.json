In Kuta, the used-book stores were stocked with Harold Robbins and John Jakes; in Ubud, they were bursting with Huxley, Wilde, Castaneda and Anaïs Nin. And the visitors in the Ubud streets were chipper sexagenarians, Pan-like boys with headbands around their black curls, well-preserved Century City executives in sarongs with pretty young companions by their side and French women in their late thirties in search of something exotic. Ubud was one beautifully designed gift shop with wind chimes all around.",

The room opened on a long wooden verandah, with the sea coming in at the windows. It was bare and cool, with a table covered with a coarse checkered cloth and adorned by a bottle of pickles and a blueberry pie under a cage. No more guileless-looking cabinet particulier ever offered its shelter to a clandestine couple: Archer fancied he saw the sense of its reassurance in the faintly amused smile with which Madame Olenska sat down opposite to him. A woman who had run away from her husband—and reputedly with another man—was likely to have mastered the art of taking things for granted; but something in the quality of her composure took the edge from his irony.

The coast had become more desolate now and the road wound along it within sight and sound of the troubled waters; every bend was a hair­pin cut into the grey mulch of a limestone whose coarse dirty thatch lay damp and inert, heavy with seashells. Once or twice we thought we saw the shadow of a man on the cliffs or among the olive trees and I pulled up, expecting a challenge, for I knew that troops were being moved into this area to support the police, but each time we were mistaken. The whole network of cliffs and promontories lay deserted under an empty sky. Kato Pyrgos, Limonias, Mansoura; we passed slatternly villages tou­sled in sleep, deserted farms, deserted fishing nets hanging out to dry on scaffoldings of wooden spokes. The headlights picked up only the flaring legends which decorated the crumbling white walls of the towns, ENOSIS, DEATH TO ARMITAGE, THE BRITISH MUST GO. ‘These are somewhat new,’ said Panos reflectively, ‘but then the Paphiots were always extrem­ists. But look at this one.’ In red paint, not in blue this time, the words WE WILL SHED BLOOD written athwart a coffee-house wall. Panos sighed and nibbled at a biscuit … ‘There’s some­thing in the air,’ he said in his dry academic voice, ‘which makes me wonder.’",

On the top branch of the nearest bush an enchanting small bird – all cardinal red – sang his happy evening song, pausing at intervals to swoop through the air, making little clicking noises as he reduced the insect population. At 6.30 the long rolls of pearly cloud to the west briefly became gold, then rose-pink, fading to smoky blue. And quarter of an hour later the stars were out. While writing this I have drunk four litres of water.",

When I was seven I clearly remember my grandfather showing me a black-and-white photograph, perhaps ten inches by five, of a snow ridge in the Alps which he had climbed – the Biancograt of the Piz Bernina. The ridge was so sharp that it appeared to cut the sunlight in two: one side of the ridge blazed whitely, the other was cast in shadow. In the background was only the sky, and at its summit the ridge tapered to a snow cone. From the tip of this cone unfurled a white flag of cloud. With his little finger, my grandfather pointed out the flag. He told me it was a stream of ice crystals being blown off the mountain by the wind. To me this peak, dipping its point up into the empty air and flying its flag of ice, seemed extraterrestrial. I could not believe my grandfather had climbed it.",

He never noticed her. Some said he was dead; some said she was dead. Which was it? Mrs Bast didn’t know for certain either. The young gentleman was dead. That she was sure.

Up-stream, the water broke up the reflected turquoise of a sky full of dishevelled cirrus clouds. Pink and crimson threads were dispersed in conflicting drifts and then frozen in motionless turmoil; it was all the stranger as there had not been a breath of wind all day. Swifts were still skimming through the air and a heron flew across the river from wood to wood. A number of large and mysterious birds were floating high overhead and at first I thought they were herons too, but they carried their necks extended instead of coiled between their shoulders, and they were white. They were larger and more slender and less hurried than swans: the spread of wings scarcely moved as they revolved on the air-currents. There were about a dozen, snow-plumed except for black flight-feathers which ran along the inner edge of their wing like a senatorial stripe of mourning. They were storks! When they circled lower, the long beaks and the legs that trailed in the slipstream showed red as sealing wax. An old shepherd was leaning on the ramp close by and gazing up at them too. When some of the great birds floated lower, the draught of their feathers brushed our upturned faces, and he said something in Magyar – ‘Nét, góbyuk!’ and smiled. He hadn’t a tooth in his head. Two of the birds glided upstream. One dropped on a haystack and fluttered to regain its balance. The second landed underneath in the meadow – becoming, as it folded its wings, a white bobbin with red lacquer stilts and bill – and paced to the water’s edge. The others, meanwhile, were alighting on the tiles of the two little bridgehead towns and advancing with ungainly steps along the roofs to inspect the dishevelled nests that cumbered many of the chimneys. Two of them were even attempting, in defiance of the bells which were tolling there, to land in one of the Cathedral belfries – they remembered the harmless hazard from former incumbency. The bell-hampers were choked with tangles of last year’s twigs.",

Then you come to a mad junction at Burger King and discover that the new six-lane road to Kmart is long, straight, very busy, and entirely without facilities for pedestrians—no sidewalks, no pedestrian crossings, no central refuges, no buttons to push for a WALK signal at lively intersections. I walked through gas station and motel forecourts and across restaurant parking lots, clambered over concrete barriers, crossed lawns, and pushed through neglected ranks of privet or honeysuckle at property boundaries. At bridges over creeks and culverts—and goodness me how developers love a culvert—I had no choice but to walk on the road, pressed against the dusty railings and causing less attentive cars to swerve to avoid me. Four times I was honked at for having the temerity to proceed through town without benefit of metal. One bridge was so patently dangerous that I hesitated at it. The creek it crossed was only a reedy trickle, narrow enough to step across, so I decided to go that way. I slid and scampered down the bank, found myself in a hidden zone of sucking grey mud, pitched over twice, hauled myself up the other side, pitched over again, and emerged at length streaked and speckled with mud and extravagantly decorated with burrs. When I finally reached the Kmart Plaza I discovered that I was on the wrong side of the road and had to dash through six lanes of hostile traffic. By the time I crossed the parking lot and stepped into the air-conditioned, Muzak-happy world of Kmart I was as grubby as if I had been on the trail, and trembling all over.",

From the distant past to the unknowable future, my mind swings wildly through time, touching on dozens of ideas a minute, unharnessed and undisciplined. This in itself is not necessarily a problem; the problem is the emotional attachment that goes along with the thinking. Happy thoughts make me happy, but—whoop!—how quickly I swing again into obsessive worry, blowing the mood; and then it’s the remembrance of an angry moment and I start to get hot and pissed off all over again; and then my mind decides it might be a good time to start feeling sorry for itself, and loneliness follows promptly. You are, after all, what you think. Your emotions are the slaves to your thoughts, and you are the slave to your emotions.",

Ed opens the window and the breeze sends in pine scent from blown-down limbs and scattered needles. The electricity still is out. As we sit propped up on pillows, waiting for our hearts to slow down, we hear something at the window. A small owl has landed on the sill. Its head swivels back and forth. Perhaps its perch was blown down or it is disoriented by the storm. When the moon breaks through the clouds, we can see the owl staring inside at us. We don’t move. I’m praying, Please don’t come in the room. I am deathly afraid of birds, a holdover phobia from childhood, and yet I am entranced by the small owl. Owls seem always to be more than themselves, totemic in America, symbolic at least, and here, mythological as well. I think of Minerva’s owl. But really it’s just a small creature that belongs to this hill. We have seen its larger forebears several times at evening. Neither of us speaks. Since it stays, we finally fall asleep and wake in the morning to see that it has flown. At the window, only the quarter of six light—raked gold angling across the valley, suffusing the air briefly before the sun clears the hills and lifts into the absolved, clear day.",

Fifty mules and their muleteers, a throng of porters, cooks, translators and sirdars, and the Everesters themselves. For days they move through the greenhouse of the Sikkim jungle. It rains profusely, and this causes problems. Mallory has his black cycling cape and Bullock his pink umbrella, but nothing keeps you dry beneath such a prodigious downpour. Everything is wet, water slides and trickles off every leaf and stone. The mules they procured in Darjeeling are plump creatures, unused to the jungle paths. Nine fall sick, and one collapses and dies. After five days there is no choice: they decide to pack the mules and their muleteers back to Darjeeling, and extemporize with local transport – yaks, ponies – once they get into Tibet. The rain brings out the leeches, too. Both sorts – the string-thin, army-green leeches and the tuberous, ochre-striped tiger-leeches. They come from all directions, and in their hundreds: undulating over the ground at surprising speed, or standing erect on leaves and branches, waving like admonishing fingers in the air. The porters nip them off from their legs with a twist and a pull, leaving little rings of blood that bleed on for hours afterwards, and quickly the Westerners learn to do the same.",

John Muir had swarmed up a hundred-foot Douglas Spruce during a Californian windstorm, and looked out over a forest, ‘the whole mass of which was kindled into one continuous blaze of white sun-fire!’ Italo Calvino had written his magical novel, The Baron in the Trees, whose young hero, Cosimo, in an adolescent huff, climbs a tree on his father’s forested estate and vows never to set foot on the ground again. He keeps to his impetuous word, and ends up living and even marrying in the canopy, moving for miles between olive, cherry, elm and holm oak. There were the boys in B. B.’s Brendon Chase, who go feral in an English forest rather than return to boarding-school, and climb a ‘Scotch pine’ in order to reach a honey buzzard’s nest scrimmed with beech leaves. And of course there was the team of Winnie the Pooh and Christopher Robin: Pooh floating on his sky-blue balloon up to the oak-top bee’s nest, in order to poach some honey; Christopher ready with his pop-gun to shoot Pooh’s balloon down once the honey had been poached.",

Two issues were at the core of the predicament: the difficulty of obtaining a work visa and the lack of funds to pay the proper taxes on legitimately registered employees. The school hadn’t ever attempted to take care of the paperwork, however thorny a process it may have been, knowing they didn’t have the money to back it up.

Perhaps the infamy of the Heck cattle breeding project has prejudiced me against this way of thinking, but I do worry that, in pining for the landscapes and the wildlife of the distant pastones that may never have existed in quite the way we envisagewe risk creating false idols. Carefully constructed selective breeding projects to produce “wild” animals seem, on the face of it, to be self-defeating. What could be more artificial than selectively breeding animals based on superficial traitshorn shape, height at the shoulders, shade of brownattributed to an animal as much myth as reality? Even those bred for aggression are carefully controlled: any progeny showing too much a tendency for bloodshed will be shotlest Frankenstein’s monsters run amok.",

They brought you—the half million or more of them who came and stayed—a warmth you lacked, a passion that God knows you needed, a belief and a devotion that was wanting in your life, an integrity of purpose that was rare in your own swarming hordes. They brought to all the multiplex and feverish life of all your ancient swarming peoples some of the warmth, the depth, the richness of the secret and unfathomed South. They brought some of its depth and mystery to those sky-shining vertices of splintered light, to all those dizzy barricades of sky-aspiring brick, to those cold, salmon-colored panes, and to all the weary grey of all those stony-hearted pavements. They brought a warmth of earth, an exultant joy of youth, a burst of living laughter, a full-bodied warmth and living energy of humor, shot through with sunlight and with Africa, and a fiery strength of living faith and hope that all the acrid jests, the bitter wisdoms, the cynical appraisals, and the old, unrighteous, and scornmaking pride of all the ancient of the earth and Israel could not destroy or weaken.",

There was only one horse in the whole city, and it was pointed out to me by the proprietor of the Grand Hotel, a thin piebald beast pulled down the main street like a mule. There had been other horses from time to time, but they had all died. Where there wasn’t a tin shed there were huge hoardings covered with last year’s Poppy Day posters (the date was January the fifteenth). On the roofs the vultures sat nuzzling under their wings with horrible tiny undeveloped heads; they squatted in the gardens like turkeys; I could count seven out of my bedroom window. When they moved from one perch to another they gave no sensation of anything so aerial as flight; they seemed to hop across the street, borne up just high enough by the flap-flap of their dusty wings.",
