The festival of Osorezan had ended five days before, and the ground was still littered with the tiny one-yen coins that worshipers had strewn about. Three or four elderly women picked their way among the mounds of pebbles and lit candles in front of a small charnel house that contained the teeth of countless dead; and a middle-aged man in a business suit strode confidently up and down taking pictures of the eyeless figures and announcing to everyone within earshot, ‘Ah yes, I see. Ah yes, I see.’",

We gazed down at the moonlit landscape and up at the metalled and shingled spires and watched the hands of an old clock over an archway where a jerky figurine emerged and struck the hour. The town blazed with moonlight but beyond the glimmer of the distant ranges, the eastern sky was still restless with summer lightning. We put up at an inn with gables and leaded windows in a square lifted high above the roofs and the triple cincture of the town wall and dined at a heavy oak table in the Gastzimmer. The glasses held a cool local wine that washed down trout caught that afternoon, and every sight and sound – the voices, the wine-glasses, the stone mugs and the furniture shining with the polish of a couple of centuries – brought it closer to a Weinstube by the Rhine or the Necker. When István retired, Angéla and I sat on in the great smokey room holding hands, deeply aware that it was the last night but one of our journey. There are times when hours are more precious than diamonds. The gable-windows upstairs surveyed a vision of great unreality. The moon had triumphed over the mute fireworks to the east and the north and all the dimensions had been re-shuffled. We leant on the sill and when Angéla turned her head, her face was bisected for a moment, one half silver, the other caught by the gold glow of lamplight indoors.",

As in Laotian forests (of which these reminded me) the bird-life was tantalising: flashes of red, blue, white, green, chestnut, only glimpsed through the obscuring foliage.

The summer heat of the last few days had partly evaporated in the night, and dark clouds were building along the ridges of the hills. I passed a young tramp with long hair and a beard carrying a cloth-wrapped bundle and a dented copper kettle, and like all the other tramps I met on my journey, he grimly ignored my existence. A woman pulling a cart loaded with straw came slowly up the other side of the road and stopped to yank back her headscarf and stare at me. And as I stood consulting my map at a point where it looked as though I could finally get off the highway, a car drew up, the driver wound his window down and said in English, ‘Where go?’",

Nothing was the same—I had seen that much from the window of the bus during the long, cluttered drive from the airport. This wasn't a return to the past but a meaningless venture into a strange city. Prewar streets had been obliterated and replaced by roads that led in new directions, so that I was lost before I started anywhere, and Tokyo was enormous beyond my power to have imagined it—a great, haphazard collection of buildings without a nucleus. Although the outside of the hotel still looked as I remembered it, like the base of a dark-red pyramid, inside all had been changed—at least, as far as I could see through the crowd of tourists struggling to make their way through the lobby. I asked myself what in the world I was doing there. I would have been tired and depressed in any case, because I'd come by night flight and it was the middle of the morning. As things were, there seemed nothing to do about the debacle but book a passage out as soon as possible. However, after a bath, I reminded myself that I knew people in the city—not friends of the old days but acquaintances from Hong Kong—and I thought I might as well telephone some of them and fill the time. One of them, an Englishman, asked me to join him at lunch. \"That is, if you don't mind meeting a couple of other people,\" he said. \"They're Japanese business contacts, and I can't very well cancel them out.\"",

But the biggest harm that he does is to spoil the shape of the female dog.

The police did not appear (perhaps there are none in these remote villages) and one gathered that the event was unimportant.

Up high, we came upon stone huts where the grove tenders sheltered themselves. Although we got lost and encountered a pacing bull in a meadow, we felt this immense peace all day, walking among those trees that looked and may have been a thousand years old. Walking these few curving acres here give me the same feeling. Unnatural as it is, terracing has a natural feel to it. Some of the earliest methods of writing, called boustrophedon, run from right to left, then from left to right. If we were trained that way, it probably is a more efficient way to read. The etymology of the word reveals Greek roots meaning “to turn like an ox plowing.” And that writing is like the rising terraces: The U-turn space required by an ox with plow suddenly loops up a level and you’re going in the other direction.",

Unbounded forests, and blue snow-light falling on to drifts marked with the paw-prints of wolves. Frost-shattered summits and corries holding lochs of great depth. And this was the vision of a wild place that had stayed with me: somewhere boreal, wintry, vast, isolated, elemental, demanding of the traveller in its asperities. To reach a wild place was, for me, to step outside human history.",

The next time I woke up, I stood, swung the door open quietly, and stepped out into the brisk midnight air. I knew I had crossed a threshold—now my very life was in danger. Yet I couldn’t relent, not now. Leaving Muir Hut, I was driven not only to find an answer, but to follow the trail as it dropped thousands of feet.

Before he grew his mandarin beard he looked in some photographs distinctly European, with his long face, long nose and wide mouth, and the woman he married was Eurasian too – the daughter of a Jardine’s partner. Ho Tung thought of himself however as Chinese, and as year by year he amassed his tremendous fortune he became one of the great figures of the Hong Kong Chinese community, ever more venerable, ever more generous in good causes, a founding father of the University of Hong Kong, now presenting a warplane to the Chinese Government for its fight against the Japanese, now giving a couple of fighters to the RAF.",

There were people in splendid evening dress, and beautiful women blazing with jewels and wearing costly wraps. There were others in pyjamas who had evidently been awakened from sleep and had hastily put on slippers, dressing-gowns, kimonos, or whatever garments they could snatch up in the excitement of the moment. There were young and old, masters and servants, a mixture of a dozen races and their excited babel of strange tongues. There were German cooks and French maids, English butlers and Irish serving girls. There were Swedes and Danes and Italians and Norwegians, with a sprinkling of White Russians. There were Poles and Czechs and Austrians, Negroes and Hungarians.
