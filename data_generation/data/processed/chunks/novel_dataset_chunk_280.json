All the night he had been feeling that the neglect he was labouring to repair was abnormal and isolated – the only instance of the kind within the circuit of the county. Yet at this very time, within the same parish, a greater waste had been going on, uncomplained of and disregarded. A few months earlier Boldwood’s forgetting his husbandry would have been as preposterous an idea as a sailor forgetting he was in a ship. Oak was just thinking that whatever he himself might have suffered from Bathsheba’s marriage, here was a man who had suffered more, when Boldwood spoke, strangely – in the voice of one who yearned to make a confidence and relieve his heart by an outpouring.",

One and all, they are afflicted with every form of malignant skin disease. Some have ringworm, others have bukua. This latter is caused by a vegetable parasite that invades the skin and eats it away. The itching is intolerable. The afflicted ones scratch until the air is filled with fine dry flakes. Then there are yaws and many other skin ulcerations. Men come aboard with Solomon sores in their feet so large that they can walk only on their toes, or with holes in their legs so terrible that a fist could be thrust in to the bone. Blood-poisoning is very frequent, and Captain Jansen, with sheath-knife and sail needle, operates lavishly on one and all. No matter how desperate the situation, after opening and cleansing, he claps on a poultice of sea-biscuit soaked in water. Whenever we see a particularly horrible case, we retire to a corner and deluge our own sores with corrosive sublimate. And so we live and eat and sleep on the Minota, taking our chance and \"pretending it is good.\"",

On a recent visit, I dragged out of dusty storage (thank you, Moxie) a stack of ancient diaries, brittle letters and mysterious miscellany from the 1980s and 1990s, when London was my home. It felt like a time bomb, or maybe a time capsule. It was like a note in a bottle I sent to my future grey-haired self from my faraway youth in a crummy bedsit in Camden, London NW3. It had magical mystery tour written all over it.",

Bright, trembling with heat, it lay in open glades of miragelike glimpses of stone or brick: columns without tops, towers apparently floating above a green cloud in slow ruin against the southwest wind, sinister, imponderable, bland; and he standing there listening to the sweet cloistral bell, thinking Now what?

In a few moments, Eugene was able to decipher his jargon sufficiently to understand that his jaw and nose were broken, that most of the teeth had been extracted, in order that the jaw-bone might be wired together, and that he could not open his mouth now, either to speak or eat, because of wires that bound the fracture.

    "target_paragraph": "Rachel pointed out this evening that so far we have almost kept pace with Pizarro and his men on their historic march from Cajamarca to Cuzco; which of course is a coincidence – we’re not ‘racing’ them. The conquistadores left Cajamarca on 11 August 1533 and reached Tarma on 10 October; we left Cajamarca on 9 September and have reached Tarma on 10 November. Like ourselves, the Spaniards paused in Tarma only long enough to feed their horses; the town is so closely encircled by mountains that they feared an ambush where horsemen would be at a disadvantage, Pizarro’s secretary, Pedro Sancho, graphically described that night on an exposed mountainside near Tarma: ‘The men remained continuously on the alert, with the horses saddled and the men themselves unfed. They had no meal whatsoever, for they had no firewood and no water. They had not brought their tents with them and could not shelter themselves, so they were all dying of cold – for it rained heavily early in the night and then snowed. The armour and clothing they were wearing were all soaked’. It’s odd that in 1533 there was snow in early October in this area. And odder still that they didn’t carry water with them from the valley; by then they must have known that it isn’t always available on the heights. We may think this not an ideal site, but at least we’re warm, dry and fed. And tomorrow morning we won’t see the corpses of over 4,000 Indians, killed in one of the battles of the Inca civil war – which was the sight that awaited the conquistadores on 11 October. On which of these moonlit mountains did they camp? Possibly on this one, if our guide out of Tarma was correct and we are now on an Inca road.",

Many of the poorer highlanders never eat before midday and as no one seemed to be thinking of breakfast I opened a tin of tuna fish and ate it with my pale pink plastic spoon, watched by a fascinated family who accepted the empty tin as though it were a golden goblet. Everyone disapproved of my leaving so early – they shook their heads and rubbed their hands together while repeating ‘Birr! Birr!’ (‘Cold! Cold!’) But I reckoned that I would feel a lot less cold if moving and we started out at seven o’clock.",

Set in the surface of the pavement, easily missed among the manhole covers and litter, were a series of round lamps the size of coffee cups. Each was dimly backlit with a faint red bulb and emblazoned on top with a flame symbol that resembled a bad tattoo. Spaced at intervals of a few metres, the lamps ran down the pavement, stopping and then resuming where roads and tram tracks crossed their path, before disappearing round a corner. Together, they formed the brandgrens – the ‘fire boundary’ marking the edge of the area destroyed by the wartime bombing raids and subsequent fires. An upward glance confirmed the difference between the two sides. To the left were the remnants of the old city: tall townhouses of red brick, with sloping roofs and pulleys poised to hoist furniture up five skinny floors. To the right were grey modern blocks with flat tops and concrete façades and bicycles hanging off the sides of cramped balconies; the unattractive evidence of a city reborn. Where the weak bulbs now blushed in the pavement, there had once been a searing wall of flame. A plane flew low overhead on its way to the nearby airport, and I flinched.",

They went to a hotel, they planned it the day before. He discovered that he knew next to nothing about the proper procedure other than supposition and imagination; because of his ignorance he believed that there was a secret to the successful performance of the business, not a secret formula to be followed but rather a kind of white magic: a word or some infinitesimal and trivial movement of the hand such as that which opens a hidden drawer or panel. He thought once of asking her how to go about it because he was certain that she would know, just as he was certain that she would never be at a loss about anything she wished to do, not only because of her absolute co-ordination but because even in this short time he had come to realise that intuitive and infallible skill of all women in the practical affairs of love. But he did not ask her because he told himself that, when she told him how to do, which she would, and it would be correct, he might at some later time believe that she had done this before and that even if she had, he did not want to know it. So he asked Flint.",

You can’t drive to Cordova. You could walk, overland, if prepared for perilous crevasse fields and icefalls, and you’d arrive weeks after you’d begun, itchy with devil’s club spines and the mental fatigue of a month of route finding. You could kayak, if you had time, or take a private boat, if you owned one. (If you knew how to maneuver it against chop and fetch, if you weren’t a little afraid of the sea.) No matter how you get there, what strikes you upon landing in Cordova is water and mountains. And birds, and fishy air thick with salt you taste on licked lips.",

When we got home, we realized that we had scheduled the survey for Super Bowl Sunday. I couldn’t beg, borrow or steal a hotel room in Fort Lauderdale. It didn’t go over well when I asked the selling broker in Miami if we could stay on the boat Saturday and Sunday. I knew there wasn’t much chance of him letting us stay overnight on her. This idea was worse than having someone interested in buying your house move in and become a house guest for a couple of weeks. I called my broker in Annapolis who smoothed out the troubled waters. I received a ‘thumbs up’ to stay on the boat for the two nights. We arrived that Saturday. Fort Lauderdale was overrun with Super Bowl fever. We were moored far away from the revelers.
