Africa was Africa to me, about as clever as thinking New York and California would be the same. Always glad to postpone shopping, I compromised by buying a hot water bottle. And set off to cross the continent with a brand new Boots’ hot water bottle, wool trousers and heavy sweater, three cotton dresses, two pairs of city shoes, and a large Spanish fisherman’s straw hat. Since I knew nobody anywhere and expected to be gone nearly three months, I was more interested in amusements.",

    "target_paragraph": "But though he came home full of spiritual treasure, it was without material results. He had found no way of raising money, and he knew he must have some before the end of the month. For a fortnight past the woman who came to help Laura Lou had not shown herself. She lived some distance away, and when Vance went to hunt her up she excused herself on the plea of the cold weather and the long snowy walk down the lane from the trolley terminus. But Vance knew it was because he owed her several weeks’ wages, and when she said: “I’d never have come all that way, anyhow, if it hadn’t been I was sorry for your wife,” he received the rebuke meekly, conscious that it was a way of reminding him of his debt. With the coming of the dry cold Laura Lou seemed to revive, and for a while she and Vance managed to carry on the housekeeping between them, though the meals grew more and more sketchy, and it became clear even to Vance’s inattentive eyes that the house was badly in need of cleaning. Carrying in the bags of coal (which he now had to fetch from the end of the lane) left on the floors a trail of black dust that Laura Lou had not the strength to scrub away, and the soil was frozen so hard that Vance could no longer bury the daily refuse at the foot of the orchard, but had to let it accumulate in an overflowing barrel. All that mattered little when she began to sing again about the house; but his nerves were set on edge by the continual interruptions to his work while he was still charged with creative energy, and often, when he got back to his desk, he would sit looking blankly at the blank page, frightened by the effort he knew his brain would refuse to make.",

The lumpy mounds rose wet above her head and she set out following the creases. Before long she was lost. Like a mystic maze the folds and ridges rose in desolation; there was nothing to indicate one way from another. She stumbled on and finally reached the medulla oblongata. Vast tortuous indentations led her round and round. Hysterically, she began to run. David, distracted by a tickling sensation at the head of his spine, lifted his lips from hers.",

Businesses as well as private apartments filled the five-story structure. At first, I taught in the school’s larger classroom with a sea view. With the pleasant October temperature, I hadn’t noticed the lack of centralized heating. As winter set in, I learned that the afternoon sun on the smaller room was far more effective than the inefficient space heater that consistently overloaded the power source.

That night, traffic and pedestrians filled the streets, horns honked, engines roared, and I was all but certain that a month in Egypt would kill us both. But, as we crossed Giza that Friday afternoon, our last day in Egypt, we had the city to ourselves. The storefronts were shuttered, the sidewalk cafes closed, the cars, trucks, and buses nowhere to be found. If ever there were an apocalypse, it would look like this, I thought. While I stared out the window in disbelief, Abdel continued his tour. I missed much of what he said, but I remember that he recommended a restaurant that we could try later. “Here, my friend,” he said as he pointed to a McDonald’s, “tonight, dinner, I take you, the best sandwich in all Egypt.”",

The Shogun had established a university at Yushima Confucian Hall in Edo, the purpose of which was to educate schoolmasters to train the nation in Confucian loyalty and good manners. The graduates of Yushima were expected to return to their native districts and set up academies in their native towns. However, the policy backfired, because many of these local scholars became literati, and the literati are loyal to no system. In their leisure they began to study ancient Shinto. Soon they were publishing books denouncing the Shogun and calling for the return of the Emperor, thus laying the groundwork for the fall of the Shogunate. Meanwhile they traveled constantly, exchanging letters, poems and calligraphy.",

After his father’s and his Uncle Hubert’s sister’s marriage they moved back into the big house, the tremendous cavern which old Carothers had started and never finished, cleared the remaining negroes out of it and with his mother’s dowry completed it, at least the rest of the windows and doors and moved into it, all of them save Uncle Buddy who declined to leave the cabin he and his twin had built, the move being the bride’s notion and more than just a notion and none ever to know if she really wanted to live in the big house or if she knew before hand that Uncle Buddy would refuse to move: and two weeks after his birth in 1867, the first time he and his mother came down stairs, one night and the silver cup sitting on the cleared dining-room table beneath the bright lamp and while his mother and his father and McCaslin and Tennie (his nurse: carrying him)—all of them again but Uncle Buddy—watched, his Uncle Hubert rang one by one into the cup the bright and glinting mintage and wrapped it into the burlap envelope and heated the wax and sealed it and carried it back home with him where he lived alone now without even his sister either to hold him down as McCaslin said or to try to raise him up as Uncle Buddy said, and (dark times then in Mississippi) Uncle Buddy said most of the niggers gone and the ones that didn’t go even Hub Beauchamp could not have wanted: but the dogs remained and Uncle Buddy said Beauchamp fiddled while Nero fox-hunted",

For quite a distance—far longer than it seemed it ought to—the road stayed straight. Even if, farther on, it did curve back near the trail, there was no certainty (or even perhaps much likelihood) that we would spot it. In these trees and this snow you could be ten feet from the trail and not see it. It would be madness to leave the logging road and try to find it.

Elderly men with gobs of fishing gear. And more crying babies. All the usual sights of the great American campground. The strangest thing to me, after a week of living minimally in the backcountry, were the huge metal campers. It was like an entire family had simply uprooted their home, packed it on the back of a truck, and hauled it out to the forest. The familiar glow of a television set was emanating from one such metallic box. Who would drive all the way out here just to watch TV?",

I hadn't had a crush of these dimensions for a long time. I smiled, enjoying the delicious sensations of forgotten frisson. I hurried toward the building where I would find his office.\nThe sun warmed my hair. I felt the perpetual Riyadh breeze ruffle my short crop. It was always marvelous to come out into the open, and here on the medical compound I could always exit without an abbayah or veil. I was perfectly at ease, though doubtless many eyes were watching my unusual progress, which generated surprise wherever I went. Saraway, my pharmacist friend, told me about this, condensing my diaphanous vapors of suspicion that I was being observed into a very concrete reality.\n“Qanta, you know when you first started inviting me to have lunch in the canteen, I felt really strange. I wasn't sure if I should go. I mean it was unheard of for a woman to eat with a male colleague at work.” I was surprised, remembering my natural invitation of Saraway to eat with me as soon as we had finished making our first rounds together. Because he was American, we became friends immediately. I hadn't realized I had distressed the Ethiopian American Coptic Christian quite so much. I listened.\n“I mean, you cannot know how startling it was to see you arrive in the ICU, Qanta. We had never had a woman there before. Even for me as an American it was hard because after five years in Riyadh, you kind of get used to the segregation.”",

I was therefore curious to see what had changed during my time away, and whether any of the incoming government’s promises to transform the country had been delivered. According to the media, they hadn’t: the newspapers were still filled with talk of economic crisis, an overstretched health service and duplicitous bankers. Looking at a bank of wide-screen televisions in the window of an enormous electrical goods store, I saw politicians from the three main parties stroppily debating immigration policy. Did, the reporter asked, the ‘tsunami of media coverage’ and ‘bitter partisan divide’ politicians had to deal with make it harder for them to debate good policy? Was Britain moving towards a European-style system where coalition governments were the norm? All three ducked the questions.",

As it surged past, a huge lava-flow of interlaced traffic, her tired bewildered eyes seemed to see the buildings move with the vehicles, as a stationary train appears to move to travellers on another line. She fancied that presently even the little Washington Square Arch would trot by, heading the tide of sky-scrapers from the lower reaches of the city . . . Oppressed and confused, she rejected the restless vision and called up in its place the old Fifth Avenue, the Fifth Avenue still intact at her marriage, a thoroughfare of monotonously ugly brown houses divided by a thin trickle of horse-drawn carriages; and she saw her mother-in-law, in just such a richly-curtained window, looking down, with dry mental comments, on old Mrs. Chivers’s C-spring barouche and Mrs. Beaufort’s new chestnut steppers, and knowing how long ago the barouche had been imported from Paris, and how much had been paid for the steppers—for Mrs. Clephane senior belonged to the generation which still surveyed its world from an upper window, like the Dutch ancestresses to whom the doings of the street were reported by a little mirror.",

Some said Neil Armstrong had named the valley. Flying overhead had reminded him of the moon. It really did look like something not of this earth. Nothing grew there except for a scattering of cacti of many species. Following the descriptions in the travel journal, it was not difficult to recognise the San Pedro cactus. Some of the stumps were carved with names and dates. I looked around for a nice, clean specimen and found one to my liking. I checked out the seven ribs and the spacing of the thorns. Everything was exactly right. I cut off about a foot and a half of the trunk with my pocket knife. Dede put it carefully in my pack, and off we marched.",

When he was a teenager, Perry’s parents had found out he was gay and immediately taken him to a paediatrician for examination. The doctor prescribed Perry five psychotropic medications (like Prozac and Xanax) simultaneously – medications that, even taken individually, warranted close supervision, especially in young people. Perry’s doses were insanely high. After a week, he was unable to walk. The doctor increased the dose, but, upon inspecting Perry a few weeks later, had to make an admission to the parents.",

I jumped in and followed the crowd deeper into the old city, a warren of cobbled streets and fancy boutiques spreading west from the water. After a few minutes’ walk, the procession turned to cut across one side of a large cobbled square lined with cafés and pretty trees. Open-sided trucks sold an array of artery-clogging regional cuisine: Belgian-style fries with mayonnaise, kibbeling fish nuggets, bratwurst hotdogs and greasy oliebollen donuts. I bought a paper plate of poffertjes – coin-sized pancakes slathered with butter and icing sugar – and immediately regretted it. Through the crowd I spotted two men in giant homemade Lego costumes struggling to use a portable urinal, liquid spattering on unwieldy cardboard boxes as their monstrous yellow heads rested on the ground behind them. Nearby, a pair of Japanese tourists stared in amazement at another urinal, a high-tech cylinder of polished steel that had just ascended from beneath the pavement.",

Our tickets were for the side upper and lower berths, which were ideal for such a long journey. Passengers in those seats have no reason to share sitting space with anyone else and can gaze out of the window all day. But side berths cause issues at night. They are narrower than the main berths of a 2A compartment and leave the lower passenger more susceptible to a face full of passing backside, and the upper passenger more likely to stay awake due to conferences that often take place in the aisle at unsociable hours. Claustrophobics will also want to avoid the upper berth, as the three closed sides and one drawn curtain create the feeling of lying in a moving coffin. It was barely midday, so sleep was a long way off.",

The group came upon a herd of cape buffalo, animals that can appear calm but are notoriously mean-spirited. The driver wanted his visitors to get a better view of the herd so he backed the vehicle into the bush with the intention of turning around. As often happens when driving in the bush, the vehicle became stuck. The herd moved toward the truck and the driver told everyone to be extremely still. The cape buffalo examined the vehicle and its occupants closely. One even ventured toward the passenger side of the vehicle and came face-to-face with the elderly woman sitting there. She remained frozen like a statue as the animal placed its face within inches of her own. She later reported that she could feel the heat coming from the animal’s nostrils. Then, after about ten seconds, the cape buffalo turned and walked away. No harm done, except the woman was traumatized.",

This is the peninsula of Azuera, a wild chaos of sharp rocks and stony levels cut about by vertical ravines. It lies far out to sea like a rough head of stone stretched from a green-clad coast at the end of a slender neck of sand covered with thickets of thorny scrub. Utterly waterless, for the rainfall runs off at once on all sides into the sea, it has not soil enough—it is said—to grow a single blade of grass, as if it were blighted by a curse. The poor, associating by an obscure instinct of consolation the ideas of evil and wealth, will tell you that it is deadly because of its forbidden treasures. The common folk of the neighbourhood, peons of the estancias, vaqueros of the seaboard plains, tame Indians coming miles to market with a bundle of sugarcane or a basket of maize worth about threepence, are well aware that heaps of shining gold lie in the gloom of the deep precipices cleaving the stony levels of Azuera. Tradition has it that many adventurers of olden time had perished in the search. The story goes also that within men’s memory two wandering sailors—Americanos, perhaps, but gringos of some sort for certain—talked over a gambling, good-for-nothing mozo, and the three stole a donkey to carry for them a bundle of dry sticks, a water-skin, and provisions enough to last a few days. Thus accompanied, and with revolvers at their belts, they had started to chop their way with machetes through the thorny scrub on the neck of the peninsula.",

    "target_paragraph": "I arrived in Cordova on the ferry, seasick and jelly-legged and curious. I left Cordova on a plane, an initiate into the cult of boats, but not a full-fledged member. Over four months spent seaside, I rode in or on a raft, a jet boat, a kayak, a ferry, a Whaler, a bowpicker, a canoe, and a wildlife cruise ship. I piloted, briefly and illegally, the crew boat, with Gabe’s licensed hand ready to take the wheel, and the row oars of the raft on a mellow section of the Copper until, after about half an hour, my saw-weary shoulders went numb. I unloaded and loaded boats, backed the trailer into its spot in the yard (but not down the steep boat ramp at the harbor, in front of all the fishermen), helped repair the prop on the Evinrude, filled fuel cans, changed spark plugs, recoiled pull cords, and bettered my bowline, which I could almost do one-handed (not quite). Yet of all the tools I’d used for work and loved, the boat remained the most resistant. I knew it would take me seasons longer to become a true pro, comfortable on the water with chop and wind and passengers who leaned too far over the side and made my stomach clench. I wouldn’t have that time. Our Cordova season was to remain singular, epic, almost mythic in status. The time I’d look back on fondly from farther inland, those months when I got my feet wet, and fell, tentatively, in love with the sea.",

    "target_paragraph": "We camped that night six hours from Sheramiyeh in a sheltered place among the hills beside a spring of which the waters were bitter with sulphur and not unmixed with pitch; our companions drank of it, but my servants and I quaffed royally from the flasks which Jusef had filled at the Tigris. While the tents were being pitched I walked to the top of the hills, and on the banks of watercourses that had but recently run dry I found flowers, blue larkspurs and purple gentians and a wide selection of the thistle family. A bowl of larkspurs was set upon my dinner-table, and Jusef was very loath to throw them away when we struck camp, so rare and delicate a possession did they seem to us. But I assured him that the German professors at ?al’at Shergat would have flowers fairer than these. A more wonderful sight was in store for us on the next day’s march. We had travelled barely two hours when we splashed into a pool of rain-water, and then into another; there was grass round them, green, abundant grass: “More than we have seen all the way from Aleppo!” exclaimed Jusef. The region of the drought was over, and when our path led us to the top of the Jebel ?amrin, here sunk to a low hog’s back, I was scarcely surprised to see the slopes down to the Tigris red with poppies. But even the poppies could not withhold the eye from the great mound of ?al’at Shergat by the river’s edge, the mound of Asshur, crowned with the crumbling mass of a huge zigurrat, the temple pyramid of the tutelary god of the Assyrians. With the general aspect of the first capital of Assyria I was already familiar, thanks to the excellent photographs published by the German Orient-Gesellschaft, but I was not prepared for so magnificent a prospect. The Tigris in high flood washed the foot of the temple mound; far away to the north ran the snow-clad barrier of mountains whence its waters flow?a barrier which Nature planted in vain against the valour of the Assyrian armies; and across the river the fertile plain stretched away in long undulations to where Arbela lies behind low hills. Bountiful gods had showered their gifts upon the land.",

These guys exploding in infectious laughter over a missed shot at deuce, and flashing their hands so that scissors cut paper, were among the ones who made the so-called Japanese miracle, rebuilding their country after the war in record time, so that, very soon, their kids could spend summers in Redondo Beach, their wives could take three-day trips to Fairbanks to catch the Northern Lights. They’re the ones who bulldozed all the broken buildings to the ground so as to erect this gleaming, ultramodern spectacle. It’s almost as if they constructed the airport runway that now allows their loved ones to fly away.",
