This room was quiet too and empty and she stopped against him half turning, and they kissed. But she freed her mouth presently and moved again and he drew the piano bench out and they sat on opposite sides of it and kissed again. “You haven’t told me you love me,” Belle said, touching his face with her fingertips, and the fine devastation of his hair. “Not in a long time.”",

To Christopher it seemed like Yorkshire. He had a vision of Mark, standing on the lawn at Groby, in his bowler hat and with his umbrella, whilst the shooters walked over the lawn, and up the hill to the butts. Mark probably never had done that; but it was so that his image always presented itself to his brother. Mark was considering that one of the folds of his umbrella was disarranged. He seriously debated with himself whether he should unfold it at once and refold it—which was a great deal of trouble to take!—or whether he should leave it till he got to his club, where he would tell the porter to have it done at once. That would mean that he would have to walk for a mile and a quarter through London with a disarranged umbrella, which was disagreeable.",

A very nice young Frenchwoman, of the lower middle class, and her mechanic husband run this hotel which is also the garage and gasoline pump. She has been here for twelve years; in another year and a half they mean to return to France, as they cannot stick the new black régime. I gather that this revulsion is due to “pagaille”—disorder, not knowing where one stands, sudden taxes, etc.—rather than to colour prejudice.",

A beefy guy dripping with sweat was breaking up rocks with an enormous sledgehammer. Below him, a thick-mustached Latino guy and a well-tanned younger man with glistening olive skin, were both struggling with crowbars to level one of the massive stepping-stones along the trail, shimming it with the broken rock fragments.

A composite feeling, made up of disgust with the, to him, humdrum tædium of a farmer’s life, gloomy images of her who lay in the churchyard, remorse, and a general aversion to his wife’s society impelled him to seek a home in any place on earth save Weatherbury. The sad accessories of Fanny’s end confronted him as vivid pictures which threatened to be indelible, and made life in Bathsheba’s house intolerable. At three in the afternoon he found himself at the foot of a slope more than a mile in length, which ran to the ridge of a range of hills lying parallel with the shore, and forming a monotonous barrier between the basin of cultivated country inland and the wilder scenery of the coast. Up the hill stretched a road perfectly straight and perfectly white, the two sides approaching each other in a gradual taper till they met the sky at the top about two miles off. Throughout the length of this narrow and irksome inclined plane not a sign of life was visible on this garish afternoon. Troy toiled up the road with a languor and depression greater than any he had experienced for many a day and year before. The air was warm and muggy, and the top seemed to recede as he approached.",

We’d spent four days with Signor Martini, who had a dark little office on Via Sacco e Vanzetti down in the lower town. Above his desk hung a photo of him as a soldier, I assumed for Mussolini. He listened to us as though we spoke perfect Italian. When we finished describing what we thought we wanted, he rose, put on his Borsolino, and said one word, “Andiamo,” let’s go. Although he’d recently had a foot operation, he drove us over nonexistent roads and pushed through jungles of thorns to show us places only he knew about. Some were farmhouses with roofs collapsed onto the floor, miles from town and costing the earth. One had a tower built by the Crusaders, but the contessa who owned it cried and doubled the price on the spot when she saw that we really were interested. Another was attached to other farmhouses where chickens were truly free range—they ran in and out of the houses. The yard was full of rusted farm equipment and hogs. Several felt airless or sat hard by the road. One would have required putting in a road—it was hidden in blackberry brambles and we could only peer in one window because a coiled black snake refused to budge from the threshold.",

Undine’s preference was for the worldly parties, at which games were played, and she returned home laden with prizes in Dutch silver,5 but she was duly impressed by the debating clubs, where ladies of local distinction addressed the company from an improvised platform, or the members argued on subjects of such imperishable interest as: “What is charm?” or “The Problem-Novel”—after which pink lemonade and rainbow sandwiches were consumed amid heated discussion of the “ethical aspect” of the question.",

I felt lucky to be able to push through with our expedition?a unique challenge which I had been planning for some months. One of the aims of this adventure was to cross a section of the world’s largest island, Greenland, on fatbikes, off-road bicycles with oversized tires, in the middle of winter, as the first all-female team. Up until our departure date, the team and I had been monitoring the situation carefully, keeping our fingers crossed that this fundraising and awareness-building expedition could still go ahead. Once again, the objective was to raise funds for underprivileged women affected by climate change in the Asia region. I chose Greenland because after trekking far away to Siberia and Antarctica, I knew I had to seek out this last final frozen frontier.",

The away fans behind the glass screen jumped and cheered at the sudden change in their fortunes: 2–1 down with half an hour to play, Cambuur had a fighting chance.

She knelt before the fire and looked out into the room. The light fell softly, but with clear radiance, through shades of yellow and blue paper, and the room, which was set with one or two sofas resembling grassy mounds in their lack of shape, looked unusually large and quiet. Mary was led to think of the heights of a Sussex down, and the swelling green circle of some camp of ancient warriors. The moonlight would be falling there so peacefully now, and she could fancy the rough pathway of silver upon the wrinkled skin of the sea.",

Decoud, leaning his back against the wall, listened with crossed arms and lowered eyelids. He drank the tones of her even voice, and watched the agitated life of her throat, as if waves of emotion had run from her heart to pass out into the air in her reasonable words. He also had his aspirations, he aspired to carry her away out of these deadly futilities of pronunciamientos and reforms. All this was wrong—utterly wrong; but she fascinated him, and sometimes the sheer sagacity of a phrase would break the charm, replace the fascination by a sudden unwilling thrill of interest. Some women hovered, as it were, on the threshold of genius, he reflected. They did not want to know, or think, or understand. Passion stood for all that, and he was ready to believe that some startlingly profound remark, some appreciation of character, or a judgment upon an event, bordered on the miraculous. In the mature Antonia he could see with an extraordinary vividness the austere schoolgirl of the earlier days. She seduced his attention; sometimes he could not restrain a murmur of assent; now and then he advanced an objection quite seriously. Gradually they began to argue; the curtain half hid them from the people in the sala.",

First we couldn't go outside the town limits, and then some of my friends were shot at while riding, and we had to give up hacking even inside the Settlement. The shops ran short of things, Chinese acquaintances quietly disappeared, and there came a time when the staff of my college, with the exception of me, moved to Hong Kong because, it was explained, students from the interior could no longer get to Shanghai. This was just about when the European war started. But Europe was a long way off, and in any case the war didn't so much break on the world as slither onstage. I didn't really notice it until I tried to get an entry permit for Hong Kong—for I was going to Chungking, and had to cross the colony on the way—and found a bit more difficulty travelling than I had encountered in the past. I got the permit, of course: I had a good reason to go to Chungking, I explained, because it was arranged that I should interview Madame Chiang there, where the government had withdrawn from the advancing Japanese. But it meant filling in more forms.",

The nearby agricultural town of Zungri has an immensely fascinating archeological site from the medieval period that I visited on another occasion. Carved into the foothills of Mount Poro is a complex of cave dwellings that date from the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries. The settlement is made up of one- and two-room houses, a few even have two stories. Windows, arches, air vents for smoke, and inside the individual rooms, different sized and shaped niches have been carved out of the volcanic stone. The units are grouped together and connected by a network of narrow streets and steps as well as a system of water channels and cisterns. Both functional and attractive, the long-abandoned structures with their natural, white walls and stone additions organically blend with their environment. Their inhabitants, in turn, were afforded a magnificent view of the surrounding countryside.",

At the top of one wall are the scores of monks who are in jail, forbidden to wear their robes or to preach. Another collection shows the eighty-five faces of those known to have died in prison since 1988 because of maltreatment or lack of medical attention. The photographs are of varying quality: some are old black-and-white passport shots, others are clipped from snapshots of happier occasions. Many of the men and women they depict are locked away behind the walls of Insein Prison. As I looked at the varied colours and shapes of the photographs, they seemed to resemble a jigsaw puzzle that was gradually being assembled piece by piece, and managed to give the impression that all these broken lives could one day be put back together again.",

Indeed, the mosquitos of the leeward coast, to whose attacks one becomes inured in a few months, are the only physical drawback. The open-air life is most conducive to health, and the climate is absolutely perfect, owing to its equability and purity. Whether the steady heat of Honolulu, the languid airs of Hilo, the balmy breezes of Onomea, the cool bluster of Waimea, or the odorous stillness of Kona, it is always the same. The grim gloom of our anomalous winters, the harsh malignant winds of our springs, and the dismal rains and overpowering heats of our summers, have no counterpart in the endless spring-time of Hawaii.",

He had had his own studio once and he had used everything. There was no stop Stahr could pull that would surprise him. His task was the delivery of situations, and Stahr by effective business could not outplay him on his own grounds.

He vaguely said she was, and showed a tendency to get back to the ruins nearer at hand, which I dodged by observing that she must make a perfect picture in her castle in Thuringia, the background being so harmonious, such an appropriate setting for an old lady, for, as is well known, the castle grounds contain the most magnificent ruins in Europe. “And your august Aunt, my dear Lord Sigismund,” I continued, “is I am certain not one whit less magnificent than the rest.”",

He felt angry with the brutal tumult of earth and sky for taking him unawares and checking unfairly a generous readiness for narrow escapes. Otherwise he was rather glad he had not gone into the cutter, since a lower achievement had served the turn. He had enlarged his knowledge more than those who had done the work. When all men flinched, then — he felt sure — he alone would know how to deal with the spurious menace of wind and seas. He knew what to think of it. Seen dispassionately, it seemed contemptible. He could detect no trace of emotion in himself, and the final effect of a staggering event was that, unnoticed and apart from the noisy crowd of boys, he exulted with fresh certitude in his avidity for adventure, and in a sense of many-sided courage.",
