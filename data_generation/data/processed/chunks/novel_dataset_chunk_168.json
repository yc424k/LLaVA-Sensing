It does not observe the pale lines of old drove-ways that seam the soft-stone counties of England, or the tawny outlines of the south-western moors. It fails to record the ceaseless movement of mud within the estuaries of the Wash, and it is inattentive to texture, smell and sound: to the way oak pollen and fireweed seeds drift in wind, to the different shadows cast by mountains, to the angles of repose of boulders at the base of Pennine crags. It ignores the mists of Dartmoor, which are as thick, fluid and quick as milk, and the black peat of Rannoch, so liquid that a human footprint is dissolved within hours. It is blind to the chosen perches of goshawks in the forests of the Dark Peak, or the hunting paths of the sparrowhawks of Cambridgeshire.",

Never were the pines more pungent than after the long heat, and their rosy stems flushed pinker as I passed.

Encouraged by one U.S. president, his conservative mentor Theodore Roosevelt, and motivated by his antipathy toward the sitting White House occupant, his former Princeton boss Woodrow Wilson, Bingham lobbied successfully for a role as an alternate delegate to the 1916 Republican National Convention in Chicago. As war raged in Europe, he channeled his organizational skills into the “preparedness” movement, urging the United States military to be ready to join the battle against Germany. At age forty-one, he volunteered to join the Yale Corps of the Connecticut National Guard, which he hoped would pursue the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa, who’d attacked an American cavalry unit in New Mexico. Instead, Major Hiram Bingham put his new pilot’s license to use starting in April 1917, when he was deputized to organize flight schools to train America’s first generation of military airmen. By Armistice Day in 1918, eight thousand men were under his command in France.",

That was less than a year ago, and she looked back with amazement at the effect which that chance encounter had had on her. She seemed hardly to be suffering more now than she had suffered then. It had seemed unbearable, impossible, at the moment, that Chris Fenno should enter, even so episodically, so remotely, into her new life; and here he was, ensconced in its very centre, in complete possession of it.",

A broad flight of stone steps was overlooked silently from a niche in the wall by a Madonna in blue robes with the crowned child sitting on her arm. Subdued voices ascended in the early mornings from the paved well of the quadrangle, with the stamping of horses and mules led out in pairs to drink at the cistern. A tangle of slender bamboo stems drooped its narrow, blade-like leaves over the square pool of water, and the fat coachman sat muffled up on the edge, holding lazily the ends of halters in his hand. Barefooted servants passed to and fro, issuing from dark, low doorways below; two laundry girls with baskets of washed linen; the baker with the tray of bread made for the day; Leonarda—her own camerista—bearing high up, swung from her hand raised above her raven black head, a bunch of starched underskirts dazzlingly white in the slant of sunshine. Then the old porter would hobble in, sweeping the flagstones, and the house was ready for the day. All the lofty rooms on three sides of the quadrangle opened into each other and into the corrédor, with its wrought-iron railings and a border of flowers, whence, like the lady of the mediaeval castle, she could witness from above all the departures and arrivals of the Casa, to which the sonorous arched gateway lent an air of stately importance.",

Currents of water rushed through switchbacks leaving crevasses that took ten minutes to drop into and climb out of again, more topography than trail. If I hadn’t seen it the week before with my own eyes, I’d never have believed water could change something that quickly. The rocks we’d cached for our stairs were gone, as well as the section of trail the stairs had climbed. We paired up on the rock bar, four hands and 250 pounds reefing on debris the size of kitchen appliances—Refrigerator Rock, we named one, taller than me by a foot. We leveraged precarious rocks over the ends of switchbacks, hooting as one-ton boulders catapulted like tumbleweeds into gullies that swallowed them up. We spent days grubbing, prying, digging through fill ten feet deep, cutting our hands through our gloves on rough edges, falling into our bunks at night too sore to move. Talking to tourists, we shook our heads: Never seen anything like it. Even our foreman, working trails since the seventies, agreed it was epic. It seemed as if every single piece of sediment on the whole mountainside had traded places with something else. As if heft were weightless. As if permanence, fleeting.",

Short of shooting them, there could be no clearer warning to Russians to keep away from foreigners. The main streets in Moscow can only have been built for six tanks in line abreast. You could cross through long tunnels at specified points or run like hell; the traffic was scant but always practising for the Monte Carlo Rally. There may be many crooked old cobbled streets of small wood houses and assorted nooks and crannies of picturesque charm.

In this nine-storey monstrosity (by Swiss chalet out of Stalin) the post-Ceausescu habit of heating buildings had not yet caught on though icicles hung from everything in sight, including the non-functioning lavatory cisterns. In the restaurant a merry party of eight foresters wore mittens, and sheepskin jackets with the collars rolled up, and fox-fur hats with the ear-flaps pulled down. They were celebrating their team leader’s winning of 10,000 lei in the National Lottery by mixing cognac, white wine, tuica and beer, which seemed to me unwise. I little realised how soon I was to be the victim of their unwisdom. The walls of the vast restaurant were 90 per cent glass, something perhaps appreciated by summer visitors though the view was restricted to a cliff-face covered in dwarf pine. Astonishingly, supper was served hot: a heavy-duty soup of potatoes, tinned peas and tender (non-Bulgarian) chicken, followed by a massif of crisp chips, thick slices of flavoursome fried pork, the inevitable bowl of pickled cabbage and a bottle of excellent Iasi dry white wine – all for seventy pence.",

Spirit of raspberries, or their ghost – this crystalline distillation, twinkling and ice-cold in its misty goblet, looked as though it were homoeopathically in league with the weather. Sipped or swallowed, it went shuddering through its new home and branched out in patterns – or so it seemed after a second glass – like the ice-ferns that covered the window panes, but radiating warmth and happiness instead of cold, and carrying a ghostly message of comfort to the uttermost fimbria. Fierce winters give birth to their antidotes: Kümmel, Vodka, Aquavit, Danziger Goldwasser. Oh for a thimble full of the cold north! Fiery-frosty potions, sequin-flashers, rife with spangles to spark fuses in the bloodstream, revive fainting limbs, and send travellers rocketing on through snow and ice. White fire, red cheek, heat me and speed me. This discovery cast a glow over the approach of Linz. A few miles on, round a loop of river, the city appeared. It was a vision of domes and belfries gathered under a stern fortress and linked by bridges to a smaller town at the foot of a mountain on the other bank.",

    "target_paragraph": "One warm spring day, Vance Weston strode along between the ruts, past squares of Swedish market-gardening and raw pastures waiting for the boom. These were the days when he liked the expectancy of Crampton better than the completeness of Euphoria--days of the sudden prairie spring, when the lilacs in his grandmother’s dooryard were bursting, and the maples by the river fringing themselves with rosy keys, when the earth throbbed with renewal and the heavy white clouds moved across the sky like flocks of teeming ewes. In a clump of trees near the road a bird began over and over its low tentative song, and in the ditches a glossy-leaved weed, nameless to Vance, spangled the mud with golden chalices. He felt a passionate desire to embrace the budding earth and everything that stirred and swelled in it. He was irritated by the fact that he did not know the name of the bird, or of the yellow flowers. “I should like to give everything its right name, and to know why that name was the right one,” he thought; the names of things had always seemed to him as closely and mysteriously a part of them as his skin or eyelashes of himself. What was the use of all he had been taught in college if the commonest objects on this familiar earth were so remote and inexplicable? There were botany manuals, and scientific books on the shapes and action of clouds; but what he wanted to get at was something deeper, something which must have belonged to flowers and clouds before ever man was born to dissect them. Besides, he wasn’t in the mood for books, with this spring air caressing him. . . .",

I twice rode up and down the side road that, as far as I could remember, led to my destination, before I noticed that one of the houses had a back door plastered with surf stickers. One of them read ICY WAVES SURF SHOP: THE FAR NORTH SHORE. I took two steps toward the house, and a very unhappy guard dog rushed out to meet me, stopped short by his chain. The dog apparently doubled as a doorbell, because a head popped out, silenced the beast, and invited me to come around back.",

Accordingly as the carriage drew abreast of her in climbing the long ascent she walked close to the wheels, the rays of the nearest lamp penetrating her very pores. She had only just dropped behind when the carriage stopped, and to her surprise the coachman asked her over his shoulder if she would ride. What made the question more surprising was that it came in obedience to an order from the interior of the vehicle.",

I found a clarification on the website later: “Naturalistic plantings try to recreate the emotional experience of being in nature. While the gardens may feel natural, they are anything but. Plants that would never meet in the wild are planted together here in manufactured soil. The gardeners weed, water, prune, edit, and shape. Human intervention is a constant and many conditions of the site are artificial.”",

Sometimes at night, from our beds, we see heat lightning light up the whole beach – it looks like someone is turning on a giant light bulb every few minutes.

As it turned out, the flash flood didn’t have enough power to carry away the vehicle or even to do any lasting damage.

Thereupon, he was renounced by his disciples. At dusk he sat himself beneath a pipal tree with his face toward the East, vowing that though his skin and nerves and bones should waste away and his life-blood dry, he would not leave this seat until he had attained Supreme Enlightenment. All that night, beset by demons, Sakyamuni sat in meditation. And in that golden daybreak, it is told, the Self-Awakened One truly perceived the Morning Star, as if seeing it for the first time in his life.",
