There was never any question that he would return.",

Rich corpses reside above ground in their individual apartments in what we call ‘Death Villages’. A macabre form of protection racketeering is associated with this distinction.

    "target_paragraph": "The White House and the CIA were so conspiratorial that they didn’t tell their ambassador to Chile about their plans to ensure Allende didn’t take his seat. Hersh compares White House behaviour regarding Chile with its conduct during Watergate: cover-up payments for CIA crimes, the destruction of records and the distortion of documents, perjured evidence to Congressional investigating committees and liaisons with violent, unscrupulous men. Was Washington so afraid because of its two top-secret National Security Agency facilities operating on offshore Chilean territory and monitoring Soviet submarines, among other things? Both sites were evacuated overnight when Allende came to power. No, it wasn’t undercover security facilities which set White House passions alight. The reaction was more visceral – a white-hot scream of hatred. Nixon had developed a pathological antipathy towards Chile; David Frost records in his memoirs that it was the subject Nixon’s aides warned him off before he interviewed the President. This high-level animosity was duly translated into policy and cultural indoctrination and funded by millions of dollars, right down to the distribution of comics on the streets of Chilean towns and villages reinforcing the ‘good’ US image over the ‘evil’ of Communism.",

Onto the facade, in 1980, were projected images of the facade as conceived by various artists. These superimposed images are preserved for us in photographs, which were then displayed in Ricchi. This is as nice a case of eating your cake and having it too as I have ever encountered; how pleased Brunelleschi must be to see his church take on so many new aspects while forever remaining the same.",

    "target_paragraph": "Freed from the burden of war, the United Provinces boomed. Under the terms of the Treaty of Westphalia the river Scheldt, in present-day Belgium, was closed to international shipping. At a stroke, the city of Antwerp went from being one of the world’s great trading hubs to a relative backwater. Amsterdam and Rotterdam were quick to exploit their rival’s demise, and the United Provinces embarked on a period of extraordinary economic growth. Dutch merchants and explorers set off on long sea voyages that would create an empire spanning the globe. Canals were dug, windmills constructed and waterlogged fields drained. Wealthy merchants built grand canal houses, churches and civic buildings, and sponsored the careers of artists such as Rembrandt and Vermeer. Within the space of a few decades, the new country became a world centre of art, architecture, science and culture. The war with the Spanish had exacted a terrible toll, but its end marked the beginning of what came to be known as the Dutch Golden Age.",

Now taking her lump of chalk she draws figures, six, seven, eight, and then a cross and then a line on the blackboard. What is the answer? The others look; they look with understanding. Louis writes; Susan writes; Neville writes; Jinny writes; even Bernard has now begun to write. But I cannot write. I see only figures. The others are handing in their answers, one by one. Now it is my turn. But I have no answer. The others are allowed to go. They slam the door. Miss Hudson goes. I am left alone to find an answer. The figures mean nothing now. Meaning has gone. The clock ticks. The two hands are convoys marching through a desert. The black bars on the clock face are green oases. The long hand has marched ahead to find water. The other, painfully stumbles among hot stones in the desert. It will die in the desert. The kitchen door slams. Wild dogs bark far away. Look, the loop of the figure is beginning to fill with time; it holds the world in it. I begin to draw a figure and the world is looped in it, and I myself am outside the loop; which I now join—so—and seal up, and make entire. The world is entire, and I am outside of it, crying, “Oh save me, from being blown for ever outside the loop of time!” ’",

    "target_paragraph": "In 1760 Horace-Bénédict de Saussure identified the Alps as a new world – a sort of ‘earthly paradise’ – and began his systematic exploration of them. De Saussure had certainly read Windham’s letter, and had paid a visit to Pococke’s rock on the Mer de Glace, and when he sought to characterize the appearance of the glacier he made use, in a finessed form, of Windham’s image. The glacier looks, wrote de Saussure, like ‘a sea which has become suddenly frozen, not in the moment of a tempest, but at the instant when the wind has subsided, and the waves, although very high, have become blunted and rounded.’ It was this passage which Karl Baedeker quoted in every edition of his guidebook to Switzerland, and that therefore fixed and froze it in the minds of the thousands of Victorians who came to observe the wonders of the glacier: they could conceive of it in no other way. Windham had, from a distance of over a hundred years, whipped up the imaginations of the glacier-goers, and then frozen them with a single metaphor.",

Here flowed an erratic river which we had to ford often, but in spite of a very fast current this was not difficult as the water never came above thigh-level and the bed was of firm gravel. Though this valley is about half-a-mile wide it is not cultivable, being merely a dried-up river-course which later in the season will be entirely submerged, and its stony surface was not appreciated by the barefooted Tibetans. Many of them had started out proudly wearing formidable mountaineering boots, acquired from various expeditions, but soon these unbearably unfamiliar prestige symbols had been transferred from feet to shoulders. Now the sight of so many bare feet on such cruel stones caused me considerable vicarious pain, so I urged a temporary resumption of boots; but this idea was at once rejected and in consequence we made slow progress during the next ninety minutes.",

    "target_paragraph": "CHAPTER X\nLions in the Rain\nMark\nDeception Valley\nJanuary 1976\nDear Mother & Dad,\nWe could not have known what the Kalahari had in store for us. All through September, October, November, and December the rains did not come, and at the beginning of January there was not a cloud in the sky. The temperatures soared past 120 degrees in the shade, and the wind blew hot as a blast furnace across the dry, dusty valley. As in the previous dry season, for weeks we were able to do nothing but lie on our cots, dizzy from the heat and covered in wet towels. We tried to conserve our energy so that we could work at night, but by sundown we were always weak from heat fatigue. We ate salt tablets like candy, and our joints ached continuously. We just existed. The sun and wind seemed determined to sear and strip the last vestige of life from the dry Kalahari.\nBut if the heat was bad for us, it was much worse for the animals. There were no antelope on the old riverbed, and only a few ground squirrels and birds scratched around for food. In the sandveld, gemsbok pawed deep holes in the ground, searching for the fleshy, succulent roots and tubers from which they could get enough moisture and nourishment to stay alive. Giraffe stood spraddle-legged in dry water holes, dragging their heads through the dust in the shimmering heat. The nights were deathly quiet, empty of all sound except the occasional squawk of a korhaan or the cry of a lonely jackal.\nThen in mid-January, puffs of snow-white cumulus clouds began to appear each day, softening the harsh glare of the desert sky. But, like apparitions, they disappeared into the great void of heat that gripped the Kalahari. Again and again the clouds challenged the inert high-pressure system that locked the land in drought. Each day they grew, until they stood like great cathedrals with massive columns in the sky. As if in anticipation, small herds of springbok began appearing on the riverbed, their bodies a misshapen illusion in the silent waves of midday heat. They seemed to understand the language of the distant, rumbling clouds. The sky beneath was streaked with rain; we could smell it. Standing at the edge of camp, we willed the storms toward us, but they would not come. And we knew it might not rain at all.\nThen, late one afternoon the clouds were back, stacked closely, dark mountains of vapor growing over the valley. A black squall line dropped low and rolled toward the riverbed. The trees seemed to quiver, and we could feel the thunder deep in our chests. Lightning cut across the sky, swirling clouds swept over the dunes, and fingers of sand raced down the slopes with the rushing wind. The sweet fragrance of rain was everywhere, and like an avalanche, the storm broke over the parched desert. We could not contain ourselves. Laughing and singing, we ran from the camp to meet the stinging wall of wind and rain. We danced around, and even rolled in the mud. The storm meant the rebirth of our spirits and new life for the Kalahari. It rained and rained, and that storm ushered in the Kalahari wet season. No wonder that pula is the most important word in Setswana. It means “rain” and is both a greeting and the name for a unit of Botswana’s currency.\nIt must truly be one of the wonders of the world to see the Kalahari change from a bleak desert to a verdant paradise. Through eons of time, all the life in the desert has adapted to these extreme conditions and dramatic changes. Animals and plants alike wasted no time getting reproduction into full swing to take advantage of the short and unreliable rainy season. Every living thing from grasshoppers to giraffe, jackals, and gemsbok quickly give birth to their young before the dry season begins all over again. It would be a major challenge for an animal behaviorist to describe the facial expression of a male springbok, who, after standing alone for months on his dusty midden, suddenly looks up to see 2000 females prancing into his territory.\nBefore dawn one morning another heavy storm charged into the valley. Howling winds drove sheets of rain through camp, and lightning cast the shadows of frenzied trees on the billowing wall of our tent. Before long the legs of our cots stood eight inches deep in water, and we lay listening to the symphony of the thunder accompanied by the wind and rain on canvas. When the storm had passed, the Kalahari stood in soggy silence, as though holding its breath while drinking the life-giving moisture. The only sound was the pok-pok-pok of water dripping on the tent from the trees overhead. Then the deep roar of a lion, the first of the season, rolled through the valley on the still dawn air.\nWe slogged over to the truck through ankle-deep mud and water and headed north along the riverbed in the direction of the call. North Pan was wreathed in a thin layer of ground fog, and just as the sun appeared over East Dune, a big male lion stepped through a golden curtain of swirling mist. We stopped some distance away, in case he was a stranger and not used to us. Lifting his head, his sides heaving, he came toward us, his bellows punctuated with puffs of vapor. At the truck he stood five feet away, listening for an answer to his calls. And then we saw it—the orange tag, number 001, clipped in his ear. It was Bones!\nYou cannot know the feeling, and we cannot explain it. He looked at us for several long moments, and then he walked south along the valley, roaring. We wondered where he had been since June, eight months earlier; how far he had traveled, and in which direction. Was he looking for his Blue Pride females? So far we have not seen them, but we hope to anytime now. We followed him to camp, where he sunned himself while we ate breakfast.\nOur research is going well, and we are both in good health. Will mail this in a few weeks when we go to Maun for supplies, and we hope to hear from all of you then. We miss you all very much.\nLove,\nDelia and Mark",

But for this ornament, and a copy of “The Hound of the Baskervilles”2 which lay beside it, the room showed no traces of human use, and Mrs. Spragg herself wore as complete an air of detachment as if she had been a wax figure in a show-window. Her attire was fashionable enough to justify such a post, and her pale soft-cheeked face, with puffy eye-lids and drooping mouth, suggested a partially-melted wax figure which had run to double-chin.",

On her first trip to America, she marveled at the aisles of produce in U.S. supermarkets and the internet access that was everywhere, all the time. And although she kept a lookout for mounds of stinking garbage like the one that plagued her corner in Guanabacoa, she never encountered any. In March 2016, when President Obama became the first American president since Calvin Coolidge to visit Havana, she would be invited to join other self-employed Cubans to meet with him. Seated at a newly opened craft brewery on the Havana waterfront, she heard Obama say that it was time to recognize the differences between their two countries and to move ahead, and she agreed wholeheartedly. She had been raised on slogans like “Cuba sí, yanqui no,” but seeing a black American president walking the streets of Havana with his pretty wife filled her with hope.",

    "target_paragraph": "THE HALL PORTER had telephoned, under the direction of the concierge, and it was the same motor boat that they had ridden in before.\nT5 Jackson was in the boat with the luggage, and the portrait, which had been well and sturdily wrapped. It was still blowing hard.\nThe Colonel had paid his bill and made the proper tips. The people of the hotel had put the luggage and the picture in the boat, and seen that Jackson was seated properly. Then they had retired.\n“Well, Daughter,” the Colonel said.\n“Can’t I ride with you to the garage?”\n“It would be just as bad at the garage.”\n“Please let me ride to the garage.”\n“All right,” the Colonel said. “It’s your show, really. Get in.”\nThey did not talk at all, and the wind was a stern wind so that, with what speed the old calamity of a motor made, there seemed almost to be no wind at all.\nAt the landing place, where Jackson was handing the luggage to a porter, and looking after the portrait himself, the Colonel said, “Do you want to say good-bye here?”\n“Do I have to?”\n“No.”\n“May I come up to the bar in the garage while they are getting the car down?”\n“That will be worse.”\n“I do not care.”\n“Get that stuff up to the garage, and have somebody look after it until you get the car down,” the Colonel said to Jackson. “Check on my guns and pack this stuff in a way to give the maximum space in the rear seat.”\n“Yes, sir,” Jackson said.\n“Am I going then?” the girl asked.\n“No,” the Colonel told her.\n“Why can’t I go?”\n“You know very well. You weren’t invited.”\n“Please don’t be bad.”\n“Christ, Daughter, if you knew how hard I am trying not to be. It’s easy if you’re bad. Let’s pay this good man off, and go over and sit on the bench there under the tree.”\nHe paid the owner of the motor boat, and told him that he had not forgotten about the jeep engine. He also told him not to count on it, but that there was a good chance that he could get it.\n“It will be a used engine. But it will be better than that coffee pot you have in there now.”\nThey went up the worn stone steps and walked across the gravel and sat on a bench under the trees.\nThe trees were black and moved in the wind, and there were no leaves on them. The leaves had fallen early, that year, and been swept up long ago.\nA man came over to offer postcards for sale and the Colonel told him, “Run along, son. We don’t need you now.”\nThe girl was crying, finally, although she had made the decision never to cry.\n“Look, Daughter,” the Colonel said. “There isn’t anything to say. They didn’t install shock-absorbers in this vehicle we ride in now.”\n“I’ve stopped,” she said. “I’m not an hysterical.”\n“I wouldn’t say you were. I’d say you were the loveliest and most beautiful girl that ever lived. Any time. Any place. Anywhere.”\n“If it were true, what difference would it make?”\n“You have me there,” the Colonel said. “But it is true.”\n“So now what?”\n“So now we stand up and kiss each other and say good-bye.”\n“What’s that?”\n“I don’t know,” the Colonel said. “I guess that is one of the things everybody has to figure out for themselves.”\n“I’ll try to figure it.”\n“Just take it as easy as you can, Daughter.”\n“Yes,” the girl said. “In the vehicle without the shock-absorbers.”\n“You were tumbril bait from the start.”\n“Can’t you do anything kindly?”\n“I guess not. But I’ve tried.”\n“Please keep on trying. That’s all the hope we have.”\n“I’ll keep on trying.”\nSo they held each other close and kissed each other hard and true, and the Colonel took the girl across the stretch of gravel and down the stone steps.\n“You ought to take a good one. Not that old displaced engine boat.”\n“I’d rather take the displaced engine boat if you don’t mind.”\n“Mind?” the Colonel said. “Not me. I only give orders and obey orders. I don’t mind. Good-bye, my dear, lovely, beautiful.”\n“Good-bye,” she said.",

The Kanwar was the owner of Chapslee House, a bastion of Victorian architecture, partially hidden by clay pots of nasturtiums and dog daisies and creepers knitting their way across the brickwork. Dressed in sports gear, with a fine crop of silver hair, the Kanwar wound his way through the tangle of tongues and tails and welcomed us across the lawn. He owned a moustache that must have been combed and set around a pair of heated rollers at bedtime. Extending both arms, he led us along a patchwork of paving stones to the main entrance, where the dogs hovered in dismay, knowing the house was off limits to their muddy paws.",

This was India in its most concentrated form. Delhi was teeming and vast, but its pockets of green offered space to breathe and time to stroll. Mumbai raged unharnessed: if you strolled you would be trampled, or at least knocked over by a cyclist. Even the tendency towards idling was noticeably absent. In Mumbai, everyone meant business and the feeling was addictive. This was our second visit to Mumbai and as the tide of commuters swept its way through the halls of CST, dragging us with it, a familiar thrill heated up my blood – or perhaps it was just an early symptom of malaria. Mumbai was a city of dreams and a city of nightmares, of hopes and of horrors – and I hoped to find the latter on the spaghetti trails of its commuter trains. After a month of smooth rides and few delays, it was time for a journey that would spice things up a little.",

When the curtain rises the piano stops, and there is dead silence. On swings a knight, glittering, marching with that curious hippety lilt, and gazing round with fixed and martial eyes. He begins the prologue, telling us where we are. And dramatically he waves his sword and stamps his foot, and wonderfully sounds his male, martial, rather husky voice. Then the Paladins, his companions who are to accompany him, swing one by one on to the stage, till they are five in all, handsome knights, including the Babylonian Princess and the Knight of Britain. They stand in a handsome, glittering line. And then comes Merlin in his red robe. Merlin has a bright, fair, rather chubby face and blue eyes, and seems to typify the northern intelligence. He now tells them, in many words, how to proceed and what is to be done.",

Ascending a few steps he surveyed the large crowd gaping at him and the bullet-speckled walls of the houses opposite lightly veiled by a sunny haze of dust. The word “POURVENIR” in immense black capitals, alternating with broken windows, stared at him across the vast space; and he thought with delight of the hour of vengeance, because he was very sure of laying his hands upon Decoud. On his left hand, Gamacho, big and hot, wiping his hairy wet face, uncovered a set of yellow fangs in a grin of stupid hilarity. On his right, Señor Fuentes, small and lean, looked on with compressed lips. The crowd stared literally open-mouthed, lost in eager stillness, as though they had expected the great guerrillero, the famous Pedrito, to begin scattering at once some sort of visible largesse. What he began was a speech. He began it with the shouted word “Citizens!” which reached even those in the middle of the Plaza. Afterwards the greater part of the citizens remained fascinated by the orator’s action alone, his tip-toeing, the arms flung above his head with the fists clenched, a hand laid flat upon the heart, the silver gleam of rolling eyes, the sweeping, pointing, embracing gestures, a hand laid familiarly on Gamacho’s shoulder; a hand waved formally towards the little black-coated person of Señor Fuentes, advocate and politician and a true friend of the people. The vivas of those nearest to the orator bursting out suddenly propagated themselves irregularly to the confines of the crowd, like flames running over dry grass, and expired in the opening of the streets. In the intervals, over the swarming Plaza brooded a heavy silence, in which the mouth of the orator went on opening and shutting, and detached phrases—“The happiness of the people,” “Sons of the country,” “The entire world, el mundo entiero”—reached even the packed steps of the cathedral with a feeble clear ring, thin as the buzzing of a mosquito. But the orator struck his breast; he seemed to prance between his two supporters. It was the supreme effort of his peroration. Then the two smaller figures disappeared from the public gaze and the enormous Gamacho, left alone, advanced, raising his hat high above his head. Then he covered himself proudly and yelled out, “Ciudadanos!” A dull roar greeted Señor Gamacho, ex-peddler of the Campo, Commandante of the National Guards.",

Sometimes, just as the sun was going down, the evening fumes would mingle with the dung fires of the jhuggi-dwellers to form a perfectly straight sheet of mist along Lodhi Road. Beyond, the thick and dusty air would turn weird, unnatural colours in the gloaming: vivid, luminous mauves; dark, dingy crimsons; deep, bloody reds. Once I saw the great onion dome of Safdarjang’s Tomb illuminated by a beam from the doomed sun. The light remained constant for less than a minute, but it picked out the great Mughal tomb with an unearthly brightness, spot-lit against an abattoir sky.",

He would sit behind me and, whenever the teacher had his back turned, would hit me on the head with a two-by-four. Bonk . . . bonk . . . bonk, a nice steady rhythm, always with enough of a pause between blows to allow me brief hope that there might not be another. I couldn’t understand why the teacher didn’t hear all these unauthorized, resonating clonks. They were loud enough to attract the attention of our classmates, who seemed to find Freitas’s little ritual fascinating. Inside my head the blows were, of course, bone-rattling explosions. Freitas used a fairly long board—five or six feet—and he never hit too hard, which allowed him to pound away to his heart’s content without leaving marks, and to do it from a certain rarefied, even meditative distance, which added, I imagine, to the fascination of the performance.",

There was a road for another fifteen miles towards the border; I had ordered two lorries to call for myself and the German, who had brought carriers with him from the Republic, at seven o’clock. It was a twenty-mile march from the end of the road to the mission on the other side of the frontier and I was anxious to be there before dark. Nor had I any idea how long we might be held up at the Customs. Only one lorry turned up and it was an hour and a quarter late. The German doubted whether my cousin and I would reach Bolahun before night, for we had only one hammock and his aristocratic mind recoiled from the idea of walking with the men, from the stumbling and scrambling in the dust, and the tiredness. He himself had a chair slung on poles so that he could sit upright above the carriers. But I had to think of money; one couldn’t have less than six carriers for a four-man hammock and by walking from Biedu I was saving seven and sixpence. We packed ourselves on the one small lorry; three whites, three boys, eleven carriers, and thirty loads, and drove unsteadily down the rough road through the thin morning mist. Great flattened thimbles of perpendicular rock rose above the dripping palms; we drove between.",
