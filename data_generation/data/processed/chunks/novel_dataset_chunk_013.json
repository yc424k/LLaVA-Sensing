His thin hair and plain looks were accented not with a pipe stem, however, but with the near constant presence of either a cigarette or a lollipop stem. If not one of those items, then he chewed gum or sucked on a peppermint or a cough drop. When he got tired of those, Sarge dipped snuff and spat out the results into an empty coffee cup he kept sitting in a dashboard cupholder. He emptied that cup by rolling down the window while he drove down the highway and slinging the contents against the side of the truck. By the end of the week long brown streaks of dried tobacco juice and saliva painted the driver side of the sleeper compartment. Thankfully, Sarge’s modern art canvas had no fragrance detectable while in the bunk. It remained merely an eyesore on the outside. When Sarge had nothing else to gratify his restless mouth he simply licked his lips or smacked them together. He appeared to be oblivious to the constant motion of this nervous habit. By then I had come to know and enjoy running with many co-drivers, whatever qualities they possessed.",

The lead player flourishes his wooden mallet over his head, BYAR! — 25 hammers descend as one on the bronze keys, the great gong booms out, and a shimmering cadence begins that sends chills running up your spine. This is by far the most popular music in Bali, played by the gamelan gong kebyar and heard at dances, temple ceremonies, luxury hotels, and on the radio. It might seem, to Western ears, somehow \"traditional.\" But this is modern music, with its beginnings in the 20th century. The Balinese call this musical style kebyar, an onomatopoeic word derived from byar, or biyar, meaning, variously, a sudden intense sound, a sudden bursting open of a flower bud into bloom, the flaring up of a fire, a sudden flash of light. Any of these is an apt simile for the way most kebyar music begins. It is flashy, highly embellished, and complex music, full of sudden stops and starts, lightninglike. One author calls it \"almost supercharged.\"",

A pompous march tune brayed. ‘Firm, elatant, bold and blatant,’ etc …. And once more a huge symbolical figure emerged from the bushes.109 It was Budge the publican; but so disguised that even cronies who drank with him nightly failed to recognize him; and a little titter of enquiry as to his identity ran about among the villagers. He wore a long black many-caped cloak; waterproof; shiny; of the substance of a statue in Parliament Square; a helmet which suggested a policeman; a row of medals crossed his breast; and in his right hand he held extended a special constable’s baton (loaned by Mr. Willert of the Hall). It was his voice, husky and rusty, issuing from a thick black cotton-wool beard that gave him away.",

Dear, darling Fanny; no longer what she was, of course, but at least white, at least not oily. After the fat native women, oily to the eye, and with a horrible slippery resilience to the touch, like hot snakes, marrying Fanny would have the quality of a cold bath. God, the cool women of England, thought Edward, tossing beneath his mosquito-nets--the cool, clean, fragile, delicate opposites of armfuls! He had come to hate armfuls--so black and big, so slippery. Only just at first they had rather amused him, the unlimitedness of them, the sheer supply; but for years, except in moments of desperation, he had kept clear of them, and could hardly at last wait for the day when, quit of the creatures for ever, he was going home to marry their exact contrary.",

I had watched them descend like quiet ghosts from their drinking spot high up in the hills. I looked at them, and they looked at me, sharing the same path. I knew I wouldn’t have to shoot this time, but play it safe, that’s the rules of this particular game. I smiled at them. They were more beautiful than I could describe. The big boss bull kept them slightly ahead, and glanced back constantly, to size up the situation. They stopped, I stopped – impasse. I shouted, hooted and laughed at them. They looked faintly quizzical. I waved my arms in the direction of the big bull and said, ‘Shoo…’ in a loud and authoritative shout. He looked infinitely bored. I fired some shot-gun pellets into the air and he recognized that sound. He rounded up his family, nipping at their heels, and they gathered momentum, until forty beautiful wild free camels were bucking and galloping down the valley into an echo and a vortex of dust, and then they were gone. I was remembering exactly who I was now.",

The policeman on guard then shook us awake – there was a truck heading for Ilave – and we found ourselves in the sad situation of having to leave them behind. The night was magnificent, if terribly cold, and we were granted the privilege of some planks to sit on, separating us from the foul-smelling, flea-ridden human flock below us, their potent but warm stink a virtual lasso. Only as the vehicle began its ascent did we realize the magnitude of the concession: nothing of the smell came close and it would have been difficult for a single, athletic flea to spring on to us for refuge. The wind lashed liberally against our bodies, however, and within minutes we were literally frozen. The truck continued to climb and with every minute the cold became more intense. To stop ourselves falling off we had to keep our hands outside the more or less protective blankets; it was difficult to shift position even slightly without coming close to head-first flight into the back of the truck. Close to dawn, some carburetor problem which afflicts engines at this altitude caused the truck to stop; we were nearing the highest point of the road, almost 5,000 meters. In some corners of the sky the sun was rising and a vague light replaced the total darkness accompanying us until then. The psychological effect of the sun is strange: it had not yet appeared over the horizon and we already felt comforted, just imagining the heat it would bring.",

The deep layer of sediment deposited when it was a natural inland lake has given it a mushy bottom, and though anchors tend to sink deeply into it they sometimes break free unexpectedly, with potentially disastrous results. We could do nothing about that, but we hoped to compensate by using our extra-heavy ground tackle and good technique. We worked from Caribee’s bow and from the dinghy, spending long sweaty hours laboring under the scorching sun. We spread a triangular web, with our five heavy anchors divided among three rodes, one of them all three-eighths-inch chain. Even with the bay’s questionable bottom we felt that this would give us a solid connection, no matter the wind direction. After we’d finished we rewarded ourselves with a couple of ice-cold Kaliks sipped in the cool shade of a sleepy little Alice Town bar, the Forget Me Not pub. We took a lazy afternoon stroll along the village’s quiet streets, which showed no sign that anyone was even thinking about a storm.",

Leading a train of cargo mules through a labyrinth of glacier columns on the Portillo snowfields in 1833, Charles Darwin looked up to see ‘on one of these columns of ice a frozen horse was exposed, sticking as on a pedestal, but with its hind legs straight up in the air’. The horse had slipped into a crevasse and then, by dint of the glacier’s strange machinations, had been lifted up and out of the body of the glacier. Its corpse was perfectly intact, as though it were still alive. The glacier had embalmed it expertly. On its icy pole it must have looked like a skewed merry-go-round pony.",

'But now his movements were uncertain; as if his legs obeyed his will with great reluctance. He lunged ahead, then stopped, then lunged again and made for the door, only to halt again in a paroxysm of indecision as he came up to it. He stood there facing the door for a moment, clenching and unclenching his hands, then looked about him quickly, suspiciously, as though he expected to find somebody watching him. At last, with a slight shudder of resolution, he thrust his hands deep into his pockets, turned deliberately, and walked on past the door.",

    "target_paragraph": "The American conservation movement, like the First World War, built slowly over decades and then seemed to burst forth suddenly with an anarchist’s bullet. By the spring of 1901, Boone and Crockett cofounder Theodore Roosevelt was in Washington, DC, serving as the new vice president to William McKinley and eagerly reading early drafts of reports from the Harriman Expedition that his friend Merriam had sent over. Under other circumstances, the peripatetic Roosevelt would have been an ideal member of the HAE. He had known Grinnell and Merriam for years, wrote authoritatively on the outdoors, and dined frequently with his literary hero, John Burroughs. He envied their adventures aboard the Elder. Upon reviewing Merriam’s writings on bears, “Roosevelt hatched a plan to take a steamer to Alaska and then hunt with an Aleut guide along the salmon streams of Kodiak,” writes historian Douglas Brinkley. “He even ordered rubber boots and rainproof slickers in anticipation of the journey.”",

The brass butts of heavy shells shone in gleaming rows; two men staggered under the weight of one, and rested it on the ground while the captain regulated the shrapnel timer. The breech-lock crashed shut, and we ran far back. Cra-boom-shock! A soaring whistling Pi-i-i-e-e-eeuu! flew high after the shell, and then a tiny white smoke flowered at the foot of the Cerro de la Fila—and, minutes after, a far detonation. About a hundred yards apart, all along in front of the gun, picturesque ragged men stared motionless through their field-glasses. They burst into a chorus of yells, \"Too low! Too far to the right! Their guns are all along the ridge! Time it about fifteen seconds later!\" Down front the rifle fire had frittered away to ragged sputtering and the machine guns were silent. Everybody was watching the artillery duel. It was about five-thirty in the morning, and already very hot. In the fields behind sounded the parched chirp of crickets; the lofty fresh tops of the alamos rustled in a high languid breeze; birds began to sing again.",

As I walked among the windmills I could see that many of them were still inhabited. Bicycles rested on fences, dogs slept in gardens and cheerful old women gazed out from behind chintzy curtains. Outside several mills, despite the grey skies, residents were indulging in the favourite Dutch pastime of gossiping with neighbours over thimble-sized cups of coffee.",

While attendants fill the fuel tank, drivers and navigators bustle, exuding purposefulness, checking engines, tugging straps that secure petrol cans to running boards. “Learn as you go,” I tell myself, and begin extracting all manner of things from my shoulder bag, snapping giant red and yellow plastic clips onto the sunscreen to hold future toll slips and small currency, stashing extra pens in the door pocket, arranging maps in the glove compartment. Meanwhile, the gas station attendants are having a field day. They haven’t sold this much fuel in ages, and none of them are lounging. Given the cars they’re pouring that fuel into, they vie with each other for the honor of operating the pump. Service has never been so good.",

She wanted to be back in her house by herself. She had pushed open the French windows of the study to breathe the air of the garden and see the tall sycamore growing deep into the thick blue night. Half the room, reflected on the long pane, was thrown out into the garden. She saw it thinning away, going off from the garden into another space, existing there with an unearthly reality of its own. She had sat down at last, too tired to go upstairs, and had found herself crying, incredibly crying; all the misery, all the fear, all the boredom of her life gathered together and discharging now.\n\"If I could get out of it all\"—Her crying stopped with a start as if somebody had come in and put a hand on her shoulder. Everything went still. She had a sense of happiness and peace suddenly there with her in the room. Not so much her own as the happiness and peace of an immense, invisible, intangible being of whose life she was thus aware. She knew, somehow through It, that there was no need to get away; she was out of it all now, this minute. There was always a point where she could get out of it and into this enduring happiness and peace.",

Enormous blue lakes met a sidewinding river that sliced through greenery as thick as anything in the Mekong Delta. This was Brooks Camp, a spot so rich in salmon that its brown bears were frequently too busy fishing or too full to pay the slightest mind to the humans who flew in to observe them. Kyle pointed out a road used once a day by a Park Service tour bus that shuttled visitors out from the lodge at Brooks Camp to an overlook at the lip of Ten Thousand Smokes?our plan B for returning to civilization if a flight out became impossible. (Kyle had packed his own reserve of extra food, so the hypothetical plan C was walking all the way back.) John Muir once wrote that “between every two pines is a doorway to a new world.” Here, we flew between two low mountains and might well have slipped through a wormhole. We entered a wide plain, a wasteland from which all signs of life had been scrubbed. The Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes.",

Apparently, he was not hungry, and this was a form of play. He played sling-the-salmon. With his claws embedded near the tail, he whirled the salmon and then tossed it high, end over end. As it fell, he scooped it up and slung it around his head again, lariat salmon, and again he tossed it into the air. He caught it and heaved it high once more. The fish flopped to the ground. The bear turned away, bored. He began to move upstream by the edge of the river. Behind his big head his hump projected. His brown fur rippled like a field under wind. He kept coming. The breeze was behind him. He had not yet seen us. He was romping along at an easy walk. As he came closer to us, we drifted slowly toward him. The single Klepper, with John Kauffmann in it, moved up against a snagged stick and broke it off. The snap was light, but enough to stop the bear. Instantly, he was motionless and alert, remaining on his four feet and straining his eyes to see. We drifted on toward him. At last, we arrived in his focus. If we were looking at something we had rarely seen before, God help him so was he. If he was a tenth as awed as I was, he could not have moved a muscle, which he did, now, in a hurry that was not pronounced but nonetheless seemed inappropriate to his status in the situation. He crossed low ground and went up a bank toward a copse of willow. He stopped there and faced us again. Then, breaking stems to pieces, he went into the willows.",

I’ll just camp at the top. The thought of stopping at the top of the mountain, after forty-four miles, comforted me. I was nearing my limit already. No need to push farther. You’ve done your best today. I paused to pull out a commercially dehydrated meal and poured some water into it. I swished the liquid around, sealed it, and tucked it into the pocket of my pack. It usually took three hours to fully rehydrate without boiling water, but in an hour it would at least be edible. I resumed my upward trajectory.",

We woke up before six, packed, and made it to the Ulan-Ude bus station by taxi in plenty of time. We had presented our tickets and found seats on the bus when Sergei discovered he still carried the plastic room key card from the Hotel Geser in his pants pocket. He told me to tell the driver to wait for him and he went back to the hotel to return it. He’s sixty-one years old, no cabs in sight, so he runs the two-mile round-trip on icy streets in just under twenty minutes, and he’s back before the driver has started counting heads and making ready to leave. Sergei wasn’t even terribly winded. I told him that in America no one thinks twice about walking off with those keys. That’s what I would have done. Sergei said that the woman at the reception desk was very grateful to him because she would have lost her job for not making sure he had returned the key card when he checked out.",

And somewhere, between frozen sandhills, in a haunted and forgotten desert, where time is always measured by the interminable roll of constellations, or the chill call of a crow waking, I lay down on my dirty bundle of blankets. The frost clung like brittle cobwebs to the black bushes around me, while the sky turned thick with glitter. It was very still. I slept. The hour before the sun spills thin colour on the sand, I woke suddenly, and tried to gather myself from a dream I could not remember. I was split. I woke into limbo and could not find myself. There were no reference points, nothing to keep the world controlled and bound together. There was nothing but chaos and the voices.",

I drove into the truck stop parking lot at about one in the morning, but at the right place and only a couple of hours off of the ideal arrival time. Just two days before this very team had caused us the extended drive to Nashville. We had never caused them more work.\n\nBut with his face tilted up in a look of defiance, Yuri asked. “Where have you been?”",

Here’s the fool, here’s the villain, here in a car comes Cleopatra, burning on her barge.* Here are figures of the damned too, noseless men* by the police-court wall, standing with their feet in fire, howling. This is poetry if we do not write it.

The sea lay close to our feet in great green and blue streaks; the leaves of the beeches on our left seemed carved in gold, they shone so motionless against the sky; and the Professor was so gay, so certain that he was going to find Charlotte, that he almost danced instead of walking. He talked to me, there is no doubt, as he might have talked to quite a little child—of erudition there was not a sign, of wisdom in Brosy's sense not a word; but what of that? The happy result was that I understood him, and I know we were very merry. If I were Charlotte nothing would induce me to stir from the side of a good-natured man who could make me laugh. Why, what a quality in a husband, how precious and how rare. Think of living with a person who looks at the world with the kindliest amused eyes. Imagine having a perpetual spring of pleasant mirth in one's own house, babbling coolly of refreshing things on days when life is dusty. Must not wholesomeness pervade the very cellars and lumber-rooms of such a home? Well, I meant to do all in my power to persuade Charlotte to go into the home again. How delightful to be the means of doing the dear old man beside me a good turn! Meanwhile he walked along happily, all unconscious that I was meditating good turns, perhaps happy for that very reason, and full of confidence in his ability to catch and to keep Charlotte. 'Where she goes I go with her,' he said. 'I now have my summer leisure and can devote myself entirely to her.'",

There was the East in the food, the emphasis on sweets, some of which I knew from my childhood; in the posters for Indian films with the actress Nargis, a favourite, I was told, of Greek audiences; in the instantaneous friendships, the invitations to meals and homes. Greece was a preparation for Egypt: Alexandria at sunset, a wide shining arc in the winter sea; beyond the breakwaters, a glimpse through fine rain of the ex-king’s white yacht; the ship’s engine cut off; then abruptly, as at a signal, a roar from the quay, shouting and quarrelling and jabbering from men in grubby jibbahs who in an instant overran the already crowded ship and kept on running through it. And it was clear that here, and not in Greece, the East began: in this chaos of uneconomical movement, the self-stimulated din, the sudden feeling of insecurity, the conviction that all men were not brothers and that luggage was in danger.",

The thin straps bite at my shoulders, the broken wicker stabs holes in my parka, and the basket itself on its crude harness rolls heavily from side to side, throwing me off-balance: I pant so in the thin air that I feel sick. I keep my gaze fixed on the misted footprints that weave back and forth up the steep slope, so as not to be disheartened by the distance still to go; the sun is shimmering in waves off the bright snow.",
