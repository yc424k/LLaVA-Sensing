A remarkable wood bridge has boarded sides that are carved in flowers, while the four posts at the bridge ends are sculpted crudely as paired dhauliyas, or “guardians,” representing local deities of the old religions; such male and female portal figures are also made by coastal Indians of the Pacific Northwest. The females are holding their vulvae wide, as if in welcome to the realms of the mountain gods; sternly we cross the bridge and climb anew.",

He had ground out all of the wet fiberglass which was a messy, dirty contorted job, scrunched behind the engine and transmission. Some days it had been snowing, but he had managed to remove all of it. The tricky part was the shaft log that housed the propeller shaft and the cutlass bearing. It, too, had become waterlogged and couldn’t be salvaged, and he knew he couldn’t buy one, so he had to make it himself. He took the measurements and turned a template out of maple on his wood lathe that matched the inside dimension of the stern tube perfectly. Then he sanded the template smooth and applied a wax coating and then a layer of fiberglass cloth and then resin, and then he wound it with monofilament fishing line. He did six layers until he reached his outside dimension measurement. He was pretty sure it would work. He knew he just had to get the alignment right.",

This ugly solution is still common for stone houses constructed before indoor plumbing. Often I see these loos jutting out, sometimes supported by flimsy wooden poles angling into the walls. The small bath, which I take to be the house’s first, has a low ceiling, stone checkerboard floor, and the charming hip bath. The large bathroom must have been added in the fifties, not long before the house was abandoned. Someone had a dizzy fling with tile—floor-to-ceiling pink, blue, and white in a butterfly design. The floor is blue but not the same blue. The shower simply drains into the floor, that is to say, water spreads all over the bathroom. Someone attached the showerhead so high on the wall that the spray creates a breeze and the angled shower curtain we hung wraps around our legs.",

J sees sorrow, an issue about money and rebelliousness in my face. Maybe my mirror is faulty, maybe he’s right, but then again, maybe he’s guessing. After all the ego-reducing of Vipassana and the Buddhist course I’m finding it hard to concentrate on myself so intensely. I’m worried self-analysis will lead to spiritual paralysis. In the hours that follow, the only thing we have to think about more than ourselves is our parents. I begin to slump, drowsy in the moist air that’s rank with Sweetie’s breath. The thick atmosphere is making my limbs wet and heavy, I feel I’m breathing water and my mind is soggy. Luckily we are allowed to disobey Kryon by turning on the fan (he says appliances have magnetic fields that disturb our magnetic makeup). I stand under it, splash myself with water and try and get back to the mission of finding my mission.",

For example, one could not pass the crowded window of a bookshop in any town without instantly observing in it a reflection of the intellectual and cultural enthusiasm of the German people. The contents of the shop revealed a breadth of vision and of interest that would have made the contents of a French bookshop, with its lingual and geographic constrictions, seem paltry and provincial. The best writers of every country were as well known in Germany as in their own land. Among the Americans, Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis, Upton Sinclair, and Jack London had particularly large followings; their books were sold and read everywhere. And the work of America's younger writers was eagerly sought out and published.",

Cars in all the bmc factories waited without wipers on the production line. Export figures were down and so was the pound.",

Sometimes one sees scared, barefooted youths from remote hill villages coming to the airfield, carrying battered little tin boxes of meagre possessions, on their way to join those elder brothers, cousins and uncles who are ‘doing well’ with the British Army in Hong Kong, Borneo or Malaya. Then one often sees Gurkhas returning on six months’ leave, after three years’ service, and invariably they look sensationally spruce among their welcoming family. The grimy stay-at-homes wear unwashed, fraying garments, while the well-scrubbed soldiers are attired in starched, neatly-creased khaki shorts, flowered bush-shirts and broad-brimmed straw hats. And instead of the modest little tin box with which they departed from home they now possess at least four huge padlocked trunks. These, of course, are left for their wives, mothers or sisters to carry – one on each bent back, supported by a broad canvas band across the forehead – while the Returned Hero strides importantly ahead, an expensive camera slung over his shoulder and a raucous transistor screaming in his hand as he chats with those male relatives who trot respectfully beside him, carrying light pieces of hand-luggage. Usually at this stage the hero’s pocket is full of newly-acquired rupees, for he will have paused long enough on the airfield to sell a selection of excellent Swiss watches and Japanese pocket-transistors at incredibly low prices.",

The silver waters of Kawaihae Bay reflected the full moon, the three great mountains of Hawaii were cloudless as I had not before seen them, all the asperity of the leeward shore was softened into beauty, and the long shadows of bending palms were as still and perfect as the palms themselves. And there was a new sight above the silver water, for the huge dome of Mauna Loa, forty miles away, was burning red and fitfully. Horses and a servant awaited me, and we were soon clattering over the hard sand by the shining sea, and up the ascent which leads to the windy table-lands of Waimea. The air was like new life. At a height of 500 feet we met the first whiff of the trades, the atmosphere grew cooler and cooler, the night-wind fresher, the moonlight whiter; wider the sweeping uplands, redder the light of the burning mountain, till I wrapped my plaid about me, but still was chilled to the bone, and when the four hours ride was over, soon after midnight, my limbs were stiff with tropical cold. And this, within 20° of the equator, and only 2500 feet above the fiery sea-shore, with its temperature of 80 where Sydney Smith would certainly have desired to \"take off h1s flesh, and sit in his bones!\"",

In Utah, the state legislature considered sending women to prison?not fining them, but imprisoning them?if their skirts showed more than three inches of leg above the ankle. In Seattle, a group called the Clean Books League even tried to get banned the travel books of the adventurer Richard Halliburton on the grounds that they “excited to wanderlust.” Regulations of a moral nature were introduced all over the nation?and nearly everywhere were, like Prohibition itself, ignored. Among people of a conservative temperament, it was a time of despair.",

If he were left to himself he would in all probability stay there till the morning, and be chilled to certain death. She had heard of such deaths after sleep-walking. But how could she dare to awaken him, and let him know what he had been doing, when it would mortify him to discover his folly in respect of her? Tess, however, stepping out of her stone confine, shook him slightly, but was unable to arouse him without being violent. It was indispensable to do something, for she was beginning to shiver, the sheet being but a poor protection. Her excitement had in a measure kept her warm during the adventure; but that beatific interval was over.",

Photos of orange-robed monks, cartons of “Ready to Eat Cheese Crispies,” men banging cymbals in an afternoon sweetened by the scent of tangerines.

The motion was gentle and we took advantage of the sunshine and lack of sea spray to do some laundry. We washed two sets of sheets and pillowcases and hung them on the shrouds and lifelines to dry in the sun. They were starting to feel a little salty even though we always took pains to make sure that we were clean and dry before climbing into our berths.",

Rub with a mixture of chopped rosemary, basil, and thyme, then lard with strips of pancetta. Remove the tough outer portions of 2 fennel bulbs. Cut in half-inch crescents, drizzle with olive oil, and scatter them around the birds, along with a couple of quartered onions. Roast at 350° at 20 minutes per pound. These birds are leaner than chickens; be careful not to overcook. For a rich sauce, add béchamel sauce (this page) and roasted chestnuts to the pan juices. Serves 4.",

He would talk about anything she wished if only he might be with her for a while and see her and hear her, but he knew very little of the Droitwiches and their friends really—beyond meeting them at those bigger functions where literature is also represented, and amusing them at luncheons and dinners, he knew very little of them really. To them he had always remained Mr. Arundel; no one called him Ferdinand; and he only knew the gossip also available to the evening papers and the frequenters of clubs. But he was, however, good at inventing; and as soon as he had come to an end of first-hand knowledge, in order to answer her inquires and keep her there to himself he proceeded to invent. It was quite easy to fasten some of the entertaining things he was constantly thinking on to other people and pretend they were theirs. Scrap, who had that affection for her parents which warms in absence, was athirst for news, and became more and more interested by the news he gradually imparted.",

Rich and resonant the brasses crashed and died in the thick green twilight, rolling over them in rich sad waves. Temple yawned behind her hand, then she took out a compact and opened it upon a face in miniature sullen and discontented and sad. Beside her her father sat, his hands crossed on the head of his stick, the rigid bar of his moustache beaded with moisture like frosted silver. She closed the compact and from beneath her smart new hat she seemed to follow with her eyes the waves of music, to dissolve into the dying brasses, across the pool and the opposite semicircle of trees where at sombre intervals the dead tranquil queens in stained marble mused, and on into the sky lying prone and vanquished in the embrace of the season of rain and death.",

Then we ask how to pay his friend who towed us from the lakebed, but he simply says that if we see him around town we can offer him some money. Finally, John presses a 500 peso note into his hand and he reluctantly accepts it. This trip is constantly teaching us about generosity to strangers.",
