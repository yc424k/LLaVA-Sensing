At the front of the press stood Katya’s older brother, Mitya Arnold, a physicist with dark, mournful eyes and a salt-and-pepper beard longer and fuller than Tolstoy’s. He leaped at Katya and took her in a hug. Next to Mitya was the driver he had hired, a man named Stas, as big and slope-shouldered and patient and jowly and put-upon as any Russian coachman I’d ever read about, differing from them only in the light-green Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles T-shirt he had on.",

There was only one other occupant: a man in the center of the car, next the window, bareheaded, leaning back, his elbow on the window sill and an unlighted cigar in his ringed hand. When the train drew away, passing the sleek crowns in increasing reverse, the other passenger rose and went forward toward the day coach. He carried an overcoat on his arm, and a soiled, light-colored felt hat. With the corner of his eye Horace saw his hand fumbling at his breast pocket, and he remarked the severe trim of hair across the man’s vast, soft, white neck. Like with a guillotine, Horace thought, watching the man sidle past the porter in the aisle and vanish, passing out of his sight and his mind in the act of flinging the hat onto his head. The train sped on, swaying on the curves, flashing past an occasional house, through cuts and across valleys where young cotton wheeled slowly in fanlike rows.",

It was actually a series of cave-like rooms, all stone, with arched windows and doorways, straw on the cement floor and virtually without furniture. It was a haven for the most enormous cockroaches I have ever done battle with. They were fearless and would rise on their hind legs if confronted. They had me bluffed. As I went in at night with my candle, they would scuttle and scratch their way back into their various holes with a noise that made my skin crawl and my stomach heave. They are one creature, apart from leeches, that I simply cannot bear. I laid down large quantities of poisonous powder, something I would not normally do, but they thrived on it. They ate it, chomp chomp, for breakfast, lunch and tea and continued to grow like mutated monsters.",

On 24 June 2003 the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Felipe Perez Roque, launched a volume entitled The Dissidents. It had been put together in ten days and was based on sixty hours of interviews conducted by two well-known professional writers assisted by twenty-four researchers. The interviewees were twelve State Security agents who had infiltrated some of the groups from which the contentious convicts emerged. When the agents gave evidence in public their secret careers ended; most were not sorry to resume normal life and be reconciled with families who for years had been distressed by their apparent betrayal of the Revolution.",

    "target_paragraph": "In spite of its many problems, and my own description of it as a hole, I had a peculiar fondness for the town, though I learned not to mention that to normal people. The yacht club grounds—a collection of 1920s tropical structures sitting on a lawn dotted with whitewashed-trunked palm trees and mired in a long and steady state of decay and dilapidation—was straight out of a Hemmingway novel. The bar served the coldest beer in Central America for a dollar a bottle. The adjacent Chinese restaurant offered tasty meals for bargain prices at open-air dockside tables, and most people who ate there didn’t get that sick, notwithstanding the fact that numerous cats wandered the premises on the prowl for the apparently plentiful rats that infested the place. The hospitality of the staff and management made entering the funky old club’s gates after a taxi ride through the barrios of Colón feel like returning to the safety of the home fortress. Security in the Flats anchorage was okay (or at least nothing bad ever happened), shopping was good in the malls and supermarkets, and there was a movie theater showing newly released Hollywood movies for two dollars per ticket. Taxis were plentiful and cheap and as long as you used them consistently and were vigilant about your surroundings, the crime and squalor became just a part of the background, and in fact were used as such by the movie director. All you had to do was avoid being robbed, raped or murdered and all was good. My view was that Colón, with its crumbling old buildings and peeling paint, was a nearly perfect setting for the flick, even if it did fall somewhat short of the Port-au-Prince standard. I say that it fell short because I once commented to a canal advisor from Panama City on how Colón was a good movie stand-in for Port-au-Prince. His reply was, “No, I have been to Port-au-Prince. Believe me, Colón is a paradise compared to Port-au-Prince.”",

    "target_paragraph": "This jeep road was ‘cycleable’ (slowly) for about thirty miles and I walked the rest through ankle-deep sand, which gave me the feeling that some invisible person was trying to pull Roz back all the time. We started at 4.30 a.m. and as I had missed my siesta yesterday I felt quite dopey by 11.30, but kept going till shade was found under a big rock. Then saying ‘To hell with snakes!’ I curled up on the deep, soft sand and slept soundly from 12 to 3.30. I woke to find that a strong breeze had got up, which made the air very pleasant, and after a meal of eggs and bread and apricots we set off again. The water situation was grim all day. This valley is much wider than the other and there are no streams or nullahs till you get to Juglote, while the river is always out of reach. Occasionally it’s out of sight too, as the ‘road’ goes over sand desert with only two lines of boulders to mark the route to be followed. At other times, where the track wriggles round precipices of sheer, bare rock, it’s visible 1,000 feet below, in the deep gorge it has carved through the mountains, and to be able to see and hear water you can’t possibly reach is the quintessence of torture. I had to make do on six pints when I could have used at least eighteen. On arriving at the Juglote nullah I drank twelve pints just like that and I’ve drunk another six since I came to the hamlet itself. But for all its hardships I wouldn’t have missed today’s journey. Nanga Parbat is directly overlooking Juglote and was visible all the afternoon, thrusting up grandly from the wild array of surrounding peaks; it’s definitely the second most impressive mountain I’ve seen, after Ararat, with Demavand a good third on my list. Lying east of the road it was a glorious spectacle at sunset, with the last golden rays pouring over the peaks to the west and being caught by the snow-laden summits of the Nanga Parbat range, whilst the Indus Gorge was already full of purple dusk and the surrounding desert was a still expanse of greyness.",

When a black Labrador wandered in, the priest interrupted his holy spiel to shout, “For the love of God, somebody get that dog out of here.” If I stop in on a weekday morning, I sit there alone, enjoying the country Baroque. I think: Here I am. I love the parade of relics through the streets, with gold-robed priests travelling along in a billow of incense, their way prepared by children in white, scattering the streets with petals of broom, rose, daisy. In the noon heat, I almost hallucinate. What’s in the gold box held aloft with banners—a splinter from the cradle? Never mind we thought Jesus was born in a lowly manger; this is the splinter of the true cradle. Or am I confused? It’s a splinter of the true cross. It is on its way through the streets, brought out into the air one day a year. And suddenly I think, What did that hymn mean, cleft for me, rising years ago, perpendicular from the white board church in Georgia?",

This was not a queue situation. Arriving last on the pavement, we saw the vehicle being besieged. Young men and women swarmed up the sides, using the wheels as footholds; old folk were being hoisted through the back, children dragged between the bars – or passed up like parcels. We hesitated; already the truck looked overfull, for us to find space seemed impossible. But when our hesitation was noticed many voices urged us on; in petrol-starved Cuba the faint-hearted get nowhere – literally. Hands reached down to take our rucksacks before we scrambled up the metal steps at the back. A woman sitting beside the steps made room for me by vigorously pushing at the man on her left, then Rachel and the Trio were lost to view. I was lucky, able to see all. They couldn’t see beyond the nearest bodies.",

The day was cold and drizzly. On the ocean side of the island, you could see the top few inches of yellow bulldozers and other retired heavy equipment that had been buried in the sand as bulwarks against the waves. The wind shifted direction and we were hit with a foul blast. Because homes in Shishmaref lack flush toilets, household waste is collected and deposited into a cesspool, which, Jones had insisted with a smirk, was an essential part of the tour.",

Whitebeams marked the path to right and left, with their grey-green upper leaves and their sharp silver unders. I walked through a field of common orchids and pink clover, and ate the clover anthers for their nectar. I passed tombs and memorials of different eras: Bronze Age burial mounds which had once held cremated ashes in pottery vessels; Neolithic long barrows; a wayside shrine to a German airman killed in 1940, which was covered with remembrance crosses, rose petals and flints. Then I emerged out of a dark and yew-rich wood and onto a down that stretched for two miles or more ahead of me. Bleached light, shining grey beech trunks, a tractor ploughing a distant field to corduroy. Grass flickering in the wind, grasshoppers scraping and bowing. White flints scattered across the fields, tumbleweeds of sheep’s wool bowling between them.",

Then I started climbing. It was hot, and hotter and then hotter again. I had left it a little late to depart Narasoma, and now found myself hurrying along, at greater speed than I would have liked in that sluggish heat; concerned that my slot might go to someone else if I did not turn up right on time. The rice fields fell away below like waterfalls of green, as I hurried along the spine of the ridge, stopping at intervals for a swig from my water bottle. The sky was low and very grey.",

As expected, most restaurants were closed, and we settled, instead, on packaged snacks from Arkwrights. The shop is an anomaly, even by the standards of Little Britain. Arkwrights caters to European tourists; its large signs, printed in block letters, advertise Gourmet Food. The shop could pass for a very clean 7-Eleven, or even a small Tesco. Its large, plate-glass windows flood the store with natural light, and its white and black tile floors sparkle. European and American brands like Cadbury, Nestlè, Lays, Red Bull, Coke, and Pepsi fill the shelves. Arkwrights also sells familiar household products like pet food and dish soap that can be hard to find in many neighborhoods. The operator was a friendly, middle-aged fellow with a bit of a paunch and a bright smile. We often found him sitting at his register, staring at the television perched over the drink cooler at the front of the shop. He always greeted us with a smile and sincere hello. That day we treated ourselves to a couple sandwiches, made-to-order. I tried the tuna on white, and Teresa had the chicken salad. Weary of long days with no restaurants, we also bought several bags of chips, candies, bottles of water, and sodas to get us through our visit to Luxor.",

Less agreeable is another fortress, the sinister citadel, used by both the Ottomans and the British as a prison and now a Haganah museum and memorial to terrorists – with special emphasis on Jabotinsky, whose Irgun gang bombed Jerusalem’s King David Hotel and organised the Deir Yassin massacre.",

During the spring break, I visited my friend Roberto in Milan. Roberto was only twenty-two, but he had found friends and patrons in the jet set and was already doing a brisk business as an international art dealer. At his apartment he showed me a notebook in which Man Ray, Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol had sketched drawings for him. I looked at them and thought, ‘I can do that!’ Above Roberto’s bed was a large Andy Warhol portrait – a few splashes of bright color over a blown-up photograph. It was all the encouragement I needed. I asked Roberto to bring me some paper and colored Magic Markers, and seated under the Andy Warhol I penned several dozen calligraphies. On returning to Oxford, I went to an art-supply store and stocked up on a variety of different colors of washi (Japanese rice paper), brushes and ink, and began pouring out calligraphies. Not all of them were calligraphies per se; some were ink paintings, which are just one step away from calligraphy.",

Oh, to fall in love like that, to the languorous magic melody of such a tune!\nThe last scene was laid on a roof garden, and the cellos sighed to the musical moon, while light adventure and facile froth-like comedy flitted back and forth in the calcium. Amory was on fire to be an habitué of roof gardens, to meet a girl who should look like that—better, that very girl; whose hair would be drenched with golden moonlight, while at his elbow sparkling wine was poured by an unintelligible waiter. When the curtain fell for the last time he gave such a long sigh that the people in front of him twisted around and stared and said loud enough for him to hear:\n“What a remarkable-looking boy!”\nThis took his mind off the play, and he wondered if he really did seem handsome to the population of New York.\nPaskert and he walked in silence toward their hotel. The former was the first to speak. His uncertain fifteen-year-old voice broke in in a melancholy strain on Amory’s musings:\n“I’d marry that girl tonight.”\nThere was no need to ask what girl he referred to.\n“I’d be proud to take her home and introduce her to my people,” continued Paskert.\nAmory was distinctly impressed. He wished he had said it instead of Paskert. It sounded so mature.\n“I wonder about actresses; are they all pretty bad?”\n“No, sir, not by a darn sight,” said the worldly youth with emphasis, “and I know that girl’s as good as gold. I can tell.”\nThey wandered on, mixing in the Broadway crowd, dreaming on the music that eddied out of the cafés. New faces flashed on and off like myriad lights, pale or rouged faces, tired, yet sustained by a weary excitement. Amory watched them in fascination. He was planning his life. He was going to live in New York, and be known at every restaurant and cafés, wearing a dress-suit from early evening to early morning, sleeping away the dull hours of the forenoon.\n“Yes, sir, I’d marry that girl tonight!”",

These take twenty-four hours to get troublesome and then they’re hell. My face, neck, hands and arms are covered with tiny purple lumps, both itchy and sore, and I woke constantly to find myself tearing at them with my nails. It’s so long since I’ve slept under a roof that it was disconcerting not to see the stars above me. The night sky here is a most brilliant and beautiful sight and is one of the few consolations of the hot areas. If one opens one’s eyes for a moment the starlight is almost dazzling, and the Milky Way, with ‘coal-sacks’ and nebulae, is quite different from the same spectacle seen through an Irish atmosphere. I spent quite a lot of my first night at Chilas admiring it as the wind off the desert was like a dragon’s breath – not conducive to sleep – yet indoors with no fans was even worse.",

I have never been asked to meet her mother, who possibly disapproves of mysteriously wandering females, but her father is an entertaining and erudite character. Farida often asks us in for tea and enjoys riding Hallam; she is a most self-possessed young lady, with a keen interest in the Wide World, and she seems likely to discard numerous taboos as she matures.",

Even the colors were crisp: vivid blue sky, deep green fields, leaves in every sharp shade that nature can bestow. It is a truly astounding sight when every tree in a forest becomes individual; where formerly had sprawled a seamless cloak of green there now stood a million bright colors.",
