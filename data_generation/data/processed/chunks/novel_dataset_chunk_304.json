I went across the road to a pleasant little salad-bar restaurant called the Olive Branch, where I quickly made myself into a pariah by taking a table for four. The place was practically empty when I arrived, and as I was struggling with a knapsack and a tippy tray, I took the first empty table. But immediately after I sat down people poured in from all quarters, and for the rest of my brief lunch period I could feel eyes burrowing into me from patrons who turned from the till to find me occupying a space obviously not designed for a solitary diner, requiring them to take their trays to the unpopular MORE SEATING UPSTAIRS section, evidently a disagreeable option. As I sat there, trying to eat quickly and be obscure, a man from two tables away came and asked in a pointed tone if I was using one of the chairs, and took it without awaiting my reply. I finished my food and slunk from the place in shame.",

She thought the room so ugly and dreary that she could hardly blame Lita for wanting to do it over. “I’ll give her a cheque for it at once,” she reflected indulgently. “All young people begin by making mistakes of this kind.” She remembered with a little shiver the set of imitation tapestry armchairs that she had insisted on buying for her drawing-room when she had married Wyant.

It stood about eighty centimetres high, walked on two feet and lived in the territory of the Haush. It always went armed with a stone or short club. By day it lived in the ñire trees (Notofagus antarctica) but at night it would warm itself by the fire of a lonely hunter. The Yoshil was probably vegetarian and fed on wild fruits, fungi, and the white grubs that are the staple of the Magellanic woodpecker.",

We sat at a small table laid with pickles, herring strips wrapped around pieces of red peppers, cold sliced chicken breast with dill, potatoes also with dill, and plates of radishes and cucumbers from the family’s dacha garden. Tea after the meal came with the usual unbelievably delicious strawberry jam. I could eat that jam every day of my life. The conversation went off into realms social and philosophical, also as usual, interspersed with lively narratives from Volodya on the subject of the construction business in Sochi. Sergei P.’s mother—a pretty, red-haired woman, who looked almost too young to have grown-up offspring—spoke about the economic sufferings of the time. She also said that when she was younger, working on the Soviet space program, she and her colleagues had considered Americans the enemy. Something in her quiet, firm manner suggested that her views on this had not yet entirely changed.",

About what happened later in the night I would not willingly speak: suffice it to say that I had not before realised the immense and apparently endless distance of England from the good dry land of the Continent. Edelgard, indeed, behaved the whole way up to London as if she had not yet got to England at all; and I was forced at last to comment very seriously on her conduct, for it looked as much like wilfulness as any conduct I can remember to have witnessed.",

Measure waves in feet, bottom of trough to top of crest. Wind and boats both travel in knots: one knot, a nautical mile, is 1.15 miles per hour. Do seasoned boaters convert highway speed-limit signs in their heads? Forty-five miles per hour, how many knots? When traveling on water, your own speed matters as well as the speed of the medium, an extra dimension. On ocean, neither water nor vessel is still—always the rise and plunge, wave in, tide out. On rivers, current flows in cubic feet per second, the volume of water traveling past a point at a certain time. Sometimes it seems that the raft stays put and, beneath, the water moves.",

The fascination with the place is that Samuel Johnson and James Boswell visited it on their Highland “jaunt” in 1773 leaving me wondering how they managed it because Lochbui is near…nothing. In the worst case, I will get a headwind for one half of the trip and wind-assisted ride for the other half. I set off down the one track road. This means when the ferry lands, I run off into the bushes because of the stream of cars, trucks, and, yes, coach buses flying by on their way to Iona. After one onslaught, there is a lull until the next ferry disgorgement. The exception is people rushing from the opposite direction to get TO the ferry. Cycle travelling on one track roads has its challenges. Some cyclists fantasise they are automobiles and insist on their space. I am of the persuasion that, while I may have the right of way, a coach bus with eighty-four people is going to opt for me splattered on its front grill rather than swerve and go over a cliff.",

The world is younger than it is, and she to herself appears so old and wise, grasping her problems and wrestling with them as affairs peculiar to herself and not as racial heritages. There is a brightness and bloom over things; she inspects life proudly, as if she walked in a garden forced by herself to grow in the least hospitable of soils. She is already contemptuous of ordered planting, believing in the possibility of a wizard cultivator to bring forth sweet-smelling blossoms from the hardest of rocks, and night-blooming vines from barren wastes, to plant the breath of twilight and to shop with marigolds. She wants life to be easy and full of pleasant reminiscences.",

The movie was not in any case a success. The big hit of the season was a steamy offering called Don Juan, in which Hollywood heartthrob John Barrymore managed to plant no fewer than 143 kisses on compliant females?so many that hardly anyone later remembered that the movie was even more memorable for containing a sound track. Although Don Juan offered only recorded music and not speech?and hence was not a talkie?it still preceded The Jazz Singer as a sound picture by several months.",

Meanwhile, the yearlings scamper prettily to stay out of the reach of itching adults. There has been no real fighting or advanced sexual display of the sort that is beginning to be seen in the western herds, although occasionally a male will approach a female slowly, his extended neck held low, in what GS calls “low-stretch” behavior, an overture to copulation. Since the Somdo herd has grown so used to me that I can observe it comfortably, without binoculars, it is a pity that I must leave before full rut.",

One woman, short and middle-aged, wore a gray flannel skirt over a pair of blue-gray cotton slacks. One old man, who had swollen ankles, wore no socks, and parts of his shoes had been cut away to relieve his toes. He bought a quart of orange soda and a bag of potato chips. Half of the crowd seemed to be teen-aged. Noise was high. When the pickers had gone to their buses, Mrs. Buzby said to me, “A couple of the drivers came in here earlier to buy soda water. They use it to cut the wine.”",

The sun shines with a bolt of light coming right into the Stone Circle. Maybe I am a Druid. It is magical. I bask in the message that maybe “boot pulling up” and “Big Girl pants” are being cosmically rewarded. Much more happily, the clouds back in place, I ride the rest of the diversion route along bubbling burns and tree lined glades.

This is much the biggest edifice in Khapalu, and perhaps in all Baltistan – apart from Skardu’s fort. ‘It must be the Raja’s Palace,’ observed Rachel, already wise in the ways of the Karakoram. The eccentric, whitewashed pile of wood and stone and carved balconies has a slightly Tibetan air, though its walls lack the characteristic Tibetan inward slope. It is wildly ramshackle, yet handsome in its simplicity and undeniably imposing as it dominates the valley. Two small circular summer-houses are conspicuous on the enormous expanse of its flat roof, from the edge of which several midget-like figures were studying us with the aid of binoculars. The usually docile Hallam was so determined to leave the jeep track here that I feel sure he once formed part of the Raja’s polo team. When Rachel at last got him past the turn-off we were walking parallel to the polo-ground, distinguishable because of its area – about ten times that of the average field.",

Outside, angry crowds thronged the streets, and mounted police strained to maintain order. “The air seemed charged with electricity,” Robert G. Elliott noticed as he arrived in the early evening. Machine guns had been placed along the prison walls, and those manning them were authorized, it seems, to fire into the crowd if things got ugly. Inside, Sacco, Vanzetti, and a third condemned inmate, Celestino Madeiros?the young man whose confession to the South Braintree robbery Judge Thayer had dismissed in 1925?were given their last meals and offered last rites. Madeiros had nothing to do with the Sacco and Vanzetti case. He was being put to death now for the murder of a bank clerk in another robbery.",

A band of thick cloud stretched across the sky immediately above the Jebel Sim’ān, keeping us in a cold grey shadow, while to north and south we saw the mountains and the plain bathed in sunshine. We rode north for about an hour to Keifār, a large village near the extreme edge of the Jebel Sim’ān. Beyond the valley of the Afrīn, which bounds the hills to the north-west, rose the first great buttresses of the Giour Dāgh. Mūsa observed that in the valley and the further hills there were no more ruined villages; they end abruptly at the limits of the Jebel Sim’ān, and Syrian civilisation seems to have penetrated no further to the north, for what reason it is impossible to say. At Keifār there were three churches much ruined, but showing traces of decoration exquisitely treated, a few good houses, and a canopy tomb something like the one at Barād. There was a large population of Kurds. We rode back to Barād and so south-east to Kefr Nebu, about an hour and a half away through bitter wind and rain. There was a Syriac inscription here on a lintel, one or two Kufic tombstones, and a very splendid house partially restored, but I was a great deal too cold to give them the attention they deserved. Chilled to the bone and profoundly discouraged by attempts at taking time exposures in a high wind, I made straight for mv tents at Bāsufān, an hour’s ride from Kefr Nebu, leaving unexplored a couple of ruined sites to the south.",

Something of her mother’s fierce shrinking from observation and sympathy was beginning to develop in her, and the promiscuity of small quarters and close intimacy seemed, on the whole, less endurable than the solitude of a hall bedroom in a house where she could come and go unremarked among other workers. For a while she had been sustained by this desire for privacy and independence; but now, perhaps from increasing physical weariness, the lassitude brought about by hours of unwonted confinement, she was beginning to feel acutely the ugliness and discomfort of her surroundings. The day’s task done, she dreaded to return to her narrow room, with its blotched wall-paper and shabby paint; and she hated every step of the walk thither, through the degradation of a New York street in the last stages of decline from fashion to commerce.",

Why, you haven’t any intention of going today, you know you haven’t,’ she said to him. ‘He’s been fooling you all along,’ she now said, turning to the mother with an air of maddening assurance. ‘He has no idea of taking that train. He’s going to wait over until tomorrow. I’ve known it all along.’",

At once, now, she was the warm little creature he remembered. Her tender face glowed with its warm color, only, now, she became suddenly a little formal and embarrassed, she shook hands somewhat nervously and stiffly, and said: “Hello, Mr. Webber. How are you—hah?” in a somewhat cracked, shrill, and impatient city voice. Then she stood rapidly slipping the ring on and off her finger with the nervous and impatient movement that worried and somewhat annoyed him. “Would you like to have some tea—hah?” she said again in her somewhat protesting tone, and when he said “Yes,” she said, “All right, Katy bring us some tea.” The girl went out and closed the door.",

This bitter taint was mixed with the rich plummy smell of the kola nuts the carriers picked from the ground and chewed, with an occasional flower scent one couldn’t trace in the thick untidy greenery. All the smells were drawn out, as the heat increased, like vapour from moist ground. The carriers walked naked except for loin-cloths, the sweat leaving marks like snails on their black polished skins. They didn’t look strong, they hadn’t the ugly muscular development of a boxer; their legs were as thin as a woman’s, but they ended in typical carrier’s feet, flat like enormous empty gloves, spreading on the earth pancake-wise as if the weights they carried had pressed them out in a peine forte et dure. Even their arms were childishly thin, and when they raised the fifty-pound cases a few inches to ease their skulls, the muscles hardly swelled, were no thicker than whipcord.",

    "target_paragraph": "Gustavo received a hero’s welcome at the airport, and the celebration continued at the house on San Sebastián Street. Later, the family traveled to Artemisa for a reunion with that side of the family. Gustavo had brought them together after many years apart. But in a short time, the revolution divided them again. One of Jorge’s cousins in Artemisa was known as “Jalopy César” because he sold old clothes from the trunk of his beat-up American car. During the years of fighting against Batista, he had used the car to transport firearms to the rebels. Then he, like many others, became disillusioned as Fidel made clear the red tint of his revolution. Replacing one dictator with another was not what they had fought for. They organized and armed counterrevolutionary cells in several parts of the country. The most serious threat to the communists in Havana arose in the Escambray Mountains that run along the spine of Cuba’s middle provinces. Fidel called those resistance fighters banditos and pursued them relentlessly until the last insurgents were eliminated in 1965. Other anti-Castro movements flared up across Cuba, and they too were eventually snuffed out. Aligned with one of them, César was charged with counterrevolutionary activities and thrown into prison. Gustavo tried to intervene, hoping to use his stature to persuade the revolutionary authorities to release him. They didn’t. A few months later, Jorge’s family received word that César had suffered a heart attack in prison and died. He was thirty years old.",

The houses are being reroofed by the NT volunteer work parties. The village looks in good shape. Rock cleits, little stone storage huts, dot the landscape in random fashion. One cottage has information on cards. I take a handful of them and go outside in the sun to read, sitting on a bench like a St Kildan would. Even the oil tank construction can’t dampen my sense of place. I wander down to the site of Lady Grange’s hovel, which has also been described as a large cleit. It is no longer there, but even life in a cottage would have been a challenge. If she were truly in a smaller cleit, or bothy, it would have been damp, dark, and depressing.",

Over and through the soaking earth was the feathery new spring growth of little flowers, of young leaves and of ferns. The tree tops were all bright with reds and yellows, with brilliant gleaming whites and gorgeous greens. All the lower air was full of the damp haze rising from heavy soaking water on the earth, mingled with a warm and pleasant smell from the blue smoke of the spring fires in all the open fields.
