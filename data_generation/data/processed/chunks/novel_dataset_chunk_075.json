But she achieved the feat of not answering him, or turning her steady eyes from the dancing mid-summer water at the foot of Laura’s lawn. Ralph leaned a little nearer, and for an instant his hand imagined the flutter of hers. But instead of clasping it he drew back, and rising from his chair wandered away to the other end of the verandah . . . No, he didn’t feel as Clare felt. If he loved her—as he sometimes thought he did—it was not in the same way. He had a great tenderness for her, he was more nearly happy with her than with any one else; he liked to sit and talk with her, and watch her face and her hands, and he wished there were some way—some different way—of letting her know it; but he could not conceive that tenderness and desire could ever again be one for him: such a notion as that seemed part of the monstrous sentimental muddle on which his life had gone aground.",

He was not to show it to anybody, the Count had said—not yet! The government must not hear about that relic—not yet! Later on, perhaps very soon, everything would be in order. Denis cherished that photo in his pocket. He was thinking, too, of the pastel—the face of Matilda, which seemed like a star shining through the mist….

I described them to my mother as “two Chinese officers, both officers by courtesy, since one was in the Political and one in the Transport Department. Mr Ma, the politico, our interpreter, early showed himself to be a dope . . . Mr Ho, the transport king, was as efficient as humanly possible in this repellent country and we liked him very much.

There, while Mrs Gormer plunged into problems of lighting and sanitation, Lily had leisure to wander, in the bright autumn air, along the tree-fringed bay to which the land declined. Little as she was addicted to solitude, there had come to be moments when it seemed a welcome escape from the empty noises of her life. She was weary of being swept passively along a current of pleasure and business in which she had no share; weary of seeing other people pursue amusement and squander money, while she felt herself of no more account among them than an expensive toy in the hands of a spoiled child.",

Magnolias and tulip trees were on the point of breaking open, the branches of biblical cedars swept in low fans, all of them ringing with the songs of thrushes and blackbirds and positively slumbrous with the cooing of a thousand doves, and the house in the middle, when the trees fell back, looked more extraordinary with every step. It was a vast ochre-coloured pile, built, on the site of an older building perhaps, in the last decades of the nineteenth century. Blois, Amboise and Azay-les-Rideau (which I only knew from photographs) immediately floated into mind. There were pinnacles, pediments, baroque gables, ogees, lancets, mullions, steep slate roofs, towers with flags flying and flights of covered stairs ending in colonnades of flattened arches.",

Bartlett surveyed the skies in every direction and the land to the south, where he was headed; no signs of clearing. No matter. It was time to go, and he reminded himself of his optimistic philosophy: “If you start in the snow you are likely to have fair weather the rest of the way.” He bundled up the letters each of them had written to their families and loved ones back home, promising to mail them at the first chance he got. He was taking seven dogs, and dog pemmican for thirty days. He and Kataktovik would have rations of pemmican, sugar, and tea for forty-eight days, plus rifles and ammunition. Before leaving, Bartlett handed McKinlay a letter of instructions, which was to be given to Munro on his return.",

Inside, the Burma Airways head office was empty, save for a three-year-old boy wandering around vaguely among unpeopled desks. A few cheerless black-and-white posters of the homeland were stuck on the walls. A short typewritten schedule for such destinations as “Kathmadu” lay in an old Air-India folder. A postcard or two. Nothing else. Finally, a round-faced matron, huffing impatiently, shuffled up to the counter. I asked whether I could buy a ticket. She looked gloomy. It was difficult, she said. I asked why; she said nothing. At last, with lugubrious reluctance, she pulled out a Dickensian ledger and a fountain pen and entered my name on a list. Was that all? It had to be; after all, there were no typewriters in the place, and certainly no computer terminals. If I actually wanted to buy a ticket, she warned, I should go to Nepal Tours; their prices were much better than Burma Airways’. With that, she padded back into her room.",

He explained that we’d left Chignik a little late because he’d been moving ballast around the ship to maintain balance. “We’ve got a whole dump truck full of sand for the airport at Sand Point,” he said. (Captain Mayer, whose knowledge of maritime matters verged on omniscience, did not know why the town needed to import the granular substance with which it shared a name.) He talked about the challenges of the open ocean (“That scares the bejeezus out of some captains, but I never get bored”) and what would happen if the GPS system went out (“Don’t worry, we’re still tested on celestial navigation”). I asked if sailing here was much different than it had been in 1899. “Just look out there,” he said. To one side of us was the ocean, and to the other empty hills with snowy mountains in the distance. Green, white, and blue were still the prevailing tints of the run to Dutch Harbor. “Very little has changed since Captain Cook was here.”",

Some aquaculture and salmon in pens, being raised much closer to shore than I have seen in other places. Certainly an undeveloped area except for the super highway coming up. Comparatively speaking of course. The Lochailort turnoff is onto a two lane road that runs from Fort William on the east to Mallaig where I might be headed, depending on how the day goes. I had considered hopping the train at Lochailort because, once again, the contours don’t look very inviting. I am now wise to the map legend for rock cuts and embankments, both of which appear.

I regard them with interest, as proving that some, if not all, of the buildings at Campanella date from the early imperial epoch. For I have found this material, which was used by the Romans for the modelling of vaults, and where lightness was to be combined with strength, nowhere save in those ruins of Capri which cannot have been built before Augustus. Now if this scoria, as I strongly suspect, was brought from Vesuvius–like the “tufa of Herculanum” concerning which there have been learned discussions–before that mountain was covered with ashes in 79, the age of these buildings is determined pretty accurately within two close-lying limits. Mason-bees now construct their houses in its almond-shaped cavities, selecting it for the same reasons which commended it to the architects of Roman palaces: because it is dry, porous, and adhesive to plaster.",

Conversation was difficult and seems a skill not much practised between husband and wife. Strenuous efforts on my part prised out the information that four daughters are married elsewhere, that Piet farms sixty hectares (subsistence farming, given the quality of his land) and employs two men. Marie does all the domestic chores and tends the four sows and their litters. After that I gave up and, as we ate in Cistercian silence, tried to imagine this room in Livingstone’s day. It is much more pleasing than the opulent living rooms of rich Boers. Nineteenth-century craftsmen rather than modern factories produced the dining table and chairs – their tapestry upholstery woven by a great-grandmother. Inherited copperware fills a tall handsome dresser and two enormous Voortrekker chests, fancifully carved, hold spare bedding. Six portrait photographs of formidable ancestors – austere unsmiling faces with visionaries’ eyes, the women looking even tougher than the men – help to explain why it took the British three years to win the Anglo-Boer War.",

Addresses were read from the Bull. Replies were made from the Stag. The town was illuminated. Gold caskets were securely sealed in glass cases. Coins were well and duly laid under stones. Hospitals were founded. Rat and Sparrow clubs* were inaugurated. Turkish women by the dozen were burnt in effigy in the market-place, together with scores of peasant boys with the label ‘I am a base Pretender’, lolling from their mouths. The Queen’s cream-coloured ponies were soon seen trotting up the avenue with a command to Orlando to dine and sleep at the Castle, that very same night. Her table, as on a previous occasion, was snowed under with invitations from the Countess of R., Lady Q., Lady Palmerston, the Marchioness of P., Mrs W. E. Gladstone,* and others, beseeching the pleasure of her company, reminding her of ancient alliances between their family and her own, etc.]—all of which is properly enclosed in square brackets, as above, for the good reason that a parenthesis it was without any importance in Orlando’s life. She skipped it, to get on with the text. For when the bonfires were blazing in the marketplace, she was in the dark woods with Shelmerdine alone. So fine was the weather that the trees stretched their branches motionless above them, and if a leaf fell, it fell, spotted red and gold, so slowly that one could watch it for half an hour fluttering and falling till it came to rest at last, on Orlando’s foot.",
