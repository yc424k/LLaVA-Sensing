When the nose of the engine reached the platform and the sound of braking and creaking grew deafening, moustaches and sweat-sodden polyester shirts appeared in the doorways, looming larger and higher before they suddenly leapt into the air from the moving carriages and hit the ground running. Before the train had stopped, hordes of men rained down on us with monsoon force, while the rows behind began to heave forward, reaching over our heads to grab the doorways and haul themselves in. The papaya was knocked from my hand and slithered down my leg. Once again the rule was simple: attack or be attacked. Crushed between satchels, stale armpits and wet skin, spitting out mouthfuls of coconut oil-flavoured hair, we managed to push forward and fell into the middle of the carriage.",

When you walk into an Italian post office today, things appear to be fairly well organized. There’s a bright yellow machine from which you select the service you require. Out pops a slip of paper with a letter and a number on it and you wait until your combination materializes on a screen that directs you to the appropriate window. Not just for the mail and your odd money order, the post office has banking, bill pay and collects some taxes, which I suppose was calculated to minimize the risk of loss if the payments were sent through their system.",

It’s a process that soon becomes second nature to us, but at this point is new and confusing. We pull down our folding table and chairs from the roof and set them up next to the van, along with our portable camping stove, to make the outdoor kitchen. Then we raise the roof of the van from the inside, which unfolds tent fabric to open up an extra three feet of space, allowing us to stand comfortably inside. There are movable panels around chest-height that create an “upstairs” bed platform for sleeping, or can be stacked together to give us room to walk around inside. Finally, we spin the two passenger chairs around 180º to face backwards, making a living room area. Hey presto, it’s a house! (You can see a video tour of our van home at monkeysontheroad.com/van.)",

As part of the spirit of Nara’s secrecy, lovers of this region frequent hideaways unknown or preferably not open to the general public; the writer Yukio Mishima’s occasional visits to the aristocratic abbess of Ensho-ji Nunnery were rooted in this cult of secrets. I too have a secret temple, situated in the mountains to the east of Yoshino and Mt Koya. My temple is called Seisen-an. The drive there is very pleasant, and the road winds past famous temples such as Hase-dera and Muro-ji. Deep in the mountains between these temples lies the town of Ouda. There’s nothing special to see in this region, so travelers are scarce. Around 1978, Abbot Daiki of Daitoku-ji found and remodeled an old village headman’s estate near Ouda. He slowly built up a complex of sub-temples and worship halls, one of which is Seisen-an – a farmhouse from deeper in the hills that was dismantled, moved to Ouda and restored.",

    "target_paragraph": "Standing on the shore, Fedeler snaps his wrist and sends a big enamelled spoon lure, striped like a barber pole, flying over the water. Not long after it splashes, he becomes involved in a struggle with something more than a grayling. The fish sulks a little. For the most part, though, it moves. It makes runs upriver, downriver. It dashes suddenly in the direction of the tension on the line. His arms now oscillating, now steady, Fedeler keeps the line taut, keeps an equilibrium between himself and the fish, until eventually it flops on the dry gravel at his feet. It is a nine-pound salmon, the beginnings of dinner. Stell Newman catches another salmon, of about the same size. I catch one, a seven-pound adolescent, and let it go. Pat Pourchot, whose philosophical abstinence from fishing has until now been consistent, is suddenly aflush with temptation. Something like a hundred thousand salmon will come up the Kobuk in a summer. (They are counted by techniques of aerial survey.) The Kobuk is three hundred miles long and has at least fifty considerable tributaries—fifty branching streams to which salmon could be returning to spawn—and yet when they have come up the Kobuk to this point, to the mouth of the Salmon River, thirty thousand salmon turn left. As school after school arrives here, they pause, hover, reconnoitre—prepare for the run in the home stream. The riffles we see offshore are not rapids but salmon. Pourchot can stand it no longer. He may have phased himself out of fishing, but he is about to phase himself back in. Atavistic instincts take him over. His noble resolve collapses in the presence of this surge of fish.",

But there – hurrah! – stood a guest-house, surrounded by a six-foot wooden fence. This was the biggest building in a newish trading centre not marked on any map. In the empty wick-lit bar I was welcomed wonderingly by Ed and Gin. Gin spoke no English; Ed’s was quite fluent. He wheeled Lear across a wide flooded yard to our £2 room – the walls and floor concrete, the barred window unglazed, the tin roof supported by stout beams, the only furniture a hard but comfortable single bed with clean cotton sheets. This being a modern establishment, three toilet bowls had been installed in cubicles at the far end of the yard and there were two open-air wash-basins with chrome taps: an expensive mistake, Ed admitted, since running water remained a pipe-dream. The usable latrine was a hygienic forty yards away, in the bush.",

A strong wind could cause a lot of damage unless one had spread nets under the trees. The shiny black olives are plump and firm. Curious about the raw drupe, I bite one and it tastes like an alum stick. How did anyone ever figure out how to cure them? The same people, no doubt, who first had the nerve to taste oysters. Ligurians used to cure them by hanging bags in the sea; inland people smoked them over the winter in their chimneys, something I’d like to try. We peel off jackets, then sweaters as we work, hanging them in the trees. The temperature has climbed to about fifty-five degrees and although our boots are wet, the air feels balmy. Off in the distance, we see the blue swath of Lake Trasimeno under an intense blue sky. By three, we have stripped every single olive off twelve trees. I’ve put my sweater on again. Days are short here in winter and already the sun is headed for the rim of the hill behind the house. By four, our red fingers are stiff and we quit, hauling the sack and basket down the terraces into the cantina.",

I admit to him that I didn’t care much for the note and offer to say why, but he anticipates my objections, saying that the note meant no criticism of my actions but only recognition that my instincts about the route had been correct, whereas he had held us up by “waiting too long on the wrong mountain.” That he wrote it as he did, and that I took it so amiss, he ascribes to the pressure of the days preceding and also the high-altitude irritability that has ruined so many mountain expeditions. Everything he says rings true to me, and I feel foolish: I recall my first visit to high altitudes, in the Andes, when I was so volatile that any sudden noise inspired fury. Quickly and happily we drop the entire business. We are glad to see each other—and a good thing, too, since in this camp we shall have to share this one small tent—and full of excitement about Shey, for there is good news, too: the blue sheep there are plentiful and tame, and the rut we have come so far to see has scarcely started.",

Lanterns suspended from a ceiling high above our heads (each large enough to cage a man) spilled their molten light, bathing the sea of pilgrims in white brilliance. Dazzling rays chased out the encroaching night, left bereft at the threshold. Wave upon wave of pilgrims carried us forward like flotsam. Pilgrims moved no more than a quarter-stride at a time, edging cautiously, as though on the verge of a precipice. Each footstep of mine dissolved into the collective footfall.\nWe were on the ground floor of the three-story mosque, able to hold seven hundred fifty thousand at once. The oval-shaped mosque was a product of four expansions since the 1950s. The Saudis had dedicated more than $25 billion just to the renovation and modernization of the Hajj sites.\nI gingerly moved forward, carefully judging my steps. The ground was cool and refreshing underfoot, a brilliant feat of underground water engineering. A network of pipes conducted cold water under the marble, vital when Hajj occurred in the hotter seasons and air temperatures here could exceed 129ºF.\nTo the sides of the causeway, carpeted areas were filled with pilgrims in different stages of supplication. Many sat, simply reading the Quran, or stopped to take sips of ice-cool ZamZam8 water, stored in orange plastic urns stationed all around the mosque. For the first time I noticed my thirst, despite the humid night. They were drinking holy water, the same water that had arrived while Hagar searched desperately in the desert, fearful that her son Ismail might die without it. I remembered the story well:",

    "target_paragraph": "There were times when she would think that she must have been mistaken, that no trouble was overshadowing her father; these would be when they two were sitting in his study, for then he would seem contented. Surrounded by his books, caressing their bindings, Sir Philip would look care-free again and light-hearted.\n‘No friends in the world like books,’ he would tell her. ‘Look at this fellow in his old leather jacket!’\nThere were times, too, out hunting when he seemed very young, as Raftery had been that first season. But the ten-year-old Raftery was now wiser than Sir Philip, who would often behave like a foolhardy schoolboy. He would give Stephen leads over hair-raising places, and then, she safely landed, turn round and grin at her. He liked her to ride the pick of his hunters these days, and would slyly show off her prowess. The sport would bring back the old light to his eyes, and his eyes would look happy as they rested on his daughter.\nShe would think: must have been terribly mistaken,’ and would feel a great peace surge over her spirit.\nHe might say, as they slowly jogged home to Morton: ‘Did you notice my youngster here take that stiff timber? Not bad for a five-year-old, he’ll do nicely.’ And perhaps he might add: ‘Put a three on that five, and then tell your old sire that he’s not so bad either! I’m fifty-three, Stephen, I’ll be going in the wind if I don’t knock off smoking quite soon, and that’s certain!’\nThen Stephen would know that her father felt young, very young, and was wanting her to flatter him a little.\nBut this mood would not last; it had often quite changed by the time ‘that the two of them reached the stables. She would notice with a sudden pain in her heart that he stooped when he walked, not much yet, but a little. And she loved his broad back, she had always loved it—a kind, reassuring protective back. Then the thought would come that perhaps its great kindness had caused it to stoop as though bearing a burden; and the thought would come: ‘He is bearing a burden, not his own, it’s someone else’s—but whose?’",

Two railway-station kombi taxis stopped outside and more than forty young men, wearing new khaki uniforms or worn jungle fatigues, swarmed into the café. Each had a large canvas kitbag slung over his shoulder, all were aggressively unruly. They shouted their demands for beer and food, pushing the orderly queue aside, unnerving the regulars and causing the elderly owners to go pale while serving them fast and po-faced. Several walked across the tables, their boots clanging on the metal – at which point I saw the usefulness of having immobile furniture. Their paying technique prevented the Afrikaners from checking on whether or not they had received the correct amount – but they weren’t going to argue. This was, in effect, a raid on the café by MK soldiers who – together with some 6,000 of their comrades – yesterday went AWOL from various military bases.",

With the sun sinking behind the nearby mountains, the evening quickly grew cold. A bleak wind came whipping down from the emptiness of Canada, 300 miles to the north, the kind of wind that slips up the back of your jacket and humiliates your hair. It resonated down the telephone lines, like a man whistling through his teeth, and made the tall grass seethe. Somewhere a gate creaked and banged, creaked and banged. The highway stretched out flat and straight ahead of me until it narrowed to a vanishing-point some miles away. Every so often a car would come at me down the highway from behind, sounding eerily like a jet taking off. As it came nearer and nearer I would half wonder for one moment if it was going to hit me – it sounded that close – and then it would flash past and I would watch its tail-lights disappear into the gathering gloom.",

    "target_paragraph": "MORNING. As he awoke he perceived drowsily that the room had at the same moment become dense with sunlight. The ebony panels of one wall had slid aside on a sort of track, leaving his chamber half open to the day. A large negro in a white uniform stood beside his bed.\n“Good-evening,” muttered John, summoning his brains from the wild places.\n“Good-morning, sir. Are you ready for your bath, sir? Oh, don’t get up—I’ll put you in, if you’ll just unbutton your pajamas—there. Thank you, sir.”\nJohn lay quietly as his pajamas were removed—he was amused and delighted; he expected to be lifted like a child by this black Gargantua who was tending him, but nothing of the sort happened; instead he felt the bed tilt up slowly on its side—he began to roll, startled at first, in the direction of the wall, but when he reached the wall its drapery gave way, and sliding two yards farther down a fleecy incline he plumped gently into water the same temperature as his body.\nHe looked about him. The runway or rollway on which he had arrived had folded gently back into place. He had been projected into another chamber and was sitting in a sunken bath with his head just above the level of the floor. All about him, lining the walls of the room and the sides and bottom of the bath itself, was a blue aquarium, and gazing through the crystal surface on which he sat, he could see fish swimming among amber lights and even gliding without curiosity past his outstretched toes, which were separated from them only by the thickness of the crystal. From overhead, sunlight came down through sea-green glass.\n“I suppose, sir, that you’d like hot rosewater and soapsuds this morning sir—and perhaps cold salt water to finish.”\nThe negro was standing beside him.\n“Yes,” agreed John, smiling inanely, “as you please.” Any idea of ordering this bath according to his own meager standards of living would have been priggish and not a little wicked.\nThe negro pressed a button and a warm rain began to fall, apparently from overhead, but really, so John discovered after a moment, from a fountain arrangement near by. The water turned to a pale rose color and jets of liquid soap spurted into it from four miniature walrus heads at the corners of the bath. In a moment a dozen little paddle-wheels, fixed to the sides, had churned the mixture into a radiant rainbow of pink foam which enveloped him softly with its delicious lightness, and burst in shining, rosy bubbles here and there about him.\n“Shall I turn on the moving-picture machine, sir?” suggested the negro deferentially. “There’s a good one-reel comedy in this machine to-day, or can put in a serious piece in a moment, if you prefer it.”\n“No, thanks,” answered John, politely but firmly. He was enjoying his at too much to desire any distraction. But distraction came. In a moment he was listening intently to the sound of flutes from just outside, flutes ripping a melody that was like a waterfall, cool and green as the room itself, accompanying a frothy piccolo, in play more fragile than the lace of u s that covered and charmed him.\nAfter a cold salt-water bracer and a cold fresh finish, he stepped out and into a fleecy robe, and upon a couch covered with the same material he was rubbed with oil, alcohol, and spice. Later he sat in a voluptuous chair while he was shaved and his hair was trimmed.\n“Mr. Percy is waiting in your sitting-room,” said the negro, when these operations were finished. “My name is Gygsum, Mr. Unger, sir. I am to see to Mr. Unger every morning.”\nJohn walked out into the brisk sunshine of his living-room, where he found breakfast waiting for him and Percy, gorgeous in white kid knickerbockers, smoking in an easy chair.",

The shape resolved itself into a woman’s; she was looking on the ground, and walking slowly as if searching for something that had been lost, her course being precisely that of Mr. Melbury’s gig.

When you walk down the narrow streets of Florence, Vespas (and cars) whiz by so closely you can feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. There are designated parking stations for Vespas, and one of them is outside the windows of Mary Ann and Amedeo's pensione. Their noise has sent more than a few tourists flying to a hotel in the hills of Fiesole; for me, the eccentric and happy hominess of the Pitti Palace is more than ample recompense for belching motorscooters and motorcycles (for which Vespa has become the generic term).",

I found myself turning dumbstruck to people passing on the sidewalk as if to say ‘Do you see this building here?’, but they all just hunched past, quite unmoved by its existence. I just don’t understand the world.",
