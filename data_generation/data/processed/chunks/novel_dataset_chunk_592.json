Later, at another site near “Red Idol Gorge” (as the British rendered it), almost 200 more Tibetans were killed, while British casualties amounted to three wounded. At every point the invading troops, as they seemed, fired on the locals with machine guns, and the Tibetans retaliated with slingshots or flung rocks. Though the British gamely carried wounded Tibetans to a military field hospital, the overall impression, in John Buchan’s words, was of a “big boy at school” pushing back an “impertinent youngster.”",

Feeling my way down a steep wooden ladder, I fumbled across a darkened courtyard and splashed my face with icy water from a pump. Then, while the world was still dreaming, I walked out into the inky streets, and traveled by bus, far, far out of town, past phantoms clomping through the blue-black alleyways, past the sleeping yak-hair tents of nomads, lit by tiny candles, past silhouettes of prayer flags flapping above squat, mud-brick houses, far, far across the high plateaus to a lonely hilltop monastery. There, in the chill of first light, some monks and nomads invited me to join them where they sat. Our breath condensed in the early air, as we shared rough bread and tea made of rancid yak butter and salt. Then, as the sun began to burn away the mist, a monk got up without a word and opened a door, letting me wander through the darkened chambers of the lamasery. Every one of them was heavy with the artichokey smell of butter lamps. Ancient scrolls were stacked inside glass cases thick with dust. Rows of flickering candles encircled placid Buddhas. Dog-eared snapshots of the Dalai Lama stood about their altars. In some rooms, in the darkness, small windows were thrown open to the bright, sharp air, framing the distant snowcaps against a brilliant blue. In others, the sun came down in shafts upon the chanting monks, flooding the room with light.",

In a locked closet was now discovered an extraordinary collection of articles. There were several sets of lady’s dresses in the piece, of sundry expensive materials; silks and satins, poplins and serges, all of colours which from Bathsheba’s style of dress might have been judged to be her favourites. There were two muffs, sable and ermine. Above all there was a case of jewellery containing four heavy gold bracelets and several lockets and rings, all of good quality and manufacture. These things had been bought in Bath and other towns from time to time, and brought home by stealth. They were all carefully packed in paper, and each package was labelled ‘Bathsheba Boldwood’, a date being subjoined six years in advance in every instance.",

For years Fidel has been condemning the Cuban variety, to no effect; even during the Special Period, with its particular urgent needs, the Faceless Ones resisted most reforming efforts. Cubans are of course the main victims, often on a daily basis. Tourists usually escape this net, woven of illogicality, but free-range travellers are soon enmeshed. For instance, Havana’s railway ticket office is a brisk ten minutes walk away from the station itself – why? Moreover, there are two offices in separate buildings, one for Cubans, one for foreigners – why? Arriving at 12.50, I was told to return at 1.15; one’s ticket must be bought within the hour of departure – why? Then, having queued twice in that vast office, one has to queue again, within the station, for the ticket to be ‘Confirmed’.",

He was only a 600-rupee-a-month man, and his place was therefore with 600-rupee-a-month men. But at that level there were no outsiders, no one who, like Malhotra, had rejected the badges of food and caste and dress. He wished to marry; it was also what his parents wished for him. But his colonial eye made him aspire too high. ‘Don’t call us. We will call you.’ ‘We thank you for your interest, and we will let you know as soon as the numerous applications have been gone through.’ ‘We don’t appreciate 600 rupees a month.’ This was what the son of one family said. And below that there was, in Malhotra’s view, little more than village society. No marriage, then, for him; and the years were going by, and his parents were breaking their hearts. He could only share his bitterness with his friends.",

Instinctively I know how the waves roll, when one will duck and weave to give a clear view for another hundred yards or half a mile. This noon a freighter streams up from astern, a bit to the north of us. The hand flares are nearly invisible in the daylight, so I choose an orange smoke flare and pop it. The dense orange genie spreads its arms out and flies off downwind just above the water. Within a hundred feet it has been blown into a haze thinner than the smoke of a crowded pub. The ship cuts up the Atlantic a couple of miles abeam and smoothly steams off to the west. She must be headed to an island port.",

Then black goats come clicking up the ice glaze, straight, straight up to the noon sky; the goat horns turn silver on the blue as, in the vertigo and brilliance of high sun, the white peak spins. The goatherd, clad from head to boots in blood-red wool, throws balls of snow to keep his beasts in line; crossing the sun, the balls dissolve in a pale fire.",

Across the West, with its restless youth, a great many things—sex, society, authority—were being rethought or sharply questioned, and the little world of surfing rose, in its way, to the insurrectionary moment. The shortboard revolution was inseparable from the zeitgeist: hippie culture, acid rock, hallucinogens, neo–Eastern mysticism, the psychedelic aesthetic. The peace movement, just entering its boom period nationally, never developed a coherent surfers’ wing (the environmental movement has been another story), but the world of surfing became, however incoherently, and pace Francis Ford Coppola, broadly antiwar. Many surfers dodged the draft. Even famous surfers, guys who could hardly paddle out anywhere without being photographed, but who were now wanted by the authorities, tried to go underground.",

Once, desperately, on a July afternoon, when the morning’s work had gone wrong and father had been cross, she had managed to perspire herself back to patience by taking an omnibus to the foot of Primrose Hill and then walking very quickly up and down its asphalt paths in the sun ten times without stopping. But this she had found both dull and conspicuous, and she laughed as she thought of her dogged determination not to leave those slopes till she perspired, the I-will-not-let-thee-go-until-thou-bless-me attitude, the time it took before the wretched place did bless her, the astonished faces of the people she met, of the people on seats who kept on seeing her striding by, and the steadily increasing distrust of the policeman at the bottom of the hill.",

The old part of Tobolsk provides that, with the kreml visible at a distance and the humdrum structures of the city not prominent at all. The walls of the kreml are white, fifty feet high, with conically shaped towers at each corner. St. Sophia Cathedral, inside the wall, has a large central tower and three subsidiary ones, and their main domes are a light blue with gilded dots on them and gold filigree at the top and bottom, and above are smaller gold domes supporting tall Orthodox crosses. And above all that is the sky and its suggestion of limitless Siberian space, more breathtaking than any modern building could make it seem. As we parked in the parking lot near the kreml and walked toward it, I noticed that one end of the structure was under renovation, and the scaffolding erected for it was of planks supported by tall, narrow fir-tree trunks with their bark still on. When the kreml was first being built, the scaffolding used then probably looked just the same.",

Trying to affect disdain, he avidly listens to breakfast conversations, uncontrollably grunting to express understanding, approval, or disapproval; he moves his lips in silent soliloquy. One morning he listens to an American who is on his way to Venice; while English spinsters stare, he bursts into song—a gondolier's song—holding a four-minute egg aloft in his hand. “Poor old thing” that he professes himself to be, Agostino would rather be Agostino than anyone else in the world. “Metro male,” he responds to inquiries about his well-being—which means, literally, “less bad,” a frugal Florentine way of saying: “I am as God wishes me to be.”",

I was about to drop my pants in the brush, when just ahead, a single, bowed aspen sapling caught my eye, arched into the trail like a flag, its base ten feet off in the tundra. It would have hit a hiker in the face. Who on earth would walk past that with a lopper in his hand? Fucking slackers.",

The small figure came on, flashed safely behind, then a narrow band of rushing green; a tree trunk like a wheel spoke in reverse, and the stallion struck clashing fire from wet concrete. It slid, clashed, fighting for balance, lunged and crashed down; and for Bayard, a red shock, then blackness. The horse scrambled up and whirled and poised and struck viciously at the prone man with its hooves, but the negro with the pitchfork drove it away and it trotted stiffly and with tossing head up the street and passed the halted motor car.

    "target_paragraph": "Working in a bedroom overlooking the sea, Lindbergh scribbled out his life story, using Carlyle MacDonald’s draft as a guide. In a little under three weeks he completed a manuscript of about forty thousand words?an impressive achievement in terms of output if not literary merit. The book, called We, was coolly received by critics. Lindbergh, as noted earlier, gave only passing mention to his childhood, and devoted just seven pages to his historic flight. The rest was mostly about barnstorming and delivering airmail. One reviewer drily observed, “As an author Lindbergh is the world’s foremost aviator.” The buying public didn’t care. We was published on July 27 and went straight to the top of the bestseller list. It sold 190,000 copies in its first two months. People couldn’t get enough of anything Lindbergh did.",

    "target_paragraph": "It didn’t take long to exhaust the possibilities for diversion in downtown Bryson City, and almost before I realized it I found myself on the highway out of town leading towards Cherokee, the next town along the valley. I followed it for a little way but there was nothing to see except a couple of derelict gas stations and barbecue shacks, and hardly any shoulder to walk on so that cars shot past only inches away and whipped my clothes into a disconcerting little frenzy. All along the road were billboards and large hand-lettered signs in praise of Christ: GET A GRIP ON YOUR LIFE – PRAISE JESUS, GOD LOVES YOU, AMERICA, and the rather more enigmatic WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU DIED TOMORROW? (Well, I thought, there would be no more payments on the freezer for a start.) I turned around and went back into town. It was 5.30 in the afternoon, Bryson City was a crypt with sidewalks, and I was at a complete loss. Down a small hill, beside the rushing river, I spied an A & P supermarket, which appeared to be open, and I went down there for want of something better to do. I often used to hang out in supermarkets. Robert Swanson and I, when we were about twelve and so obnoxious that it would have been a positive mercy to inject us with something lethal, would often go to the Hinky-Dinky supermarket on Ingersoll Avenue in Des Moines during the summer because it was airconditioned, and pass the time by doing things I am now ashamed to relate – loosening the bottom of a bag of flour and then watching it pour on to the floor when some unsuspecting woman picked it up, or putting strange items like goldfish food and emetics in people’s shopping carts when their backs were turned. I didn’t intend to do anything like that in the A & P now – unless of course I got really bored – but I thought it would be comforting, in this strange place, to look at foodstuffs from my youth. And it was. It was almost like visiting old friends – Skippy Peanut Butter, Pop Tarts, Welch’s Grape Juice, Sara Lee cakes. I wandered the aisles, murmuring tiny cries of joy at each sighting of an old familiar nutrient. It cheered me up no end.",

For a month she struggled against aching silences, wild reproaches and accusations—she pled with him, made quiet, pitiful little love to him, and he laughed at her bitterly—and then she, too, slipped gradually into silence and a shadowy, impenetrable barrier dropped between them. The surge of love that had risen in her she lavished on Donald, her little boy, realizing him almost wonderingly as a part of her life.",

I look on these venerable. people as I should on people who had seen the Deluge, or the burial of Pompeii, and wonder that they eat and dress and live like other mortals! For they have felt the perpetual shudder of earthquakes, and their eyes, which look so calm and kind, have seen the inflowing of huge tidal waves, the dull red glow of lava streams; and the leaping of fire cataracts into deep\"lying pools, burning them dry in a night time. There were years in which there was no day in which the smoke of underground furnaces was out of their sight, or night which was not lurid with flames. Once they traced a river of lava burrowing its way 1500 feet below the surface, and saw it emerge, break over a precipice, and fall hissing into the ocean. Once from their highest mountain a pillar of fire 200 feet in diameter lifted itself for three weeks 1000 feet into the air, making night day, for a hundred miles round, and leaving as its monument a cone a mile in circumference. We see a clothed and finished earth; they see the building of an island, layer on layer, hill on hill, the naked and deformed product of the melting, forging, and welding, which go on perpetually in the crater of Kilauea.",

The book also had a real practical impact, with merchants clamouring to prepare expeditions following van Linschoten’s advice. Almost single-handedly, the young author spurred a burst of exploration that was to end the Portuguese monopoly on Asian trade and build the foundations of the Dutch empire. It was not for nothing that the historian E.M. Beekman later called him ‘the Moses of Dutch colonialism’.",

He struck away across the Seine, along the quays to the Cité, the net-work of old Paris, the great grey vaults of St. Eustache, the swarming streets of the Marais. He gazed at monuments dawdled before shop-windows, sat in squares and on quays, watching people bargain, argue, philander, quarrel, work-girls stroll past in linked bands, beggars whine on the bridges, derelicts doze in the pale winter sun, mothers in mourning hasten by taking children to school, and street-walkers beat their weary rounds before the cafés.",

I closed my eyes and the distant sound of a festival drum – a deep sodden thump of a sound practically drowned in the shush of the rain – came floating through the bathroom window.

They moved provocatively slowly, stopping twice to exchange amused comments about certain IDs – shades of my Peace Now bus tour. As I swore sotto voce Hanna said, ‘They’re not all like this. Some are tougher, some better. Coming back is much worse.’",

When the elder saw the lion in such distress, he sat down and, taking the paw, he lanced it. The point was removed and also much pus. He cleansed the wound well, bound it up and dismissed the beast. But the healed lion would not leave the elder. It followed him like a disciple wherever he went.

It was on the ground floor of the building, with a separate entrance, and a weathered name-plate on the door. Before going in he stepped in to the post-office for his mail—usually an empty ceremony—said a word or two to the town-clerk, who sat across the passage in idle state, and then went over to the store on the opposite comer, where Carrick Fry, the storekeeper, always kept a chair for him, and where he was sure to find one or two selectmen leaning on the long counter, in an atmosphere of rope, leather, tar and coffee-beans. Mr. Royall, though monosyllabic at home, was not averse, in certain moods, to imparting his views to his fellow-townsmen; perhaps, also, he was unwilling that his rare clients should surprise him sitting, clerkless and unoccupied, in his dusty office. At any rate, his hours there were not much longer or more regular than Charity’s at the library; the rest of the time he spent either at the store or in driving about the country on business connected with the insurance companies that he represented, or in sitting at home reading Bancroft’s History of the United States and the speeches of Daniel Webster.",

She hoped Raymond would speak of his mother’s attitude: she had her answer ready if he did! But he made no comment, he took no notice; her impulses of retaliation spent themselves against the blank surface of his indifference. He was as amiable, as considerate as ever; as ready, within reason, to accede to her wishes and gratify her whims. Once or twice, when she suggested running up to Paris to take Paul to the dentist, or to look for a servant, he agreed to the necessity and went up with her. But instead of going to an hotel they went to their apartment, where carpets were up and curtains down, and a care-taker prepared primitive food at uncertain hours; and Undine’s first glimpse of Hubert’s illuminated windows deepened her rancour and her sense of helplessness.",

She was still tirelessly beating and sprinkling as we were on our way back an hour later: but time is among Baltistan’s few plentiful commodities. And at least wool threshing keeps one warm.

    "target_paragraph": "This ‘hotel’ was opened two years ago when a weekly truck-bus-service from Lima began and it seemed possible that tourists might find Conchucos. So far they haven’t. The large, two-storeyed, brightly blue-washed structure was built by Rosa’s menfolk, with the assistance of eighteen relatives and friends. Our room opens directly onto the pavement and has a tethering hook outside the door. The floor is of beaten earth and the two unglazed windows are heavily barred. As I write this – by very dim electric light, which goes off at intervals for ten or fifteen minutes – half the adolescent population of the town seems to be crowding around the door and windows. They are a noisy lot and Rachel wants to get to sleep so I am now going to hang space-blankets as curtains.",
