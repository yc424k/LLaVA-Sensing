Since I had learned of the tire lane’s existence and ran with a co-driver who always stopped there, I got the trailer tires looked at every time possible. Many days a mechanic walked out when our rig pulled up, but often no one did. If a mechanic did step out and start checking the tires, I looked in the side mirrors for several minutes while updating my logbook before climbing down from the truck to record the seal numbers on the back of each trailer. Writing down the seal numbers gave us a chance to check on the status of the tire inspection or to make sure a mechanic really did replace a light or give the dolly some needed minor repair.",

In perfect English he asked for our passes. We affected not to understand and said we were pilgrims from Kashmir. He thought this over for a moment and then found a solution which spelled finis to our hopes of escape. There were, he said, two Kashmiris in the neighbouring house. If we could make them understand us, we could go on our way. What devilish ill-luck had brought two Kashmiris into the neighbourhood just at that moment? I had only used this “alibi” because it was the most unlikely thing to find Kashmiris in this region.",

Even in such a position as theirs it was possible to exist in a dream. In the afternoon the rain came on again, and Marian said that they need not work any more. But if they did not work they would not be paid; so they worked on. It was so high a situation, this field, that the rain had no occasion to fall, but raced along horizontally upon the yelling wind, sticking into them like glass splinters till they were wet through. Tess had not known till now what was really meant by that. There are degrees of dampness, and a very little is called being wet through in common talk. But to stand working slowly in a field, and feel the creep of rain-water, first in legs and shoulders, then on hips and head, then at back, front, and sides, and yet to work on till the leaden light diminishes and marks that the sun is down, demands a distinct modicum of stoicism, even of valour.",

She had heard the call of the Atlantic seaboard, and the next summer found the Spraggs at Skog Harbour, Maine. Even now Undine felt a shiver of boredom as she recalled it. That summer had been the worst of all. The bare wind-beaten inn, all shingles without and blueberry pie within, was “exclusive,” parochial, Bostonian; and the Spraggs wore through the interminable weeks in blank unmitigated isolation. The incomprehensible part of it was that every other woman in the hotel was plain, dowdy or elderly—and most of them all three. If there had been any competition on ordinary lines Undine would have won, as Van Degen said, “hands down.” But there wasn’t—the other “guests” simply formed a cold impenetrable group who walked, boated, played golf, and discussed Christian Science and the Subliminal, unaware of the tremulous organism drifting helplessly against their rock-bound circle.",

For necessary money, they could work from time to time in Fairbanks—and, possibly, in Eagle. But they hoped to live much of the year apart from any community. “I reject suburbia,” Snow was not shy to explain. “I reject crowds. I do not want a new car, a fancy house. They are not worth working for. In the Lower Forty-eight, economic pressure made it impossible for me to have the land and space I would like to have without spending twenty years to get it and then being surrounded by box houses. In order to get anything like what I wanted, in New Hampshire, I would have had to deal in large figures. I was unwilling to complicate my life to get those figures.”",

The monkey sat in a corner moaning like a child, and as the sun declined and the flies left us, the cockchafers came, detonating against the wall. A rat had died under the floor, and the smell of decay settled over the compound. This was the second place where there was nothing to do but get drunk. We looked across the wall with envy towards the airy village. We were enclosed like lepers with the dead rat and the cockchafers.",

I’m sure I heard a crack as of splintering wood ? did a series of graceless pirouettes which even as they were occurring put me in mind of the Frankenstein monster on roller skates, spun across the road, smacked face-first into the barn wall and, after teetering theatrically for a moment, fell backwards.",

Stephen would go for long rides alone, leaving Mary to idle about the villa; and when she got back Mary would not speak, but would wander away by herself to the garden. For Stephen had grown almost harsh at times, possessed as she now was by something like terror, since it seemed to her that what she must say to this creature she loved would come as a death-blow, that all youth and all joy would be slain in Mary.\nTormented in body and mind and spirit, she would push the girl away from her roughly: ‘Leave me alone, I can’t bear any more!’ ‘Stephen—I don’t understand. Do you hate me?’\n‘Hate your Of course you don’t understand—only, I tell you I simply can’t bear it.’\nThey would stare at each other pale-faced and shaken.\nThe long nights became even harder to endure, for now they would feel so terribly divided. Their days would be heavy with misunderstandings, their nights filled with doubts, apprehensions and longings. They would often have parted as enemies, and therein would lie the great loneliness of it.\nAs time went on they grew deeply despondent, their despondency robbing the sun of its brightness, robbing the little goat-bells of their music, robbing the dark of its luminous glory. The songs of the beggars who sang in the garden at the hour when the santa noche smelt sweetest, those songs would seem full of a cruel jibing: A-a-a-y! Before I saw thee I was at peace, but now I am tormented because I have seen thee.’\nThus were all things becoming less good in their sight, less perfect because of their own frustration.",

Two months later the Land Bank, glowing with political correctness, publicized its decision to grant loans to part-time farmers by way of helping blacks.

At last, after many failures, they had succeeded in wakening Vincent to a sense of distant kinship with the life of boys and maidens. Down at the bottom of his nature there had always been an intense craving for affection, and his heart went out to Ted and Katherine. Not that he considered himself fit for their blameless society. Together with the vices he had acquired there had sprung up humility, that strange virtue, which has its deepest roots in the soil of shame. But all his old yearning after goodness revived in their presence. When he was with them he felt that the cloud of foul experience was lifted for a moment from his mind; they gave him sweet thoughts instead of bitter for a day perhaps, or a night.",

This was in the eighties and we were taking dive trips once a year or so. We’d just gotten certified and were still very excited about scuba diving. We were young and it was a brand new adventure. It was the last day of our trip to Cozumel and we were really dreading having to leave, not just because we had to return to work but also because winter was coming on soon and we knew it would be quite a while before we would feel warm sunshine on our skin again, much less see palm trees, beaches and coral reefs. We pushed our toes into the white powder sand at a funky little beachfront bar, sipped icy Coronas and tried to make the most of the short time we had left in paradise. A warm breeze drifted over the beach from the blue Caribbean and ruffled my hair. From behind my sunglasses I idly watched a sailboat that was anchored just off the beach, a ketch about forty feet long, only I didn’t know it was a ketch because I didn’t know about rigs then. The two young couples onboard had led the anchor rode to the stern and hoisted a spinnaker in the gentle breeze. They used the spinnaker like a tire swing, taking turns hanging onto the cinched-up sheets (or maybe they had a boatswain’s seat fixed to the sheets) and letting the spinnaker billow out and blow them up over the water in front of the bow. Sometimes they would turn loose and fall into the water and swim back to the boat. Wavelets shimmered in the afternoon sun, the girls giggled, and you could just tell they were all having a blast, not a care in the world. It made me think of that Jimmy Buffet song, “Nautical Wheelers”. I remembered seeing the boat anchored there when we first arrived on the island a week before and it didn’t look like they were about to leave anytime soon. We had to go home tomorrow, but they didn’t, or so it seemed to me. One of the couples had what looked like permanent tans and acted like they were home. It looked like they might be living a lifestyle rather than taking a vacation. This made a bigger impression on me than it might otherwise have because I had been privately fantasizing all week about ways we might save up enough money to come live on Cozumel for the winter months and just dive and live the good life, maybe stay in one of the little posadas in town, get the monthly rate. Maybe even figure out some way to earn some money here. This was before Cozumel got all touristy, when it was still something like a laid-back fishing village and dirt-cheap. I hadn’t run this idea by Cheryl. Maybe I had mentioned a little something about it in passing, but it was essentially a private fantasy at that point.",

In Cordova, hitch transport was a boat or a bush plane, both signaled by a mechanized roar and the odor of fuel. I definitely missed the mules, but there was something heady about packing tools under the prow of a silvery dinghy in a stiff wind, buckling up float coat as an extra layer of warmth for the ride home, or tossing duffel into the rear of a fixed-wing flown by a salty fiftysomething woman who’d been piloting small craft in Alaska since she got her license at age seventeen. In this new country my hiking prowess, nurtured over years of long miles, was barely necessary. The memorized knots and hitches, all the rules for safe passage on trails with stock, out the window. In land this massive, passage home meant rocketing through sea spray, the thwack of hull on swells, or humming below the clouds with the quilted earth below confirming what I’d already guessed: the usual scale is useless here, everything farther, wilder than I imagined.",

Jomo moved with a slow deliberateness. His raking, watering, and planting all somehow seemed filled with solemn wisdom. He would look up in the middle of trimming a hedge and say, “That is good meat,” and then walk to the goatskin bag tied behind his bicycle to rummage for his catapult. Once, he shot a bush pigeon down from the cashew tree with a small stone, wrapped it in leaves, and put it into his bag.",

Back home, my friend Louise directed a project in the Highlands which sought to remove the Rhododendron ponticumdescendants of those escaped from Victorian gardensfrom where it had been spreading beneath old-growth Scots pines and crowding out the native species. It was, effectively, all-out war. For the best part of a year, the team ripped out rhododendrons, chainsawing them into sections, then feeding the cuttings into a mulcher, which spat them out as chippings. In other places, they built pyres and burned the corpses. Afterward, they injected the stumps with herbicide, to prevent resprouting.",

His exhibition had gone well, he had drunk cognac and slept on the plane, and he appeared in a remarkably untroubled mood. For a few days we walked on the beach, built fires there, took hikes in the woods. I had never seen a forest of such variety, with sky-high larches, rank on rank of birches, poplars four feet around, and an understory full of blueberry, currant, and red raspberry bushes, along with ferns of many kinds and mushrooms soggy with rainwater and shot through with worms. The food in the resort’s dining room was neither good nor plentiful, so we added to it with fish Katya and I caught in a nearby river, the Maksimikha, using grasshoppers for bait. The fish were small, but wrapped in wet paper from Katya’s sketchbook and baked in the coals of our beach fire, they tasted fine. While improvising a fishing pole for Katya from a willow sapling, I cut deep into the ball of my thumb with my barlow pocketknife, and I made a fuss about that.",

The dance is just a character study of a warrior as he prepares for and engages in combat. Solo baris is considered to be the basic male dance and is taught to all male dance students, since it incorporates the fundamental movements of the entire spectrum of Balinese dance. Solo baris is often performed by young boys, in contrast to the baris gede groups, which are largely older men.",

A large tour bus shuttled tourists through the forest from the museum to the camp, its sides tastefully emblazoned with decorative flames and key facts about the site (102,000 dead! 120 Roma killed!). I preferred to walk and set out along a winding path through the trees. In the late 1960s, the area adjoining the camp had become an important site for radio telescopy and the path passed close to a long row of enormous white satellite dishes, each the size of a five-storey building, pointed through the forest canopy at the sky. There was something unsettling, I thought, about a place where thousands had been sent to their deaths now being used to look for life on other worlds.",

Maud was born with almost no chin and spent most of her time alone. To provide an activity, her mother gave her material to begin painting. After the death of both parents, Maud married a poor fish peddler who took care of the house while she, in spite of her severely impaired hands, brought in money with her paintings. She began by painting brightly colored flowers on almost every surface of her cottage, including walls, windows, and even the wood-burning stove. Her front door was always open to visitors curious about the flower-covered exterior. As her reputation grew, people stopped to visit and purchase her work. Her house has been restored and the entire structure moved inside the museum.",
