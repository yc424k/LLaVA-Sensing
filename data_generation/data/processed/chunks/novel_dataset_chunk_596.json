His Paul Simon was perfect in its boyish sweetness. Yet what his own voice sounded like, and what his own personality might have been, were impossible to tell. And when it came to improvising, adding some of the frills or flourishes that his culture relished, making a song his own, he—like every other singer I had heard—simply did not bother.",

I’ve lived just for this moment. I came two thousand miles across the continent to blow your brains out …’\n\n‘Did you hear him?’ cried Robert, jumping up from the table. ‘Did you hear what he said, Martha?

And now that she had put that right, and in so doing had subdued the impertinences and irrelevances that plucked her attention and made her remember how she was such and such a person, had such and such relations to people, she took her hand and raised her brush. For a moment it stayed trembling in a painful but exciting ecstasy in the air. Where to begin?—that was the question; at what point to make the first mark? One line placed on the canvas committed her to innumerable risks, to frequent and irrevocable decisions. All that in idea seemed simple became in practice immediately complex; as the waves shape themselves symmetrically from the cliff top, but to the swimmer among them are divided by steep gulfs, and foaming crests. Still the risk must be run; the mark made.",

We nodded, he rolled his bicycle up to us, and we took the five-minute ride to the hotel. Getting out, we handed him 40 fen (there are 100 fen in a yuan), and he pushed the money back to us. Again, the Brit gave him the fare, and began walking away. He hurried up and grabbed the Brit by the arm, thrusting the money back into his hand. His friends began gathering around. He shouted at us. We stood our ground. He shouted again. The Brit shouted back. The mood of the crowd started to turn ugly. The man poked at the Brit’s arm, and the Brit pushed him back. There were shouts and threats. The Brit gave him the money again and he threw it on the ground. Alarmed by the mounting air of violence, I raced into the hotel and brought back a young gift-shop proprietress to serve as an interpreter. She explained that the man wanted 4 yuan. We told her that we had paid only 1 yuan for four people on the way over. The Brit handed over 40 fen again, and the man let out a shout. The girl, looking back and forth with rising alarm, told us that the driver was going to bring the police. Thirty or forty people had gathered around by now, some of them curious, some of them furious. The Brit threw 40 fen onto the ground and began walking away. The man spit at us. The girl, looking more and more miserable, said we would be taken to jail. The man hovered over us. The Brit cursed. The girl asked us just to pay 2 yuan and be done with it. We protested. The man circled around. At last, we handed over 2 yuan and, twenty-five minutes after the dispute had begun, the gang of rickshaw drivers shambled sullenly away.",

It was very hot, and after a little we got tired of the market itself and wandered around the outskirts. We peered into the courtyard of His Highness’s grandfather’s tomb, against the entrance to which grows the pretty plant which I have already mentioned. It is the oleander (kanel), a poisonous evergreen shrub with bright red or white flowers and leathery spear-like leaves. I remembered what was alleged to have happened to His Highness’s grandfather, and wondered whether this plant, which was the only vegetation growing there, had been deliberately selected to keep this particular memory green. The tomb, Babaji Rao tells me, contains nothing but an oil-painting of the deceased, his bed, pillow, and sandals, and a few of his ashes.",

Were Sweden and Switzerland the same country? He asked what London was like, and my cousin chose to tell him of the underground trains, but it wasn’t an easy idea to convey to someone who had never seen an ordinary train. ‘Very remarkable,’ he said coldly and disbelievingly at the end of it and changed the subject by humming God Save the King. The boy with the gun walked behind and last followed the tiny piccaninny in the transparent vest.

Popeye watched him, his forefingers in his vest, the cigarette (he had smoked it down without once touching it with his hand) curling across his face. His expression was savage, perhaps baleful; contemplative, watching the man in overalls recross the floor with a kind of alert diffidence, the jug clumsily concealed below his flank; he was watching Popeye, with that expression alert and ready for mirth, until he left the room. Again they heard his bare feet on the porch.",

Among the waterfowl of the Paine lakeshores Fabien had pointed out a fat bird called the Chiloé widgeon which sang a three-syllable chorus; when I listened properly I heard a finely tuned orchestra vibrating through the cold air, percussion furnished by the high-pitched squeal of a piqued guanaco.",

It did not take me long to find the narrow alleyway, and I made my way quickly to the mess of broken shacks. As a little boy skipped past, I showed him the number 193. He pointed to a gate, and I walked hesitantly through. Five or six doors were arranged around a small, dusty courtyard. On one of them, in the corner, I found the number 404. I knocked, and there was a long silence. Then at last a slight teenage girl opened up. Behind her was a tiny, barren room scarcely big enough for the three mattresses on its floor. On the wall a few Playboy pinups flapped idly. Two other frightened-looking girls—one of them nursing a baby—looked up at me from where they were sitting on their beds.",

That was Audrey's room, he knew. Little fool! Ill with a feverish cold, and sleeping with open windows!

The building is self-contained, with no interfering landlords on site, and has enough room for an upstairs office and a downstairs home, plus it has a roof terrace and a tiny patch of scorched earth for a garden. The owner is a colonel who doesn’t rip us off too badly. We’re thrilled, but our old landlord, General Kumar, is distraught; we are deserters, abandoning him for a lower-ranking officer’s home.",

My temper wasn’t tolerable to Anna who, I believe, still wished for something better. For me, this was a far deeper love than I had experienced before?not an addiction, but equally compelling.

Habitually I sat by one of the barred, unglazed windows and one morning three young men stopped outside on the pavement, staring at my table. After a brief confabulation they entered and shyly offered me NP1 for a pen – the coin on an extended hand. Four pens were visible: blue, red, black and green, all in use when I’m journal-writing, a fetish which perhaps says something about how hard I find it to order my thoughts. Feeling mean and nasty, I apologised for needing all those pens because of being a writer. Gloomily the young men accepted this excuse, one explaining that in Santiago just then there were no pens and when the next delivery arrived they would cost CP1 apiece. Tactlessly I opened my purse to provide CP3. The young men stepped back, gesturing their horror – they weren’t jineteros, they didn’t want a tourist’s money, what they urgently needed, now, was one pen. I gave them my black and blue pens and accepted NP2.",

From the ground to the distant ceiling, a good three stories above us, the stairwell walls were divided into panels of different sizes by strips of wood, and some artist had filled each of them—scores in all—with a mural, some of them several feet across, some much smaller. They consisted entirely of romantic and idealized landscapes showing herds of kangaroos sipping at billabongs or swagmen gathered around a lonely coolibah tree. They were undeniably hokey, but charming even so and without question from a gifted hand. Almost involuntarily we found ourselves advancing slowly up the stairs, moving with silent absorption from one image to the next.",

Ambasz created a “Library in the Garden”—bookcases of precious woods and beveled glass that, acting as doors, swung open to reveal leather-bound books and old photographs in a house made for daydreams and repose, a house roofed in latticework densely covered by green leaves. No one, seeing that house, could possibly wish not to crawl into it for green and leafy shelter. From another aperture one sees, inside the house, a chair facing a bookcase. Books are stories, and an empty chair facing a bookcase tells a story: Someone is coming; someone has left—stories within stories . . . and stories are for consuming . . . a house one could eat, like a gingerbread house, or wear, like a skin.",

He loved his work, he said, even with the midges that emerged in their billions during the summer months, even with the deer-ticks that now carried Lyme disease. He had been born in Sutherland, but had married a French woman, and after living in the Auvergne for ten years they had moved back to Scotland, because he found he missed the landscape too much to keep away. Sometimes, in winter, he said, he went out deep into the forests, made a shelter, shot a deer, and stayed for a few days or a week. It saved the long walks in and out.",

After this, with a change of key, come one or two early Latin hymns and canticles; then the Dies Irae and the Stabat Mater. (Of Latin poets of the two centuries between the classical and the Christian, I scarcely even knew the names; it was a region to be invaded and explored alone, and much later and with great delight.) Last came a smattering of profane Mediaeval Latin lyrics, many of them from the monastery of Benediktbeuern. In the brief Greek coda to all this, the sound of barrel-scraping grows louder. It begins with the opening movement of the Odyssey, as it does for everyone who has dabbled in the language, followed by bits from the escape of Odysseus from the cave of Polyphemus; unexpectedly, not Heraclitus; nothing from the tragic dramatists (too difficult); snatches of Aristophanes; a few epitaphs of Simonides, two moon-poems of Sappho; and then silence.",

In addition a party of Turcomans have arrived, whose women wear tall red head-dresses hung with cornelian-studded plaques of silver gilt. Owing to this influx, food is short. There is no fuel. And as I can only light the room by opening the doors, I have to keep warm by putting on all my clothes and staying in bed. The shops sell Russian cigarettes and Swan ink, neither of which is much comfort. But I have bought some home-knitted socks that would resist the North Pole.",

The zigzag approach led to the complicated crisscross of spatial arrangements found in tea ceremony, as well as the slashing diagonals found in paintings on folding screens, and the design of woodblock prints – almost everything traditional or modern which looks ‘Japanese’. The origins of this style can be seen in the chaotic layout of the tsuka at Fushimi-inari.",

He lifted out the appropriate volume—Kosmologia-Leptokaryon—and lugged it to his table. ‘Here we are,’ he said, ‘Kravara’ and read the paragraph out loud, dealing with the fairly elaborate katharevousa of the dictionary—he went to school at the Gymnasium in Navpaktos—with impressive ease. ‘Some of the inhabitants,’ he read ‘in accordance with old custom, twisted their arms and legs at a youthful age or feigned blindness with intent to deceive as they wandered about the towns of Greece and, frequently, of foreign countries. . . .

The area had long been farmland, but a wealthy British family bought the fields and developed the neighborhood throughout the 1920s and 30s. Today, Dokki is home to Egypt’s modern-day aristocracy as well as thousands of university students. Dozens of embassies occupy regal estates and expensive apartments here. Many residents live in high-rise buildings with sweeping views of the Nile, and, on a clear day, the pyramids.",

But these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a whiplash.\nThe iridescent bubbles were beautiful. But they were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man loved to see the big sea turtles eating them. The turtles saw them, approached them from the front, then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and all. The old man loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet.\nHe loved green turtles and hawk-bills with their elegance and speed and their great value and he had a friendly contempt for the huge, stupid loggerheads, yellow in their armour-plating, strange in their love-making, and happily eating the Portuguese men-of-war with their eyes shut.",
