Her family had for several generations owned a shieling in the middle of the moor. They still gathered out there early each summer to spend several days cooking, walking and talking. When it wasn’t too cold, and not so dry that the heather was sharp, Anne liked to walk barefoot on the moor. ‘It takes about two weeks to get your feet toughened up so that it’s no discomfort. And then it’s bliss. You should try it when you’re out there. Take those big boots of yours off!’",

I thought west, where it would be rushing over the summits of Bin Chuanna and Croagh Patrick, scouring the golden island on which I had slept near Rosroe, and probing down into the shearwater burrows on Enlli. And I thought south, where it would be stirring the still air inside the Dorset holloways, and buffeting the birds on the Essex mudflats.",

There was a snug kávéház, a coffee-house (if only all Magyar were as easy as this!) less than a minute’s walk away in Holy Trinity Square (I could just manage Szent Háromság Tér, Saint Three-ship Place) and I was spending a morning of showery weather there with books and writing things. The coffee-house windows surveyed ancient palaces and the tall restored gothic steeple of the Coronation Church, and just in front, a plinth sprang from the cobbles and lifted a bronze horseman called Andreas Hadik into the raindrops; he was a commander in the Seven Years War who had dodged the armies of Frederick the Great, swooped on Berlin with a cavalcade of hussars, looted the place at lightning speed and galloped away again. At the next table, the only other person in the coffee-house was a frail, white-haired man reading the Pesti Hirláp. I couldn’t take my eyes off the headline. It ran: O boldog Angolország! I knew that the last word meant ‘England’, and the rest was obvious: it could only mean ‘O bulldog England!’, ‘O English bulldog!’ or something of the kind. The photograph below showed the Prince of Wales in a golfing pullover with a bold lozenge pattern and a tweed cap; but, very puzzlingly, the dog under his arm, which simultaneously stole the picture and turned it into an enigma, was a fox-terrier; they must have muddled the breeds. I couldn’t resist asking the reader in German if I had understood the words correctly. He laughed, and answered in English. No, it was nothing to do with dogs; ‘boldog’ is ‘happy’; ‘O fortunate England!’ was what the caption meant, and the gist of the article was England’s good luck in having so promising a Crown Prince. Hungary was a kingdom too, my neighbour ruefully added, but they only had a regent. The apostolic crown was empty.",

There are very sharp bare hills on the way to Olympia; and between them blue sea in triangular spaces. A little like the Cornish coast.

Alabama was conscious of how much she must fall short of the fine concision that marked the French girl’s work. When they danced together the combinations were mostly steps for Arienne rather than the lyrical things that Alabama did best, yet always Arienne cried out that the steps were not for her. She protested to the others that Alabama was an interloper.",

There were grand red carpets in the corridors, but they were torn. There were rows of gift-store display cases, but they were covered with dust.

Use the water (so icy cold out of the well all year long it hurts your teeth) to fill the Gatorade jug that poses as a faucet on the sink’s edge, press the little spigot: running water.

The chicken soup is made with rainwater. Paper towels are a guilty luxury. It’s normal until the day you forget to empty the slop bucket, and you drain a can of beans or dump a soaking pan and that last drop brings the water over the top of the bucket, flooding, thick and stinky, onto the floor, the rug, your feet. It doesn’t matter if it’s warm out or cold, light or dark, there’s only one way to vent the disgust and that is to yell at the top of your lungs the refrain favored by inhabitants of dry cabins all over the state, the admission, to the plumbed universe, that we’re posers at best: My sink drains into a fucking bucket!",

Hence the anxiety to keep him from annoyance showed not quite the ardour that would have animated it in former days.",

I, too, was feeling cold, despite my exertions: this was the sort of searching wind that conquers all. Yet I was afraid to take Hallam across a long, swaying bridge over a noisy stretch of Indus. He might have accepted it, but he seems not too happy while crossing the many short bridges over nullahs on this track. So we pressed on, hoping our US Army map was correct (it often isn’t) when it showed a hamlet some three miles further upstream on the right bank.",

By seven o’clock the air was blind with sweeping snow, the earth was carpeted, the streets were numb. The storm howled on, around houses warm with crackling fires and shaded light. All life seemed to have withdrawn into thrilling isolation. A horse went by upon the street with muffled hoofs.",

I've travelled on enough buses in India to know that you should always sit in the middle of the vehicle, so you are afforded maximum protection from any impact, though seat position is unlikely to save you if the bus goes over a cliff edge. In Southern India, I watched in horror as our driver tore through a busy town on the wrong side of the road, in a kamikaze overtaking manoeuvre which forced oncoming vehicles to swerve off the road and onto the footpath. The culmination of this deadly driving display was to run down a pedestrian who was stupid enough to be walking along the roadside, whilst only monitoring the oncoming vehicles. Clearly not expecting a fifty two-seater to be approaching from the rear, he was taken by surprise as we clipped him at speed, and sent his limp body spinning into a swampy ditch. The incident was horrific to witness but didn't deter our driver, who ploughed on regardless, scattering scooters, rickshaws, tuk-tuks and pedestrians to the soundtrack of a continuous horn blast.",

He had no private life anymore. Shirts he sent to the laundry never came back. Chicken bones and napkins from his dinner plate were fought over in kitchens. He could not go for a walk or pop into a bank or drugstore. If he went into a men’s room, people followed. Checks he wrote were rarely cashed; recipients preferred to frame them instead. No part of his life was normal, and there was no prospect that it ever would be again. As Lindbergh was discovering, it was a lot more fun to get famous than to be famous.",

One then ascends a long flight of steps to the main gate, done in the Balinese style. There are ponds of water surrounding the path with water flowing through them. The church itself is oval in plan and is open to the air on all sides. The language of the services alternates — one week in Indonesian, one week in Balinese. Church members are encouraged to bring gifts of food to the church on holy days, but instead of offering them to God, Balinese style, they share the gifts with each other. The church boasts a membership of 185 families.",

The whole pig, parsley entwined with the tail, apple—or a big mushroom—in its mouth, stretches across the cutting board. Sometimes the decapitated head sits aside at an angle, eyeing the rest of its body, which has been stuffed with herbs and bits of its own ears, etc. (best not to inquire too closely), then roasted in a wood oven. You can buy a panino (a crusty roll) with nothing on it but slabs of porchetta to take home, lean or with crispy, fatty skin. One of the lords of the porchetta wagons looks very much like his subject: little eyes, glistening skin, and bulbous forearms. His fingers are short and porky, with bitten-down nails. He’s smiling, extolling his pig’s virtues, but when he turns to his wife, he snarls. Her lips are set in a permanent tight half smile. I’ve bought from him before and his porchetta is delicious. This time I buy from the milder man in the next stand. For Ed, I ask for extra sale, salt, which is what the indefinable stuffing is called. I like it but find myself picking through to see if there’s something peculiar in it. Though the pig is useful and tasty in all its parts and preparations, the slow-roasted porchetta must be its apogee. Before I move on to the vegetables, I spot a pair of bright yellow espadrilles with ribbons to wind around the ankles; I balance my shopping bags while I try on one. Perfect, and less than ten dollars. I drop them in with the porchetta and parmigiano.",

She heard mounting the steps the blessed word Transport! ‘They,’ so Mark said: he and she—the family feeling again—were going to get Christopher into the Transport … By the kindness of God the First Line Transport was the only branch of the Services of which Valentine knew anything. Their charwoman, who could not read and write, had a son, a sergeant in a line regiment. ‘Hooray!’ he had written to his mother, ‘I’ve been off my feed; recommended for the D.C.M. too. So they’re putting me senior N.C.O. of First Line Transport for a rest; the safest soft job of the whole bally front line caboodle!’ Valentine had had to read this letter in the scullery amongst blackbeetles. Aloud! She had hated reading it as she had hated reading anything that gave details of the front line. But charity begins surely with the char! She had had to. Now she could thank God. The sergeant, in direct, perfectly sincere language, to comfort his mother, had described his daily work, detailing horses and G.S. limber wagons for jobs and superintending the horse-standings. ‘Why,’ one sentence ran, ‘our O.C. Transport is one of those fishing lunatics. Wherever we go he has a space of grass cleared out and pegged and b——y hell to the man who walks across it!’ There the O.C. practised casting with trout and salmon rods by the hour together. ‘That’ll show you what a soft job it is!’ the sergeant had finished triumphantly …",

He lifted this to the edge of the chest and opened it. The paper was brown and mellow with years, and it had a texture like that of slightly-moist wood ashes, as though each page were held intact by its archaic and fading print. He turned the pages carefully back to the fly leaves. Beginning near the bottom of the final blank page, a column of names and dates rose in stark, fading simplicity, growing fainter and fainter where time had lain upon them. At the top they were still legible, as they were at the foot of the preceding page. But halfway up this page they ceased, and from there on the sheet was blank save for the faint soft mottlings of time and an occasional brownish penstroke significant but without meaning.",

The water was stale, leaf-littered; and the heavy, inelegant stonework of the temple was roughly patched with new concrete. The temple was in the style of the Awantipur ruin, the ‘fort of the Pandavas’; but it was still in use, and it was this, rather than its age, which gave it greater meaning. Romance arose out of a sense of more than physical loss; and here, for Muslim as well as Hindu, nothing had been lost. A building might collapse or be destroyed or cease to be of use; another would take its place, of lesser or greater size or beauty. On the eastern side of Akbar’s lake fort an exquisite building lay in ruin. It might have been a mausoleum. Two towers stood at one end of a small cool quadrangle whose walls were faced with black marble. The towers were broken, the flat brick dome pierced; the elegantly proportioned Mogul arches had been filled in with mud bricks, now partly disintegrated; rubble blocked the entrances and littered the high-stepped Mogul staircases which led to low dusty chambers where the fine stone grilling of the windows was broken or lost. But decay, spectacular as it was, lay only in the eye of the visitor. More important than the ruin were the corrugated-iron latrines and washing places which had been built there for the use of those who came to pray at the nearby mosque.",

When he got down-stairs, Starwick’s restless manner had increased perceptibly: he was pacing up and down, smoking one cigarette after another. In the same leisurely and maddening manner they left the hotel. Starwick asked where they were going: Eugene replied cheerfully that they were going to dinner at a modest little restaurant across the Seine. By the time they had walked across the bridge, and through the enormous arches of the Louvre, Starwick was gnawing his lips with chagrin. In the restaurant Eugene ordered dinner and a bottle of wine; Starwick refused to eat, Eugene expressed regret and pursued his meal deliberately. By the time he had finished, and was cracking nuts, Starwick was almost frantic. He demanded impatiently to know where they were going, and the other answered chidingly:",

A shadow flickers on the canopy, grows, and a slight weight puts an imprint on the tent peak. Cautiously I bend forward and see the bird perched, looking aft, its feathers rustling in the wind and then falling back into place. I shoot out my arm. Instantaneously the bird’s wings spread. My fingers close on its straw legs. It squawks and snaps its wings down to gain lift, wheels its head around, and madly pecks at my fist. I grab its back with my other hand, drag its claws free of the tent, pull it into my den. In one quick move I twist its head around. There is a silent snap.",

I tried out an old headsail, one that I was told was original to the boat. It still worked, although it was a bit blown out.\nI rigged a preventer by running a line to the starboard bow-cleat from the cockpit and around to the end of the boom. I then positioned the sails “wing on wing” – with the mainsail starboard and the jib to port, supported by the whisker pole, on opposite sides of Sobrius, like a bird with its wings spread out catching the wind. This worked well, but took a lot of concentration to keep both sails filled and not gybe accidentally. It was a tranquil time on the water; Sobrius and I sailed as the sun set and a dolphin visited.\nSinglehand miles: 108",

When you set sail from a familiar shore you enter on a course from which the usual landmarks of daily existence have been swept away. What has become of the march of time? Dawn leads to noon, noon to sunset, sunset to the night; but night breaks into a dawn indistinguishable from the last, the same sky above, the same sea on every side, the same planks beneath your feet. Is it indeed another day? or is it yesterday lived over again? Then on a sudden you touch the land and find that that recurring day has carried you round half the globe. So it is in the desert. You rise and look out upon the same landscape that greeted you before?the contour of the hills may have altered ever so slightly, the hollow that holds your camp has deepened by a few yards since last week, the limitless sweep of the plain was not hidden a fortnight ago by that little mound; but here are the same people about you, speaking of the same things, here is the same path to be followed, yes, even the seasons are the same, and the dusty face of the desert is too old to flush at the advent of spring or to be wreathed in autumn garlands of gold and scarlet. Yet at the end of a long interval composed of periods recurrent and alike, you look round and see that the whole face of the universe has changed.",

Have I not told you in the course of it how the party’s spirits were up in the skies one hour, and down on the ground the next, how their gaiety some days at breakfast was childish in its folly, and their silence on others depressing, how they quoted poetry and played at Blind Man’s Buff in the morning, and in the afternoon dragged their feet without speaking through the mud, how they talked far too much sometimes, and then, when I wished to, would not talk at all, how they were suddenly polite and attentive, and then as suddenly forgot I could possibly want anything, how the wet did not damp their hilarity one day, and no amount of sunshine coax it forth the next? But of all their moods this of Menzies-Legh’s in the field above Canterbury was the one that surprised me most.",

There were probably forty people out, by far the biggest surf crowd I had seen on the East Coast. It was the first time I had been on a longboard in decades. Surfing had endured a longboard revival in the ’80s, driven mainly by older guys who could no longer manage shortboards. Longboards require less strength and agility. They catch waves more easily. But longboarders catch waves so early that at many spots they had started crowding out more high-performance boards. For me, it was a point of pride to keep riding a shortboard as I staggered into my forties. Reverting to a longboard would be, I thought, like using a geriatric walker—your dancing days were over. I planned to put it off as long as possible. I knee-paddled around the pack at Ditch and caught a wave outside. It felt odd, maneuvering a ten-foot board, but the ancient moves came back one by one, and by the end of the ride I was cross-stepping gingerly, mostly ironically, toward the nose. When I kicked out, a guy was sitting on the shoulder studying me. He was a hawk-nosed fellow about my age, with dark blond hair down past his shoulders and a goatee. “They didn’t tell me you were a longboarder,” he squawked.",

And instantly a feeling of such power rose up in him that he felt he could tear the buildings up by the roots like onions from the earth. The blazing image of the brawny, lusty beauty of the woman was stamped into his brain forever, giving its savage memory of joy to the hideous clamor of the ugly street and all the crowds of grey-faced people that swarmed round her.",
