He held up my sleeping-bag and bucket to be admired – but was at once sharply reprimanded by his father for unnecessarily touching a guest’s belongings. By now the men had edged into the tukal and we were all sitting close together on the bed, while outside the women excitedly discussed me. Soon they had decided that I must be transferred to the main dwelling-house – a rectangular, high-ceilinged, single-storey building, which consists of one large room, where several tree-trunks support the wooden beams of the mud roof and many grain bins take up most of the floor-space. Here the mud bed – which has been sacrificed to me – is about three feet high and built four feet out from the wall. The younger members of the family sleep on the floor around the fire and the poultry roost on crude shelves directly above the bed.",

The standard was much higher than in Ronda’s Hotel and having eaten nothing but dried apricots since 8 a.m. I relished every mouthful. The proprietor has not yet recovered from the shock of our arrival. A gaunt, elderly Pathan with a straggling beard, he wears a purple skull-cap that slightly gives him the air of a down-at-heel bishop. It was dark by the time we ate but the little room was adequately lit by the flames of the fire – lovely tongues of scarlet and orange leaping high around the giant dechis. The only other guests are the two Pathan jeep-drivers, on their way back from Skardu. I had expected them to share the storeroom with us but they are sleeping in the eating-house where the embers will remain aglow all night. They and the proprietor can huddle together under quilts on the square mud platform in front of the fire where customers sit cross-legged to eat their food. One jeep has broken down and a huge bonfire is now blazing outside to warm the driver as he lies under it, struggling with its infirmity. The other jeep is its mate and won’t continue to Gilgit without it. Many drivers prefer to do the Gorge trip in convoy.",

    "target_paragraph": "By the time Chekhov arrived in 1890, Nikolaevsk had sunk into obscurity. Half its houses were ruined and gaping like skulls, he wrote. The inhabitants were surviving in drunken lethargy, semi-starved, by exporting fish to Sakhalin, embezzling gold, preying on the natives and selling stag antlers as a Chinese aphrodisiac. For religion and politics they cared nothing (the most prominent priest was a gold smuggler). Sometimes they shot Chinese in the nearby forests.\nChekhov found no hostel. As evening came on, with his baggage piled on the quay, he started to panic. But at last he persuaded two natives to row him to an offshore steamer, and slept in a passable berth. Alexander and I arrive at the same dismal quayside, but find a Soviet hotel on the stark main square. We might have slipped back half a century. In its gaunt foyer a receptionist assigns us rooms without a word. The only other person in this echoing gloom is a guard watching the empty corridors on a closed-circuit television. I must have been allotted the honeymoon suite; the nylon sheets are printed with red hearts and roses, and two vodka glasses stand by the bed. A fire notice on the door, rendered into quaint English, advises that if you cannot liquidate the burning, do not use the lift for avocation (there is no lift). At evening I look across at buildings where no one comes or goes – a palace of culture, a medical school – and street lamps that are never lit. I imagine I can smell the sea. Perhaps it is the knowledge that this is my journey’s end that turns sleep fitful. My face in the bathroom mirror looks harsher than I remember it, as if I were still gazing into the wind.",

Poor Richard, how I made him pay. I think he was truly frightened of me at times. But he was certainly game. I put him on Dookie for a ride, while I rode Bub, who started to shy and pig-root. I yelled at Richard to hang on, but through the fracas, I could hear the steady clicking of his camera. I have noticed this trait in many photographers – the ability to be much braver when they are looking through a lens than when they are not. Interesting.",

In Moscow, trying to set it up, Katya made many phone calls at odd hours to find out when and from where flights left for Ulan-Ude. Such Western conveniences as reserving airline tickets over the phone had not yet become routine in Russia. Finally she found a flight, and one afternoon Stas drove us and our luggage out to Domodedovo Airport, Moscow’s main airport for domestic travel. When we arrived, the place was in near chaos, packed with people in the steamy heat, most of the passengers not standing in lines but mobbing the counters in throngs. We tried to work our way through them and onto a plane but gave up not very near the departure gate. Stas took us back to Chuda’s, where it turned out we could not stay because other houseguests had just shown up. Stas then drove us to Alex’s mother’s apartment. Alex’s mother, Lyudmila Borisovna, let us in, and when she heard we had just been at Domodedovo, she made us take showers immediately. “The last thing we need around here is cholera,” she said.",

In a very short time every armed man from one end of Patusan to the other was on the alert, yet the banks of the river remained so silent that but for the fires burning with sudden blurred flares the town might have been asleep as if in peacetime. A heavy mist lay very low on the water, making a sort of illusive grey light that showed nothing. When Brown’s long-boat glided out of the creek into the river, Jim was standing on the low point of land before the Rajah’s stockade — on the very spot where for the first time he put his foot on Patusan shore. A shadow loomed up, moving in the greyness, solitary, very bulky, and yet constantly eluding the eye. A murmur of low talking came out of it. Brown at the tiller heard Jim speak calmly: “A clear road. You had better trust to the current while the fog lasts; but this will lift presently.” “Yes, presently we shall see clear,” replied Brown.",

Assuming we’ve had enough wind to sail through the night and have not had to motor, the battery voltage will be at the lowest point of the day, especially when sailing downwind. That’s because when sailing off the wind (except in very windy conditions) our wind generator is nearly useless due to low relative wind speed, and even if the previous day was sunny, our array of solar panels won’t have pumped in enough energy to overcome the extra electricity burned off by running the navigation lights and radar all night. I also like to keep our somewhat smallish fresh water tank topped up in case the reverse osmosis watermaker should fail, which would force us onto a strict water-rationing regimen for the rest of the passage. The high-pressure pump that powers the watermaker is belted off the engine, so an hour spent idling along with the propeller engaged is a fuel efficient way to increase our sailing speed by at least a knot, make twenty gallons of fresh water and charge the battery banks.",

We ordered some toast and a pot of tea and talked beside a sunlit pitch on which white-flanneled cricketers went through their motions with lazy grace. All the hubbub of Bombay was screened out in the quiet morning; we could almost, I thought, have been in Oxford, in a tranquillity broken only by the diffident thump of bat meeting ball, an occasional polite scatter of applause. A few girls in polka-dot dresses and high heels rambled around the pitch in the warm sea breeze. On the horizon were the steeples and towers of the red-brick Gothic buildings left by the British. And through the mild sunny morning we chatted about Gremlins, disco, the effects of PR.",

The hijackers agreed to a tow and Fidel directed the Minister of the Interior and the border patrol chief to oversee the rescue from Mariel. Three boats and a tug were deployed. By the time the ferry had been moored to the pier with a line several yards long, Fidel was on the scene. The hijackers continued to demand a faster boat while keeping knives to the throats of several women. It was then midnight and Special Forces, intent on freeing the hostages, had replaced the Coast Guard. But Fidel ordered them to take no action lest lives be lost. Through a police cruiser’s radio, he and his colleagues then tested the gang-leader’s state of mind and concluded that he was a genuine hazard, unlike the solitary hijacker with the mock grenade. At intervals he held his pistol to a Frenchwoman’s head, the safety clip off and the hammer cocked.",

Hours later, music and cheers filled my head with a pleasant dream, but it wasn’t a dream at all. I sat upright and looked around. The room was dark, but I saw Teresa’s silhouette by the open window. The noise was coming from outside. In the parking lot, eight stories down, two dozen men, women, and children formed a ring around a dancer. The dancer wore an elaborate robe of red cloth with gold stripes. He whirled on his toes, in a tight circle. He spun and spun faster. With each revolution he raised his arms higher and higher. He raised a long sword over his head and waved it up and down in the air. He aimed his sword at everyone and no one. He whirled faster and faster. His robe caught the breeze and stretched out from him like a fan. The music grew louder and the tempo raced. Someone in the crowd set off fireworks and the sparkling lights danced in the air, just outside our window. Teresa oohed and aahed. When we looked back to the parking lot, the dance was over. The audience applauded (so did Teresa) and followed the dancer back into the hotel. The next morning, we asked the front desk clerk about the party. “It was probably zaffa,” he said. The song and dance precedes a wedding party, he told us, and the hotel hosted weddings almost every night of the year. Teresa repeated the word, “zaffa.” She loved the whole affair, and she loved Egypt, if only for the moment.",

The plantations were always weird at this hour of eve—more spectral far than in the leafless season, when there were fewer masses and more minute lineality. The smooth surfaces of glossy plants came out like weak lidless eyes; there were strange faces and figures from expiring lights that had somehow wandered into the canopied obscurity; while now and then low peeps of the sky between the trunks were like sheeted shapes, and on the tips of boughs sat faint cloven tongues.",

Mikhail Küchelbecker’s older brother, Wilhelm Küchelbecker, was a poet and a friend of Pushkin’s who turns up often in stories of that poet’s action-filled life. Kukhla, as the elder Küchelbecker was called, even fought a duel with Pushkin, after Pushkin wrote some verses that said that reading Küchelbecker’s verses brought on a malady called “küchelbeckorrhea.” Kukhla challenged Pushkin, Pushkin accepted, Kukhla shot at Pushkin and missed. Declining to return fire, Pushkin threw his gun down in the snow and went to embrace his friend. Kukhla angrily insisted that Pushkin fire. Pushkin protested that his gun was now jammed with snow, and nothing came of the duel in the end.",

My first canister had expired at 7:00 A.M. on the Balcony, after lasting about seven hours. Using this as a benchmark, at the South Summit I’d calculated that my second canister would expire around 2:00 P.M., which I’d stupidly assumed would allow plenty of time to reach the summit and return to the South Summit to retrieve my third oxygen bottle.
