The last big eruption was three and a half years earlier, on September 26, 1984. As I was watching it erupted – suddenly I understood the expression to jump out of one’s skin. The steamy mudpack before me made a flapping sound like a colossal palpitating sphincter (my own sphincter, I can tell you, began to beat a modest counterpoint) and then with a whoosh like a whale coming up for air shot out a great, steaming plume of white water. It went up only about twenty or thirty feet, but it poured forth for many seconds. Then it died and came again, and it repeated this four times, filling the cool air with blankets of steam, before it went dormant. When it finished, I shut my mouth with my hand and walked back to the car, knowing that I had seen one of the more arresting sights of my life.",

Then a change occurred. The jets, which for long had been playing at a height of 300 feet, suddenly became quite low, and for a few seconds appeared as cones of fire wallowing in a sea of light; then with a roar like the sound of gathering waters, nearly the whole surface of the lake was lifted up by the action of some powerful internal force, and its whole radiant mass, rose three times, in one glorious, upward burst, to a height, as estimated by the surrounding cliffs, of 600 feet, while the earth trembled, and the moon and stars withdrew abashed into far-off space. After this the fire-fountain played as before. The cold had become intense, 11° of frost; and I crept back into the tent: those words occurring to me with a new meaning, \"dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto.\"",

His wife would have to know his secret or else life would be impossible. He was attracted by Giselle, with her candid gaze and white throat, pliable, silent, fond of excitement under her quiet indolence; whereas Linda, with her intense, passionately pale face, energetic, all fire and words, touched with gloom and scorn, a chip of the old block, true daughter of the austere republican, but with Teresa’s voice, inspired him with a deep-seated mistrust. Moreover, the poor girl could not conceal her love for Gian’ Battista. He could see it would be violent, exacting, suspicious, uncompromising—like her soul. Giselle, by her fair but warm beauty, by the surface placidity of her nature holding a promise of submissiveness, by the charm of her girlish mysteriousness, excited his passion and allayed his fears as to the future.",

There are beards in buns and beards in pigtails, there are beards separated into two braids each tucked behind an ear. There are beards tied down with a cord so tight it puffs out cheeks and thrusts fat lips forward. Some men even wear a facial hair net. But my favorite look would have to be the big bandage wrapped over the beard and tied at the top of the head—these guys look like they’re the victims of a permanent toothache. With my balding scalp I feel more naked and vulnerable than ever and put my dupatta shawl over my head as I travel along the facial hair parade. At a delightful guest house that smells of mothballs and faded glories, I sleep to dream of hair.",

Other precious artifacts dating from the eighth to the fifth centuries BC include decorative bronze and terracotta sculptures. The museum at Capo Colonna highlights architectural fragments and objects found in the sea, and also provides a good overview of the zone.",

Emotions flashed across her face like the sweep of sun-rent clouds over a quiet landscape, bringing out the gleam of hidden waters, the fervour of smouldering colours, all the subtle delicacies of modelling that are lost under the light of an open sky. And it was extraordinary how she could infuse into a principle the warmth and colour of a passion! If conduct, to most people, seemed a cold matter of social prudence or inherited habit, to her it was always the newly-discovered question of her own relation to life—as most women see the great issues only through their own wants and prejudices, so she seemed always to see her personal desires in the light of the larger claims.",

    "target_paragraph": "Young clericals changed into uniform and marched side by side with the roughest Poilus, to share in their hardships, their hopes, their terrors, their deeds of supremest valour. Old men bowed their heads and gave of the strength which no longer animated their bodies, gave of that strength through the bodies of their sons who would charge into battle shouting and singing. Women of all ages knelt down and prayed, since prayer has long been the refuge of women. ‘No one is useless who can pray, my sister.’ The women of France had spoken through the lips of the humble Mademoiselle Duphot.\nStephen and Puddle said good-bye to the sisters, then went on to Buisson’s Academy of Fencing, where they found him engaged upon greasing his foils.\nHe looked up, Ah, it’s you. I must go on greasing. God knows when I shall use these again, tomorrow I join my regiment.’ But he wiped his hands on a stained overall and sat down, after clearing a chair for Puddle. ‘An ungentlemanly war it will be,’ he grumbled. Will I lead my men with a sword? Ah, but no! I will lead my men with a dirty revolver in my hand. Parbleu! Such is modern warfare! A machine could do the whole cursed thing better—we shall all be nothing but machines in this war. However, I pray that we may kill many Germans.’\nStephen lit a cigarette while the master glared, he was evidently in a very vile temper: ‘Go on, go on, smoke your heart to the devil, then come here and ask me to teach you fencing! You smoke in lighting one from the other, you remind me of your horrible Birmingham chimneys—but of course a woman exaggerates always,’ he concluded, with an evident wish to annoy her.\nThen he made a few really enlightening remarks about Germans in general, their appearance, their morals, above all their personal habits—which remarks were more seemly in French than they would be in English. For, like Valérie Seymour, this man was filled with a loathing for the ugliness of his epoch, an ugliness to which he felt the Germans were just now doing their best to contribute. Buisson’s heart was not buried in Mitylene, but rather in the glories of a bygone Paris, where a gentleman lived by the skill of his rapier and the graceful courage that lay behind it.\n‘In the old days we killed very beautifully,’ sighed Buisson, ‘now we merely slaughter or else do not kill at all, no matter how gross the insult.’\nHowever, when they got up to go, he relented: ‘War is surely a very necessary evil, it thins down the imbecile populations who have murdered their most efficacious microbes. People will not die, very well, here comes war to mow them down in their tens of thousands. At least for those of us who survive, there will be more breathing-space, thanks to the Germans—perhaps they too are a necessary evil.’\nArrived at the door Stephen turned to look back. Buisson was once more greasing his foils, and his fingers moved slowly yet with great precision—he might almost have been a beauty doctor engaged upon massaging ladies’ faces.\nPreparations for departure did not take very long, and in less than a week’s time Stephen and Puddle had shaken hands with their Breton servants and were driving at top speed en route for Havre, from whence they would cross to England.",

It was never meant to be a capital city, its sole advantage being that the Japanese couldn’t reach it. I see it as grey, shapeless, muddy, a collection of drab cement buildings and poverty shacks, the best feature a lively market. The Japanese bombed when they wished though not while we were there. The citizens fled to caves as air raid shelters; 396 had lately been killed by suffocation and stampeding feet when a bomb closed the mouth of such a cave. Crowds of thin cotton-clad expressionless people swarmed in the streets. Lepers abounded. They were beggars and forgivably spiteful; you hurried to find money in your purse; if not quick enough, they touched your shrinking skin.",

She was attending an interregional convention of a religious society called Movimento Rinascita Cristiana (Christian Rebirth Movement). The price of the sojourn was very reasonable owing to the fact that the hotel’s owner was also a member of the association. As was often the case, however, the schedule seemed to be a little vague, initially departing at 1:00 p.m., then changing to 11:00 a.m., and not knowing if, when or where the bus would stop for lunch. Part of this indecisiveness undoubtedly had to do with the perpetual state of construction on the infamous A3 highway, making the 100-kilometer (62-mile) journey to Vibo Valentia a two-hour affair at best.",

I used up the entire roll of film and both flash cubes taking pictures of our Christmas dinner; of family members pulling faces, the decorated tree, and my mother’s blazing pudding. It was months before I got the pictures developed, at the expense of a week’s pocket money. They were terrible photographs: my family looked red-eyed and demented, and our Christmas tree was a watery green blob. I couldn’t see the point of them. I’m not sure what I had expected, but it wasn’t that. There was no thrill in returning to the past via those photographs. I never used that camera again.",

He eventually makes contact with an underground group headed by O’Brien, and swears to die in his struggle against the Party’s oppression. But O’Brien turns out to be a double agent working for the Party to rout out dissenters, and Smith ends up in prison at the so-called Ministry of Love, where he is brutally interrogated: \t\t\t \t\t\t\tThey slapped his face, wrung his ears, pulled his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to urinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water; but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning. Their real weapon was the merciless questioning that went on and on, hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for him, twisting everything that he said, convicting him at every step of lies and self-contradiction, until he began weeping as much from shame as from nervous fatigue.",

In every direction swarmed dirty, inquisitive, laughing children, and vigorously-elbowing, barefooted passengers eager to embark for the onward flight to Bhairawa before our cargo had even begun to be unloaded. We were at once surrounded by predatory, dictatorial porters – mainly women, wearing tattered, vivid clothes and heavy, noisy jewels – and by a vast number of interested locals, few of whom have ever flown anywhere or will ever fly anywhere and most of whom have nothing whatever to do with passengers or cargoes. Having disentangled myself from this throng I was at once pursued by a young policeman in creased khaki, armed with a cumbersome ledger in which all arriving foreigners are requested to write down ‘particulars’. For political reasons the country north of Pokhara has recently been made a Restricted Area and one gets the impression that the Government, which only opened its frontiers to foreigners in 1951, would be quite pleased to have an excuse to re-impose restrictions on all tourist travel outside the Kathmandu and Pokhara valleys.",

I figure we can get the load down to five pounds. And”—he waggled his hand delightedly in the empty newspaper bag—”we put it all in here.” His expression begged me to drape him with plaudits.",

Far from the major tourist hubs, the trails in the Middle Fork are quiet, the sounds of breath and footsteps amplified. Day-hiking potential is limited. The first stretch of each drainage is heavily forested, with few big vistas until you reach the high passes or small lakes 12 to 18 miles in. The average hiker usually goes elsewhere, where the bears are easier to spot and views give more bang for the buck. If Sperry and Granite are the pretty extroverts twirling in the middle of the action, the Middle Fork is the wallflower, subtle but lovely upon close inspection. If you put in the miles, suck it up through bad bugs, boggy tread, and overgrowth, the Middle Fork will offer up the secret heart of the park, a pulse beneath your feet. The tourists who throng the road corridor don’t plow through brush, or dip their toes into glacial runoff. The river keeps out the riffraff.",

The oppression of the plateau was suddenly remitted. It was only now I knew what a penalty had been levied on the spirit by the bare wind-swept deserts, the threatening mountains and the tumbledown villages. The relief was actually physical. Our bodies seemed to undergo a change of gravity, a return to normal buoyancy.",

He came, in a gaseous coil, to the roaring explosion of great engines. He descended, a tall, elegant figure, dyspeptic, lean almost to emaciation, very foppishly laundered and tailored. He looked the car over slowly, critically, a long cigar clamped in the corner of his saturnine mouth, drawing his gauntlets off deliberately. Then, in the same unhurried fashion, he removed from his head the tengallon grey sombrero – the only astonishing feature of his otherwise undebatable costume – and shook each long thin leg delicately for a moment to straighten out the wrinkles. But there were none. Then, deliberately, he came up the walk to Dixieland, where the Gants were assembled. As he came, unhurried, he took the cigar from his mouth calmly and held it in the fingers of his lean, hairy, violently palsied hand. His thin black hair, fine spun, was fanned lightly from its elegance by a wantoning breeze. He espied his betrothed and grinned, with dignity, sardonically, with big nuggets of gold teeth. They greeted and kissed.",

Here the four-storey buildings are taller than the Old City norm, the trendy shop façades and interiors contrast pointedly with the souk’s caverns, the narrow laneways and symmetrical cut-stone stairways are garbage-free, hanging flower-baskets replace sagging overhead cables and the residents are homogenous. When the Company for the Development and Reconstruction of the Jewish Quarter expelled the Muslims and Christians after the Six-Day War they were forbidden to return: this ‘Jews-only’ development is an early example of Israeli-style apartheid. Originally it was intended to house an Ashkenazi elite but they soon moved out, not relishing the lack of parking space and the nearness of all those muezzins calling five times a day starting at 4.30 a.m. Their replacements represent a new breed, outwardly conventional ultra-Orthodox but including some alarming recent immigrants – fundamentalist Jews, their accents American, their mission to advance West Bank settlements. Such people have been gaining influence in Jerusalem’s municipal council and also in the Knesset; Israel’s parliamentary system leaves the main parties much too dependent on destabilising splinter groups. Significantly, I never saw tourists being led through the residential streets; they would be unwelcome beyond the areas excavated and rebuilt to attract them.",

A moment longer he stood so, his head bent a little and the gun in his numb hands; then he leaned it again in the corner and lifted the wooden bar from its slots carefully and without noise.
