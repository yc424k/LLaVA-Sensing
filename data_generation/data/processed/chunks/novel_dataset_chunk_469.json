    "target_paragraph": "Wyant leaned back and laughed. His laugh was a contagious chuckle, easily provoked and spreading in circles like a full spring. Jim gave a large shout at his own mimicry, and Heuston joined the chorus on a dry note that neither spread nor echoed, but seemed suddenly to set bounds to their mirth. Nona felt a momentary resentment of his tone. Was he implying that they were ridiculing their mother? They weren’t, they were only admiring her in their own way, which had always been humorous and half-parental. Stan ought to have understood by this time—and have guessed why Nona, at this moment, caught at any pretext to make Jim laugh, to make everything in their joint lives appear to him normal and jolly. But Stanley always seemed to see beyond a joke, even when he was in the very middle of it. He was like that about everything in life; forever walking around things, weighing and measuring them, and making his disenchanted calculations. Poor fellow—well, no wonder!",

Superior Russian salami, sweet sheep’s cheese, potato and egg salad, stale bread, home-made plum jam and a shapely china pot of Russian tea were swiftly spread before me on a white cotton tablecloth edged with heavy lace. As I ate, Lisa fed the baby and Agnes made up my bed near the gigantic stove – twice the usual size and semicircular. Then Gabor – whose English was fluent – proudly showed me a massive leather-bound album of coloured photographs of family holidays, during the 1980s, in France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain. For dessert a two-kilo box of Russian chocolates – wearing a huge nylon bow – was ceremoniously offered. And then there was a choice of finest Russian vodka, genuine Scotch whisky or double-distilled cherry tuica – the best tuica I have ever drunk.",

    "target_paragraph": "The heat grew intense.\nThe air was more and more oppressive as the day went on.\nClara fainted suddenly just after dinner, and Fräulein, holding a little discourse on clothing and an enquiry into wardrobes, gave a general permission for the reduction of garments to the minimum and sent everyone to rest uncorseted until tea-time, promising a walk to the woods in the cool of the evening. There was a sense of adventure in the house. It was as if it were being besieged. It gave Miriam confidence to approach Fräulein for permission to rearrange her trunk in the basement. She let Fräulein understand that her removal was not complete, that there were things to do before she could be properly settled in her new room.\n“Certainly, Miss Henderson, you are quite free,” said Fräulein instantly as the girls trooped upstairs.\nMiriam knew she wanted to avoid an afternoon shut up with Emma and Ulrica and she did not in the least want to lie down. It seemed to her a very extraordinary thing to do. It surprised and disturbed her. It suggested illness and weakness. She could not remember having lain down in the day-time. There had been that fortnight in the old room at home with Harriett ... chicken-pox and new books coming and games, and Sarah reading the Song of Hiawatha and their being allowed to choose their pudding. She could not remember feeling ill. Had she ever felt ill?... Colds and bilious attacks....\nShe remembered with triumph a group of days of pain two years ago. She had forgotten.... Bewilderment and pain ... her mother’s constant presence ... everything, the light everywhere, the leaves standing out along the tops of hedgerows as she drove with her mother, telling her of pain and she alone in the midst of it ... for always ... pride, long moments of deep pride.... Eve and Sarah congratulating her, Eve stupid and laughing ... the new bearing of the servants ... Lilla Belton’s horrible talks fading away to nothing.\nFräulein had left her and gone to her room. Every door and window on the ground floor stood wide excepting that leading to Fräulein’s little double rooms. She wondered what the rooms were like and felt sorry for Fräulein, tall and gaunt, moving about in them alone, alone with her own dark eyes, curtains hanging motionless at the windows ... was it really bad to tight-lace? The English girls, except Millie and Solomon all had small waists. She wished she knew. She placed her large hands round her waist. Drawing in her breath she could almost make them meet. It was easier to play tennis with stays ... how dusty the garden looked, baked. She wanted to go out with two heavy watering-cans, to feel them pulling her arms from their sockets, dragging her shoulders down, throwing out her chest, to spray canful after canful through a great wide rose, sprinkling her ankles sometimes, and to grow so warm that she would not feel the heat. Bella Lyndon had never worn stays; playing rounders so splendidly, lying on the grass between the games with her arms under her head ... simply disgusting, someone had said ... who ... a disgusted face ... nearly all the girls detested Bella.\nGoing through the hall on her way down to the basement she heard the English voices sounding quietly out into the afternoon from the rooms above. Flat and tranquil they sounded, Bertha and Jimmie she heard, Gertrude’s undertones, quiet words from Millie. She felt she would like a corner in the English room for the afternoon, a book and an occasional remark—“Mr. Barnes of New York”—she would not be able to read her three yellow-backs in the German bedroom. She felt at the moment glad to be robbed of them. It would be much better, of course. There was no sound from the German rooms. She pictured sleeping faces. It was cooler in the basement—but even there the air seemed stiff and dusty with the heat.\nWhy did the hanging garments remind her of All Saints’ Church and Mr. Brough? ... she must tell Harriett that in her letter ... that day they suddenly decided to help in the church decorations ... she remembered the smell of the soot on the holly as they had cut and hacked at it in the cold garden, and Harriett overturning the heavy wheelbarrow on the way to church, and how they had not laughed because they both felt solemn, and then there had just been the three Anwyl girls and Mrs. Anwyl and Mrs. Scarr and Mr. Brough in the church-room all being silly about Birdy Anwyl roasting chestnuts, and how silly and affected they were when a piece of holly stuck in her skirt.",

We would go in pairs, so that one could stand guard while the other washed quickly. I had never done anything like this before, standing stark naked with a bit of shampoo in my hair, and looking at the miles of wide-open expanse of desert unfolding before me?it was glorious and surreal.

Juana insisted on several rest stops – the gradient was brutal – and this suited me as I was beginning to feel the effects of an unwontedly large meal at the fatal hour of noon.

XtraTuf is a brand, Tufs their affectionate nickname, and good luck wearing any other boot in Alaska and holding your head up. (The boot is so universally associated with the state that Miss Alaska’s regional costume for a recent national pageant included a specially commissioned pair of brown rubber XtraTuf pumps.) Tufs are first choice for fishermen and cannery workers, for biologists and dip-netters, for day hikes and yes, for trailwork. They’re so ubiquitous in coastal towns that the foyer of a house with a potluck going on is piled with Tufs, and people Magic Marker their names on the vanilla-colored stripe around the top in order to ensure they’ll go home in the right pair. With a tight-fitted calf and tapered toe, these beauties provide far more stability than the rubber boot from childhood puddle walks, with handles at the top and a fit like a bucket. You’d rather not lose them.",

He looked at his watch and saw that it was almost 20 seconds. The swells were long and smooth, and Lone Eagle just glided over them. One minute you were down in the trough with water above and all around you, and then a few seconds later, you were on the top of the swell and you could see for miles.

Now I am not even permitted in the room when Coronation Street is on because I have lost touch with the manifold plot lines and spend the whole time saying, “Where’s Ernie Bishop? So who’s that then? I thought Deirdre was with Ray Langton. Where’s Len? Stan Ogden is dead?” and after a minute I find myself shooed away. But, as I discovered now, you can go years without watching Coronation Street and still enjoy walking along the open-air set because it’s so obviously the street from the TV series. It’s the real set, by the way—Granada closes the park on most Mondays to film on it—and it feels like a real street. The houses are solid and made of real bricks; though, like everyone else, I was disappointed to peer into the windows and find through gaps in the curtains that they were empty shells with nothing but electrical cables and carpenters’ sawhorses inside. (The interior scenes are all shot in the studio building behind.) I was a bit confused to encounter a pair of modern houses at one end of the street, and the newsagent’s, to my clear distress, was much smarter and better ordered than it used to be, but I still felt uncannily on familiar and hallowed turf. Throngs of people walked up and down the street in a kind of reverential hush, identifying front doors and peering through lace curtains. I latched onto a friendly little lady with blue-rinsed hair under a transparent rain hat she seemed to have made from a bread wrapper, and she not only informed me who lived in which houses now, but who had lived in which houses way back when, so that I was pretty well brought up to speed. Pretty soon I found myself surrounded by a whole flock of little blue-haired ladies answering my shocked questions (“Deirdre with a toy boy? Never!”) and assuring me with solemn nods that it was so. It is a profoundly thrilling experience to walk up and down this famous street, and it comes as something of a shock to round the corner at the far end and find yourself abruptly—I might almost say mercilessly—on a nineteenth-century London street, the set for Sherlock Holmes, and realize that it is all just an elaborate fantasy.",

I came to a thick clump of bushes and bent the branches down to clear my way, disturbing a hornet’s nest. They swarmed upon me in frenzied attack. I was stung on my face countless times. I was stuck in the bushes and couldn’t get away quickly. I could feel my lips puffing up and my eyes swelling shut. After a while I managed to blunder my way out in hysteria and ran, almost blinded, into more branches, stumbling, falling. I went down to the river, drank, and bathed my face. This wasn’t my day. First my lousy ass and now my face. I went on my way, bitter and angry.",

And more than home—bull’s eye, heart’s needle, center of my private universe. The apricot-rose façade, shuttered windows open to the southern sun, profuse geraniums, clematis, lemons, and lavender burgeoning in the garden—all this exotic beauty symbolizes a risk I took to change the life I was given into a life I made with my own two hands. Those first years remain vivid. I filled my blue notebook with ideas, sketches of gardens, words I liked, images. A bird flew in one window in my study and out the other. Leaning out my window into the bright air, I could see the garden below, even know each rose by name. I listened to the musical notes of water cascading into the ancient cistern, saw lilacs, dahlias, lilies, and secret reading spots among the olive trees. The beauty of the landscape saturated my days. It seemed dreamy. Almost surreal. And it still does. Is this much happiness allowed?",

He declared that it was a shame for so young and blithe a spirit to be tied to a middle-aged man; he said that he himself represented youth, strength and gallantry, and was a much more fitting mate for her. He added that as the evening advanced he found that he desired her more and more. Charlie Chee, with the glass tube in his mouth, nodded intelligently at each of these statements. I had a happy thought. Why not send for Adolfo and his wife and invite them to join our festivities? The Chinamen asleep on the floor were kicked awake and their opinion asked.

The lobby – cool and dark and lonely – was filled with empty armchairs and tables. The desk clerk greeted us warmly, and a waiter brought two glasses of karkadé that we gobbled without shame. Though we hoped for a room on a high floor of the tower – with a grand view of the Nile - we lowly soldiers were assigned to the barracks. Even then, our room was large, modern, and perfectly comfortable. The walls were decorated with modern African art. We admired one print in particular: a group of men, tall and thin with deep brown skin, play traditional Nubian instruments, surrounded by geometric shapes in gentle earth tones. I wondered whether we could fit the print in my backpack, but it was fastened to the wall with security screws. Later, we would meander the grounds and eat a quiet dinner in the hotel restaurant, but that afternoon, we just slept away the heat of the day.",

    "target_paragraph": "The Mass itself was in a large, modern structure that looked more like the setting for an American evangelical worship service than for the followers of a monk who lived as a hermit over half a millennium ago. Completed in the year 2000, the bright, expansive church was decorated with contemporary mosaics and stained glass windows; its interior space featured arched ceiling rafters that resembled a sailing ship, appropriate for the patron saint of sailors and fisherman. While Luisa was taking communion, I took the opportunity to read a bit more about this St. Francis on the church’s large display. The story of his encounter with a boatman who refused him passage because he didn’t have any money, having given it all away, explained the many images I had seen all over Calabria. The simple monk needed to get across the Strait of Messina so he constructed a makeshift raft and with his coat as a sail, navigated across the channel. (I imagine that this particular St. Francis must also be quite celebrated amongst windsurfers.)",

At weekends the area hosted a sprawling fruit and vegetable market, but on a Thursday evening there were only yards of empty concrete and seagulls bickering amid crisp brown leaves. At one end of the square about fifty people were gathered in front of a cheap sushi restaurant, facing a small white van with a loudspeaker bolted to its roof. In front of the vehicle, two cheerful Dutchmen in anoraks held a long blue-and-white banner hand-painted with the legend ‘010 = 1’, a reference to Rotterdam’s area code and to the unity they hoped to promote. Compared to the earlier protest in The Hague, this had drawn a more gentle and diverse crowd – there were not only young Muslim men, but also young women in tight jeans and colourful headscarves, middle-aged white couples and Orthodox Jews. A man in a bright orange fleece jacket and matching orange skullcap greeted me warmly as I arrived. ‘Hallo, hallo! Welkom!’ he said, holding a mobile phone aloft to take a photo of the crowd.",

The colonists decided someone should return to England with the ships that had brought them, to secure more aid. The obvious choice was John White. He was influential, knew where to direct a supply ship, and would be unlikely to abandon the colonists, since his family remained among them.",

Then he remembered that, as he had left the house that morning, she had called over the stairs that she would meet him at her grandmother's so that they might drive home together. He had called back a cheery \"Yes!\" and then, absorbed in other visions, had forgotten his promise. Now he was smitten with compunction, yet irritated that so trifling an omission should be stored up against him after nearly two years of marriage. He was weary of living in a perpetual tepid honeymoon, without the temperature of passion yet with all its exactions.

On our way to the airport, we passed the Cairo Tower, and we remembered that afternoon when its speakers erupted overhead, while we sat, stuck in traffic, in its shadow. We passed the Novotel, and we recalled the wedding party under our window our first night there; I liked the twirling dancers, Teresa liked the fireworks. We crossed the Nile, for the last time, and we recounted our walks along the Corniche, in Cairo, in Luxor, and Aswan. We passed the Ramses Hilton and we remembered the chaos outside our window those first few days; we thought we’d never survive the city. I pointed toward the Egyptian Museum; Teresa wished that we had gone back. “Next time,” I said, “save something for next time.” We passed Ramses Station and the Harmony Jet office, where we had boarded the bus to Luxor one day. I wondered if Hamady were there already, a cigarette stuck to his lip, a stack of bus tickets in hand. Suddenly we were on a highway, the city safely tucked below us. Abdel accelerated quickly. Teresa wondered if we were going the right way. “Where is all the traffic?” she asked. There was none.",

He thanked me and placed his hand for a moment on mine; then, shaking his head sadly, he walked up the stairs bearing his great armful of flowers from Klepini. I had a glass of wine with Clito – who served me with tears in his eyes, but unspeaking; and then walked back to the seashore where I had left the car in the rich cool darkness of that perfect spring weather. All the sights and sounds of Kyrenia came to me with a new and poignant brilliance, as if experienced for the first time. The balconies spanning the conversational streets with their pattern of humble intimacies, now silent as the vines which climbed everywhere; fishermen mending nets by elf-light; a man hooping a barrel; a grey-headed man stringing a mandolin; a Turk in a wine-red fez; two boys playing hop­scotch; children sleeping like sculptures below the bastion of the castle; a man blowing upon a tray of embers which was covered with sweetcorn; a little boy padding about with a thur­ible from which a wisp of laurel-smoke ascended – in Clito’s the drinkers took a pinch of smoke with finger and thumb and made the sign of the cross with it; a coffee house sweet with the sound of cage-birds, where the nargilehs were piled in a rack like muskets in a magazine – you brought your own ebony mouthpiece before choosing your favourite one to smoke.",

The conclusion of Owen's romance brought his own plans once more to the front. Anna had promised that she would consider dates and settle details as soon as Madame de Chantelle and her grandson had been reconciled, and Darrow was eager to go into the question at once, since it was necessary that the preparations for his marriage should go forward as rapidly as possible. Anna, he knew, would not seek any farther pretext for delay; and he strolled up and down contentedly in the sunshine, certain that she would come out and reassure him as soon as the reunited family had claimed its due share of her attention.",

The squalor of the tukul was extreme and the old people were grief-stricken because yesterday their only cow – due to calve soon – and their only ox died of some disease which has dysentery as its chief symptom. The magnitude of this disaster is hard for us to grasp. These animals were their most valuable possessions – worth at least two hundred dollars – and they have no hope of replacing them. The women wept as they told us, the men sat gazing dully at the floor. Now they are without an ox to pull the plough and the neighbours are too poor to lend them one.

A frightful old woman, looking like a relic of the old heathen days, with bristling grey hair cut short, her body tattooed all over, and no clothing but a ragged blanket huddled round her shoulders; a girl about twelve, with torrents of shining hair, and a piece of bright green calico thrown round her, and two very good-looking young women in rose-coloured chemises, one of them holding a baby, were squatting and lying on the mats, one over another, like a heap of savages.",

    "target_paragraph": "In the West, postmodern architects awoke from half a century of relentless modernism and rediscovered the traditions of the arch, the dome and the column, and they succeeded in incorporating these into a new modern idiom. Thailand, because of its thriving tourist industry, has seen imaginative experimentation with traditional-style roofs in modern architecture. Hotels such as the Amanpuri in Phuket or the Sukhothai in Bangkok are particularly successful examples. In Japan, however, the elite architects concentrate on building square office towers; sometimes, the more daring of them will incorporate arches and columns in the Western postmodernist manner.",

It had seven windows and two doors; all the windows were propped open with blue castor-oil bottles.\nI was surprised to find that the old man who had trudged behind our wagon was Chief Douse—Aleck’s father.\nMrs. Douse was more important than Mr. Douse; she was a chieftainess in her own right, and had great dignity. Neither of them spoke to me that night. Aleck showed me where to put my bed on the verandah and I hung the fly over it. I ate a dry scrap of food and turned into my blankets. I had no netting, and the mosquitoes tormented me.\nMy heart said into the thick dark, “Why did I come?”\nAnd the dark answered, “You know.”",

He often burrowed so deeply into his dementia that there was no reasoning with him. His naked wanderings repulsed Joseíto’s wife and scared his daughters. Something had to be done to restrain the old man and, Lili thought, keep him safe. Not knowing what else to do, she asked Joseíto to wall off a corner of his workshop, creating a three-by-six-foot closet with a small window that opened onto an alleyway. There was just enough room inside the closet for a narrow cot but nothing else. Lili took her father’s hand and led him into the space and then locked him in there to keep him from wandering and to allow her family to finally get some rest. She brought him meals and washed his clothes when he soiled them.",
