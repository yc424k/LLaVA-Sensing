They are astonishing – long banks of calcified molluscs which have been elevated, Darwin correctly deduces, by gradual crustal movement to their present resting-place several metres above the level of the sea. Having seen the shells – and having watched a gang of locals with pick and shovel plunder barrowloads of them for lime-burning – Darwin turns his horse inland, and canters up through the wide and fertile valley of Quillota (‘whoever called Valparaíso Valley of Paradise must have been thinking of Quillota’, he would observe later to his journal). The valley is densely packed with olive groves, and with stands of orange, peach and fig trees which have been manicured into tiny square orchards by the valley’s inhabitants. On its higher slopes prolific fields of wheat flash in the sunlight, and above them rises the Bell of Quillota, a 1,900-metre peak from which there are reputed to be magnificent views. It is this mountain which Darwin has come to climb.",

Paul Redfern, the son of the dean of Benedict’s College, a school for black students in Columbia, South Carolina, announced a plan to fly 4,600 miles from Brunswick, Georgia, to Rio de Janeiro in a Stinson Detroiter airplane. Redfern was an unlikely hero. He had been crazy about planes all his life?so much so that he often wore an aviator’s goggled helmet even when on the ground and just going about his daily business?but his academic training was as a musician. His experience as a pilot consisted of a couple of years of barnstorming at county fairs and working as a spotter of illegal stills for the government. The same age as Lindbergh, he was small and slight (he weighed just 108 pounds) and had a nervous-looking face, but then he had a lot to be nervous about. He was proposing to fly 4,600 miles?farther than anyone had ever flown before?over ocean and jungle, into a realm far beyond the range of reliable maps and weather reports.",

It’s a charming building, “charming” being a word that regularly pops into mind for structures in which Telford had a hand. Much like the mission churches that were established in far flung parts of Scotland, these “Telford” churches were also created by an Act of Parliament and constructed in thirty-two locations throughout the Highlands. Only 30% survive, with the Ullapool one being the best example. Ullapool’s is large enough for 492 worshippers and has an upstairs gallery as well. All this space is jam packed with oddments, including volunteers engaged in genealogical research. One of them takes me upstairs where a video enlightens a small group of us. We are then free to wander. I wander back downstairs to some of the zillion folders which describe life in Ullapool, including the factory processing ships from the Eastern bloc that fished for mackerel and frequented Ullapool from the 1970’s to 1990’s. I discover that Ullapool was founded in 1788 by the British Fisheries Society and did not exist before that time. Thus, streets are laid out very tidily. I consider my £4 very well spent and head off to the Arch Inn for a beer. Then back up that horrendous hill, which is at least walkable with all the panniers off the bike, and to bed.",

At some unmarked point I crossed the disputed border between Lewis and Harris, marked on a 1630 map of the Western Isles as ‘a boundary between the two countries’. Around mid-morning a sharp sun burnt through the clouds and set cloud-shadows scooting across the moor: Rionnach maoim – another Hebridean Gaelic term of exquisite exactitude, meaning ‘the shadows cast on the moorland by cumulus clouds moving across the sky on a bright and windy day’.

Starwick reeled blindly against it as he went past, the thing rocked sickeningly, and even as it tottered slowly over, Eugene heard Madame Gely’s gasp of terror, heard her low ‘Mon Dieu! Ça tombe, ça tombe!’ and a loud united ‘Ah-h-h!’ of thankfulness as he caught it in his hands, and gently, safely, with such inner triumph as a man may feel who leaps through space and lands safely hanging to a flying trapeze, restored it to its former position. As he looked up he saw old Gely and his wife peering from their quarters with fat perturbed faces, and the little concierge and his wife still clutched together peering through their curtains in a covert of bright frightened eyes.",

On leaving Maimena we turned due north up a valley such as one finds among the Wiltshire uplands, where the villages are lined in close succession along a small nameless river meandering through orchards and fields: orchards in this case of mulberries and apricots; fields of pale-blue flax flowers. After Faizabad, the chief of the villages, the hills grew lower, the ground barren, and the air warmer; we began to skid in sand. A flat horizon opened out, a sinister hot breeze struck us, and the sky grew the colour of lead. We had reached the Oxus plain, and felt the presence of the river fifty miles away as one feels the presence of the sea before seeing it. At length we sighted a flat-topped mound, on top of which, at the head of a steep stairway guarded by yellow plaster lions, stood a hideous brick bungalow. Here we found the Governor of Maimena, a giant of a man with spectacles, a small black beard and a feminine voice, to whom we presented a letter from Shir Ahmad.",

The snow had shrunk to a few discoloured patches and the ice on the Danube had broken up. When this is solid, the thaw sunders the ice with reports like a succession of thunderclaps. I had been out of earshot downstream when the giant slabs had broken loose, but all at once the water, halted by occasional jams, was crowded with racing fragments. It was no good trying to keep pace: jostling triangles and polygons rushed past, cloudier at the edges each day and colliding with a softer impact until they were as flimsy as wafers; and at last, one morning, they were gone. These were mild portents, it seemed. When the sun reaches full strength, the eternal snows, the glaciers of the Alps and the banked peaks of the Carpathians look unchanged from a distance; but close to, the whole icy heart of Europe might be dissolving. Thousands of rivulets pour downhill, all brooks overflow and the river itself breaks loose and floods the meadows, drowns cattle and flocks, uproots the ricks and the trees and whirls them along until all but the tallest and stoutest bridges are either choked with flotsam or carried away.",

The very light and air in the space outside the cell had a soaring buoyancy and freshness which, by comparison, gave to that within the cell a material and oppressive heaviness, a sense of walled and mortared space that had pressed upon his heart and spirit with a crushing weight. Now, suddenly, as if a cord that bound him had been cut, or a brutal hand that held his life in its compelling grip had been removed, the sensations of release and escape filled his body with a sense of aerial buoyancy and the power of wing-like flight.",

He was from the desert north, and he said, ‘I’ll never get used to the cold, not if I live here till I’m a hundred and one’. It didn’t take us long to get onto the subject of the Falklands War and Chilean assistance to the British RAF. ‘We painted the crown off a plane at our base, and we gave your men our flying jackets. It was very funny seeing them with our name tags. You know, “Gonzalo” is thought of as a small, swarthy bloke. When I saw a tall, blond Englishman in a jacket labelled “Gonzalo” I really laughed a lot.’ The troops often spoke like this. The officers did not. I wheedled a fighter pilot round to the subject once, and he said, ‘I saw many things. I do not speak them.’",

She remembered it all, and how sure she had been then that she was meant to live on a farm and keep chickens; just as sure as he was that he was meant to be a painter, and would already have made a name if his parents hadn’t called him back to Baltimore and shoved him into a broker’s office after Harvard—to have him off their minds, as he said.",

Every now and then Mark and Mary looked at them from the nursery window.\nThat night she dreamed that she saw Aunt Charlotte standing at the foot of the kitchen stairs taking off her clothes and wrapping them in white paper; first, her black lace shawl; then her chemise. She stood up without anything on. Her body was polished and shining like an enormous white china doll. She lowered her head and pointed at you with her eyes.\nWhen you opened the stair cupboard door to catch the opossum, you found a white china doll lying in it, no bigger than your finger. That was Aunt Charlotte.\nIn the dream there was no break between the end and the beginning. But when she remembered it afterwards it split into two pieces with a dark gap between. She knew she had only dreamed about the cupboard; but Aunt Charlotte at the foot of the stairs was so clear and solid that she thought she had really seen her.\nMamma had told Aunt Bella all about it when they talked together that day, in the drawing-room. She knew because she could still see them sitting, bent forward with their heads touching, Aunt Bella in the big arm-chair by the hearth-rug, and Mamma on the parrot chair.",
