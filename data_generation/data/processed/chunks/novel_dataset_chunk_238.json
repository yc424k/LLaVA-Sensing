It flew the Yugoslav colours and the name Beograd was painted along the sooty bows in Cyrillic and Latin characters. The long-drawn-out wail of the siren gave way to the coughing staccato of the engine. The funnel puffed out a non-stop sequence of smoke balloons that lingered on the still air as the procession grew smaller in the distance, in a slowly-dissolving dotted line. The barges toiled against the current, sunk to their gunwales under a tarpaulined cargo. But in a day or two – I thought with sudden envy – they would be stealing into the Wachau and waking the two-noted echo of Dürrenstein.",

    "target_paragraph": "They bade farewell to the peasant family, and again returned a few days later—this time not disguised. They first negotiated with the parents, who had already given one of their sons as an Incarnation to the Church, and then the little boy was awakened from his sleep and the four delegates withdrew with him to the altar-room. Here the child was subjected to the prescribed examination. He was first shown four different rosaries, one of which—the most worn—had belonged to the thirteenth Dalai Lama. The boy, who was quite unconstrained and not the least bit shy, chose the right one without hesitation and danced round the room with it. He also selected out of several drums one which the last Incarnation had used to call his servants. Then he took an old walking-stick, which had also belonged to him, not deigning to bestow a glance on one which had a handle of ivory and silver. When they examined his body they found all the marks which an Incarnation of Chenrezi ought to bear: large, outstanding ears, and moles on the trunk which are supposed to be traces of the four-armed god’s second pair of arms.",

There was colour everywhere – trees the colour of mustard and rust, meadows of gold and green, colossal white barns, blue lakes. Here and there along the roadside, produce stands brimmed with pumpkins and squash and other autumn fruits. It was like a day trip to heaven. I wandered around on back roads. There was a surprising lot of small houses, some little better than shacks. I supposed there couldn’t be much work in a place like Vermont. The state has hardly any towns or industry. The biggest city, Burlington, has a population of just 37,000. Outside Groton I stopped at a roadside café for coffee and listened along with the other three customers to a fat young woman with a pair of ill-kempt children moaning in a loud voice about her financial problems to the woman behind the counter. ‘I still only get four dollars an hour,’ she was saying. ‘Harvey, he’s been at Fibberts for three years and he’s only just got his first raise. You know what he gets now? Four dollars and sixty-five cents an hour. Isn’t that pathetic? I told him, I said, “Harvey, they’re just walkin’ all over you.” But he won’t do nothin’ about it.’ She broke off here to rearrange the features on one of her children’s faces with the back of her hand. ‘HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU NOT TO INNARUP ME WHEN I’M TALKING?’ she enquired rhetorically of the little fellow, and then in a calmer voice turned back to the café lady and launched into a candid list of Harvey’s other shortcomings, which were manifold.",

The driver’s full dog team was a godsend, for by now, of Bartlett’s own, only Colt could do any real work. Bartlett had to laugh: after busting out of two igloos and running away twice, Colt had turned out to be a fine dog. Bartlett shook hands with Olsen, thanking him profusely, and they moved out. At first the hired driver rode while Bartlett and Kataktovik trotted behind, but they traded out every few miles to give each man a rest. They passed Pitlekaj, the place, Bartlett noted, where Nordenskiöld’s ship Vega had been frozen in the ice in 1878. The Vega, the first ship to navigate through the entire Northeast Passage—the sea route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans via the Arctic Ocean—had remained frozen in for nearly a year, but by luck (or fate, to Bartlett’s way of thinking), she’d not been crushed.",

    "target_paragraph": "Although the instruments in a symphony are all tuned to the same note, the tonal characteristics of each combine to produce the lush sound Westerners love to hear — although both may be playing middle C, a cello is warmer than, say, a clarinet. In a gamelan, each of the paired instruments, such as the gangsas, is tuned differently from its partner. Even in single instruments with more than one octave range, the octave notes may be deliberately tuned slightly higher than the matching lower tone. All Balinese will tell you that when the pairs of instruments so tuned are played in unison the sound produced will be rich and appealing. This is caused by the fact that when two notes are struck that differ very slightly from each other in pitch, a third note, called the beat note, is produced that has a frequency that is the difference between the two notes sounded. The beat note adds a kind of throbbing sound to the other two notes, not unlike the vibrato a trained singer uses, or that produced by the player of a stringed instrument when he wiggles his left hand over the stops of the strings.",

We pass the apartment we rented five years ago, when I swore off Florence. In summer, wads of tourists clog the city as if it’s a Renaissance theme park. Everyone seems to be eating. That year, a garbage strike persisted for over a week and I began to have thoughts of plague when I passed heaps of rot spilling out of bins. I was amazed that long July when waiters and shopkeepers remained as nice as they did, given what they had to put up with. Everywhere I stepped I was in the way. Humanity seemed ugly—the international young in torn T-shirts and backpacks lounging on steps, bewildered bus tourists dropping ice cream napkins in the street and asking, “How much is that in dollars?” Germans in too-short shorts letting their children terrorize restaurants. The English mother and daughter ordering lasagne verdi and Coke, then complaining because the spinach pasta was green. My own reflection in the window, carrying home all my shoe purchases, the sundress not so flattering. Bad wonderland. Henry James in Florence referred to “one’s detested fellow-pilgrim.” Yes, indeed, and it’s definitely time to leave when one’s own reflection is included. Sad that our century has added no glory to Florence—only mobs and lead hanging in the air.",

The stilt-walkers waltzed around, occasionally shooting off fireworks from their hands. At one point, the Goth girl lit the four strands of the May pole and paced around with a little box that apparently had some representational purpose for the director, possibly the heavyset man who at times danced around and at other times focused on repositioning the tractor with the gear set in neutral. The lighting of a suspended string of fireworks signaled the grand finale and received the requisite smattering of applause—an auspicious heralding of the season and a favorable first encounter with the Calabrian artistic community.",

A thin breeze-block wall, plastered with cement, which had been turned into a firing range. Targets were scratched onto the plaster: concentric circles plugged by bullet-holes. Green glass bottles were lined up along the top of the wall. Most had had their tops shot off. I started humming ‘Ten Green Bottles’ to myself; the song would buzz like a fat fly, like a greenbottle, in my brain for the rest of the day.",

Even if the reservation could attract and sustain large-scale industry heavy or light, which it cannot, what have the Navajos to gain by becoming factory hands, lab technicians and office clerks? The Navajos are people, not personnel; nothing in their nature or tradition has prepared them to adapt to the regimentation of application forms and time clock. To force them into the machine would require a Procrustean mutilation of their basic humanity. Consciously or unconsciously the typical Navajo senses this unfortunate truth, resists the compulsory miseducation offered by the Bureau, hangs on to his malnourished horses and cannibalized automobiles, works when he feels like it and quits when he has enough money for a party or the down payment on a new pickup. He fulfills other obligations by getting his wife and kids installed securely on the public welfare rolls. Are we to condemn him for this? Caught in a no-man’s-land between two worlds the Navajo takes what advantage he can of the white man’s system – the radio, the pickup truck, the welfare – while clinging to the liberty and dignity of his old way of life. Such a man would rather lie drunk in the gutters of Gallup, New Mexico, a disgrace to his tribe and his race, than button on a clean white shirt and spend the best part of his life inside an air-conditioned office building with windows that cannot be opened.",

The salt water sores begin as small, infected boils that grow, burst open, and leave ulcers penetrating the skin. These continue to widen and deepen, as if a slow-burning acid were being dropped on the flesh. But so far my work at keeping dry has paid off. I have only a dozen or two open sores, about a quarter inch across, clustered on my hips and ankles. My cushion and sleeping bag, when dry, are encrusted with salt, which grinds into my wounds.",

There was only one platform and as I scanned it, a circle of heavily embroidered, dyed cotton began to close in on me. A tribal troop of Rabari women wearing necklaces and earrings akin to wedding jewellery had flocked to investigate and were now clamping tattooed hands across their mouths. Beautiful grid-like work, considered to contain magical symbolism, emblazoned their arms, necks and giggling faces. Where their braless breasts sagged low, their hard chests resembled chessboards. By tradition the Rabaris were camel herders, but had begun to move towards the big cities to seek employment as labourers. Meanwhile, Passepartout had been returned by a tiny man and his family, who had taken him to look at turtles in their garden. Train 34 arrived and I shuffled up the steps among the women, feeling terribly underdressed. By the time it departed they had got tired of me and gone back to gossiping, their earlobes swinging wildly, so I took out a notepad and tried to look busy.",

Humboldt originally intended to explore Africa, but the sight of a simple flower, the purple blossoms of bougainvillea, a plant native to the Americas, caused him to shift his sights to the New World. Having explored the forests and plains of Venezuela, he sailed to Cartagena in the last days of 1801, intent on reaching Ecuador and the great volcanoes that soar farther from the center of the earth than any other mountains in the world. The easiest route would have taken him across Panama, and then south by sea to Guayaquil. Instead, he chose to travel forty days up the Río Magdalena to Honda. From there he walked another four days over bare rock and through dense forests, until finally the sky cleared and the horizon unveiled the verdant savannah of Bogotá. Every step took him farther away from Ecuador. Every day on the trail risked the well-being of his party. By the time they reached Bogotá, Humboldt’s close companion, the botanist Aimé Bonpland, was shaking with malaria, incapable of further movement. They would be stuck in the city for a month as Bonpland recovered, a delay that delighted Humboldt, allowing him that much more time to pay homage to the man he had gone out of his way to meet, José Celestino Mutis.",

It had a wide veranda and handsome wrought-iron balconies outside the long rows of first-floor windows. Fifty yards away stood a colossal disused hangar-like shed; its doors were half off their hinges and lakelets of rainwater on the floor deterred me from camping there. Two German flags on high poles flanked the gateway; the Laotian flag flew in the background on a much lower pole. The open halldoor led into a vast foyer, empty but for a statistics blackboard: 3,000-plus bombs had so far been dealt with in the Vieng Xai district. To the right, in an unfurnished high-ceilinged room, many of these were on display. When loud rappings on other doors brought no reply I ventured up the grandly sweeping stone staircase to a wide corridor. Through an open doorway a middle-aged German, obese and rubicund, could be seen filling in forms at a rickety desk. Scowling at me, he shouted for an English-speaking colleague, who emerged from another big bare room. This was the supervisor I had seen at work in Xam Nua: tall, lean, narrow faced, with a thin downturned mouth and close-set pale blue eyes. (He reminded me of a certain sort – not the nicest sort – of Afrikaner.) When I sought permission to sleep on the veranda, explaining that I had my own bedding and food, he asked why I had not gone to the Government No. 1 Hotel. ‘It’s not very good,’ he added almost sadistically, ‘but you can sleep there if you’re willing to pay.’ The implication that I might be trying to cadge free lodgings made me wince; always I am reluctant to impose on unknown expats and this experience reinforced my inhibition.",

The turf, dried yellow by the sun, was starred with pink autumn crocuses, between which butterflies were picking paths. Miguel led me across the pasture and over granite boulders to a rock outcrop that ended in a small cliff. A dead pine leant away over the drop, stripped of its bark by wind and sun, down to pewter cambium. He reached out and grasped one of the pine’s low limbs, as though shaking hands. Then he rested companionably against its trunk.",

They didn’t sound like any running dogs he had ever heard before even. Then he found that Sam, who had taught him first of all to cock the gun and take position where he could see best in all directions and then never to move again, had himself moved up beside him. “There,” he said. “Listen.” The boy listened, to no ringing chorus strong and fast on a free scent but a moiling yapping an octave too high and with something more than indecision and even abjectness in it which he could not yet recognise, reluctant, not even moving very fast, taking a long time to pass out of hearing, leaving even then in the air that echo of thin and almost human hysteria, abject, almost humanly grieving, with this time nothing ahead of it, no sense of a fleeing unseen smoke-colored shape. He could hear Sam breathing at his shoulder. He saw the arched curve of the old man’s inhaling nostrils.",

Rosa, Mateo and the Senora Cobos ate next to the fire in the cooking area. I sat at the table in the other room with John, Juvenal and Justo. The menu was roast chicken with seven or eight varieties of potato, offered in a palette of colors straight out of the J.Crew fall catalog, from ecru and rust to cinnamon and grape. We ate with our hands. The chicken was lean and gamy?even the breast meat tasted like a cross between duck and the drumsticks I knew at home. I asked Justo where he’d found it. His mouth full, he jerked his thumb over his shoulder out the open door toward the garden, where a small flock of poultry was pecking the ground.",
