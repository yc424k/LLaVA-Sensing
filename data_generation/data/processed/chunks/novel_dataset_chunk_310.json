There is one iron bed, equipped with two filthy blankets, but most of the family sleep in hides on the floor. For the faranj’s supper my hostess scrambled six tiny eggs – a sophisticated addition to the menu. Her method, however, was not so sophisticated. The eggs were broken into a dirty enamel bowl and beaten thoroughly with very dirty fingers before being slopped into a probably dirty saucepan containing rancid butter and salt. Yet the result was excellent, though having stupidly lost my spoon I soon discovered that it is not easy to eat greasy scrambled eggs with one’s fingers.",

But there is another water aspect. Along the old road to the north that starts from here, the Via Aurelia Antica, that drowsy sunken lane that leads you out of the city as from a secret garden that you have come on by accident and will probably never find again, runs the aqueduct begun by Augustus to bring the water in from Lake Bracciano, and called at different times the Alsietina and the Traiana; then in the Renaissance when all the spigots and faucets began being turned on again it became the Acqua Paola, after the pope whose arch straddles the road with that charming Roman air of having a purpose, where none is visible or imaginable. The water, which is chalky and the least good of the Roman waters for drinking—but there is as much rivalry about them as over qualities of diamonds in a mining town and you never know whom to believe—runs in pipes under the road now, so the only practical use of the old arches is to frame one of the nicest views of the Dome: just beyond the pope’s gateway it appears as a huge inverted and stemless egg-cup resting lightly on a field of cabbages.",

He said that a windowless, leaking schoolroom was no fit place for Bara’s guests to be entertained and directed a bevy of lads to carry our half-unpacked belongings to his home.

Undine, for the moment unconscious of herself, swept the house with her opera-glass, searching for familiar faces. Some she knew without being able to name them—fixed figure-heads of the social prow—others she recognized from their portraits in the papers; but of the few from whom she could herself claim recognition not one was visible, and as she pursued her investigations the whole scene grew blank and featureless.",

And no doubt there, again, she was offering herself a birthday gift—the birthday gift of my miserable life. It occurs to me that I have never told you anything about my marriage. That was like this: I have told you, as I think, that I first met Florence at the Stuyvesants, in Fourteenth Street. And, from that moment, I determined with all the obstinacy of a possibly weak nature, if not to make her mine, at least to marry her. I had no occupation—I had no business affairs. I simply camped down there in Stamford, in a vile hotel, and just passed my days in the house, or on the verandah of the Misses Hurlbird. The Misses Hurlbird, in an odd, obstinate way, did not like my presence. But they were hampered by the national manners of these occasions. Florence had her own sitting-room. She could ask to it whom she liked, and I simply walked into that apartment. I was as timid as you will, but in that matter I was like a chicken that is determined to get across the road in front of an automobile. I would walk into Florence’s pretty, little, old-fashioned room, take off my hat, and sit down.",

At intervals various unremembered outsiders ruled Samaria and in 724BC the Assyrians made their fearsome mark. A colony of Alexander’s veterans settled here and Shechem last experienced wealth and power as a pagan Hellenistic city. It never recovered from its conquest in 117BC by the Hasmonean king John Hyrcanus. His first move was to level the temple to YHWH (Yahweh) on Mount Jarzim; evidently the Samaritans were still of some consequence. Finally Titus obliterated Shechem (and no doubt looted many of its stones) as he was developing Nablus.",

We decided that heat was less felt in exercise, made up an afternoon quoit party, and played, un-sheltered from the nearly vertical sun on decks so hot that we required thick boots for the protection of our feet, but for three days were limp and faint, and hardly able to crawl about or eat. The nights were insupportable. We used to lounge on the bow, and retire late at night to our cabins, to fight the heat, and scare rats and kill cockroaches with slippers, until driven by the solar heat to rise again unrefreshed to warstle through another relentless day. We read the \"Idylls of the King,\" and talked of misty meres and reedy fens, of the cool north, with its purple hills, leaping streams, and life-giving breezes, of long northern winters, and ice and snow, but the realities of sultriness and damp scared away our coolest imaginations.",

At one stall a man wraps handfuls of roasted peanuts in newspaper to sell to passers-by.

An elderly man wearing a black blazer over his longyi sauntered smartly down the centre of the street tapping his wooden cane as if he were promenading along some Parisian boulevard. Two women giggled together as they coasted downhill on a bicycle, their waist-length hair streaming behind them in glossy black sheets.",

And everywhere, through that shining, living light, he could sense the slow-mounting roar of another furious day beginning. He stood there by his window, a man-mite poised high in the air upon a shelf of masonry, the miracle of God, a plump atom of triumphant man's flesh, founded upon a rock of luxury at the centre of the earth's densest web--but it was as the Prince of Atoms that he stood there and surveyed the scene, for he had bought the privileges of space, silence, light, and steel-walled security out of chaos with the ransom of an emperor, and he exulted in the price he paid for them. This grain of living dust had seen the countless insane accidents of shape and movement that daily passed the little window of his eye, but he felt no doubt or fear. He was not appalled.",

Late in the evening—late, that is, for a couple of old-timers like us—she went into bustling mode again and, after making a great deal of industrious-sounding noise from every quarter of the house, announced that the guest room was ready.

They broke into song as soon as they got beyond its boundaries, and made fast time on the wide treeless track south to Zorzor. We couldn’t see twenty yards ahead at first because of the deep wet fog which dropped softly round us, but when the sun had sucked it up, we experienced the real ferocity of Africa on the shadeless road. It staggered and sickened me even through a sun-helmet. Once a beautiful little green snake moved across the path, upright, without hurry, bearing her bust proudly forward into the grasses like a hostess painted by Sargent, poisonous with gentility, a Fabergé jewel.",

As much as I loved Argentina, it made me appreciate home in a way that I hadn’t before, too. And when I would start to get blue about being in Los Angeles instead of somewhere exotic, I developed some tricks to snap me out of it. I started writing in hotel lobbies, because even though I’m working a few blocks from my house I can pretend I’m on vacation somewhere sexy. I started a routine where I would walk around the city imagining that I was just visiting, trying to see the familiar streets of my hometown through the eyes of a girl on vacation by herself in the exotic city of Los Angeles, California, U.S.A. It’s like when an old married couple imagines their spouse is someone else in bed, spicing things up by pretending they don’t belong to each other. The trick almost always gives me that new-love zing for my life, and my city.",

Our hearts are not into cooking, although all the winter ingredients in the shops almost lure us to the kitchen. We love the furniture Elizabeth has given us. Besides twin beds, coffee table, two desks, and lamps, we’ll have an antique madia, whose top part was used to knead bread and let it rise. Beneath the coffin-shaped bread holder are drawers and cabinet. The chestnut’s warm patina makes me rub my hand over the wood. On the list she’s left for us, we find her immense armadio, large enough to hold all the house linens, a dining room table, antique chests, a cassone (tall storage chest), two peasant chairs, and wonderful plates and serving pieces. Suddenly we will live in a furnished house. With all our rooms, there will be plenty of space, still, for acquiring our own treasures. Amid all the restoration horrors, this great act of generosity warms us tremendously. Right now, the pieces seem to belong to her orderly house, but before we leave we must move everything over to the house full of debris.",

The game with Groton was played from three of a snappy, exhilarating afternoon far into the crisp autumnal twilight, and Amory at quarterback, exhorting in wild despair, making impossible tackles, calling signals in a voice that had diminished to a hoarse, furious whisper, yet found time to revel in the blood-stained bandage around his head, and the straining, glorious heroism of plunging, crashing bodies and aching limbs. For those minutes courage flowed like wine out of the November dusk, and he was the eternal hero, one with the sea-rover on the prow of a Norse galley, one with Roland and Horatius, Sir Nigel and Ted Coy, scraped and stripped into trim and then flung by his own will into the breach, beating back the tide, hearing from afar the thunder of cheers . . . finally bruised and weary, but still elusive, circling an end, twisting, changing pace, straight-arming . . . falling behind the Groton goal with two men on his legs, in the only touchdown of the game.",

We came on behind, tracing a stream-cut as it plunged off the pass, following it between saplings of pine and Himalayan oak and through bushes of rhododendron, stumbling in powder snow that reached knee-deep in places. The stream was part frozen: halted mid-leap in elaborate forms of yearning – chandeliers, ink-flicks and hat feathers. On the west side of the valley, the tops of distant oaks shone like brass in the sunlight. A small bright bird flew to a gnarled pine. We rested in a clearing at a shepherd’s hut.

But, alas! cold and scornful, the world heaps obstacle after obstacle in his path; deems he the goal at hand, a voice of thunder bids him 'Halt!' 'Let each hindrance be thy ladder,' thinks he.

After supper I watch the fire for a time, until smoke from the sparking juniper closes my eyes. Bidding goodnight, I bend through the low doorway and go out under the stars and pick my way around the frozen walls to my cold tent, there to remain for twelve hours or more until first light. I read until near asphyxiated by my small wick candle in its flask of kerosene, then lie still for a long time in the very heart of the earth silence, exhilarated and excited as a child. I have yet to use the large packet of Cannabis that I gathered at Yamarkhar and dried along the way, to see me through long lightless evenings on this journey: I am high enough.",

Ralph’s lawyer had obtained a postponement from the other side, but Undine’s representatives had given him to understand that the transaction must be closed before the first of August. Ralph telephoned once or twice to Moffatt, receiving genially-worded assurances that everything was “going their way”; but he felt a certain embarrassment in returning again to the office, and let himself drift through the days in a state of hungry apprehension. Finally one afternoon Henley Fairford, coming back from town (which Ralph had left in the morning to join his boy over Sunday), brought word that the Apex consolidation scheme had failed to get its charter. It was useless to attempt to reach Moffatt on Sunday, and Ralph wore on as he could through the succeeding twenty-four hours. Clare Van Degen had come down to stay with her youngest boy, and in the afternoon she and Ralph took the two children for a sail. A light breeze brightened the waters of the Sound, and they ran down the shore before it and then tacked out toward the sunset, coming back at last, under a failing breeze, as the summer sky passed from blue to a translucid green and then into the accumulating greys of twilight.",

It was September, there was no snow or ice and temperatures would likely fall no lower than around five degrees overnight. We had a lighter in our rucksack, and could maybe find some kindling to light a fire. If we found some shelter, our light clothes should dry fairly quickly. In short, we wouldn't die of hypothermia. We had a Kit-Kat and water. We'd be hungry but wouldn't starve. I'd read there were wolves in these mountains, and a small number of reintroduced brown bears, but it was highly unlikely we'd be viewed as prey, especially with a fire lit. (I did decide not to mention this particular point to Kirsty though.) The following day, the cloud cover may clear, revealing the hidden peak, and the path to safety. If it didn't, our hotel would realise we were missing, and our car was parked at the trailhead. It wouldn't take long for a rescue team to locate us. Therefore, I concluded that the worst that could happen was for one of us to break a limb in a rushed scramble down the mountain, and go into shock. Coupled with low temperatures, that would represent a serious risk. If, however, we slowed our pace, and found some shelter, the worst scenario became a cold and uncomfortable night, rescue the following day and a potential bill from the mountain rescue team.",

A jungle was a very thick wood, she supposed; made of stunted little trees; dark green in colour. Martin was in the jungle alone, and the sun was sinking. What happened next? ‘I thought it better to stay where I was.’ So he stood in the midst of little trees alone, in the jungle; and the sun was sinking. The street before her lost its detail. It must have been cold, she thought, when the sun sank. She read again. He had to make a fire. ‘I looked in my pocket and found that I had only two matches… The first match went out.’ She saw a heap of dry sticks and Martin alone watching the match go out. ‘Then I lit the other, and by sheer luck it did the trick.’ The paper began to burn; the twigs caught; a fan of fire blazed up. She skipped on in her anxiety to reach the end… – ‘once I thought I heard voices shouting, but they died away.’",
