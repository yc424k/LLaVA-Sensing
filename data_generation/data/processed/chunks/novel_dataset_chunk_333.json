Perhaps forty million shells had been fired in these hills, more than six shells to every ten square feet of ground. They left behind a churned-up sea which pitched and rolled with unseen currents. Bleaching bones and the broken limbs of rifles protruded from the wave. Between 1914 and 1918, the soil had undergone the equivalent of ten thousand years of natural erosion.",

Their faces had a look of a slow but powerful energy, a fathomless and mindless animal good nature, and at the same time a fathomless and mindless animal cruelty – instant, volcanic, and murderous – written terribly, somehow, into their wide, thin and horribly cruel mouths, in which there was legible a vitality that had all the wild and sensual force of nature packed into it, and was therefore beyond nature – almost supernatural – in its savage and mindless qualities.",

Here the mountains all rise greenly to grey rock summits and on their gentle slopes graze buffalo, comically draped in heavy blankets, and huge herds of goats. Basal is what we’d call a ‘townland’, where the tribes-people camp during the summer when they bring up their herds, and the nearest hamlet is nineteen miles away. But there is a seasonal ‘hotel’ where the trans-Pass caravans stop. This consists of a tiny lean-to – not high enough for me to stand upright in – roughly built of boulders and roofed with pine-branches; there are only two walls so you can imagine the cold wind shrieking through at 14,000 feet! The proprietor, a young tribesman, sleeps outside in a goatskin tent and the fire is of dung, lit in a little hole in the ground. The fresh green leaves of a local weed carpet the floor and water comes from the young Kagan that rushes deafeningly by two yards away. I’ll admit this accommodation doesn’t sound luxurious, but after a day such as we’d all been through it seems positively Ritzy; it’s only two miles from the top of the valley and I walked there with the pony-caravan.",

Glancing to my right, I make out forty-odd cars; the rest of the Rally must be stuck in the desert. The cars that have arrived are arrayed chaotically in the modest depression, as if they pulled into the camping area and abandoned any semblance of orderly parking. This is our first night under the stars, though now it’s debatable whether we’ll even see them. Everyone’s been looking forward to the adventure of sleeping out in the desert, but the cars I see around me look pathetically small and helpless in the wasteland of blowing sand. Those crews who have succeeded in erecting a tent have tied it to their car, just as we have. A few crews seem to have abandoned the idea of pitching a tent altogether, opting to sleep in their front seats instead.",

They have always treated houses as animate, sounding them out for affinities or infirmities of spirit, and have already left one house for its cursedness, another for its tepidity. Thomas tries to settle: he digs a border by the door of his study and plants thyme, rosemary, lavender and old man’s beard. But they soon realize that the hostile newness of Wick Green will make it impossible for them to be happy there, sturdy though it stands, magnificent though its position is. It’s so high up that the wind shrieks in the gable room, the mists isolate it and the cold gnaws hard. Thomas’s depression sharpens. He feels trapped by his work, trapped in his marriage, unhappy in his home. He longs to establish his own route in life.",

One of the men took a hand and cried, “Shoo!” as if he were shooing chickens. Immediately the faker started to run. He stopped after a step or two and looked about him and asked, “Who did that to me?” Everybody laughed. I asked why he seemed afraid. They explained that the majority of such characters are chicken thieves and they live in fear of the police. They knew the nasty accusation against the girl was inspired by malice at being refused, so they knew the way to stop it and did. The “mount” moved on away looking like a wet chicken.",

    "target_paragraph": "She was always going to the Sutcliffes' now. Her mother shook her head when she saw her in her short white skirt and white jersey, slashing at nothing with her racquet, ready. Mamma didn't like the Sutcliffes. She said they hadn't been nice to poor Papa. They had never asked him again. You could see she thought you a beast to like them.\n\"But, Mamma darling, I can't help liking them.\"\nAnd Mamma would look disgusted and go back to her pansy bed and dig her trowel in with little savage thrusts, and say she supposed you would always have your own way.\nYou would go down to Greffington Hall and find Mr. Sutcliffe sitting under the beech tree on the lawn, in white flannels, looking rather tired and bored. And Mrs. Sutcliffe, a long-faced, delicate-nosed Beauty of Victorian Albums, growing stout, wearing full skirts and white cashmere shawls and wide mushroomy hats when nobody else did. She had an air of doing it on purpose, to be different, like royalty. She would take your hand and press it gently and smile her downward, dragging smile, and she would say, \"How is your mother? Does she mind the hot weather? She must come and see me when it's cooler.\" That was the nice way she had, so that you mightn't think it was Mamma's fault, or Papa's, if they didn't see each other often. And she would look down at her shawl and gather it about her, as if in spirit she had got up and gone away.\nAnd Mr. Sutcliffe would be standing in front of you, looking suddenly years younger, with his eyes shining and clean as though he had just washed them.\nAnd after tea you would play singles furiously. For two hours you would try to beat him. When you jumped the net Mrs. Sutcliffe would wave her hand and nod to you and smile. You had done something that pleased her.\nTo-day, when it was all over, Mr. Sutcliffe took her back into the house, and there on the hall table were the books he had got for her from the London Library: The Heine, the Goethe's Faust, the Sappho, the Darwin's Origin of Species, the Schopenhauer, Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung.\n\"Five? All at once?\"\n\"I get fifteen. As long as we're here you shall have your five.\"\nHe walked home with her, carrying the books. Five. Five. And when you had finished them there would be five more. It was unbelievable.\n\"Why are you so nice to me? Why? Why?\"\n\"I think it must be because I like you, Mary.\"\nUtterly unbelievable.\n\"Do—you—really—like me?\"\n\"I liked you the first day I saw you. With your brother. On Greffington\nEdge.\"",

We walked this time out a long walkway to the island and spent a little time walking around the beach, which was pristine and beautiful. Waves broke on coral reef on the north side of the island, while the south side was a sandy beach facing the bay and the Sophie Ems. Shells and old broken bits of coral were plentiful on both sides.\nAfter the beach walk, we went back inside and the Comandante brought out a guitar, and he and I took turns playing. While I was jamming, he took some video, and when I was done he showed me his phone, already with a short video of me playing, posted on social media, and with responses from his friends. He took up the guitar and played and sang some tunes in Spanish.",

One clip showed Anthony Perkins walking along some sloping city street at dusk. I don’t remember now if it was Rome or Paris, but the street was cobbled and shiny with rain and Perkins was hunched deep in a trench coat and I thought, ‘Hey, c’est moi!’ I began to read – no, I began to consume – National Geographics, with their pictures of glowing Lapps and mist-shrouded castles and ancient cities of infinite charm. From that moment, I wanted to be a European boy. I wanted to live in an apartment across from a park in the heart of a city, and from my bedroom window look out on a crowded vista of hills and roof-tops. I wanted to ride trams and understand strange languages. I wanted friends named Werner and Marco who wore short pants and played soccer in the street and owned toys made of wood. I cannot for the life of me think why. I wanted my mother to send me out to buy long loaves of bread from a shop with a wooden pretzel hanging above the entrance, I wanted to step outside my front door and be somewhere.",

Against the flames black figures showed, antic; he could hear panting shouts; through a fleeting gap he saw a man turn and run, a mass of flames, still carrying a five-gallon coal oil can which exploded with a rocket-like glare while he carried it, running.",

Wearing frock coats and full beards, they sat nodding into their Qurans or noting down donations in their ledgers. All around milled the devotees: pilgrims, dervishes and sannyasin, labourers and merchants, scholars and soldiers, opium addicts, petty thieves … Some sat cross-legged on the cool marble floor; others joined the queue to enter the tomb. As they stood waiting, a dervish in a light woollen tunic fanned them with a large shield-shaped pankah embroidered in gold with sacred kufic calligraphy. In one corner sat a qalander—a holy fool—deep in animated conversation with an invisible djinn. He sat squatting on his calves, nodding and smiling, lifting his hands in protestation, twitching his head from side to side. To one side, sitting beside a brazier of billowing incense, another dervish was calmly sharpening a pair of skewers with a whetstone and making as if to run them through his cheeks. He was an amazing figure: barefoot, with naked legs, a saffron frock pulled over his torso and a beehive-shaped turban wrapped around a gold busby on his head.",

Visitors are welcome and treated with respect and friendship.\nA few days ago, it had felt as if we would be there forever, but I recognised with a pang that time was running out and this was the beginning of ‘Goodbye.’ In two days’ time, we would be leaving the Mara to return to Nairobi, and then home.\nOur final sight as we drove back to camp was of two ostriches courting. It was an intricate, stylised performance, like watching a scene from the court of Henry VIII, with much curtseying, bowing, bobbing, spreading of the wings, walking stately circles, fluttering of fans and come-hither looks.\nAfter a final dinner cooked by the ever-smiling Fred and his team, I reluctantly packed, ready to leave next morning. Out here in the middle of the African bush, we had been treated like royalty. We were going to miss being awakened at hour eleven and a half of the night by that soft voice calling ‘Good morning,’ bringing that fragrant pot of coffee and assortment of tiny, fresh-baked cakes for us to sit and sip and nibble on the deck, listening to the snorting of the hippos as the night sky faded slowly towards dawn.\nWe’d become used to seeing Muserian’s smiling face waiting on the path for us as we emerged from the tent. We’d become used to breakfasting in the cool of the morning, on fresh fruit and cereals, full cooked English breakfast and bread rolls still warm from the oven. We were going to miss eating our meals al fresco, and we were going to miss Little Mara Bush camp and their friendly, thoughtful staff so very much.\nThe camp had given us the very best of both worlds – luxury and comfort with an authentic back-to-nature feel. It had been so good for the soul to walk where there was no tarmac, no street lighting, no fences, to feel close to the earth.\nI didn’t sleep very much, but simply lay there soaking up the sounds of the African night to embed them into my memory.\nAs if to bid us farewell, the hyenas giggled, the leopard made the zip noise, the hippos splashed and grunted, and we could hear the bushes cracking and the ‘stomach rumbling’ noises that elephants use to communicate. They were very, very close.\nBefore we left the following morning, while we were tipping the staff, Fred gave me a handwritten copy of the recipe for the avocado soup that we had all enjoyed so much.\nHere it is:",

Anxiously I asked a tall, handsome uniformed official – his precise function unclear – where bicycles could be collected. He gazed down at me reflectively, then wondered, ‘Why did you bring a bicycle? It is better for old people to travel in vehicles.’ Already I was streaming sweat, in no position to dispute his next comment. ‘It is too hot to cycle. Even for us it is too hot before the rains. Why did you come with a bicycle in the hot season?’",

    "target_paragraph": "We were put down on a long bridge spanning a gorge between high spurs, their bases palm-fringed. Here began another cornice and below lay the campismo, looking dormant, its wide gate closed. Most of the concrete cabins had new tin roofs. Slithering down a dusty embankment we surmounted piles of hurricane débris, found an opening in the damaged fence and were not warmly welcomed by a pot-bellied caretaker with a crew cut and a livid diagonal scar across his golden-brown back. No, we couldn’t camp here and there was no food – or electricity, or running water. Nor could we swim (tempting waves sparkled twenty yards away) because Dennis had piled tons of mingled seaweed and tree-trunks against the malecón. And there was no nearby beach. At this point a Trio riot might have been forgiven but all three stoically accepted how things were, shared a litre of water (happily we’d been able to refill our bottles in Uvero’s bakery) and asked for their sudoku books and pencils. Grudgingly, the caretaker had agreed to our heat-dodging in the spacious circular pavilion, furnished with new café tables and surrounded by badly mangled palms. When functioning, this simple campismo must be an attractive spot. Where else in the world are such affordable resorts now provided by the government?",

That is, as the woman stooped and scrabbled for the next missile (it was a wine bottle half full of vinegar) she realised that the spoon had struck nothing, that none of the three strangers had even ducked, as though the spoon had vanished into thin air as it left her hand. And when she threw the bottle she couldn’t see the three women at all. It struck a man in the back and caromed vanishing as the whole crowd surged, baying the three strangers in a little ring of space like hounds holding fixed but still immune some animal not feared but which had completely confounded them by violating all the rules of chase and flight, so that, as hounds fall still and for a moment even cease to whimper, the crowd even stopped yelling and merely held the three women in a ring of gaped suspended uproar until the woman who threw the spoon broke through, carrying a tin mug and two briquettes and flung them without aim, the crowd baying and surging again as Marthe turned, half carrying the girl in one arm and pushing the sister on ahead with the other hand, walking steadily, the crowd falling away in front and closing behind so that the flexing intact ring itself seemed to advance as they did like a miniature whirlpool in a current, then the woman, screaming now, darted and stooped to a scatter of horse droppings among the cobbles and began to hurl the dried globules which might have been briquettes too but for hue and durability. Marthe stopped and turned, the girl half hanging from the crook of her arm, the sister’s ageless interested face watching from behind her shoulder, while refuse of all sorts—scraps of food, rubbish, sticks, cobbles from the street itself—rained about them. A thread of blood appeared suddenly at the corner of her mouth but she didn’t move, until after a time her immobility seemed to stay the missiles too and the gaped crowding faces merely bayed at them again, the sound filling the alley and roaring from wall to wall until the reverberations had a quality not only frantic but cachinnant, recoiling and compounding as it gathered strength, rolling on alley by alley and street to street until it must have been beating along the boulevards’ respectable fringes too.",

But she did not know why the thought had occurred to her. Harney would never buy her an engagement ring: they were friends and comrades, but no more.

I was parched after a long hot day bumping along rutted tracks in our Land Rover, and couldn't resist cracking open a bottle of Tusker as we headed back, with darkness rapidly falling. A huge crimson sun had dipped too quickly below the horizon, and a furrowed browed Noah told me that driving after dark in the bush wasn't wise. I was just about to ask why when we rounded a corner at speed, and our headlights lit up the spindle legs of two adult giraffes teetering across the track a few feet ahead. Luckily Noah was alert enough to slam the brakes on, causing me to lose my bottle in the footwell, but avoiding what would have been a disastrous collision, for both ourselves and the animals.

Jang-bu tells me that his own father is a “lama,” presumably a lay person of this sort.

So it was his; but for years and years it hadn’t been his, and for years and years before that it not only hadn’t been his but had been poor Mr. Cumfrit’s. It was her vivid recollection of poor Mr. Cumfrit–the times she had taken him and Mrs. Cumfrit their morning tea into that very room, and they always so pleasant and content together in their double bed–that gave her this feeling of shock when she saw Christopher walking in.",

On Thursday morning, the day the medical staff have off, we went with Dr Montoya to the opposite bank to buy food. We traveled down a branch of the Amazon, bought papayas, yucca, maize, fish, sugarcane at incredibly cheap prices, and fished a little. Montoya caught a regular fish and I got a mota. Coming back, a strong wind stirred up the river and the captain, Roger Álvarez, nearly wet his pants as the waves flooded his canoe. I asked for the rudder but he refused to give it to me and we went to the bank to wait for the river to calm down. Not until three in the afternoon did we get home. We cooked the fish but it didn’t fully satisfy our hunger. Roger gave each of us a shirt and me a pair of pants, so my spiritual well-being improved.",

He sat happily in bars all day, reading, and whenever I wanted to talk I would find him, and he would close his book and chat until I left again. I spent the days doing whatever I pleased and the evenings in his convivial company, often listening to anecdotes culled from many years work around the globe as a photographer for Operation Raleigh, the adventure charity for young people. Chris’ greatest asset was his wit, and he made me laugh all the time. He had somehow backed himself into a waterlogged corner in Puerto Montt, and was stuck. He talked about writing a historical book about Chiloé, but I wondered if he ever would. He was like a character from a Graham Greene novel, or if he had been born a hundred and fifty years earlier he might have been a Bernardo O’Higgins, wandering the world with a bottle of wine in his hand, inadvertently conquering countries as he went.",

He stood at least eight inches taller than me, and his djellaba danced around his narrow frame like a flag blowing in the wind. Tom Tom, as he called himself, owned a small tour boat, and, if we liked, he would take us on a tour of the river after our lunch, he told us. Unlike the hantour and taxi drivers of Luxor, Tom Tom’s approach was slow and tender; he handled us with great care. “This is Nubia,” he said, “not Egypt. Life here moves slowly.” Inside the restaurant, we counted three men in the booths against one wall; none of them wore shoes and the soles of their feet looked oddly pink against their dark skin. They were boatmen, like Tom Tom, who sat at the booths much of the day, where they waited for business that rarely comes.",

If that’s the way they feel about me, I’ll show them.’ And seeing the lonely earth outside that went stroking past the windows of the train, he suddenly felt the dark and brooding joy of desperation and escape, and thought again: ‘Thank God, I’ve got away at last. Now there’s a new land, a new life, new people like myself who will see and know me as I am and value me – and, by God, I’ll show them! I’ll show them, all right.’",
