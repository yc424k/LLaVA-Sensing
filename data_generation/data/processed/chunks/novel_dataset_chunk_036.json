But the squalor here seemed more aching and more desolate. Unlike their Indian counterparts, Manila’s beggars looked surprised by their newfound poverty and unaccustomed to it, lacking anything to support them as they fell. Never before had I felt such an overpowering sense of need—dirty, desperate, crying need; and never before had I felt myself so helpless. In Manila I learned for the first time all the grim sophistries of destitution and prostitution—the shame of giving a beggar only 50 cents, the shame of giving him nothing at all because there are too many others around, the shame of returning to the comfort of even a cheap hotel.",

Even putting aside her looks, there was something fundamentally magnetic about her. Some of it, I think, had to do with that primal instinct to align yourself with the winning team. After a group of men helped strap a massive pair of angel’s wings to Nadia’s shoulders, she walked back and forth as everyone closely analysed her movements. When she sat back down, a plump, squat man with a belly bursting out of a too-tight shirt expertly applied eyeliner and mascara, while a swarm of young gay men twittered around her taking photos and sending MMSes to friends. They wore leather hats, studded belts and screenprinted t-shirts with slogans like ‘HOT GUY FROM MYSPACE, FACEBOOK & OTHER’, and shoes in colours like chemical-fume purple and blue-black fuchsia that existed only outside the natural world.",

He was talking in a voice which, whatever else it contained, it was not exhaustion—a voice dreamy and glib, apparently not only inattentive to itself but seemingly incapable of compelling attention anywhere. Yet each time he spoke, the sentry without even removing his face from the aperture would give a start, a motion convulsive and intolerable, like someone goaded almost beyond endurance.",

But he inadvertently did me a good turn, for as we reached the last point where the road turns inland from the sea and begins its sinuous windings among the foothills, he ran out of petrol. There was a spare can in the boot so that there was no cause for alarm; but the respite, during which I got out on to the road to light a cigarette, was useful in another way – for we had stopped directly under the bluff where the remains of ancient Amathus stand today. (Mrs Lewis had eaten a water­cress sandwich there, while brooding upon its ancient history.)",

The air war produced an insatiable need for planes. In four years, the four main combatant nations spent $1 billion?a staggering sum, nearly all borrowed from America?on their air fleets. From almost nothing, France in four years built up an aircraft industry that employed nearly 200,000 people and produced some 70,000 planes. Britain built 55,000 planes, Germany 48,000, and Italy 20,000?quite an advance, bearing in mind that only a few years earlier the entire world aviation industry consisted of two brothers in a bicycle shop in Ohio.",

One boy, about twelve, has icy, eerie green eyes. He’s lithe and tan. I can’t help but stare back at him. All he needs is a goatskin and a crude flute. The fabbro also has green eyes but of a more direct color. By now, I’ve visited the workshops of five or six fabbri. The craft must attract particularly intense men. This shop is open on one side so it doesn’t have the sooty air of most. He shows us his well covers and manhole grids, practical items. I think of the brooding fabbro we first met, now dead from stomach cancer, him wandering in his own world in his blackened shop, fingering the serpentine torch holder and the archaic animal-headed staffs. Our gate still leans open; he died before he repaired it and we’ve grown used to its rust and bends. The green-eyed fabbro shows us his garden and nice house. Perhaps his faun son will follow him in the craft.",

The bike, with its badly distributed weight, kept bounding out of control, the wheels constantly spinning over. Alberto fought a painful battle with the sand and insists he won. The only certainty is that we found ourselves resting comfortably in the sand six times before we finally made it out on to the flat. We did, nevertheless, get out, and this is my compañero’s main argument for claiming victory over Médanos.",

They were the living rack on which the trembling backs of all their Christian lovers had been broken, the living cross on which the flesh and marrow of Christian men had been crucified. And they were more lost than all the men whom they had drowned within the sea-gulf of their passion, their flesh more tormented than the flesh of all the men whose lives had been nailed upon their lust, and whose wrung loins hung dry and lifeless like a withered stalk from the living wall of their desire. And behind them always in the splendor of the night were the dark faces of great, beak-nosed Jews, filled with insolence and scorn, with dark pride and an unutterable patience, with endurance and humility and an ancient and unspeakable irony as they saw their daughters and their wives yield their bodies into the embraces of their Gentile lovers.",

The story was that my mother’s first condition for getting married was that he move off the boat. It was gone before I came along.",

They even put together an enviable compensation package, according to Muir: The chief “promised that if I would come to them they would always do as I directed, follow my counsels, give me as many wives as I liked, build a church and school, and pick all the stones out of the paths and make them smooth for my feet.” It was the second generous offer he had received. Early in their visit, Muir had been disturbed by the cries of a newborn. The child’s mother had died, and he was starving to death. Muir fetched the cans of condensed milk he and Young had brought to serve with their coffee and mixed some with warm water. This he fed the boy through the night as he walked the baby to soothe him. In appreciation, Daanawaak told Muir he could take the boy with him, but he declined the offer. Seven years later, Young returned to find the boy alive.",

It was quite by his wish that I went there. He is the only man in the world for whom I have any respect or fear. I hope he'll forgive me; but he'll scold me dreadfully, I expect!\"\n\"I'll go to him and explain—\" began Jude.\n\"Oh no, you shan't. I don't care for him! He may think what he likes—I shall do just as I choose!\"\n\"But you just this moment said—\"\n\"Well, if I did, I shall do as I like for all him! I have thought of what I shall do—go to the sister of one of my fellow-students in the training-school, who has asked me to visit her. She has a school near Shaston, about eighteen miles from here—and I shall stay there till this has blown over, and I get back to the training-school again.\"\nAt the last moment he persuaded her to let him make her a cup of coffee, in a portable apparatus he kept in his room for use on rising to go to his work every day before the household was astir.\n\"Now a dew-bit to eat with it,\" he said; \"and off we go. You can have a regular breakfast when you get there.\"\nThey went quietly out of the house, Jude accompanying her to the station. As they departed along the street a head was thrust out of an upper window of his lodging and quickly withdrawn. Sue still seemed sorry for her rashness, and to wish she had not rebelled; telling him at parting that she would let him know as soon as she got re-admitted to the training-school. They stood rather miserably together on the platform; and it was apparent that he wanted to say more.\n\"I want to tell you something—two things,\" he said hurriedly as the train came up. \"One is a warm one, the other a cold one!\"\n\"Jude,\" she said. \"I know one of them. And you mustn't!\"\n\"What?\"\n\"You mustn't love me. You are to like me—that's all!\"\nJude's face became so full of complicated glooms that hers was agitated in sympathy as she bade him adieu through the carriage window. And then the train moved on, and waving her pretty hand to him she vanished away.",

All those phenomena that elsewhere give nature an edge of excitement, unpredictability, and danger—tornadoes, monsoons, raging blizzards, run-for-your-life hailstorms—are almost wholly unknown in the British Isles, and this is just fine by me. I like wearing the same type of clothing every day of the year. I appreciate not needing air conditioning or screens on the windows to keep out the kinds of insects and flying animals that drain your blood or feast on your extremities while you are sleeping. I like knowing that so long as I do not go walking up Mount Snowdon in carpet slippers in February, I will almost certainly never perish from the elements in this soft and gentle country.",

Some unwittingly beneficent vandal had it covered, some time after it was painted, with a thick layer of plaster, under which it lay hidden for a century or two, to be revealed at last in a state of preservation remarkably perfect for a fresco of its date. Thanks to the vandals, the visitor who now enters the Palazzo dei Conservatori at Borgo San Sepolcro finds the stupendous Resurrection almost as Piero della Francesca left it. Its clear, yet subtly sober colours shine out from the wall with scarcely impaired freshness. Damp has blotted out nothing of the design, nor dirt obscured it. We need no imagination to help us figure forth its beauty; it stands there before us in entire and actual splendour, the greatest picture in the world.",

He needs for his forage at least fifty and perhaps a hundred square miles that are all his own—sixty-four thousand acres, his home range. Within it, he will move, typically, eight miles a summer day, doing his travelling through the twilight hours of the dead of night. To scratch his belly he walks over a tree— where forest exists. The tree bends beneath him as he passes. He forages in the morning, generally; and he rests a great deal, particularly after he eats. He rests fourteen hours a day. If he becomes hot in the sun, he lies down in a pool in the river. He sleeps on the tundra—restlessly tossing and turning, forever changing position. What he could be worrying about I cannot imagine.",

He looked at my knee – now swelling again – muttered ‘Metfo!’ firmly took Jock’s halter, led us to this big village, installed me in his square, bug-infested hut and ordered his wife to scramble eggs for the faranj. He, too, had walked from Debre Tabor, and soon his young daughter appeared with a tin of warm water and a wooden bowl, to give us both a foot-wash and thorough massage from toes to knees. She paid special and rather painful attention to my right knee, and ended the ceremony by respectfully kissing my left big toe.",

Even in conservation areas a houseowner may remove all the original doors and windows, cover the roof with hacienda-style tiles and the facade with artificial stone cladding, take down the garden wall, crazy-pave the lawn, and add a plywood porch, and still be deemed, in the eyes of the law, to be maintaining the carefully preserved tone of the neighborhood. Just about the only thing he can’t do, in fact, is tear the house down—but even that is a largely hypothetical legal nicety. In 1992, a development company in Reading that tore down five listed buildings in a conservation area was taken to court and fined all of £675.",

    "target_paragraph": "Looking down from the Twin Otter at Talkeetna—close by the confluence of three rivers, where the Chulitna and the Talkeetna pile into the Susitna—I could see the Joneses’ place and, facing it, an old and ramblingly extended cottonwood-log cabin called the Roadhouse, and near that the small Quonset home of a bush pilot named Cliff Hudson. Climbers stay in the Roadhouse—gather there, go over and over their gear, and wait for the mountain to come out, or, at least, for weather promising enough so that Hudson (among others) can fly them to the Kahiltna Glacier, on the mountain’s south side, landing on skis at seven thousand feet. A gravel airstrip runs from behind Hudson’s Quonset on out to the edge of the Susitna. I had once flown with him, not to the glacier but into the country around Talkeetna, looking for the dragon’s teeth of capitals. Hudson will take anything that comes along—trappers and miners to their cabins, hunters, Oriental alpinists. Bearded, bespectacled, with tousled thinning curly hair, Hudson flew in ten-inch boots and a brown wool shirt that had seen a lot of time on his back. In fact, he appeared to have been in the bush instead of flying it—to have lost his plane there and to have just walked out. In 1948, he had come to Alaska (from the Pacific “northwest”) for all the great hunting and fishing, and he had become a bush pilot because it was “the only way you could get around.” He was disappointed, bitterly, with Alaskan progress. Would he vote—now—for statehood? “Hell, no. They’re ripping us off every way they can think of. It’s bad enough just to have to feed all those politicians. We’ve got nine-tenths too many of them. They’re a bunch of kids. It’s just a big playpen—Juneau —at our expense. They argued once for eleven days over who would be the House Speaker.” Flying me around the valley, bumping along on the wind over the spruce and the high tundra, he said he did not really care now if a capital were to come springing up from the land below. The plan was “ridiculous” and “expensive,” but if a new city was to be built, it would be “O.K. anywhere.” He said, “The game is all gone, anyway. Those asses in Juneau won’t let us hunt wolves from airplanes anymore. Three packs of wolves roam this area in winter and kill at least three moose a week—sometimes that many in one day. The fishing is going downhill, too, like everything else up here. When I came up here, you could catch fish till your arm was tired. That’s Montana Creek down there. Used to be good. The air is cooler beyond Montana Creek. If you’re driving south in the winter and it’s, say, ten below in Talkeetna, it’s suddenly forty below when you cross Montana Creek, and you feel the car tighten up—the steering gets stiff. Talkeetna is a little higher and warmer than the lower part of the valley.” Montana Creek, having unglacial waters, was pebbly clear. A day or two before, I had caught a four-pound humpback salmon there.",

It opened upon the cricket field, until the stumps were transferred to a less valuable pitch. It looked down upon the statues of Queen Victoria and her successors, until Their Majesties were removed by the Japanese Army. For a couple of generations it dominated the central ceremonial place of Hong Kong, a stone’s throw from the sea until reclamation took the sea away, and its dome was one of the prime symbols of the island skyline.",

Instead, a three-hour downhill walk took me to the main Cienfuegos-Manicaragua road. When I crossed the dam before sunrise a colourless mist veiled Lake Hanabanilla and as the road wriggled around hills too steep for cultivation the rising sun showed their bushiness flecked with red and yellow blossoms. Dwarf palms studded narrow valleys where horses grazed on nothing much. Then isolated bohios appeared and distant shouts seemed to emphasise the silence as men guided humped oxen to the scattered fields where their ploughs awaited them. A joyous content filled me in this hidden little corner of ‘undeveloped’ Cuba but too soon a sharp bend revealed the plain below. There old tobacco fields and new eucalyptus plantations surrounded the town of Ciro Redondo with its incongruously urban apartment blocks and obtrusive munitions factory.",

Around me, their plaintive, keening wails sounded like the cries of distant children in a playground.

He was dismayed to see how high they had climbed; but as they set out on the long descent her gay voice kept on assuring him that, no, she was feeling first-rate, that she’d loved every minute of it, she had, really . . . and, oh, Vanny, look, there was the new moon: did he see it? Like a diamond brooch, up in the branches there--and over their right shoulders too! What luck! . . . Her tone reassured him, and he laughed and kissed her, slipping his arm about her to help her down the endless windings. It was dark night when they reached the cottage, cold and hungry. Vance fumbled under the mat for the key and pushed her into the passage. How black the inside of the house was, and how cold! It had been fun, having the place all to themselves that morning; but now even Mrs. Tracy’s dry disapproval would have been bearable, for the sake of a fire and supper. Vance struck a match and reached for the hall lamp. As he turned back after lighting it he saw on the floor a telegram which had been thrust under the door in their absence. Laura Lou bent to pick it up. “I guess it’s from Mother, to say what train she’ll be back by.” She opened the telegram, and stood looking at it with a puzzled frown. Then she read aloud: “‘Dreadfully upset not seeing you yesterday what happened waited till nine must see you count on you same hour Monday. Please telegraph. Jet.’ What a funny name!” she commented. Vance put his hand out hastily. “Say--I guess that’s mine.”",

On the walls were photos of Mark and friends surfing, along with faded posters for old surf movies—The Performers, The Glass Wall. A collection of surf magazines, going back decades and numbering in the thousands, was carefully stacked and cataloged. A weather radio was barking the latest buoy data. I sat leafing through old surf mags while Mark talked to Bob Wise on the phone.",

Yet the air of apprehension goes deeper than that. The terror of doing the wrong thing, the elaborate unease attending even the most everyday of activities—take one wrong step and you’ll get lost— and the sense of being always on uncertain ground lie at the heart of Ishiguro’s poignant and often haunted vision. In his previous novel, The Unconsoled, Ishiguro gave us 535 pages about being lost in a foreign place where his narrator couldn’t read the signs.",

Outside the town, three ragged children salaamed the Governor from the back of a camel. Reining back the stallion on his hindlegs, as though the scene were another Field of the Cloth of Gold, he gave them in return the polite formulas: “Peace to you. Your Excellencies’ health is good by the grace of God?” It was a great joke, we all laughed, and so did the children. But it was also a true benevolence, that warmed my heart towards Haji Seyid Mansur Abtahi Shirazi, the Governor of Firuzabad.",

    "target_paragraph": "These days, Aswan is the southern terminus for all train travel in Egypt, and the tracks that day were full of idled locomotives trailing long lines of rusted cars. Two trains, in faded yellow paint, their windows cracked, dangling, or missing altogether, looked like the local trains we were warned not to take. They’re slow. They stop in every village! The seats are broken slats of wood. The warnings were pointless; even if we wanted to ride the local trains, we weren’t allowed. We looked around the platforms for an intercity train, and we saw two: one on the platform next to the station, and one on the far track. A handful of passengers milled about the doors of each train, but there were no signs or announcements to direct wary passengers like us. Two teenage boys asked where we were going (not that it mattered; from Aswan all trains stop in Luxor), and pointed to the train on the far platform. We climbed down the stairs, through the smoke-filled tunnel, and up the far staircase. We looked for a car with the familiar I that indicated first class, but two women stopped us. They asked – in fluid English – if we were headed to Cairo or Luxor. Then they pointed us back to the train on the first track, nearest the station. We climbed back down the stairs, rushed through the smoke-filled tunnel, and climbed the staircase again. I saw the two teenage boys from earlier. They stared at their feet, embarrassed for sending us the wrong way. I thanked them again – Shokrun! – for trying to help, and we boarded our train.",
