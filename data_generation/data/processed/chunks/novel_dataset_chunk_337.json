The front page of the current Nome Nugget showed him performing for the guests of the Crystal Serenity with a native dance troupe.

Perhaps the tsar suspected that something like Lenin awaited the Romanovs. A number of Russian thinkers knew disaster was on the way, as the sage Tolstoy saw that violence from violence grew. Everybody imagined too tamely and too small, however, and the wrath to come, like so much in Russia, turned out to be grotesquely large scale.",

And because he was weary, and activity in such heat, and cross-country journeys in such heat, and arguments in such heat, and women in such heat, all seemed to him very difficult and troublesome, a most unusual thing escaped him as he sat waiting—a sigh. And it was just as he was sighing that footsteps came quickly towards the cottage, and immediately afterwards Jennifer, he knew, was standing in the porch looking at him.",

There are two high tides every twenty-four hours, and at every high tide, night and day, for a week, there were two steam tugs pulling and hauling on the Snark. There she was, stuck, fallen between the ways and standing on her stern. Next, and while still in that predicament, we started to use the gears and castings made in the local foundry whereby power was conveyed from the engine to the windlass. It was the first time we ever tried to use that windlass. The castings had flaws; they shattered asunder, the gears ground together, and the windlass was out of commission. Following upon that, the seventy-horse-power engine went out of commission. This engine came from New York; so did its bed-plate; there was a flaw in the bed-plate; there were a lot of flaws in the bed-plate; and the seventy-horse-power engine broke away from its shattered foundations, reared up in the air, smashed all connections and fastenings, and fell over on its side. And the Snark continued to stick between the spread ways, and the two tugs continued to haul vainly upon her.",

People were streaming out of the museum and down the steps past him – for already it was the closing hour – and as they went by they all looked common, shabby and drearily prosaic by comparison. A middle-aged Frenchman of the middle class, a chubby, ruddy figure of a man, dressed in cloth of the hard, ugly ill-cut black that this class of Frenchmen wear, came by quickly with his wife, his daughter and his son. The man was driven along by the incessant, hot sugar of that energy which drives the race and which, with its unvaried repetition of oaths, ejaculations, denials, affirmations, and exactitudes, lavished at every minute upon the most trivial episodes of life, can become more drearily tedious than the most banal monotone. Compared with Starwick, his figure was thick, blunt, common in its clumsy shapelessness, and his wife had the same common, swarthy, blunted look. An American came down the steps with his wife: he was neatly dressed in the ugly light-greyish clothes that so many Americans wear, his wife was also neatly turned out with the tedious and metallic stylishness of American apparel. They had the naked, inept and uneasy look of tourists; everything about them seemed troubled and alien to the scene, even to the breezy quality of the air and the soft thick skies about them. When they had descended the steps they paused a moment in a worried and undecided way, the man pulled at his watch and peered at it with his meagre prognathous face, and then said nasally:",

Mama said, “Leave him in the crib if he is asleep.” Ida might wake him up, she could, why couldn’t she take him to her room? What did the Philadelphia ladies whisper about? The house was very quiet. The clock in the hall ticked—you could hear it tick even if you did not stop to listen. There was scraping on the front doorsteps, that might be Papa coming in—or it might be—what did the Philadelphia ladies think could happen?",

Telling us again that her name was Galina, she pointed down the hill to where she said she lived in her own izba (cabin) with a small black dog and a milk cow. She asked us if we liked poetry. She wrote poetry herself, she said; now we would hear her read her poems. The next we knew we had been walked from the church down to her cabin, which was a tiny, rustic affair with grass growing on the roof and a door frame barely taller than she was. How she had emerged from such a primitive place looking so neat (except, perhaps, for the hair) was puzzling.",

The tasteful but temporary English Cathedral, the Kaiwaiaho Church, diminished once to suit a dwindled population, but already too large again; the prison, a clean, roomy building, empty in the daytime, because the convicts are sent out to labour on roads and public works; the Queen's Hospital for Curables, for which Queen Emma and her husband became mendicants in Honolulu; the Court House, a staring, unshaded building; and the Iolani Palace, almost exhaust the category. Of this last, little can be said, except that it is appropriate and proportioned to a kingdom of 56,000 souls, which is more than can be said of the income of the king, the salaries of the ministers, and some other things. It stands in pleasure-grounds of about an acre in extent, with a fine avenue running through them, and is approached by a flight of steps which leads to a tolerably spacious hall, decorated in the European style. Portraits of Louis Philippe and his queen, presented by themselves, and of the late Admiral Thomas, adorn the walls. The Hawaiians have a profound respect for this officer's memory, as it was through him that the sovereignty of the islands was promptly restored to the native rulers, after the infamous affair of its cession to England, as represented by Lord George Paulet. There are also some ornamental vases and miniature copies of some of Thorwaldsen's works. The throne-room takes up the left wing of the palace. This unfortunately resembles a rather dreary drawing-room in London or New York, and has no distinctive features except a decorated chair, which is the Hawaiian throne. There is an Hawaiian crown also, neither grand nor costly, but this I have not seen. At present the palace is only used for state receptions and entertainments, for the king is living at his private residence of Haemoeipio, not far off.",

It was a scorching hot day. The cement piles of the expressway shut the sea off like the bars of a prison, but between them I could glimpse it close and blue. The narrow streets of the one or two little villages I passed through on this flat coastal strip were silent and packed with solid black shadows, but the heat bounced wickedly off the open tar road. In the sky real crows flapped, rasping to each other, surveying the stubble in the fields that had been cut, while gray wisps of smoke trailed up from the pale fires burning autumn husks.",

Madam said she didn’t want a through road, only to cross the pass and join the R37 at Zeekoegat. Increased agitation – Madam must turn back! The wardens’ minimal English precluded a reasoned argument but then their baas arrived in a bakkie, a cheerful friendly young Afrikaner – so friendly he seemed out of place hereabouts. I probed and he is out of place; he comes from the Cape, where they breed another sort of Afrikaner. Politely, sympathetically, he told me I’d gone astray: ‘There is no way through for cyclists.’ But he was amenable to reason and soon the barrier was lifted. His final warning: ‘You’re into a homeland on the other side, there’s no hotel, I don’t know where you can sleep.’ It’s odd how many people imagine travellers must sleep in hotels.",

He already had a fairly definite sense of values, and could not delude himself with the idea that dusting a dead woman’s books was, for him or anybody else, a more vital and necessary act than reading them. This was his chance, and he was going to take it. If only he had known better how to! The pressure of this weight of wisdom on his ignorance was suffocating: he felt like a girl Miss Spear had told him about, the girl who was so greedy for gold that she betrayed Rome, and the fellows she betrayed it to despised her so that they crushed her under their golden shields. These books were crushing Vance like that. If only there were some way of climbing the slippery trunk of the Tree which dangled its fruit so far above him!",

This room’s door was off its hinges, the walls didn’t meet the sagging ceiling, all the electric fittings had been removed and both single-bed mattresses were blood- and semen-stained. It was a hot night so Orestes now called upon that Cuban ingenuity and adaptability of which Fidel so often boasts. A youth hurried in with a fan lacking a plug and I watched in horror as he attached it to naked wires protruding from the wall. I hadn’t seen such a contraption since my last visit to India some thirty years previously. Its noise resembled a grinding snore; occasionally it faltered, as though pausing to regain energy, then ground on relentlessly. I considered silencing it by pulling on the frayed flex but feared electrocution. Then, as the over-amplified band began its first number I realised how useful that fan would be, as a toothache is useful in conjunction with gout. Sleep was impossible until the party ended at 4.30 a.m.",

There was some hay on its dry floor, and in this shelter they unpacked their lunch, and comforted themselves with hot coffee. Laura Lou, curling up against the hay in the warmest corner, tossed off her cap, and Vance, stretched out at her feet, watched the sun turn her hair to golden filigree, and her lips to jewels. “Happy?” he queried; and her eyes rained down acquiescence. . . .",

If we removed her from her family, we were condemning her to a life of loneliness and depression. Arguably, she might even die from the trauma. Plus, we know that elephants study and learn from one another. Thus, the next matriarch—the one ‘in waiting’—obviously knew how to break the fence and get into Sabie Park. So no matter where we moved the matriarch, the herd’s next leader would know what to do. Repatriation would, thus, not solve the problem.",

Outside, the wreckage of a jet, crash-landed, lies like a deer being dressed, guts spilling across the rough ground, the flag of former Czechoslovakia on its tail fin.

She had even risen earlier than usual in the execution of her purpose. She had no idea that the sight of her in a grey gown of devotional cut, with her famous lashes drooped above a prayer-book, would put the finishing touch to Mr Gryce’s subjugation, and render inevitable a certain incident which she had resolved should form a part of the walk they were to take together after luncheon. Her intentions in short had never been more definite; but poor Lily, for all the hard glaze of her exterior, was inwardly as malleable as wax. Her faculty for adapting herself, for entering into other people’s feelings, if it served her now and then in small contingencies, hampered her in the decisive moments of life. She was like a water-plant in the flux of the tides, and today the whole current of her mood was carrying her toward Lawrence Selden. Why had he come? Was it to see herself or Bertha Dorset? It was the last question which, at that moment, should have engaged her. She might better have contented herself with thinking that he had simply responded to the despairing summons of his hostess, anxious to interpose him between herself and the ill-humour of Mrs Dorset. But Lily had not rested till she learned from Mrs Trenor that Selden had come of his own accord.",

Ten minutes later the Director (Headmaster) of the school appeared in the doorway, expressed disapproval of a faranj drinking with the peasantry and invited me to be his guest for the night.",
