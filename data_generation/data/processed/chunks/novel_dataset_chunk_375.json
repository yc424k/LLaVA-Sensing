    "target_paragraph": "For a long time she sat blankly contemplating the new world that was coming. Everyone would be trained and efficient but herself. She was not strong enough to earn a living and qualify as a teacher at the same time. The day's work tired her to death. She must hide somewhere. . . . She would not be wanted. ... If you were not wanted. ... If you knew you were not wanted —you ought to get out of the way. Chloroform. Someone had drunk a bottle of carbolic acid. The clock struck ten. Gathering up the newspaper she folded it neatly, put it on the hall table and went slowly upstairs, watching the faint reflection of the half-lowered hall gas upon the polished balustrade. The staircase was cold and airy. Cold rooms and landings stretched up away above her into the darkness. She became aware of a curious buoyancy rising within her. It was so strange that she stood still for a moment on the stair. For a second, life seemed to cease in her and the staircase to be swept from under her feet. . . . \"I'm alive.\" ... It was as if something had struck her, struck right through her impalpable body, sweeping it away, leaving her there shouting silently without it. I'm alive. . . . I'm alive. Then with a thump her heart went on again and her feet carried her body warm and happy and elastic easily on up the solid stairs. She tried once or twice deliberately to bring back the breathless moment standing still on a stair. Each time something of it returned. \"It's me, me; this is me being alive,\" she murmured with a feeling under her like the sudden drop of a lift. But her thoughts distracted her. They were eagerly talking to her declaring that she had had this feeling before. She opened her bedroom door very quietly. The air of the room told her that Nannie and Baddie were asleep. Going lightly across to the chest of drawers dressing-table by the window as if she were treading on air, she stood holding its edge in the darkness. Two forgotten incidents flowed past her in quick succession; one of waking up on her seventh birthday in the seaside villa alone in a small dark room and suddenly saying to herself that one day her father and mother would die and she would still be there, and after a curious moment when the darkness seemed to move against her, feeling very old and crying bitterly, and another of standing in the bow of the dining-room window at Barnes looking at the raindrops falling from the leaves through the sunshine and saying to Eve, who came into the room as she watched, know, Eve, I feel as if I'd suddenly wakened up out of a dream.\" The bedroom was no longer dark. She could see the outlines of everything in the light coming from the street lamps through the half-closed Venetian blinds. Baddie sighed and stirred. Miriam began impatiently preparing for bed without lighting the gas. \"What's the use of feeling like that if it doesn't stay? It doesn't change anything. Next time I'll make it stay. It might whisk me right away. There's something in me that can't be touched or altered. Me. If it comes again. If it's stronger every time. . . . Perhaps it goes on getting stronger till you die.\"",

Everything about it was perfect—not just its setting and execution but also, no less notably, the way it is run today. For a start there was no nagging for money, no “voluntary” admission fee. Outside, there was simply a discreet sign announcing that it cost £700,000 a year to maintain the cathedral and that it was now engaged on a £400,000 renovation project on the east wing and would very much appreciate any money that visitors might spare. Inside, there were two modest collecting boxes and nothing else—no clutter, no nagging notices, no irksome bulletin boards or stupid Eisenhower flags, nothing at all to detract from the unutterable soaring majesty of the interior. It was a perfect day to see it. Sun slanted lavishly through the stained-glass windows, highlighting the stout pillars with their sumptuously grooved patterns and spattering the floors with motes of floating color. There were even wooden pews.",

But he was vague. “Secos, County Line, Malibu. You know.” I didn’t, really, except from the mags and from Steve Painter. We applied ourselves, anyway, to California Street together—the lineups, the locals, the tides, the invisible ribs of rock under the dark kelpy water, all the idiosyncrasies of a long, somewhat tricky wave. Nobody spoke to us, and we found takeoff spots that were intermittent or overlooked and that suited our abilities, so that we could surf without interfering with anyone. But we also studied with fanatical intensity the moves of the top local guys, and discussed them into the night in our bunks in the duplex that my family had started using as a beach house. We got to know a few of their names: Mike Arrambide, Bobby Carlson, Terry Jones. How did Arrambide sideslip through all those middle sections? What was that crazy, quick-step first turn that Carlson did on the drop? Was he really switching stance (going from right-foot-forward to left-foot-forward)? Rich and I were still mastering the basics—clean takeoffs, hard turns, tight trimming, walking the nose—but we had to learn from the big guys because there were few kids our age at California Street, and none, we realized, who surfed better than us.",

He stood there looking at the tree and watched that black abomination of death and hatred sweep upon him like a wave. It soaked first into the deep folds and convolutions of his brain its damnable slime of poison, and then it channeled out its blackened tongues along the veins and arteries of his flesh. It heated and inflamed his brain with a dull, sweltering fire that was like a smear of blood and murder, but all else within the house of the flesh it chilled, froze, and constricted with a reptile’s fangs. It shriveled up his heart in a ring of poisonous ice, it deadened the feeling in his fingers, his flesh withered and turned numb, dead, and sallow-looking, his cheeks were tinged with a greenish hue, his mouth got dry, the tongue was thick and pulpy, the edges of the lips had an acrid and bitter taste, the thighs and buttock felt weak and flabby, the sockets of the knee bent down beneath the body’s weight and felt watery and feeble, the feet and toes grew cold, white, phthisic, the guts got sick, numb, and nauseously queasy, and the loins which once had leaped and quivered with a music of joy and life, under the poisonous and constricting fury grew sterile, sour, and dry.",

For a few of their dances they asked us to join in, but we were all too timid, until Bill stood up gamely and did a fair imitation of their moves. His hiking boots slowed him down a little, but still he looked admirable, striding on his long legs and concentrating to get the steps right. Chukchi girls dancing with a telephone lineman from California is a sight seen almost never, and then not more than once. For a moment the dancing caused the entire room to come into focus—the floors of bare wood, the beige curtains with their decorative pattern of cattail plants, and the cold silver radiators along the walls.",

Taxes used to be levied according to frontage, so the old houses of Kyoto tend to have narrow street entrances, and stretch far back into the interior of the block. The building’s paper-and-wood sliding doors had been removed for summer, and replaced with doors made of reeds, sudare (bamboo blinds) and gauze hangings – all more or less transparent. As we walked through the house, the blinds and hangings revealed ever-changing vistas, with room after room, separated by gardens, disappearing into the distance. On the floor were blue Nabeshima rugs, each the size of one tatami mat.",

Her own stout person and its surrounding implements took up so much room that Lily, to pass her, had to gather up her skirts and brush against the wall. As she did so, the woman paused in her work and looked up curiously, resting her clenched red fists on the wet cloth she had just drawn from her pail.

A six-foot barrier and locked gates allowed no access to the four deserted platforms. A tall, slim young woman wearing a smart sky-blue uniform labelled ‘Security Service (Private)’, guesstimated that the Santiago especiale might leave at 5.00-ish. She and her three colleagues appeared to be in lieu of a police presence. Watching them, I again noted the cold, almost disdainful persona assumed by many Cuban petty officials (including staff in government tiendas) when dealing with the public. Is this attitude, so unlike the average Cuban’s relaxed friendliness, a result of Soviet training? Or is it a symptom of the tension that has come to exist between frustrated citizens and agencies now often despised as corrupt?",

The plaster, gnawed away by winds laden with searching sea-moisture, had fallen to earth, exposing the underlying masonry of cheap construction whose rusty colour was the same as that of the ground from which it had arisen, and into which it now seemed ready and eager to descend. Everything useful or portable, everything that spoke of man's occupation, everything that suggested life and comfort—the porcelain tiles, woodwork, window-panes, roofings, mosaic or marble floors, leaden pipes—all this had been carried away long ago. It stood there stark, dismantled, de-humanized, in the midday heat. Here was nothing to charm the eye or conjure up visions of past glory; nothing elegant or romantic; nothing savouring of grim warlike purposes. It was a modern ruin; a pile of rubbish; a shameless, frivolous skeleton. Those hastily built walls and staring windows wore an air of faded futility, almost of indecency—as though the mouldering bones of some long-forgotten lady of pleasure had crept out of their tomb to give themselves an airing in the sunshine.",

The moon was still in the sky, pale and bloodless. Somewhere in the thin blue beyond the range of eyesight a plane cracked and re-cracked the sound-barrier and sent a wave of thunder flowing over the hills. ‘Bombs?’ said Sabri comfortably – in the warmth and contentment of that perfect morning it was impossible to make such a word sound any different from the word ‘lizards’ or ‘wildflowers’. Panos turned and yawned. Our own silence surrounded us like a cocoon, softly woven by the briny air which climbed the hot dunes to stir the breathing shadows under the carobs. ‘Summer is beginning,’ said a Turkish youth, wiping the sweat from his dark brows with the end of a coloured headcloth. It was quite an effort to tear ourselves away from these warm dunes and follow the little signpost which said ‘Klepini’, but Panos’ thirst for cyclamens was not to be denied, and so we reluctantly turned the little car off the main road and began the slow ascent upon the less kindly surface of the village road.",

The crews of the three boats sat and waited in their cockpits, engines revving, our fates resting on the holding power of our anchors. There was no solace knowing that the worst was almost over, that we were right on the leading edge of the front and we would be reprieved when the wind would slacken to 25 knots within hours. Beaching was one of the possibilities that I contemplated sitting in the cockpit. Just one bit of bad luck, one weak piece of gear between the three boats and it would be all over. A beached boat under $150,000 on a remote Bahama island is pretty much a lost cause, a financial write off. It has no salvage value except for the parts that can be cannibalized or plundered.",

It is a small, typical New England college town, pleasant, sedate, and compact, full of old trees and sunny steeples.

Nearly everyone in town is within a level, easy stroll of the post office, library, and stores.",
