In the flesh, gaijin might strike many Japanese as freakish, foul-smelling and crude; but as symbols—of prosperity and progress—they possessed a glamour to which few Japanese were immune. Thus blue-eyed blondes were still much sought after for commercials and regarded almost as trophies—walking advertisements for the Good Life—to be shown off to the neighbors, even as they were giggled at by schoolgirls and inspected by toddlers with fearful fascination.",

Oh, what have I done?” she whispered, shuddering to her pillow; and pressing her face against it to shut out the pale landscape beyond the window she lay in the darkness straining her ears, and shaking at every foot-step that approached….",

The Signoria does not understand in the least. So with a strange, slightly malignant triumph, the men sing all the verses of their song, sitting round the walls of the little parlour. Their throats move, their faces have a slight mocking smile. The boy capers in the doorway like a faun, with glee, his straight black hair falling over his forehead. The elder brother sits straight and flushed, but even his eyes glitter with a kind of yellow light of laughter. Paolo also sits quiet, with the invisible smile on his face.'

    "target_paragraph": "My aunts, uncles, and abuelita used to reside in the Los Laureles division of the King Ranch in a long block of yellow brick houses. They drove big trucks, ate red meat, drank Miller beer, and wore cowboy hats with cowboy boots and gleaming belt buckles. They felt great security knowing that when they retired, they’d be cared for. But in the late 1980s, King’s descendants brought in some outside business executives to run the ranch, and within a few years it became another slice in America’s corporate pie, with people rating second to profits. After discovering that a helicopter could do the work of dozens of cowboys at roundup, for instance, the ranch invested in one—causing the Kineños to scramble for ways to justify their employment. Those who couldn’t were fired. Rent was also imposed for the first time, including on retirees, at prices few could afford. Within a decade, my entire family had moved off the ranch and taken jobs at places like Wal-Mart to get by.",

    "target_paragraph": "The proper use of a clinometer relies more on good eyes and a little patience than any technical finesse, but great layout skills develop only over time and miles. Even one sharp set of eyes can put in a rough flag line, but the best trail layout is a team effort, a mutual plod over downed logs and wet bog and around bedrock outcroppings, talking in call and response: a little uphill, aw, shit, there’s that spring, try there, okay now over, we need a grade reversal soon, think we can make the pass at 10 percent? Then, return the next day, the next week, or the next season, and you realize it needs to change. You shot too steep and hit the cliff band that you meant to stay below. Ground that was dry in September is wet in the spring, requiring turnpike. There’s a beaver dam, an old-growth tree, a big swale that would need to be bridged because the topography is too steep on either side for contouring. Good trail layout requires that you care enough to keep pounding the same stretch of ground long after it’s good enough has occurred to you, and at the same time that you remain sufficiently divested so you can scrap a plan for a better one.",

Indeed Bellapaix on that radiant spring morning looked like a back-drop for Comus. The great church-doors stood open upon the rich shadowy interior with its one coloured window which stained the flags with a splash as of spilt wine. Footsteps and voices echoing in the musty interior. We paused to buy a farthing dip before examining the icons in the little chancel. ‘The church is still in use,’ explained my guide, ‘and that gives the whole ruin life. It’s something more than just an antiquity. It is the village church, my church – and indeed your own since you are coming to live here.’ Out­side in the courtyard lay the familiar branches of green laurel which would later make incense for the villagers. On the breath­less silence of the cool air came the small sounds of the village which later I could identify exactly, attaching to each the name of a friend: Michaelis’ bees burring among the blossoms, Andreas’ pigeons murmuring; the sharp knocking and planing from Loizus’ little carpentry shop; the rumble of an olive-drum being rolled along the street by Anthemos to where a bus waited; the high clear voice of Lalou singing to the dirge of the spindle … They existed for me as sounds without orchestra­tion or meaning, not more human than the whistle of swifts below the Abbey, or the distant whirr of a motor-car spinning down the white ribbon of road below.",

I mean, as soon as he got Narcissa pregnant, which must have been pretty quick, he was back in the car again until this time Colonel Sartoris himself stepped into the breach, who hated cars yet gave up his carriage and pair to let Bayard drive him back and forth to the bank, to at least slow the car down during that much of the elapsed mileage. Except that Colonel Sartoris had a heart condition, so when the wreck came it was him that died: Bayard just walked out of the crash and disappeared, abandoned pregnant wife and all, until the next spring when he was still trying to relieve his boredom by seeing how much faster he could make something travel than he could invent a destination for; this time another aeroplane: a new experimental type at the Dayton testing field: only this one fooled him by shedding all four of its wings in midair.",

In the end he was taken unawares by the out-rush of the rabble.

So, barricading every opening, the old man sat down sternly in the middle of the darkened café with an old shotgun on his knees.

The horses strange to say hardly cared at all, only mildly shying as August drove them slowly along without stopping.\n\n'That's all right,' I remarked, greatly relieved, to Gertrud, who still held her stocking.

The lines of the surrounding mountains were blurred, the air was moistly warm and it might have been the sort of August day on which one wanders through Irish fields absorbed in this same cosy adventure. Then thudding hoofs broke the stillness and some forty young horses came galloping towards me from behind a eucalyptus grove. Three lads followed, riding bareback on mules and exuding curiosity about my eccentric behaviour. None of them spoke English, but it was easy to explain that mushrooms are a faranj delicacy. They stared at me, appalled – then hastily dismounted, the better to dissuade me from eating the lethal growth. It seems strange that a people with such limited food resources should never have discovered that certain fungi are edible – though no stranger than the Aran Islanders’ ignorance of the edibility of watercress. However, by eating half-a-dozen mushrooms on the spot I convinced the boys that faranjs are immune to the poison.",

Nevertheless, during the early years of my childhood, being bilingual felt more like I had a cool party trick up my sleeve, rather than a useful and advantageous skill. It was only years later, as I started growing up, that I realized what a wonderful gift my parents had given me by striving to bring me up as a bilingual, and eventually multilingual, child.",

He was incapable of comprehending a world unfolding by its own volition, beyond his control. For a quarter century, since the loss of his young wife, he had served with absolute devotion a single cause: military victory over a foe that had ravaged his homeland and denied him the innocence of youth, drowning his childhood in rivers of bile and hatred. His fate and that of the revolutionary cause were as one, each incapable, in his mind, of surviving on its own.

But soon a derelict concrete cowshed appeared, covering a flat ledge by the river, and I half-carried Luke down the rough slope. The shed was uninviting, its floor strewn with broken glass and malodorous discarded garments; gloomily I cleared a space and spread my flea-bag on the damp mildewed straw.",

(Beggars can’t be choosers and Cuba’s Roman Catholic church is well behind in the popularity ratings.) The teenagers walked abreast, slowly, followed by the celebrant holding one little girl by the hand and two tall thin youths in white surplices, swinging censers. Meanwhile many worshippers were accompanying a children’s choir in rousing hymns. Back on the altar, the celebrant led the other little girl to a nursery-size armchair opposite the wheel-chair, but in a position of equal honour – and there she sat, alone and motionless, for the next hour, looking rather complacent. I tried, but failed, to imagine Zea in this role.",

As a proud, patriotic people, some Dutch were unhappy with the thought that their local shop might stop selling traditional Dutch food and hire staff who couldn’t speak the local language. The values the Dutch saw as the bedrock of their national identity – gay rights, gender equality – were unfortunately anathema to some of those who were now their neighbours. Many Muslims, for example, believed that women’s hair should be covered in public, but lived in a country where prostitutes stood naked behind red-lit windows without attracting a second glance. Newspapers reported cases such as that of a boy taken from his Turkish family by the Dutch authorities and placed in the care of lesbian foster parents, prompting vociferous protests from some in the Turkish community.",
