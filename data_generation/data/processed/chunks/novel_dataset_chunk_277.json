Grand staircases swept heavenward to more balconies. Long, long corridors led through unlit hallways that led into long, long corridors. The main hall, in which a few ragtag bands of nomads were camped, forked this way and that, into a garden courtyard, a nursery, a checkroom, a puzzle of bleak entrances.",

If they thought as he did, if they saw what he did, they never mentioned it; and to have things which are precious to one eternally unmentioned makes one, he had long discovered, lonely. These August nights, for instance—quite remarkably and unusually beautiful, warm and velvety as he had never known them, ushered in each evening by the most astonishing variety of splendid sunsets—nobody had said a single word about them. They might have been February ones, for all the notice they got. Sometimes he climbed up to the top of Burdon Down towards evening, and stood staring in amazement at what looked like heaven let loose in flames over England; but always he stood alone, always there was no one but himself up there, and no one afterwards, when he descended from his heights, seemed to be aware that anything unusual had been going on. As far as Alice was concerned, and she was the person he saw most closely, God needn’t have bothered to fill the year with magnificence, or invent a single sunset. For her the hedges in May foamed with white sweetness, and the buttercups turned the fields to glory, in vain. On her the wonder of the first real spring morning was lost. While as for when the daffodils trooped out in March and took possession of the world, she saw in this recurring miracle merely a sign that lamb would now be in season, and hastened to order it, roast, for their Sunday dinner.",

They’ve made the bed with the new blue sheets and left the terrace door open to the sound of cuckoos and wild canaries in the linden trees. We pick the last of the pink roses on the front terrace and fill two old Chianti bottles with them. The shuttered room with its whitewashed walls, just-waxed floors, pristine bed with new sheets, and sweet roses on the windowsill, all lit with a dangling forty-watt bulb, seems as pure as a Franciscan cell.

    "target_paragraph": "The altitude of this great table-land is 2500 feet, and the air is never too hot, the temperature averaging 64° Fahrenheit. There is mist or rain on most days of the year for a short time, and the mornings and evenings are clear and cool. The long sweeping curves of the three great Hawaiian mountains spring from this level. The huge bulk of Mauna Kea without shoulders or spurs, rises directly from the Waimea level on the south to the altitude of 14,000 feet, and his base is thickly clustered with tufa-cones of a bright red colour, from 300 to 1000 feet in height. Considerably further back, indeed forty miles away, the smooth dome of Mauna Loa appears very serene now, but only thirteen years ago the light was so brilliant, from one of its tremendous eruptions, that here it was possible to read a newspaper by it, and during its height candles were unnecessary in the evenings! Nearer the coast, and about thirty miles from here, is the less conspicuous dome of the dead volcano of Hualalai. If all Hawaii, south of Waimea, were submerged to a depth of 8000 feet, three nearly equidistant, dome-shaped volcanic islands would remain, the highest of which would have an altitude of 6000 feet. To the south of these plains violent volcanic action is everywhere apparent, not only in tufa-cones, but in tracts of ashes, scoriæ, and volcanic sand. Near the centre there are some very curious caves, possibly \"lava-bubbles,\" which were used by the natives as places of sepulture. The Kohala hills, picturesque, wooded, and abrupt, bound Waimea on the north, with exquisite grassy slopes, and bring down an abundance of water to the plain, but owing to the lightness of the soil and the evaporation produced by the tremendous winds, the moisture disappears within two miles of the hills, and an area of rich soil, ten miles by twelve, which, if irrigated, would be invaluable, is nothing but a worthless dusty desert, perpetually encroaching on the grass. As soon as the plains slope towards the east, the vegetation of the tropics reappears, and the face of the country is densely covered with a swampy and impenetrable bush hardly at all explored, which shades the sources of the streams which fall into the Waipio and Waimanu Valleys, and is supposed to contain water enough to irrigate the Saharas of leeward Hawaii.",

Three meagrely stocked shoe-shops on Centro’s main business streets offered only fragile high-heeled sandals (gold or pink), made in China. ‘You’ll have to go barefoot,’ threatened Clodagh. But it was fourth time lucky: the manager of a small shop was unpacking a consignment of sturdy brown leather sandals made in Brazil, price CP21. ‘Now you can give your trainers to some poor person,’ said Clodagh. But in Cuba there are no people poor enough to make such a malodorous donation acceptable. Moreover, those trainers had both monetary and sentimental value: I had bought them for US$60 in Severobaiskal, my favourite Siberian town. Granted, they were distressingly unsuited to a hot humid climate but I reckoned they might well outlive me and should be left with our winter garments in No. 403 for collection on the way home.",

Some have blamed it on the war, some on the tempo of the time, some have called it “a jazz age” and suggested that men should meet the rhythm of the age and move and live by it; but although this notion has been fashionable, it can hardly recommend itself to men who have been driven by their hunger, who have known loneliness and exile, who have wandered upon the face of the earth and found no doors that they could enter, and who would to God now that they might make an end to all their wandering and loneliness, that they might find one home and heart of all their hunger where they could live abundantly forever. Such men, and they are numbered not by thousands but by millions, are hardly prepared to understand that the agony and loneliness of the human spirit may be assuaged by the jerky automata of jazz.",

Our camels, from the outset, had adopted an air of endearing ignorance, but plodded into the thorny branches with suspiciously precise direction, causing the needles to slash across our cheeks, adding insult to already injured, sunburnt skin. Just as my throat had become so dry that I could barely croak up enough saliva to form words of complaint, we arrived at the dunes. A shack was waiting, which looked from afar like a haystack thatched with blankets. Santa had already visited, leaving a hessian sack of Kingfishers and Pepsi bottles covered in rapidly melting ice. Passepartout and Steve took a couple of beers and clambered onto the top of a dune to watch the beetles embroidering the sand with their tracks. ‘I used to be a Sunday-school teacher …’ drifted down as they walked away.",

Walking down the street outside the Rijksmuseum, one was still as likely to hear English, Spanish, French or Chinese being spoken as Dutch, and for a Dutch person to speak three or even four languages was considered entirely normal. (I once saw a promotional survey seeking to drum up publicity for a language school in the Netherlands that included three options: ‘My English is OK / Great / Fantastic.’) The home of Rembrandt and Vermeer remained proud of its status as a global leader in design and architecture, even if boutique bicycles and chairs had replaced oil paintings as the creative output of choice. In a country where the Prime Minister cycled to work and the wealthy paid high taxes without complaint, one could perhaps even detect enduring traces of the guiding philosophy of the Golden Age: that one had a duty to work hard, but that gains should be invested for the common good.",

It had a gate, cabins, picnic shelters, and washroom conveniences best left undiscussed. Its strewn heaps of trash were extreme, even for Russia. Somebody who saw this campground without context or explanation might come to the conclusion that a group of confused people had mistakenly gone on vacation at the town dump. The woman who ran the resort had been driven to a near frenzy by how awful it was. We discovered this when Sergei invited her to have tea with us after supper, and she told us, with great drama and forcefulness and scorching irony, about the difficulties of her job. By one o’clock her monologue had worn me out and I retired to my tent. Sergei had to evict her bodily at two thirty. At an even later hour than that, when he and Volodya were again off somewhere, I came awake to a loud conversation between two passing drunks who were debating whether to do something or other—I did not recognize the verb—to our tents. Fortunately, the milder of the drunks prevailed after a while and they went away. Cars then blasted up and down the resort’s dirt lanes for an hour or so, blowing their horns. Just after dawn, the Big Brother–like speakers of the public-address system wired to nearby trees began playing bad music from many different cultures while exhorting everyone to get up and exercise.",

They were about to disperse, when a smart footstep, entering the porch and coming up the central passage, arrested their attention. The step echoed with a ring unusual in a church; it was the clink of spurs. Everybody looked. A young cavalry soldier in a red uniform, with three chevrons of a sergeant upon his sleeve, strode up the aisle, with an embarrassment which was only the more accented by the intense vigour of his step, and by the determination upon his face to show none. A slight flush had mounted his cheek by the time he had run the gauntlet between these females; but, passing on through the chancel arch, he never paused till he came close to the altar railing. Here for a moment he stood alone.",

Juana was then close to the tent and I moved her because she likes to investigate everything as we pack up. Ten minutes later Rachel noticed that she was loose – and grazing towards the track. We advanced cautiously, but she reached the track first and there the sound of the picket rattling behind her on the hard ground sent her galloping, panic-stricken, towards Huamachuco. (Just laugh at anyone who tells you mules can’t gallop.) We also began to gallop, no less panic-stricken, but soon discovered that at approximately 11,000 feet walking and galloping are two quite different activities. As Juana disappeared over the hill I ordered Rachel back to guard the camp and trotted in pursuit – being quite overwhelmed, despite my anxiety, by the beauty of that dawn. To the west a long rock mountain was suddenly pure gold, while the rest of our world remained green-brown bog below and pale grey cloud above.",

In the pecking match, the red’s greater weight and strength evened up for his lack of a leg and a wing. He managed to give as good as he got. But suddenly his cracked beak broke off, leaving only the lower half. A large bubble of blood rose where the beak had been. The red didn’t retreat an inch, but made a great effort to get into the air once more. Using its one leg skillfully, it managed to rise six or seven inches from the ground, not enough, however, to get its spurs into play. Juju went up with him and got well above, then drove both gaffs into the red’s breast. Again one of the steel needles stuck.",

There was my mackintosh, and I also had galoshes, but I could not appear before Frau von Eckthum in the sponge bag, and yet that was the only sensible covering for my head. But what after all could galoshes avail in such a flood? The stubble field, I felt, could be nothing by then but a lake; no fire could live in it; no stove but would be swamped. Were it not better, if such was to be the weather, to return to London, take rooms in some water-tight boarding-house, and frequent the dryness of museums? Of course it would be better. Better? Must not anything in the world be better than that which is the worst?",

Generally they are presented as true. And always they make Queenslanders look like pricks. Most suggest that Queenslanders are just crazy, and the evidence does rather point in that direction. For almost two decades the state was under the control of Joh Bjelke-Peterson, an eccentric, right-wing state premier who at one time seriously entertained the notion of blowing up parts of the Great Barrier Reef with small atomic bombs to create shipping channels. Of late it had gained fame as the seat of a politician named Pauline Hanson, a fish-and-chips shop owner who had started a right-wing, anti-immigration party called One Nation, which had had a spell of striking success before it became evident even to her most ardent followers that Ms. Hanson was a little, shall we say, cerebrally singular. She wrote a book in which she suggested that Aborigines engaged in cannibalism, and produced an interestingly paranoid video which began, “Fellow Australians, if you are seeing me now it means I have been murdered.” Her seat was the Brisbane suburb of Oxley, which inspired some genius to dub her the Oxley moron. In a word, Queensland has a reputation for being a place apart. I couldn’t wait to get there.",

The appletrees still remained to show where the garden had been, the oldest of them even now retaining the crippled slant to north-east given them by the great November gale of I824 which carried a brig bodily over the Chesil Bank.* They were at present bent to still greater obliquity by the heaviness of their produce. Apples bobbed against his head, and in the grass beneath he crunched scores of them as he walked. There was nobody to gather them now.",

They had a spokesman; afterward Sam Fathers told Major de Spain how all during the past summer and fall they had drifted into the camp singly or in pairs and threes, to look quietly at Lion for a while and then go away: “Mawnin, Major.

They left abruptly, after a terrific quarrel with the old Cracker who ran the place, who thought himself tricked out of the best part of a season’s rent, and hurried off to South Carolina on receipt of a hysterical message from Daisy which bade her mother to ‘come at once.’ They arrived in the dingy little town, which was sticky with wet clay, and clammy with rain, in late March: Daisy’s first child, a boy, had been born the day before. Eliza, annoyed at what she considered the useless disruption of her holiday, quarrelled bitterly with her daughter a day or two after her arrival, and departed for Altamont with the declaration, which Daisy ironically applauded, that she would never return again. But she did.",

My friend Ira, another Russian I met through the co-ops in Austin, invited me there one night with a group of her friends. None of us were gay, but everyone seemed eager to go, including the guys (and not one whispered, “Pretend you’re my girlfriend,” as we walked through the door). Homosexuality was actually fairly accepted in Russia throughout much of her history. Some aristocratic and imperial family members led fairly open gay or bisexual lifestyles, and homosexuality was often the subject of bawdy jokes, shocking many a European diplomat during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The closet door shut under the influence of Western missionaries in the eighteenth century, but the Bolsheviks opened it back up—only to have it slammed again by Stalin. He recriminalized consensual sex between men soon after taking power and sentenced thousands of gay men to prison terms of five to eight years apiece. (I never found much research on the historical plight of lesbians, though—perhaps because, as my lesbian friend Laima joked, the thought of two women choosing each other over a muzhik was too unfathomable to Stalin to make a policy about it.)",
