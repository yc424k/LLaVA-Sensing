On his head he carried a shallow bowl of human ashes. Slowly, reverently, he made his way down the steps, then jumped into one of the two boats tied at the bottom. Walking to the far end, he cast off and waited for the dinghy to drift into the current. When he was out in the flow he gently tipped the ashes into the river, like King Arthur returning Excalibur to the lake. For a moment the white ash swirled milky on the surface, then it sank; only the black charcoal floated. Circling slowly in the eddies, it was gently swept off downstream towards the Ganga.",

Key West had become important to the Cuba Libre movement after the Ten Years War when the clandestine Cuba Convention began to organise another armed uprising. The Convention’s leaders were war veterans; its members were academics, businessmen and professionals with a leavening of factory workers. As this Cuban colony donated more than its share to help buy weapons, boats and supplies, the burning of its cigar factories and colossal tobacco warehouse seriously depleted Cuba Libre’s coffers. Before the fire, at a fund-raising meeting in a packed San Carlos Hall, even the lowest-paid workers eagerly donated dollars and ladies impulsively unpinned brooches from their bosoms and slid rings off their fingers. One American, Colonel F.N. Wicker, Key West’s Collector of Customs, contributed US$100 (then an enormous sum) to ‘strengthen the sinews of war’ – in defiance of the official US façade of ‘neutrality’. Next day the Spanish Consul informed Washington, by telephone, and the day after Colonel Wicker was sacked – also by telephone.",

The Indian connection provided a hint of glamour, and no doubt the presence of that mighty possession over the horizon offered the British some reassurance of security. How could their supremacy in the eastern seas be shaken, with such a power around the corner? It was in India that the colony raised its first military force – the Hong Kong Regiment, recruited in 1890 among Pathans, Punjabis and Bengalis, and uniformed dashingly in gold, scarlet, blue, and red stripes. When in 1941 the Japanese attacked Hong Kong, Rajput troops bore the brunt of their first assault, and a band of the Jaipur Guards welcomed the Governor back from imprisonment when all was over.",

In Sigalla, at the Sunny Days Palma de Mirette, on a dusty road miles from anywhere, we were stopped at the door by two hard-nosed security guards. One held out his hand and stood between us and the lobby. He demanded, in Russian, to know our business, and asked for our room number.",

She was wearing a nightdress and a frightening array of hair curlers, and she said something cross to me about, I guess, the lateness of the hour. I tried to explain things but she was looking at me as if I had brought shame into her home, and I gave up. She showed me to my room, her slippers flopping ahead of me down the hall. Her sons were also in there, fast asleep. My bed was an upper bunk. Suddenly $5 seemed like a lot of money. She shut the door and plodded off.",

Perhaps it was reading of Edward Thomas’s walking tours, and looking at Palmer’s mystical canvases.

Certainly, it was Roger’s influence, and the glimpse into the gryke in the Burren: that miniature wildwood, no more than an arm’s-length long and a hand’s-span wide. Whatever the combination of causes, I had started to refocus. I was becoming increasingly interested in this understanding of wildness not as something which was hived off from human life, but which existed unexpectedly around and within it: in cities, backyards, roadsides, hedges, field boundaries or spinnies.",

Mamun stayed at Merv, and in 816 he summoned thither the eighth Imam of the Shiahs, Ali-ar-Riza of Medina, whom he proclaimed heir to the Caliphate. But two years later the Imam also died at Tus, while accompanying Mamun on a visit to his father’s grave. In orthodox doctrine, he died of a surfeit of grapes. But the Shiahs believe Mamun poisoned him. In any case he was buried next to Harun-al-Rashid, and his tomb became, after that of Ali at Nejef, the holiest place in the Shiah world.",

Under the thick plate of green water, glazed in their self-centred world, fish swam – gold, splashed with white, streaked with black or silver. Silently they manœuvred in their water world, poised in the blue patch made by the sky, or shot silently to the edge where the grass, trembling, made a fringe of nodding shadow. On the water-pavement spiders printed their delicate feet. A grain fell and spiralled down; a petal fell, filled and sank. At that the fleet of boat-shaped bodies paused; poised; equipped; mailed; then with a waver of undulation off they flashed.",

Having had one bad night with insects, we next choose to pitch our tents far out on a gravel point, on a dry part of the riverbed, two hundred yards from the nearest blade of vegetation, confident that the water will not rise, and preferring anyway to be drowned outright than consumed piecemeal. The instant the bows touch shore, mosquitoes in grosses try to settle upon us. As we finish putting up the tents, a light rain begins to spit. The sky is slate gray in the east. We are camped on an island, and we fish the slough that goes behind it. Nothing there but six-inch grayling. Kauffmann and I try to walk around the island, but it is bigger than we imagined. Moreover, the beach runs out some distance down the slough. Plowing on through dense willow and alder, soaking wet, we give up the circumambulation and traverse the island to return to camp. We see wolf tracks seven inches long—amazing size, but there is a tape measure in my pocket and that is what it says. Less than a yard separates one set of prints from another—the tracks of a slow loper. Earlier in the day, fishing by the mouth of the Kallarichuk tributary, we saw wolf tracks intricately intertwined with the tracks of a running moose. There were changes of direction, overlapping circles. No other sign. The calligraphy seemed to report some unresolved encounter—unless two extremely odd animals had been through there at different times. Now, after dinner, in light rain, we look upriver and see a cow moose walk out of willows. She drinks from the river. She stands, for a while, immobile, and stares across the water. Slowly, she retreats into the thicket. Moose are so numerous now in this part of northwest Alaska that it is difficult to imagine them absent, but they have been here scarcely fifty years. The patterns of other creatures—the bear, the fish, the caribou—run in long cycles over time, cycles of waxing, cycles of waning; but they have been in the region for ten thousand years, and when they have locally been gone for a time they have always returned. In the case of the moose, though, there is no evidence that they were ever here before the early part of this century, and now they are established in the milieu and in the native economy.",

Each still remained almost whole, and, as if to catch the falling drop, Clarissa (crossing to the dressing-table) plunged into the very heart of the moment, transfixed it, there—the moment of this June morning on which was the pressure of all the other mornings, seeing the glass, the dressing-table, and all the bottles afresh, collecting the whole of her at one point (as she looked into the glass), seeing the delicate pink face of the woman who was that very night to give a party; of Clarissa Dalloway; of herself.",

In this meditative walk his foot met the floor with heel and toe simultaneously, and his fine, reddish-fleshed face was bent downward just enough to render obscure the still mouth and the well-rounded though rather prominent and broad chin. A few clear and thread-like horizontal lines were the only interruption to the otherwise smooth surface of his large forehead.",

Most of his time, during the months since George’s death, had been spent in endless aimless wanderings up and down the streets of Paris: and that day, descending early from Montmartre, he had noticed in his listless way that all the buildings on his way were fluttering with American flags. The fact left him indifferent: Paris was always decorating nowadays for one ally or another. Then he remembered that it must be the Fourth of July; but the idea of the Fourth of July came to him, through the same haze of indifference, as a mere far-off childish memory of surreptitious explosions and burnt fingers. He strolled on toward the Tuileries, where he had got into the way of sitting for hours at a time, looking across the square at what had once been George’s window.",

Nouris matched it, and we did the movement in synchronicity. Another cheer resounded from the crowd.

We film faces etched with hardship and creased with sun, and bow-shaped bodies with bandy legs carrying all their possessions in small shoulder bags. At a dusty windswept dune Vivek helps a solitary sadhu put up a tarp for shade. Sharp raven eyes peer beneath an orange turban and a brown and pink jumper clashes with his hemp-stained beard. Carbooterwallah (Pigeon Man) invites us to call him Bum Bum (which is the chant he makes to Shiva when he offers him the first toke of the hash chillum). Bum Bum’s worldly goods are a painted tree stump shaped like Shiva’s bull Nandi, a trident, a blanket, some tractor oil and a small table decorated with plastic gods, cobras and alarm clocks.",

The howling sandstorm rendered walking along the narrow ridge almost impossible, engulfing us in a dense cloud of, golden sand particles which felt razor-sharp on exposed skin. The gale-force winds roared furiously from all sides, ramming into us, imperiously demanding we get off this 600-metre mega-dune at once. Ignoring the angry storm and balancing precariously on the spine of this gigantic, shifting monster, our team of twelve women carried on resolutely, carefully putting one foot in front of the other. As we advanced in close formation, trying in vain to use the person in front of us as a human shield, I realized we had no choice but to keep moving forward. If we turned back, we would simply find ourselves in the same impossible predicament. Squinting through my goggles while battling with the straps of my backpack, which were flapping wildly in the wind and whipping my face, I said a silent prayer that the next gust of wind wouldn’t hurl us off this sandy mountain.",

She had everything ready – her ladyship’s coat, skirt, and the bag with the ticket in it. It was long past eleven. She stood at the dressing-table waiting. The three-folded mirror reflected silver pots, powder puffs, combs and brushes. Baxter stooped down and smirked at herself in the glass – that was how she would look when she went up the river – then she drew herself up; she heard footsteps in the passage. Her ladyship was coming. Here she was.",

Instead they were being hyper-active, the old familiar faces joined now by (among many others) the Cold Warriors, adding their ideological poisons to an already unwholesome political brew. The harm done during the colonial era has been hideously compounded by the harm done since. To me the ultimate symbols of neo-colonialism were those giant pylons seen marching across Malawi. They march from A to B for the benefit of donor countries and their venal Black allies. Below them crouch countless villages where children do their homework by firelight.",

Heavily armed police were now on the streets, curfews had been imposed and a ban on alcohol, the dreaded, so-called 'dry day' which can often last a week, was in force. Kirsty's attempts to leave the hotel to undertake some solo exploration in my absence, were met by a strict refusal from hotel security. She was confined to the hotel's garden with a book, whilst I rode out my fever in our room, and chanting mobs burned effigies in the streets outside.",

I had cranked the landing gear just to be helpful. Then since he was the one who broke the part and with plenty of time still available on his log, looking into a repair had been Romeo’s duty. Even if he’d turned it over to me and retired to the bunk, when I reported back that the repair had to wait until morning Romeo still could have gone ballistic, overeager as he was to get back for his solo run. Result? The same. Moreover, Wayne had laughed as if he took the whole thing as a joke. I got the impression he took my concerns as being merely those of a persnickety female.

To stay truly warm, said owner would soak his kilt in water at night, wring it out, and then sleep in the sodden mess. The idea was that cocooned like this, the material was warmer because the fibres would swell and keep out the wind. How the entire male population of ancient Scotland did not die of hypothermia, or how their sperm counts were not reduced to zero from this practice, is a mystery the videos do not explore. It does, however, explain where whiskey came from and why they drink so much of it because only in an inebriated stupor could a sane person wrap themselves in wet, cold wool. I wonder if the Pictish Blue that the Scots are said to have painted themselves in battle was not the actual colour of their skin from a night of this. The shop attendants are no help in alleviating my ignorance on the point. I entertain myself further by going through the racks to try and find the cheapest clan to belong to is (never solved) and marvel at the children’s complete kilt outfits that go for £1,000.",
