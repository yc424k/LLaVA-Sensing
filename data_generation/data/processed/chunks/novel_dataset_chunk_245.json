She repeated it a third time. Mrs Paley heard, but she did not understand. She was apparently about to repeat it for the fourth time, when Rachel suddenly said something inarticulate, and disappeared down the corridor. This misunderstanding, which involved a complete block in the passage, seemed to her unbearable. She walked quickly and blindly in the opposite direction, and found herself at the end of a cul-de-sac. There was a window, and a table and a chair in the window, and upon the table stood a rusty inkstand, an ash-tray, an old copy of a French newspaper, and a pen with a broken nib. Rachel sat down, as if to study the French newspaper, but a tear fell on the blurred French print, raising a soft blot. She lifted her head sharply, exclaiming aloud, ‘It’s intolerable!’ Looking out of the window with eyes that would have seen nothing even had they not been dazed by tears, she indulged herself at last in violent abuse of the entire day. It had been miserable from start to finish; first, the service in the chapel; then luncheon; then Evelyn; then Miss Allan; then old Mrs Paley blocking up the passage. All day long she had been tantalized and put off. She had now reached one of those eminences, the result of some crisis, from which the world is finally displayed in its true proportions. She disliked the look of it immensely—churches, politicians, misfits, and huge impostures—men like Mr Dalloway, men like Mr Bax, Evelyn and her chatter, Mrs Paley blocking up the passage. Meanwhile the steady beat of her own pulse represented the hot current of feeling that ran down beneath; beating, struggling, fretting. For the time, her own body was the source of all the life in the world, which tried to burst forth here—there—and was repressed now by Mr Bax, now by Evelyn, now by the imposition of ponderous stupidity, the weight of the entire world. Thus tormented, she would twist her hands together, for all things were wrong, all people stupid. Vaguely seeing that there were people down in the garden beneath she represented them as aimless masses of matter, floating hither and thither, without aim except to impede her. What were they doing, those other people in the world?",

Treading the old paths seems to reduce the complexities of life, as if he has stepped into an archetype or allegory: track, forest, moon, traveller. He wanders far afield, even in heavy rain. Mostly the rain calms him because it deprives him of context. It desirably subtracts some part of him, taking away from him ‘everything except the power to walk under the dark trees, to enjoy as humbly as the hissing grass’. Mostly, the ‘tender loveliness’ of his favourite landscapes offers compensations for his own lacks. At times, though – at the worst times – nature’s beauty and exuberance feel to him like accusations. ‘I am not a part of nature. I am alone. There is nothing else in my world but my dead heart and brain within me and the rain without.’ What he has come to understand, painfully, is that one may too easily take the natural world as companion, friend and salve. Nature can cure but it can also be brutally mute, shocking in its disinterest: the river’s seawards run, the chalk’s whiteness, the hawk’s swivelling stare. But he knows also that the acknowledgement of this refusal of relation might offer its own bracing reward, just as the delusion of response might also serve deep purpose – and that one might not need always to choose the one before the other.",

On the wall facing us as we entered was a blown-up photograph, taken early in the twentieth century, showing four ridiculously pleased-looking men holding a droopy twelve-footer, little thicker than a normal earthworm but clearly ambitious in the length department. This I studied with great interest until Carmel drew my attention to a display of living giant worms. These were in a large glass panel, half an inch thick and filled with earth, rather like a very large ant farm, which hung on the wall. According to a label, the case contained a pair of giant worms. In a couple of spots where the earth had come away from the glass, we could see a millimeter or two of living giant worm, but as they weren’t moving or doing anything (Megascolides is extremely devoted to rest, it seems) the experience was, I confess, a trifle anticlimactic. I had rather hoped there would be a petting corner or perhaps a tamer with a whip and a chair getting them to go through hoops. Alan and I tried to enliven the worm by tapping lightly on the glass, but it declined to respond.",

Inexplicably, no mosquitoes attended me despite ill-fitting shutters on the unglazed window. I breakfasted at eight, two hours beyond Bugiri, in a hoteli facing many half-built red-brick dwellings, abandoned by families fleeing from warfare. A friendly young man provided weak but real coffee and scraps of cold omelette sandwiched in a stale, kerosene-flavoured bun. Above a showcase displaying two more stale buns hung an anti-AIDS poster, handwritten in the local language and illustrated with clumsy drawings. I enquired about its provenance. ‘My father made it,’ said the young man. ‘He is a minister of God and tries to warn and teach people. Here most of us can’t read posters from Kampala in English so we must translate.’",

Scouring the covers, I realised that they were mostly in Hindi. Chetan Bhagat’s books were the only English choice, but I had finished them all. I stood on my tiptoes to peer inside the hut, hoping at least to spot a faded Agatha Christie or two.",

    "target_paragraph": "“No, my dear,” she responded warmly, “but I would like you to come to my house and take tea with me. I will give you my address and my numbers. Perhaps you can visit soon. You know where the Astra compound is? Let's arrange it soon.” And handing me her details, she floated off, surging ahead through the black waterfall of her abbayah. She sounded quite excited to invite me home. I wondered what I would learn about divorced women in this Kingdom of Strangers.\nThe day of the visit I had been especially busy at the hospital. Running late, I rushed home and readied myself for my small outing. Astra was just a few minutes away from the compound where I lived but I would have to go there with Zachariah, the driver. I dialed the number, and quickly, securing my abbayah in one hand, a small house gift in the other, I hurried down the unlit steps to wait for him outside.\nThe familiar night breeze fluttered around my abbayah. I waited for the taxi headlights to materialize out of darkness. Behind me, I could feel the apartment building radiating heat, each wave of hotness pushing me farther into the cooler night. Even the ground pulsed underfoot. It was almost nine p.m. but it was still over 100°F.\nZachariah bumped into view. I got into the cab, and to the filtering sounds of an unknown symphony on a crackling radio station, we rode into the night. When we arrived at the Astra compound gate, a soldier asked for our identification. I showed my hospital badge which seemed to be enough, though I had my Iqama (national ID) at the ready. He quickly waved us through and we lurched over the speed bumps.\nThe compound looked different than mine. It was landscaped into wide avenues that were surrounded by large, low bungalows and two-story homes on either side. Neatly maintained lawns fronted most properties. Each avenue led, it seemed, to many others. Thousands of Saudi citizens made their homes here. Finally we approached a dimly lit cul-de-sac. A solitary street lamp buzzed in the darkness. As we rolled up to our destination I spotted Faris's white Cadillac a few houses away. So the rumors were true: husband and wife now lived in separate villas just a few homes apart.\nZachariah dropped me off and, waving him away, I walked up a tidy path. I spied a tricycle lying on its side where a child must have just flung it. A flaccid garden hose lay curled over the still-damp lawn. Inside, the lights were on. I rang the doorbell and waited.\nThe door opened, and a diminutive figure stood just to one side of the heavy wooden paneling. At once I could smell cardamom. Fatima must be preparing coffee. The headlamps of the taxi swept past the doorway and then faded into the dark, just as a tiny and very fair hand pulled me inwards by the sleeve of my abbayah. As the door closed behind me, I turned around and found myself looking at Fatima.\nIn the bright lights of her home, after the thick darkness of the Riyadh night, I was dazzled. My eyes were smarting with black spots. Fatima smiled at me shyly and after a few moments, her face curved into a wide, cerise bow. Her lipsticked smile was giant, and her pink lips over white teeth reminded me of a Cover Girl commercial. She was gorgeous in a pristine way. I was momentarily taken aback, trying to tally this image with the mumbling, shapeless figure that I knew to be her in the hospital. After an awkward pause, we greeted each other as Muslim women do, with a series of embraces. A delicate scent of jasmine rose up from her smooth, white neck. Her hair was neatly styled in a short bob that jostled from side to side with her every animation. She was slim and sporty in build. Dressed in slacks and a pretty sweater she looked like an attractive soccer mom. She was definitely an older “hottie.”",

This was the divide between the waters that flow roundabout to the Pacific via the Ussuri and the Amur, and those that drain down the front of the Sikhote-Alins into the Pacific directly. At the crest of the divide, back among the roadside weeds, stood a cement obelisk on which was inscribed (in Russian) CROSSED OVER THIS PASS: M. I. VENYUKOV 1858; N. M. PRZHEVALSKII 1887; V. K.

One, with a voluminous sleeve and a dynamically pointing forefinger outstretched, was explaining the vast landscape while her static companion listened in wonder. Their survey ended, they passed me, stooping into the wind with a rustle of their habits and a clash of beads, each with a hand across the crown of her head to steady the starch of her coif and her swirling veils. Their glances were lowered in the custody of the eyes that their rule enjoins. As they vanished downhill through a tall gateway of late gothic ashlars, I hoped they had found the more conventional of the two descending flights. Except for a throng of jackdaws perching in the chinks and sliding about noisily in the wind, I was alone.",

Never before had she felt so old, so hopeless and humble. She knew she was bound on a love-errand of Evelina’s, and the knowledge seemed to dry the last drop of young blood in her veins. It took from her, too, all her faded virginal shyness; and with a brisk composure she turned the handle of the clockmaker’s door.",

The nurse, sensitive by nature and training to all physical characteristics, was struck at once by the contrast between his alert face and figure and the silent way in which he moved. She noticed, too, that the same contrast was repeated in the face itself, its spare energetic outline, with the high nose and compressed lips of the mover of men, being curiously modified by the veiled inward gaze of the grey eyes he turned on her. It was one of the interests of Justine Brent's crowded yet lonely life to attempt a rapid mental classification of the persons she met; but the contradictions in Amherst's face baffled her, and she murmured inwardly \"I don't know\" as she drew aside to let him approach the bed. He stood by her in silence, his hands clasped behind him, his eyes on the injured man, who lay motionless, as if sunk in a lethargy. The matron, at the call of another nurse, had minced away down the ward, committing Amherst with a glance to Miss Brent; and the two remained alone by the bed.",

According to the map, the road (if a road is what it was) started in the middle of nowhere and finished half a dozen miles later equally in the middle of nowhere, which clearly made no sense—indeed, wasn’t even possible. (You can’t start a road in the middle of forest; earth-moving equipment can’t spontaneously appear among the trees. Anyway, even if you could build a road that didn’t go anywhere, why would you?)

As the historian Alan Moorehead once wrote: “Australians of my generation grew up in a world apart. Until we went abroad we had never seen a beautiful building, hardly ever heard a foreign language spoken, or been to a well-acted play, or eaten a reasonably sophisticated meal, or listened to a good orchestra.” The oddest aspect of all was that millions of Australians, most of whom had never left the country, went through life thinking of England in some odd, ultimate sense as home. As late as 1957 in On the Beach, the Nevil Shute novel in which a nuclear war leaves Australia as the last inhabited place on earth, the author could have his Australian heroine lament: “I was going home in March. To London. It’s been arranged for years…. It’s so bloody unfair.” By “home” she means a country she has never seen and now never will.",

He made an ash from certain bushes which he mixed with the plant, so that it stayed in one glob when he chewed it. He would stick this glob behind his ear to be used later, like bubble gum.

The day after the courier delivered my shaft coupling I was deep in the bilge when I heard a scraping sound on the hull. With the amount of debris that floated up and down the creek in the swift current, a bang or thump on the hull was not out of the ordinary. But in the confined space of the bilge the sounds were greatly magnified. When the banging turned into a constant scraping I imagined that an object had wedged between the boat and dock. I finished the coupling installation and jumped on the dock. I reached down into the creek up to my shoulder and felt along Quest’s hull to dislodge the debris. Suddenly beside my head an enormous ‘demon of the deep’ surfaced inches from my hand and started making for my fingers. I pulled back rapidly and rolled over on the dock. When I looked up, Nash the owner of the sport fishing boat next to Quest was watching and thoroughly enjoying the show.",

Orwell described it as a dumpy one-storey building with a tin roof. In his time the interior boasted a mangy billiard table, a library of mildewed novels, months-old copies of Punch magazine and the dusty skull of a sambar deer on one wall. The club bar was staffed with an Indian butler, and a punkah-wallah lay at the foot of the verandah pulling a rope with his heel to swing the punkah back and forth to create a cooling breeze. Members of Katha’s British community whiled away interminable evenings with tepid gin-and-tonics and inane chatter about dogs, gramophones, tennis racquets and the infernal heat. One perennially favoured topic of conversation was the insolence of the Burmese. Older club members recalled with nostalgia the good old days of the colony, when you could send a misbehaving servant to the jail with a note reading, ‘Please give the bearer fifteen lashes.’ According to Orwell, the real seat of British power lay not in the commissioner’s mansion or the police station, but in this sad, dusty little building.",

My favorites were classics like Wind, Sand and Stars, a dreamy existential memoir of piloting an open-cockpit plane over deserts and mountains, written by the author of The Little Prince. John was partial to books such as The Long Walk, in which an escapee from a Soviet prison camp wanders from Siberia to India, scavenging food and facing down death as he crosses the Gobi Desert and the Himalayas.",

Hewet stepped off the road on to one of these, in order to avoid the hardness and heat of the main road, the dust of which was always being raised in small clouds by carts and ramshackle flies which carried parties of festive peasants, or turkeys swelling unevenly like a bundle of air balls beneath a net, or the brass bedstead and black wooden boxes of some newly wedded pair.",

The prayer walls on the river path are much visited by wolves, but there is no sign of blue sheep or of leopard. At one of the prayer walls, the girl sits down in the sun and offers her breast to Chiring Lamo, serenaded the while by a crowd of chukar partridge that had fluttered off the holy stones into the gullies. The girl is wearing a helmet of red wool, and suddenly I recognize that these red cheeks and pretty smile belong to Tende Samnug, who wore this red helmet on the day at Shey that she gave me four potatoes. Karma, of course, is Karma Dorje, son of Ongdi the Trader; what I have taken for false charm was only his eager overtures of recognition. That day at Shey, they had no baby with them, and were all bundled up against the cold, but all the same, I much regret that I did not recognize them until Tende put on her red winter hat, or respond more warmly to their claim of friendship at last night’s fire. Soon this merry Tende rises in a tinkle of small bells that dance from her sash and from the gay striped apron worn by married women of Tibet; and Karma, stepping jauntily along with his beautiful swan’s-head lute strapped to his pack, seems ready to smile at anything at all. Like many Bhotes from Dolpo and Mustang, he calls himself a “Gurung”—“Karma Dorje, Gurung,” he insists. Being thought of as inferior by the Hindu tribes that rule Nepal, some younger Bhotes seek in this way to raise their status, but there is no real link between these people and the Gurung, whose villages we passed in late September, along the southern slopes of Annapurna.",
