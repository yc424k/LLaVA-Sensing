As they clean the walls with wet cloths and sponges, they uncover the earlier paints, most prevalent a stark blue that must have been inspired by Mary’s blue robes. Renaissance painters could get that rare color only from ground lapis lazuli brought from quarries in what is now Afghanistan. Faintly, we see a far-gone acanthus border around the top of the walls. The contadina bedroom used to be painted in foot-wide blue and white stripes. Two upstairs bedrooms were clear yellow, like the giallorino Renaissance painters favored, made from baked yellow glass, red lead, and sand from the banks of the Arno.",

Her glimpse of English home life had effected this. She meant, on her marriage, to have a year in Paris, and then to have her husband buy some real estate in the neighbourhood of Fordingbridge, from which place the Hurlbirds had come in the year 1688.* On the strength of that she was going to take her place in the ranks of English county society. That was fixed.",

The notion that the democratic will of the people might prefer to place restrictions on the unfettered rule of the market is scarcely even considered. The “transitology” literature is very revealing as to the true significance of neo-liberal orthodoxy on the issue of democracy … Particularly striking is the emphasis on markets and property rights and the absence of any mention of social justice or popular participation’.",

Imagine it’s Christmas season and there are no trees in the stores, but you can shop at the local crafts market, and by asking the friendly Filipino fellow–not a Saudi—he will bring out a few paltry Christmas decorations from the storeroom that look like leftovers from Christmas 1969. That all was normal for Saudi Arabia.",

    "target_paragraph": "This inn is a unique and interesting place. Its existence is strikingly precarious, for the whole region is in a state of perpetual throb from earthquakes, and the sights and sounds are gruesome and awful both by day and night. The surrounding country steams and smokes from cracks and pits, and a smell of sulphur fills the air. They cook their kalo in a steam apparatus of nature's own work just behind the house, and every drop of water is from a distillery similarly provided. The inn is a grass and bamboo house, very beautifully constructed without nails. It is a longish building with a steep roof, divided inside by partitions which run up to the height of the walls. There is no ceiling. The joists which run across are concealed by wreaths of evergreens, from among which peep out here and there stars on a blue ground. The door opens from the verandah into a centre room with a large, open, brick fire place, in which a wood fire is constantly burning, for at this altitude the temperature is cool. Some chairs, two lounges, small tables, and some books and pictures on the walls give a look of comfort, and there is the reality of comfort in perfection. Our sleeping-place, a neat room with a matted floor opens from this, and on the other side there is a similar room, and a small eating-room with a grass cookhouse beyond, from which an obliging old Chinaman who persistently calls us \"sir,\" brings our food. We have had for each meal, tea, preserved milk, coffee, kalo, biscuits, butter, potatoes, goats' flesh, and ohelos. The charge is five dollars a day, but everything except the potatoes and ohelos has to be brought twenty or thirty miles on mules' backs. It is a very pretty, picturesque house both within and without, and stands on a natural lawn of brilliant but unpalatable grass surrounded by a light fence covered with a small, trailing, double rose. It is altogether a most magical building in the heart of a formidable volcanic wilderness. Mr. Gilman, our host, is a fine picturesque-looking man, half-Indian, and speaks remarkably good English, but his wife, a very pretty native woman, speaks none, and he attends to us entirely himself.",

Inside a cavernous record store, the most prominent tape on sale was “Peculiarities of English Usage.” At the local bookstore, the front display was given over to the Paul Simon songbook and The Ultimate Trivia Quiz Book. On some of the shelves were children’s versions in English of Vanity Fair, Goodbye, Mr. Chips and The Helen Keller Story. Upstairs, copies of The Idiot, Oliver Twist, and Madame Bovary were squashed between The Dialectic of Nihilism, The Politics of Bureaucracy, Social Cohesion and, best of all, Beyond Dumping.

    "target_paragraph": "A ferry crosses the Amur to the village of Pivan. The granite cliffs above the far bank loom in and out of blizzard, and for an unblurred moment I glimpse the railway tunnel high up in their face. By the time we reach the landing-stage the wind is lashing the snow from the shore in a frozen dust. The passengers squash their fur hats lower over their ears and muscle forward laughing into its blast. Their skin shines raw, their eyes narrow. They look as if it has been blowing in their faces for years. Soon we are wading through shin-deep drifts. The visibility drops to 50 yards, the snow falling so thick. A comical dog appears and bounds alongside with an expression of ridicule, its snout and whiskers pickled in snow. After a while a village of smothered dachas turns up. I ask the way before the final stragglers scatter into nothing, and am at last alone.\nThe tunnel was started in 1939 to link Komsomolsk over a giant bridge with a railtrack to the Pacific. Hundreds of convicts died in its blasting. But the war aborted it and afterwards the route was deflected upriver. I reach the tunnel down an abandoned cutting, unsure why I am exploring it. Its concrete ceiling runs through the mountain like the segmented intestines of a worm. The only rails inside it belong to the excavators’ vanished trucks; they surface and sink under a litter of stones.\nA hundred yards inside, where a vagrant has made his summer home and gone, a barricade of rocks had been raised to bar the way. Beyond, supposedly, it is dangerous. I crawl over the boulders, and drop into darkness. Behind me the outer world, ringed in the tunnel’s semicircle, disappears. My torch-light flickers over pure granite. At first I hear the drip of water, then silence. In front, for more than half a mile, a jagged road pushes through the crystalline mountain. Sometimes, when the tunnel ceiling lifts, the trains come whistling and thundering through in my head; more often the track rears up in a stony mass which has never been blasted clear, and razor-edged rock glints close above. Charred beams lie crashed across the way, or sunk in iron-stained puddles. Every few yards, I realise, an anonymous labourer died.\nA pinprick of light hangs ahead. It seems quite near. But it is almost an hour before I am worming on hands and knees out of the last, shrunken tunnel. Then I clutch its walls in vertigo. I am 300 feet up on a cliffside. The blizzard is still raging. A flock of startled redwings whirrs up from the shrubs under my hands. Beneath me the water is lisping on powdered black rock. Beyond I imagine the unbuilt bridge over the grey running sea of the Amur, carrying its trains for over a mile and a half from the tunnel of wasted dead and into whiteness.",

It was sweet to be with Virginia, sweet and natural to be able, in moments of stress, to take refuge in her old home, in her Virginia’s home. And Stephen, though he took his duties as host too seriously, was such a good man; and Virginia was evidently supremely happy in her undemonstrative little way. If only she could manage, when Stephen talked, to keep awake better…. What was it about him, whom she so much respected, that sent her to sleep? But really, after the silliness of her recent experiences in London, it was like getting into a bath to come into this pure place–a big, cool, clean, peaceful bath.",

She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.",

The younger teachers can’t afford the daily journey, so they live in the dusty village from September to May each year, he added. The school was only a few rooms, and they had to buy their own propane to run the generators, he told us, but even then, it was only for an hour a day, during lunch. Mr. Hussan was, of course, an English teacher, and he was very excited to meet us on the train.",

Its air of noisy glamour was just the same as ever. But as I began to look more closely at the bars, I noticed that all their details had changed.

Later he called it “the hardest journey and the most trying experience of my life.” He and Frost covered eight thousand miles of Siberia visiting prisons, talking to prison officials, observing prisoners on the march or in transport barges or in the barracks or at work. The good credentials Kennan had been able to obtain from the government forestalled most interference from local officials and gave him a chance to visit political exiles of all kinds. Sometimes he and Frost traveled on the main road, the Siberian Trakt, and sometimes far off it, to places one could not reach today without helicopter assistance. They suffered from cold, lack of sleep, jolting of the wagons, poor food, and bugs. For almost four months, Kennan had bugs on his body or in his clothes. In the trans-Baikal city of Selenginsk, his face became so disfigured by bedbug bites that he was ashamed to go on the street.",

And opposite her, with his chair turned towards her, an old man, dressed elegantly in a thin, finely-woven and expensive-looking suit of grey, and with a meagre, weary, and distinguished face that had brown spots upon it, was sitting with his thin phthisical shanks crossed, and for a moment Eugene could see his lean hands, palsied, stiff, and folded on his lap, and the brown spots on them, and he could see a corded, brittle-looking vein upon the back of one old hand.",

And as they talked—about Ralph's life before the war and the jobs he had lost because of it (he had been a journalist), and about Barbara's job at the War Office, and air raids and the games they both went in for, and their favourite authors and the room he had in the White Hart Inn at Wyck—as they talked, fluently, with the ease of old acquaintances, almost of old friends, Barbara admired the beauty of Mr. Bevan's manners; you would have supposed that instead of suffering, as he must be suffering, agonies of impatience and irritation, he had never enjoyed anything in his life so much as this adventure that was just coming to an end.\nHe had opened the gate for her and now stood with his back to it, holding out his hand, saying \"Good-bye.\"\n\"Aren't you coming in?\" she said. \"Mrs. Waddington expects you for tea.\"\n\"No,\" he said, \"she doesn't. She knows I can't come if he's there.\"\nHe paused. \"By the way, that book of his, it's in an appalling muddle. I hadn't time to do much to it before I left. If you can't get it straight you must come to me and I'll help you.\"\n\"That's very good of you.\"\n\"Rather not. It was my job, you know.\"\nHe was backing through the gate, saluting as he went.

As a boy, Carlos became enchanted by the sound: the plaintive notes of the accordion, the beat laid down by the caja drum of Africa, the rhythm of the guacharaca, an instrument clearly of indigenous origins. He was equally moved by the spirit of the songs, each a story of nature, freedom, and love; the birth of a child, a wedding gone wrong, the mysterious flight of a magical bird, the delicate movements of deer in the evening as the sun softens on the horizon.",

    "target_paragraph": "All day I met only one fellow-traveller, being taken from his village to Kilosa by bicycle-taxi – rare in the bush though common enough in big towns, especially in Uganda. The passenger, riding on a wide soft saddle fixed to the carrier, was an elderly teacher who spoke fluent English. Meeting on the summit of a steep hill we were all happy to rest, leaning on our machines while discussing education, the SAP and AIDS. It had always been difficult, said the teacher, to persuade local parents to send their juvenile work-force to school, even when Nyerere was offering free education. Now it was hardly worth the effort, so adversely had fee-paying and cutbacks affected rural attitudes. As for AIDS, that was a city and mainroad problem; there was no need to talk about such dirty things in bush schools. Yet this teacher’s village was only thirty miles from Mikumi, a popular halt for drivers on the Dar es Salaam– Malawi–Zambia run. At such moments (and there were many of them) my heart ached for Africa. Only when it is too late, when the people of a region are dying in considerable numbers, is the AIDS menace recognised. Then some villagers, if given advice from an acceptable (preferably non-Western) source, will be suspicious of outsiders and abandon customs that could spread the virus – like tattooing, scarification, circumcision with a communal razor blade and the ritual cleansing of widows and widowers through copulation with an in-law. Before we parted the teacher pointed south to a towering cliff of black cloud obscuring the mountains ahead. ‘You will get very wet!’ he said. And he was right.",

She hurled the dress away, her hand reaching for the coat. She scrabbled it up and swept it about her, pawing at the sleeves. Then, the coat clutched to her breast, she whirled and looked straight into Tommy’s eyes and whirled and ran and flung herself upon the chair. “Durn them fellers,” Tommy whispered, “durn them fellers.” He could hear them on the front porch and his body began again to writhe slowly in an acute unhappiness. “Durn them fellers.”",

Each of us has put in identical time in the various boats, so now we draw lots to see who goes where, and Fedeler and I are the losers. We draw Snake Eyes. Even before we shove off, whitecaps have formed on the river, and waves two feet high. They are coming from the west, and that is where we are going. As we pack up, Fedeler and I are subjected to intense gratuitous ridicule because we are condemned to Snake Eyes; and, indeed, a chill wet day on a half-sunk log is about all we can expect. So we plow westward, into the waves, and the wind is so strong it brings tears to the eyes. They mix with the rain and the spray of the river. The length of a mile varies. These are three-league miles. The current flows west, the wind and waves come east, and they more than cancel the force of the river. To stop paddling is to move backward. The waves are so big they wash over the bow of the Grumman. Light and bobbing in its ride down the Salmon, the canoe here is too much up in the wind. John Kauffmann and Stell Newman have to bend their paddles on every stroke. The single Klepper, with Pourchot in it, is better off, but not much. It is so light that he has to strain to drive it. Snake Eyes, however, is thirty per cent submerged in its own leakings, another third by the natural depth of its draft. Snake Eyes is in and of the river. The wind cannot get to Snake Eyes, because the wind can’t swim. The waves that wash over us roll over the deck, asserting an upstream thrust of zero. Snake Eyes, property of the United States government, is today straight out of Groton, Connecticut—a nuclear-powered submarine. Fedeler and I, the nuclei, begin to suffer in a way unimaginable before. We become chilly, and a little stiff, waiting for the others—idling at the river bends, scanning the gray river through its flying spray to see where the others might be. After six or eight miles, we are so cold we stop. We build a bonfire of drifted cottonwood, and stand downwind of it at the edge of the flames.",

Instead, in the wide bed with flowered sheets, I spread my books, cards, and notepaper around me and indulge in the rare act of writing letters to friends. A second indulgence goes straight back to high-school days—consuming a plate of brownies and a Coke while copying paragraphs and verses I like into my notebook. If only Sister, my black long-haired cat, were here. She is truly a good companion for solitude. It’s far too hot for her to sleep against my feet, as she likes to do; she would have to stay on a pillow at the foot of the bed. I sleep like one newly born and in the morning have coffee on the patio, walk to town for groceries, work on the land, come in for water, and it is only ten o’clock.

Nearly all were young, buff, crew-cut, acne prone, and male. Zhirinovsky strode in the center in a canary yellow suit coat and black trousers, surrounded by adoring young men who took turns holding a blue umbrella flecked with yellow stars above his head. The quartet hastily jumped off the army truck to make room for their grand pooh-bah, who hopped aboard to great fanfare and launched into his usual rant and rave, reiterating his ideas of burying radioactive waste along the Baltic border and blowing it across with gigantic fans, seizing the country’s lost land (including that renegade province of Alaska) so that Russian soldiers could “wash their feet in the Indian Ocean,” and giving every woman free flowers. All the while, members of the foreign media crept closer and closer until photographers from Newsweek and The Washington Post climbed right inside the truck with their Nikons and Leicas. Without skipping a beat, Zhirinovsky began to slam America and its media. The photographers—who probably spoke little Russian—snapped away as the presidential candidate bashed them and their livelihood. The crowd went wild.",

In a sense now there was no more thinking to be done. We had reached a frontier. From now it would be a question of hanging on. Such solutions as those we had dreamed about were all thrown into relief by the ugly shadow of impending insurrec­tion. And yet everywhere there were doubts. The ordinary people of Cyprus went about their work with the same friendly good manners, many of them genuinely shocked by the work of ‘hotheads’ and genuinely grateful when the Governor described them as ‘law-abiding’. I concluded that EOKA must consist of a small body of revolutionaries, unknown to the general public. Wren did not share this view. ‘What would you say,’ he said dryly, ‘if every sixth-form boy in every public school in England had signed this oath?’ His agents had brought in a new document.",

Neither of us wanted a full team, unready to give up our human-powered ski adventures, or make the sacrifices a dog yard required. (You couldn’t guarantee some suckers like us would be around to feed if we went away.) But we decided to adopt one dog. Each spring, the Denali kennels retires the nine-year-old litter to local homes. The year we were ready, Campion needed a home, a seventy-five-pound gray-and-white leggy Alaskan husky with Siberian markings and icy eyes. I remembered him from trips (he was my wheel dog on that first steep ride), but I didn’t know him well, just that he needed a home, we needed a dog. I worried about the responsibility. We were footloose. Would we have to rush home to feed every day? What about our trips, weeks or months long?",
