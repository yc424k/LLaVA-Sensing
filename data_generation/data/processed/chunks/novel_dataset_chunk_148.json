From the top the Kabul river looks a mere thread of water, though in fact it’s a torrent in a mad, foaming rush to join the Indus.",

With their commander evacuated from the field by the enemy, their ranks shattered, their medical tents overflowing with the wounded, the royalists yielded the field. Sucre’s terms of capitulation, sent by runner under a flag of truce, addressed the fate of the viceroy’s army and, more significantly, laid out the stages by which Spain, with honor, would be permitted to leave the Americas, surrendering not an army but an empire, one that had endured for far too long.

Then McKinlay collapsed onto a dry skin, spent to his core. He assessed his condition: “My boots and stockings and legs were soaked through, well above my knees. The soles of my boots were worn into huge holes. Where the holes were the skin was gone, and my feet were raw and bleeding.” He was too tired to do anything about his feet, so he lay there as he was, soaking wet, freezing cold, bleeding, and despondent. He asked Munro the time and date. It was 4:30 A.M., May 25, 1914. He’d walked sixty miles in about forty hours, and in his snow-blind state, completely missed Skeleton Island, where he’d intended to retrieve the Hudson’s Bay pemmican for Mamen.",

As she sat there in her yellow kimono, one hand resting in her lap like the hand of a Buddha, the other lying with fingers bent backwards on the tatami, it struck me that we were talking to a princess. Keeping a precise distance from us, seated at just the right angle on the tatami, she chatted politely but with an occasional flash direct to the heart. I could see the origin of tea ceremony: the combination of politeness and the appeal to the heart. But so often in tea ceremonies the politeness is suffocating; here, it was like fresh air.",

Lots of shops were dark and bare; nowhere could I find a store at which to get insect repellent. A man outside the post office suggested I try Kmart.",

As a local merchant, boat owner, onetime mayor, and national park guardian with a passion for education and conservation, Ahmed naturally knew everyone in Nueva Venecia. But his style and charm suggested a cool confidence that would have registered in any setting. He acted more like a maître d’ than a small-town politician, radiating a warmth and civic pride that was both sincere and infectious. When Ahmed said the government had done nothing, leaving the people to save both the ciénaga and their town, we took him at his word. He was a man easy to believe.",

From whale-watching trips I’d been on, I knew that it is possible to time a whale and predict the duration of a dive, so I asked a Russian guy in my boat how long the whale would stay under. “Until he comes up again,” he replied. The wind had died completely, and lozenge-shaped spaces were swapping back and forth on the surface in the flat calm. The sea flashed colors of azure and green and turquoise with a swimming-pool allure, if you could forget how cold it was. Here and there curled white feathers dropped from the passing seabirds sat undisturbed like wood shavings on a shiny floor. Five minutes or more went by. Then a mile away a whale spout rose against the dark land beyond it. The spout shot white and unmistakable in the sky, then dropped back, leaving a veil of mist that hung in the air and drifted to one side.",

The man had asked them to move so that the cleaners could sweep that area of the airport. It was the most exciting thing that had happened all day. The fraying cord of hope unravelled a little further at six when the captain came back and said there was another problem, this time unspecified, and told us to go home and come back at six-thirty in the morning. The sergeant in charge of the church-builders was driving them to their boarding-house in town, and I decided to instal myself in a room in their lodgings, working on the assumption that the plane wasn’t going to leave without them.",

Punctually we departed in a conventionally comfortable train: open-plan, well-lit, unvandalised coaches, our tickets checked by a cheerful middle-aged conductress who dispensed complimentary salami rolls, bottles of Tukola and that morning’s Granma. I didn’t grumble, though I do prefer corridor trains; they allow more freedom of movement – and more bonding, in face-to-face carriages. My seat companion, a slim young woman clasping a large drum, slept all the way. Our conductress had suggested putting the drum in the luggage annex but evidently it was too precious to be deserted.",

One night while I was on the island I heard a man shout, ‘There’s a dolphin in the harbour!’ and I ran down to the jetty to find an astonishing sight. A Labrador dog was in the water, barking and paddling in circles, while around the dog played an eight-foot dolphin, blue in hue when on the surface but green-grey at depth. So I joined the two of them, stripping off to my shorts and then walking down the harbour steps and into the clear grey icy water of the sea. For fifteen minutes or so I swam with the two creatures. The dolphin was curious, familiar. It lay on its side beneath me, nuzzling my ankle, or bottled up to watch me with black cheeky eyes. Once it retreated to a distance of ten yards, then disappeared, before rising up sharkishly. Its skin felt blood-warm to the touch, and smooth as neoprene.",

We create a word for our convenience and forthwith, unless we are on the look out, there comes over it a horrid change. The word was made man. It puts on flesh and blood and begins to give itself airs. Soon enough, it stares us in the face, as though we were total strangers. “Know you?” it jeers. “Know you for a fool!” Many respectable men have been eaten alive by the words of their own creation, for their appetite exceeds that of Frankenstein’s healthful monster, and I have reasons for suspecting that, like the ferocious Scythians of old, they only drink milk.",

Charles took positions with Transcontinental Air Transport (a forerunner of TWA) and Pan Am, and was on course to become a leading figure in the aviation industry when his and Anne’s lives were disrupted in the most devastating possible manner. In early 1932, an intruder climbed through an upstairs window in their house near Hopewell, New Jersey, and kidnapped their infant child, Charles Augustus Junior. Though they paid a $50,000 ransom, two months later the child was found murdered.",

Each time I finish there is another convulsion, another flooding of my cave, and the whole process begins again. The work is warming but fatiguing. There is no rest.

Halfway across, a statue of the saint himself stood sentry in cape and crown, his back turned to the passing marchers, staring stonily at the tourist cruise boats chugging along the river below. As I paused to inspect the statue, the carnival Prince appeared in the road behind me. A tall, grinning young man, he walked confidently amid a crowd of supplicants, doing his best to look regal in a royal fool’s hat, wide ruff collar and gold-trimmed red velvet suit. By tradition, a new Prins was elected each year by the local carnival association. I saw more than one glittery dancing girl trying hard to catch the Prince’s eye as he passed, the prettiest among them rewarded with a cheeky royal wink. A loud marching band romped past, dressed in Robin Hood–style suits, stomping to the beat of a tuba and oversized toy soldier’s drum. I took a photo and – taking me for a tourist, which I suppose I was – a man of about sixty with absurdly over-gelled hair told me this was a Zaate Hermenie, a traditional Maastricht marching band. ‘They are playing the instruments badly on purpose,’ he said. ‘Because it is funnier that way.’ I wasn’t sure this was true.",

His idea was like a trampling of heavy feet in those cool corridors of hers, in that grave serenity in which her days accomplished themselves; at the very syllables of his name her instincts brought her upstanding and under arms against him, thus increasing, doubling the sense of violation by the act of repulsing him and by the necessity for it. And yet, despite her armed sentinels, he still crashed with that hot violence of his through the bastions and thundered at the very inmost citadel of her being. Even chance seemed to abet him, lending to his brutal course a sort of theatrical glamor, a tawdry simulation of the virtues which the reasons (if he had reasons) for his actions outwardly ridiculed. That mad flaming beast he rode almost over her car and then swerved it with an utter disregard of consequences to himself onto a wet sidewalk in order to avoid a frightened child; the pallid, suddenly dreaming calm of his bloody face from which violence had been temporarily wiped as with a damp cloth, leaving it still with that fine bold austerity of Roman statuary, beautiful as a flame shaped in bronze and cooled: the outward form of its energy but without its heat.",

And everything labelled, as on an architect’s drawing; every moving thing dwarfed, the man on his bicycle, with his black, black shadow; an endless, ever-spreading city which encouraged no repose, which sent people scuttling through its avenues and malls, as these scooter-rickshaws scuttled noisily in and out of the traffic, shrunk to less than human size in the presence of the monumental city.",

They hail each other with high waves, two-arm hugs, loud hellos, and hearty backslapping. Like groundlevel bird feeders, every coffee table has attracted its own drip-dry crowd, everyone dipping forward, pecking cheeks, their yellow plastic P2P tags on red lanyards dangling and clacking as they do. We don’t know anyone in the Rally except Matthieu, though apart from a few emails since meeting in Colorado two years ago, we haven’t had much contact. Still, I’ve used this slim thread of correspondence to weave a handy fiction that once we’re in Beijing he’d take us under his wing, offering access to a ready-made circle of our own. Matthieu gives us a cordial greeting, then drifts over to his own huggy group. He’s joined by five others; together, the six of them form a team of three cars. From the ease with which they move off, I surmise they’re good friends. It doesn’t escape me that no invitation to backslap with them has been issued.",

Here the PLO held apparently important talks with foreign delegations and diplomatic missions – talks doomed to wither on the vine. In August 2001, when all Palestinian institutions were closed, Orient House was declared off-limits to East Jerusalemites – ‘and that gate has been padlocked ever since’, said Shaul. ‘My parents cheered as the Arabs lost their recognised base. I was seventeen and that gloating switched me to activism. That was in the middle of the suicide bombings – we were scared to get on a bus or sit in a restaurant. But still I could see how the despair makes extremists.’",

Mr Perrott passed through; Mr Venning poised for a second on the edge of a table. Mrs Paley was wheeled past. Susan followed. Mr Venning strolled after her. Portuguese military families, their clothes suggesting late rising in untidy bedrooms, trailed across, attended by confidential nurses carrying noisy children. As midday drew on, and the sun beat straight upon the roof, an eddy of great flies droned in a circle; iced drinks were served under the palms; the long blinds were pulled down with a shriek, turning all the light yellow. The clock now had a silent hall to tick in, and an audience of four or five somnolent merchants. By degrees white figures with shady hats came in at the door, admitting a wedge of the hot summer day, and shutting it out again. After resting in the dimness for a minute, they went upstairs. Simultaneously, the clock wheezed one, and the gong sounded, beginning softly, working itself into a frenzy, and ceasing. There was a pause. Then all those who had gone upstairs came down; cripples came, planting both feet on the same step lest they should slip; prim little girls came, holding the nurse’s finger; fat old men came still buttoning waistcoats. The gong had been sounded in the garden, and by degrees recumbent figures rose and strolled in to eat, since the time had come for them to feed again. There were pools and bars of shade in the garden even at midday, where two or three visitors could lie working or talking at their ease.",

Outside is First Avenue: mud and dust, pocked and gravelled, the principal thoroughfare of the city, where children go by in wagons harnessed to dogs, and old-timers in pickups cruise slowly back and forth—“trolling,” as someone has put it, for conversation. The cabin is tight, comfortable, heated by an Ashley. It is said of a fine stove like this one that it “will drive you out of here at seventy below,” a promise enhanced by bush architecture. Cabins are generally small, so the stove can retain command. My wife was here for a time. We slept in a loft just above the Ashley. Routines developed. Every other day, we sawed and split some wood, but, with the ice petering out on the river and the sun shining eighteen hours a day, we were soon using the stove for little more than to get our blood moving in freezing temperatures as the day began.",

The main road is lined with graceful old buildings that once belonged to colonial merchants. But the pink and cream façades are now faded, the stuccowork entablatures and rosettes that decorated them are cracked, and patches of damp have spread across the walls like a watercolourist’s impression of a moody monsoon sky. There are aged mosques with curvaceous ogee arches and sky-blue domes. Though more recently built shop-houses are dotted between the older buildings, with stores selling electrical goods, stationery or groceries, the road has an abandoned feeling to it, as if everyone has shut up shop and gone away for the summer. The windows are covered with wooden shutters, and behind gates locked with rusting padlocks the gardens are choked with weeds.",

Above that is the high-pitched whistle of some creature I don’t know, a truculent line of ca-caws, the throaty conversation of a pair of macaws. Lower down is the thud of a woodpecker’s beak. I think the tree is hollow, the way the noise sounds empty. Settling between this is the hiss of crickets, the whine of mosquitoes that grows higher as I grow still and they grow bolder, gyrating nearer to my ears. There is the motor of a hummingbird’s wings, the rustle of leaves, the muted squeal of toads, the crunch of sticks as something burrows in the undergrowth. I think with panic that these noises will be lodged in my brain forever and I’ll never be free of them, but the more I think this, the more I listen. And as I listen, with the heat cushioning my body against the cool mud and the cold metal of the cage, my mind drifts. I become dreamy, the sounds less fractious. The hummingbird’s whirl relaxes, the rustling deepens, the crickets lower, the toads sink, the woodpecker slows, the macaws start to speak somewhere else.",
