A poet is Atlantic and lion in one. While one drowns us the other gnaws us. If we survive the teeth, we succumb to the waves. A man who can destroy illusions is both beast and flood. Illusions are to the soul what atmosphere is to the earth. Roll up that tender air and the plant dies, the colour fades. The earth we walk on is a parched cinder. It is marl we tread and fiery cobbles scorch our feet. By the truth we are undone. Life is a dream. ’Tis waking that kills us.* He who robs us of our dreams robs us of our life—(and so on for six pages if you will, but the style is tedious and may well be dropped).",

They should warm themselves by the big fire, try to dry their wet boots and clothing and otherwise keep moving. Bartlett surveyed the island and the surroundings, an empire of ice and stone. The island extended in length east to west for nearly one hundred miles, with a width of some fifty miles. In the clear light, he could see nearly forty or fifty miles of the northern coast, with Cape Waring lying to the far eastern tip, and Evans Point to the west. He prayed there would be game here. As he surveyed the land, he could see two other large sandspits extending out, and from the maps and descriptions in the Coast Pilot, knew they’d landed on Icy Spit, the middle spit of the three that Muir had reported on the northeast side. Between the spits were ice-covered lagoons where, later in spring and early summer, they might find seals and walrus.",

    "target_paragraph": "Such wealth and lineage insulated the Bolívar family from the most vulgar impositions of Spanish rule, but position and privilege did little to help a young student whose hunger for knowledge would never be satisfied under a colonial regime that, as a matter of policy, promoted ignorance. Fortunately when Simón turned fifteen, another uncle, living in Madrid, invited him to continue his education in Europe. A year later, Bolívar reached Spain, where he immediately came under the care and guidance of a close friend of the family, the Marqués de Ustáriz, a scholar as generous, wise, and inspiring as his first mentor, Simón Rodríguez. Mobilizing a small army of tutors, the marqués introduced Bolívar to French and Italian, Spanish literature, world history, and all the luminaries of the Enlightenment. Ustáriz didn’t just expose the lad to new horizons; he actively worked to identify gaps in his knowledge and experience that needed to be addressed. Noting Bolívar’s passion for books, he flung open the doors to his personal library, among the finest in Spain, casting the boy into trance. The marqués exposed his charge to music, introducing him to Beethoven and the finest composers of France and Spain. Bolívar took up fencing. He learned to dance, an art of movement Bolívar would embrace with all his passion, becoming not only highly skilled but so fluid as to transcend time and space. In the many dark passages of a life of triumph and tragedy, he would always find peace and forgetfulness in the stillness of a pirouette. His finest speeches would be composed on the dance floor.",

After a few minutes at the station, several passengers (all men) stepped off and lit their cigarettes. The smoke wafted through the open doors and filled our car. With no air-conditioning, the air grew warm, and the sour cigarette smoke soiled my tongue. I wanted to spit. Instead, I stared out the window at the station and the tracks beyond. This was, by far, the largest town between Luxor and Aswan, and from my lumpy seat on the smoke-filled train car, the city looked completely unattractive; not uninteresting, just unattractive. Along the tracks, between the station and a low wall, there was a small shantytown. Tarps, carpets, and sheets formed a makeshift roof over walls of scrap cardboard and plaster. The ground around the shantytown was littered with plastic jugs, paper, bricks, and metal. Further down the track, I noticed several open-sided freight cars filled, several feet deep, with garbage, and more garbage littered the ground. They don’t publish those images in guidebooks.",

There was always a quiet whisper of home whenever my feet touched their ancient rocks. I wondered idly if the reason lay in their geologic history and the fact that my family was firmly rooted in Scotland. The Scottish Highlands and the Appalachians were the same mountain range, divided by millennia of continental drift. Once known as the Central Pangean Mountains, their dispersed remnants lingered on either side of the Atlantic. When the Highlanders left their homeland, they came en masse here: to the southern Appalachians. I closed my eyes and felt the wind gently lift wispy ringlets of sweaty hair away from my face. I listened closely—as I often did on silent mornings and starless nights. In the stillness, I could swear I heard the mountains murmur of those days gone by—when they soared above the world and clasped hands where oceans now lie. I smiled and unrooted my feet slowly from where they connected me to the earth.",

Here the trees, timber or fruit-bearing as the case may be, make the wayside hedges ragged by their drip and shade; their lower limbs stretching over the road with easeful horizontality, as though reclining on the insubstantial air. At one place, on the skirts of Blackmoor Vale, where the bold brow of High-Stoy Hill is seen two or three miles ahead, the leaves lie so thick in autumn as to completely bury the track. The spot is lonely, and when the days are darkening the many gay charioteers now perished who have rolled along the way, the blistered soles that have trodden it, and the tears that have wetted it, return upon the mind of the loiterer.",

His Highness was curled up outside the Palace on a charpai. A dilapidated canvas fence had been erected round him, forming a private enclosure. My chair and the usual tables were set beside him; charcoal glowed through its soft grey ash in a bowl on the ground. Apparently the weather was not yet warm enough for him; but my shirt was sticking to my back. We chatted about one thing and another, while white-clad servants were visible now and then behind him, pale shapes floating in the gloom. One brought a hookah. I said I had heard he was intending to start very soon upon his pilgrimage, and after rather sharply inquiring who had informed me of this, as though a breach of confidence had been committed, he sighed that he was afraid that this time there was no avoiding it.",

Spindrift – the loose particles of snow and ice blown by wind – lisps over every surface. A chough or raven flies just on the event horizon of the picture, as does a bristly old tree bole – both apparently about to be swirled inescapably down into the pale plug-hole of the sun. Even Ruskin’s signature, in the bottom left-hand corner, is bending under the strain, its ends being tugged inwards by the pull of the drawing. In the background the mountains stand in profile, like white knives, echoed by the pinnacled surface of the glacier. Ruskin comes nearer in this drawing than any other artist I have ever seen to catching the experience of being on a glacier. He brilliantly compounds its paradox of stasis and dramatic force. On a glacier, one is always aware of motion in the midst of stillness: there is, as Gerard Manley Hopkins observed of an Alpine ice-river, ‘an air of interrupted activity’.",

    "target_paragraph": "When Carlos asked if we needed food I said no but suggested a little hot water for coffee. This request soon produced a large saucepan of boiling milk which enabled each of us to have three big mugs of café con léche with our buns: an unprecedented treat. By then it was very cold and raining slightly and thunder was roaring from peak to peak. When the eldest boy, aged twenty-six, arrived home from Huamachuco driving three laden donkeys (one with foal at foot) I wondered how he’d got his animals across the broken path. Answer: he’d mended it. This monthly journey takes him twenty-four hours – what a trip to the nearest town! He quickly unloaded the donkeys, piled sacks in a corner of the verandah and without a moment’s pause was away on the next task: driving two of the donkeys to fetch enormous sacks of newly-lifted potatoes from the foot of the steep green slope below the ledge – a 1,000 foot drop, at least. Every day, this family of nine has potatoes and cows’ milk for the two main meals (morning and evening) – again like Irish peasants not so long ago. The surplus potato crop is exchanged for noodles, kerosene, salt, sugar, matches, clothes, household needs. It does one good to be among adequately fed Andean citizens who don’t need to chew coca. Comparing this mestizo family – mentally alert, not shy of gringoes, well-mannered, well-built, well-dressed, well-organised – comparing them with the average Indian family one again glimpses that shadow of doom over the native campesinos. After all, Carlos & Co., living on this ledge, could hardly be described as enjoying any unfair advantages over Indian farmers.",

As he stood there in the darkness, able only to see the shapes of trees through the fine grey light, he was overcome by a desire to escape, to have done with this suffering, to forget that Rachel was ill. He allowed himself to lapse into forgetfulness of everything. As if a wind that had been raging incessantly suddenly fell asleep, the fret and strain and anxiety which had been pressing on him passed away. He seemed to stand in an unvexed space of air, on a little island by himself; he was free and immune from pain. It did not matter whether Rachel was well or ill; it did not matter whether they were apart or together; nothing mattered—nothing mattered. The waves beat on the shore far away, and the soft wind passed through the branches of the trees, seeming to encircle him with peace and security, with dark and nothingness. Surely the world of strife and fret and anxiety was not the real world, but this was the real world, the world that lay beneath the superficial world, so that, whatever happened, one was secure. The quiet and peace seemed to lap his body in a fine cool sheet, soothing every nerve; his mind seemed once more to expand, and become natural.",

Finery laid off is as unappetizing as the remains of a feast, and it occurred to Lily that, at home, her maid’s vigilance had always spared her the sight of such incongruities. Her body ached with fatigue, and with the constriction of her attitude in Gerty’s bed. All through her troubled sleep she had been conscious of having no space to toss in, and the long effort to remain motionless made her feel as if she had spent her night in a train.",

I am the ghost of Louis, an ephemeral passer-by, in whose mind dreams have power, and garden sounds when in the early morning petals float on fathomless depths and the birds sing.

    "target_paragraph": "Already several families have moved from ‘my corner’. Affirmative action allows some skilled people to get comparatively well-paid work and this gives a trickle of jobs to others not lucky enough to have found steady employment – joiners, cobblers, seamstresses. Khayelitsha is far from being transformed, economically. Yet there are changes, scattered like the first shoots of spring wheat on winter-brown ploughland. Granted, some are more apparent than real, like the forest of electricity poles. At a cost of R48 every shack can be connected and have a card-operated meter installed; but this does not mean being able to afford cards. In many shacks bulbs now hang from ceilings but at sunset oil-lamps are lit. Electric cookers may stand in corners, the ovens serving as cupboards, but most suppers are still cooked on oil-stoves or outside fires. Various electrical appliances have been ‘found’ and are displayed like trophies: kettles, irons, toasters, hair-dryers – even a few fridges, also useful as cupboards. However, the fact that such appliances can be used, whenever enough rands are available, is in itself morale-boosting. And some spaza shops (now stocking a wider range of goods) offer iced beer, cooldrinks and fresh milk from giant fridges cunningly donated by Coca-Cola. Also, space in those fridges may be rented at so many cents a day for storing a hunk of meat or a bag of vegetables.",
