Sopir takes the white cloth off Barong's head and ties it to one of the umbrellas. The Barong is now visible, dancing in place, its head tossing and hindquarters wiggling. Finally it turns, faces the swelling crowd, and just stands there — mouth agape, head turned quizzically to one side. The fast-sinking sun casts a few last rays on the mirrors of Barong's headdress, which glows orange. The music switches once again. Then Barong advances slowly southward, the two dancers within coordinating their movements. Little children rush forward to grab the capaka flowers that spill from Barong's black beard, and others grasp the hair and pull off a tuft. These souvenirs are magic.",

First Delhi museum’s toy train, then the Deccan Queen and now, as we crossed the overhead bridge in Pune Junction, a multicoloured train awaited our arrival. After the hasty departure from the Osho ashram, we decided to leave Pune earlier than planned and the only train to Delhi running on a Tuesday, with last-minute tickets available, was the Pune-Nizamuddin Duronto Express. It chopped a whopping six hours off the 26-hour journey, which may not have seemed like much, but it was always the last few hours that triggered involuntary rocking and made the compartment feel like a padded cell. We were due to arrive into Delhi just after 7 am, so there was barely time to wake up and get off, let alone wake up and moan. Train 26 was less than six months old and was part of a new fleet launched by Mamata Banerjee, the railway minister. Shatabdi Express trains are currently the fastest trains on the railways, but the Durontos – which meant ‘quick’ in Bengali – ran a non-stop service between each station, cutting down overall journey times.",

Afternoons in Paro Dzong, all red-and-gold serenity. Later, in the failing light, a gradual chill sharpening the air. Monks making their slow way back to temples. Children singing folk songs in the dusk. The valley suspended in a virgin silence. “Idyll” was a word from which I was accustomed to recoil, yet truly I felt that there could be nothing lovelier than this peaceful windless valley, so innocent it did not know the meaning of the word. Even in December, it was spring in Paro. And sometimes, walking home through avenues of willows, golden under cobalt skies, I felt as if I had stumbled upon the hidden Arcadia of Heinrich Harrer’s Seven Years in Tibet. A sequel, perhaps: Several Weeks in Bhutan.",

With the dark another storm came up, rumbling over the hills between us and Tapee. A miserable man dragged himself over to my hut across the coffee beans which were lying in the dust to dry. He asked me whether I was a doctor and I said that I had a few medicines, but when he told me it was gonorrhoea he suffered from, I had to admit that nothing I had with me would help him. The information took a long time to penetrate. The sight of a white man had made him hope; he just stood there waiting for the magic pill, the magic ointment then moved dispiritedly away to sit in his own hut and wait for another miracle.",

I poked my head round the door and was greeted by the smiling faces of six monks, clad in maroon robes and ranging in age from late teens to early eighties. Accompanying them was a young novice, aged about six, his little head freshly shaved to a 'Grade 1' sheen for the journey. This separate travelling space is designed to provide monks with a tranquil space to meditate and also to prevent any contact with women, one of the 227 rules which make up the Patimokkha, or strict code of monastic discipline in Theravada Buddhism. Only on this occasion, the cabin had the feel of a lads' coach trip to the seaside, with a fug of aniseed scented smoke from the eldest monk's loosely packed cheroot, and the crackle of a small transistor radio, its aerial extended out of the window to maximise the weak signal. With no shared language, our meeting was limited to smiles and handshakes, and a photo of the little novice eliciting a gap-toothed grin upon seeing his own image in my camera's viewfinder.",

    "target_paragraph": "The girl, at first, had tried to defend herself from these scarcely-veiled confidences, distasteful enough in themselves, and placing her, if she listened, in an attitude of implied disloyalty to the man under whose roof they were spoken. But a precocious experience of life had taught her that emotions too strong for the nature containing them turn, by some law of spiritual chemistry, into a rankling poison; and she had therefore resigned herself to serving as a kind of outlet for Bessy's pent-up discontent. It was not that her friend's grievance appealed to her personal sympathies; she had learned enough of the situation to give her moral assent unreservedly to the other side. But it was characteristic of Justine that where she sympathized least she sometimes pitied most. Like all quick spirits she was often intolerant of dulness; yet when the intolerance passed it left a residue of compassion for the very incapacity at which she chafed. It seemed to her that the tragic crises in wedded life usually turned on the stupidity of one of the two concerned; and of the two victims of such a catastrophe she felt most for the one whose limitations had probably brought it about. After all, there could be no imprisonment as cruel as that of being bounded by a hard small nature. Not to be penetrable at all points to the shifting lights, the wandering music of the world—she could imagine no physical disability as cramping as that. How the little parched soul, in solitary confinement for life, must pine and dwindle in its blind cranny of self-love!",

A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing.",

It was because the armed man might be in the dugout itself, guarding the only exit there.

We dont know what they are up to, and only I seem to have any fears or alarms. If I am wrong, we will all die sooner or later anyway. If I am right and you shoot me here, we will all surely die. Or better still: Shoot me. I shall be the one man out of this whole four years who died calmly and peacefully and reposed in dry clothing instead of panting, gasping, befouled with mud to the waist or drenched completely in the sweat of exertion and anguish. But he didn’t do it. He didn’t need to. The dugout was empty also. The armed man might be at the top of the stairs instead of the foot of them but then there or thereabouts would be where the colonel and his orderly room and periscope were too; besides, he would have to face, risk the rifle somewhere and it wouldn’t matter where since it contained only (for him) one bullet while what he was armed with was capable of containing all of time, all of man.",

We pitched our tents on the shore of the lake and feasted our eyes on the indescribably beautiful picture of this tremendous mountain, which seemed to grow out of the lake. This is certainly one of the loveliest spots on earth. The lake is held to be sacred and round it one finds many small monasteries in which the pilgrims lodge and perform their devotions. Many pilgrims creep round the lake on their hands and knees and carry home jars of the holy water. Every pilgrim bathes in its icy cold water. We did likewise, though not from piety. Here I nearly came to grief. After swimming out some little way from the shore I got into a boggy place from which I only extricated myself with a tremendous effort. My comrades had not noticed my desperate struggle to get clear of the mud.",

We had one-way tickets and planned a month on the road. Our friends and family asked for postcards and pictures, and they wished us the best of luck. A few days later, my feet cried mercy and our trip was over. We sat at that café for hours. Teresa wouldn’t talk to me. I scrambled for ideas, and after a long while found one that stuck. What about Egypt? I knew that Teresa had always wanted to see the pyramids, and for the first time that afternoon, she looked up at me. We booked our flights that night, and two days later, we flew to London, then Cairo. We told our friends and family about the change in plans. Don’t go to Egypt, they warned us, it’s not like it used to be. We didn’t listen, we never do.",

His walk was uphill, and his mind dwelt gloomily upon the house which he approached, where he would find six or seven brothers and sisters, a widowed mother, and, probably, some aunt or uncle sitting down to an unpleasant meal under a very bright light. Should he put in force the threat which, two weeks ago, some such gathering had wrung from him—the terrible threat that if visitors came on Sunday he should dine alone in his room? A glance in the direction of Miss Hilbery determined him to make his stand this very night, and accordingly, having let himself in, having verified the presence of Uncle Joseph by means of a bowler hat and a very large umbrella, he gave his orders to the maid, and went upstairs to his room.",

American women, he contended, were destroyed by their brains. But they were only a step or two worse off than the rest of the women of the Western world. He felt it was a great tragedy to look at American women, whom he thought the most beautiful and vivacious women on earth, and then to think what little use they were as women.

Traffic was sparse (perhaps extra-sparse because of Trinidad’s problem?) and the dusty cacti hedges offered no shade. It made sense to walk on, despite the 10.00 a.m. heat. Quarter of an hour later a rice-loaded lorry, its passenger seats surprisingly empty, stopped voluntarily to pick me up and was going all the way. Its grey-haired, vivacious mulatto driver (Carlos) associated Ireland with Christians killing each other and thought Cuba fortunate to have no such conflicts. After we had parted, as I was strolling towards the central Parque Martí, the lorry pulled up beside me: my purse had been jolted out of my pocket. It held more than CP100 – a small fortune, for Carlos. Yet he had turned his vehicle – not easy in the centre – to follow me. Had I been put down near a bar he could never have found me and his virtue would have been rewarded. In Cuba one doesn’t take lost property to the police.",

Then the Texan took the husband by the arm and led him back toward the gate, the wife following, and through the gate which he held open for the woman and then closed. He took a wad of banknotes from his trousers and removed a bill from it and put it into the woman’s hand. “Get him into the wagon and get him on home,” he said.",

On July 30, my wife arranged a farewell party for me at our house. Alex and Katya came, and Boris and Sonya, and our friends Mark, Caroline, and Bill. For the Russians, the evening was an occasion for minor-key histrionics and doom-predicting in their native fashion, along with excitement and hilarity. Katya said how bitterly she blamed herself for leading me into this Russian nightmare in the first place; the next minute she was saying what a great adventure this would be. Boris asked if he could have my car, in the event that I did not return. He added that he was saying this as a precaution only, because I would return, of course. Caroline, who is French-Canadian and observant of style, said she thought it was cheating for me to bring along a satellite phone. That was the only comment I took sort of seriously. What would George Kennan have thought of the satellite phone?",

The day was radiant, and treacherously warm for March, and she had put on a little blue hat, of the same blue as the one she had worn that fatal day in the rubberneck car, and a coat with a collar of fluffy amber fur. Between cerulean hat brim and blond fur her face looked as tender as a wild rose, and the shadow of fatigue under her eyes turned them to burning sapphire. Vance looked at her in wonder. What did she do with all this loveliness in their everyday life? It seemed to appear suddenly, on particular occasions, as if she had pulled it out of the trunk under their bed with her “good” coat; and he knew it would vanish again as quickly, leaving her the pale heavy-eyed ghost of her old self. Some inner stimulus, now almost lacking in her life, seemed required to feed that precarious beauty. He noticed how people turned their heads as she entered the gallery, as they had done in the fashionable restaurant, and at the theatre, on their wedding journey. Masculine pride flushed through him, and he slipped his arm possessively in hers. “Take me right to where it is,” she enjoined him with a little air of power, as if instantly conscious of his feeling. They worked their way into the second room, and there, aloft on a central pedestal, Vance caught a half glimpse of himself as embodied in the clay of Rebecca Stram. The conspicuous placing of the bust astonished him--he hadn’t supposed that Rebecca’s artistic standing, even in her own little group, was of such importance.",

Their registry claims a laundry list of famous visitors including presidents, princes, prime ministers and at least one writer. Agatha Christie conceived her novel Death on the Nile while staying at the Old Cataract in the 1920s. Many of these famous travelers stayed for weeks or months. They turned the hotel into a home away from home, and the hotel was happy to deliver. Overlooking the Nile and Elephantine Island, the hotel fills several acres with reflecting pools, palm trees, and Moorish-infused Mediterranean architecture. The hotel’s interior complements its grounds in quality and comfort. On our self-guided tour of the hotel (of which I’m sure Cook would have approved) we slowed to a shuffle as we admired the hand-carved furniture, crystal vases set with towering flower displays, and marble floors under glowing chandeliers. We toured the lobby and sat in the plush chairs for several minutes. I wondered whether the Old Cataract Hotel was immune to the rolling blackouts that plagued the rest of the city, and the country. Its clientele would never settle for such an inconvenience, I imagined.",

Again St. Petersburg’s Pulkovo International, and the well-known smell, the sparrows in the concourse, the long line at Passport Control. Sergei and Victor were waiting on the other side of the doors beyond the customs officers. Sergei was beaming with excitement; a white point of light shone on his tanned and furrowed brow. They drove me to the city. For a reason I’ve forgotten, I spent that night in a hotel on the Neva just across from the Aurora, the Russian navy cruiser whose cannon had announced the beginning of the October Revolution. The Communists had made her into a museum; her guns were still trained on the Hermitage. I had a farewell dinner with Luda at a microbrew restaurant and then came back to the hotel. The room had become stuffy so I opened the high, narrow windows facing the river. Two or three mosquitoes flew in—the advance pickets of a vast, continental army.",
