The others grasped the fact more slowly, with anguished cries of recognition as everything gradually and painfully came back to them. Four untidy bunks lined the walls of the cabin and a brazier stood in the middle. Postcards of Anny Ondra, Lilian Harvey, Brigitte Helm and Marlene Dietrich were pinned on the planks of this den; there was Max Schmeling with the gloves up in a bruising crouch, and two chimpanzees astride a giraffe. Uli and Peter and the diesel-engineer were all from Hamburg. We sat on the lower bunks and ate fried potatoes mixed with Speck: cold lumps of pork fat which struck me as the worst thing I had ever eaten. I contributed a garlic sausage and a bottle of schnapps – leaving presents from Cologne – and at the sight of the bottle, Uli howled like a beagle in pain. Cologne had been a testing time for them all; they were at grips with a group-hangover; but the bottle was soon empty all the same. Afterwards Peter brought out a very elaborate mouth-organ. We sang Stille Nacht, and I learnt the words of Lore, Lore, Lore and Muss i denn, muss i denn zum Städtele ’naus; they said this had been the wartime equivalent of Tipperary; then came a Hamburg song about ‘Sankt Pauli und die Reeperbahn’. By pulling down a lock of his hair and holding the end of a pocket comb under his nose to simulate a toothbrush moustache, Uli gave an imitation of Hitler making a speech.",

But while the Friar’s account is obviously ridiculous, the story Polo tells is a common one, first recorded in the seventh century and still current in Kashgar in 1916 when Ella and Sir Percy Sykes heard it at first hand from a Hindu trader. The Hindu had been in the Taklimakan after dark when a sudden light revealed a broad road along which marched an army, dressed, so he thought, in Turkish uniforms. Then the army vanished only to give place to droves of cattle and sheep. The account is almost identical to that of the great Buddhist traveller Hsuan Tsang, who saw, one thousand three hundred years before the trader, ‘a body of ghostly troops amounting to several hundreds covering the sandy plain – and the soldiers were clad in fur and felt. And now the appearance of horses and camels and the fluttering of standards and lances.…’",

From behind crimson curtains, rendered semi-transparent and sometimes blowing wide came the sound of the eternal waltz – After the ball is over,2 after the dance is done – like a serpent that swallowed its own tail,3 since the ring was complete from Hammersmith to Shoreditch. Over and over again it was repeated by trombones outside public houses; errand-boys whistled it; bands inside private rooms where people were dancing played it. There they sat at little tables at Wapping in the romantic Inn that overhung the river, between timber warehouses where barges were moored; and here again in Mayfair.4 Each table had its lamp; its canopy of tight red silk, and the flowers that had sucked damp from the earth that noon relaxed and spread their petals in vases. Each table had its pyramid of strawberries, its pale plump quail; and Martin, after India, after Africa, found it exciting to talk to a girl with bare shoulders, to a woman iridescent with green beetles’ wings in her hair5 in a manner that the waltz condoned and half concealed under its amorous blandishments. Did it matter what one said? For she looked over her shoulder, only half listening, as a man came in wearing decorations, and a lady, in black with diamonds, beckoned him to a private corner.",

I remember people running after us to point out the correct path, or calling out that we had taken the wrong route. I remember others offering to buy us drinks, or giving us something to eat. And I remember being asked to light a candle on their behalf in Santiago. Decent people, faith-filled people, ordinary people—not paid to be of service, not hired to do a job, but acting from their soul’s desire, from their deep, abiding faith.”",

She had probably thought retirement was at hand, definitely not a circumnavigation, when Olivier moved aboard. She was pure basics, the only instruments on board being three little cabin lights, his Freiberger sextant, a watch and an antique shortwave radio. For nighttime running lights Olivier used kerosene lamps of green and red glass. Relying almost solely on Akka’s sails and antiquated self-steering gear, he had come far, sometimes with crew and sometimes alone. Olivier was as basic as his boat, having no desire to maintain the superfluous, no need to accumulate objects. The few he had were simple and beautiful.",

All the hotels had names that were redolent of another age ? the Bel Air, the Bellevue Syrene, the Admiral, the Caravel ? and looked as if they hadn’t changed a whit in forty years. I spent an hour draped over the railings at the roadside, staring transfixed across the magical sweep of bay to Vesuvius and distant Naples and, a little to the left, floating in the still sea, the islands of Procida and Ischia. Lights began to twinkle on around the bay and were matched by early-evening stars in the grainy blue sky. The air was warm and kind and had a smell of fresh-baked bread. This was as close to perfection as anything I had ever encountered.",

The original groundbreakers, from the Yishuv’s Labour Youth Movement, worked with Germans and Italians who had arrived in Palestine as children before September 1939. Naturally they knew nothing of the Negev and an academic agronomist, who couldn’t tell a spade from a shovel, supervised the sowing of their first grain crop on unirrigated land. Its failure was instructive. Meanwhile the watchtower was being built, above a quadrangle of small rooms with firing-slits (trimly curtained) instead of windows. I had my own nostalgic moment in the kitchen/living-room where everything, from primus stove to double-boiler to hand-mincer, might have come from my childhood home. In the Heath Robinson shower room another effigy provided light relief; in the crucially important communications room telegraphic equipment, once cunningly hidden from British eyes, is now on display beside the essential carrier-pigeon bands. Everyone slept in tents until May 1948 when Egyptian strafing forced them into an elaborate Nabatean cave system below the tower. Some 2,000 years ago this was a water reservoir; the Nabateans knew more about water management than most twenty-first-century hydrologists. Another cave, the ammunition store, now holds a selection of weapons illegally acquired by the Pachmac when Israel’s future leaders were being described as (and behaving like) terrorists. The study is furnished with ink bottles and steel pens. Here, in August 1948, Avraham Klasky wrote:",

The street lamps were already lit; and through the mist in the square one could see little figures hurrying across the road and along the pavement, on the farther side. In her absurd mood of lustful arrogance, Mary looked at the little figures and thought, ‘If I liked I could make you go in there or stop short; I could make you walk in single file or in double file; I could do what I liked with you.’ Then Mrs Seal came and stood by her.",

I had to tie the horse and go in on foot. The heavy air was swarming with flies and the numerous trails in the thickets were well beaten and dusty, strewn with cow droppings. Real cattle country all right. I picked up a club, went on, stooping under the tangle. The canyon was short and boxed in and at the head was a cow and her calf; I drove them out and back to the main canyon. I was glad to get on my horse and rejoin Viviano and Roy.",

Aware of this fact, I had enquired about the place and received assuring reports as to its hotel accommodation. But the fates were against me. On my arrival in the late evening I learnt that the hotels were all closed long ago, the townsfolk having gone to bed “with the chickens”; it was suggested that I had better stay at the station, where the manageress of the restaurant kept certain sleeping quarters specially provided for travellers in my predicament.\nPresently the gentle dame lighted a dim lantern and led me across what seemed to be a marsh (it was raining) to the door of a hut which was to be my resting-place. At the entrance she paused, and after informing me that a band of musicians had taken all the beds save one which was at my disposal if I were good enough to pay her half a franc, she placed the lantern in my hand and stumbled back into the darkness.\nI stepped into a low chamber, the beds of which were smothered under a profusion of miscellaneous wraps. The air was warm—the place exhaled an indescribable _esprit de corps._ Groping further, I reached another apartment, vaulted and still lower than the last, an old-fashioned cow-stable, possibly, converted into a bedroom. One glance sufficed me: the couch was plainly not to be trusted. Thankful to be out of the rain at least, I lit a pipe and prepared to pass the weary hours till 4 a.m.\nIt was not long ere I discovered that there was another bed in this den, opposite my own; and judging by certain undulatory and saltatory movements within, it was occupied. Presently the head of a youth emerged, with closed eyes and flushed features. He indulged in a series of groans and spasmodic kicks, that subsided once more, only to recommence. A flute projected from under his pillow.",

Looking down the Hades of the lemon-house, the many ruddy-clustered oranges beside the path remind me of the lights of a village along the lake at night, while the pale lemons above are the stars. There is a subtle, exquisite scent of lemon flowers. Then I notice a citron. He hangs heavy and bloated upon so small a tree, that he seems a dark green enormity. There is a great host of lemons overhead, half-visible, a swarm of ruddy oranges by the paths, and here and there a fat citron. It is almost like being under the sea.",

The water is too deep, too cold, too fast. As I stare into the Teklanika, I can hear rocks the size of bowling balls grinding along the bottom, rolled downstream by the powerful current. I’d be swept from my feet within a few yards of leaving the bank and pushed into the canyon immediately below, which pinches the river into a boil of rapids that continues without interruption for the next five miles.",

But since the men had no shotguns, they had to use their pistols and rifles, and the haul of birds came at a considerable cost to their ammunition, which was not unlimited. Both tents agreed that all the birds—all game, for that matter—would be divided equally between the tents based on the number of persons, regardless of who shot the game. This, in theory, would ensure equal and fair distribution, since they were all living together in close proximity at Cape Waring and hunting was for their communal survival. Williamson’s tent had four people, and Hadley’s five, since as they counted young Helen and Mugpi as one adult. Once the kill was divided, each tent was then in charge of storing, cooking, and rationing their own stores. That was the agreement, anyway.",

As the shuttles dashed through the warp they lifted up the heavy battens, and when the shuttles stopped they let the battens fall and pressed the threads together. Their faces were pinched with famine, and their thin hands shook and trembled. Some haggard women were seated at a table sewing. A horrible odour filled the place.

Ambling around the city, we dropped into the local newspaper, the Correo de Valdivia, and they very kindly wrote an article about us.

I tried to compensate with the warm sleeping bag, but couldn’t doze off again. The chill sunk through to my bones. Gingerly, I opened the curtains. Romeo was nowhere to be seen in the truck stop’s parking lot lights. Naturally, he had escaped inside to warmer climes. I started the engine and heated the interior of the truck.

The piazza is engulfed; the lower windows in the palace wall, which could have been a basilica instead, fade away at the sides among the fountain’s cliffs and boulders. At the center rides the king, Neptune, whose palace is all motion and transformation; sea horses led by tritons are drawing him forward, and you think at first a hundred other sea creatures but that is an optical illusion, another of the attributes of Ocean; all the rest is rocks, caves, ocean flora, with the beautiful Acqua Vergine racing across them from everywhere.",

As it bent, and then bent some more, I found myself seemingly surfing toward north Viti Levu, toward the mountain range where the sun rose. Not possible, my mind said. Keep going. The wave felt like a test of faith, or a test of sanity, or an enormous, undeserved gift. The laws of physics appeared to have been relaxed. A hollow wave was roaring off into deeper water. Not possible. It felt like a runaway train, an eruption of magical realism, with that ocean-bottom light and the lacy white canopy. I ran with it. Eventually, it bent back, of course, found the reef, and tapered into the channel. I didn’t tell Bryan about it. He wouldn’t believe me. That wave was otherworldly.",
