These tall reeds advanced almost into the slow, horizontal sea, from which stood up a white glare of light, massive light over the low Mediterranean.",

Presently he bobbed round in his seat so as to see Sutton, and began talking to him excitedly.\nAt the end of it Charlotte and Sutton found themselves alone, smiling into each other's faces.\n\"Do you like him?\" she said.\n\"I'm not sure. All the same that isn't a bad idea of Mrs. Rankin's.\"\nIt was Sutton who tried to work it the next morning, sounding McClane.\nCharlotte was in the space between the glass doors, arranging their stores in their own cupboard. McClane's stores had overflowed into it on the lower shelves. She could hear the two men talking in the room, Sutton's low, persuasive voice; she couldn't hear what he was saying.\nSuddenly McClane brought his fist down on the table.\n\"I'll take you. And I'll take your women. And I'll take your ambulances.\nI could do with two more ambulances. But I won't take Conway.\"",

Its tile floor was a dingy, mud hue, and the lights flickered and popped. Faded signs pointed the way toward an arrival hall. The signs, composed in Arabic, French, or English, were lettered by hand, some decades ago, and seemingly without the aid of a dictionary. A crowd of men – and only men – swarmed a row of windows along the far wall. Each window was signed with an unfamiliar name like Banque du Caire, Banque Misr, and so on. Behind each window sat young men in collared, button-up shirts. They exchanged currencies and sold visas (cash only) to ill-prepared travelers like us. For some years, the price had been fifteen dollars for a thirty-day visa, but the signs were recently amended, by hand: $25. “Someone has to pay for the revolution,” I joked, but nobody heard. With visas in hand, we made our way to the receiving hall and stood in a short line to cross through passport control.",

Here too I have twice seen a giant blue and silver kingfisher, looking like a tremendous sapphire as he flashes in and out of the water. The valley also has many other types of hawk and a great variety of unfamiliar sweet song-birds, as well as jays, tits, crows, finches, swallows and of course the very important, very ugly scavenging vulture, with its brilliant hooked yellow beak, ungainly walk and unpleasantly avid expression.",

I chose the same route as last time, and travelled as fast as I could in order to put as long a distance as possible between me and the camp by the next morning. This time I was determined not to depart from my resolve to travel only by night and lie up by day. No! this time I was not going to take any risks. My four comrades, for whom Tibet was also the objective, moved in a party and had the nerve to use the main road which led via Mussoorie into the valley of the Ganges. I found this too risky and followed my former route through the Jumna and Aglar valleys. During the first night I must have waded through the Aglar forty times. All the same, when morning came I lay up in exactly the same place which it had taken me four days to reach in the previous year. Happy to be free, I felt satisfied with my performance, though I was covered with scratches and bruises and owing to my heavy load had walked through the soles of a pair of new tennis shoes in a single night.",

She was a very dark-skinned Indian girl, about twenty-five years old, with the squat figure of her drudging race, pleasant features, hair hanging forward over her shoulders in two long plaits, and big, shining teeth when she smiled. I never did find out whether she had been just a peon woman working around La Cadena when the attack had come, or whether she was a vieja—a camp follower of the army.",

We were all armed and had nothing to fear from five robbers. The valley was a sandy depression with a sulphur stream running through it. We searched the sand-hills without success, but when we came down to the Euphrates, there were five armed men strolling unconcernedly along the bank as though they would take the air. Now, you do not wander with a rifle in your hand in unfrequented parts of the Euphrates’ bank for any good purpose, and we were persuaded that these black-browed Arabs were the five we sought. Probably they had intended to reap a larger harvest, but finding the caravan too numerous they had contented themselves with the stragglers. Unfortunately we had no proof against them: the bread was eaten and the cloaks secreted among the stones, and though we spent some minutes in heaping curses upon them, we could take no steps of a more practical kind. The zaptieh, for his part, was in an agony of nervous anxiety lest we should propose to relieve them of their rifles. He looked forward to a return journey alone to Baghdadi, and it is not good for a solitary man to have an outstanding quarrel with the Deleim. Finally I realized that we were wasting breath in useless bluster and called Fattu? away. If we were to concern ourselves with the catching of thieves, we might as well abandon all other pursuits in Turkey.",

I just managed to attend to my needs in time; out of nowhere black shapes rose—the Ramadan feasters were not all asleep.

To say that everything had changed would not begin to express my bewilderment. With an hour to kill before the evening event, I walked back and forth between museum and garden, trying to conjure from memory images of a place that had vanished, as if swept away into the dustbin of history. I had no sense of nostalgia. My only thought was “Good riddance.” The air in the streets no longer smelled of dust, grease, and lube oil. The repair shop where boys black with soot forged parts and pounded tires; the corner bar lit up at all hours and through all seasons with Christmas decorations and tinsel; the hot-panted girls nestled in the dark doorways; the young toughs shadowed by the streetlamp, huddled around a billiard table moldy from the rain, stranded in the street; the dingy restaurant where every night I ate with the truckers, paying a dollar for the same simple meal, a plate of fríjoles con arroz y plátano with a bit of meat, a fried egg, or chicken feet on top—all of this was gone, replaced by a wide plaza that skirted the science museum, an open space of fountains, shade trees, seating areas with whimsical benches, and even a water park for the young. Spread along one axis of the plaza was a row of interactive exhibits, where everyone was welcome to take part and play. The price of admission to the museum was on a sliding scale, such that no one could be turned away, even the penniless. The botanical garden across the way is free to all.",

Dark and gnarled, the beam was hewn from a single tree trunk, its shape irregular, especially around a foot to the right of where I was lying, where a large knot in the wood caused a tumorous bulge which I hadn't previously spotted. A large, sloping tumorous bulge, which was now moving along the beam as I watched. I leapt to my feet, shouting to Kirsty, who was in the shower. The faecal phantom had revealed himself!",

Within three days, Mrs Barton was out of danger; but her complete recovery was slow, ugly, and painful. As the days lengthened out wearily, the girl became more and more bitter over her thwarted honeymoon. Rushing out of the sick-room, she would enter Eliza’s kitchen with writhen face, unable to control her anger:",

Through the window I could see him pick up his telephone and make a call. He looked at me as he did it. Suddenly I felt alarmed. What if he was calling the police to tell them to come out and shoot me? I laid a small patch of rubber on his driveway as I departed – something you don’t often see achieved with a Chevette – and made the pistons sing as I floored the accelerator and hurtled out of town at a breakneck twenty-seven miles an hour. But a mile or so later I slowed down. Partly this was because I was going up an almost vertical hill and the car wouldn’t go any faster – for one breathless moment I thought it might actually start rolling backwards – and partly because I told myself not to be so jumpy. The guy was probably just calling his wife to remind her to buy more wart lotion. Even if he was calling the police to report an outsider asking impertinent questions, what could they do to me? It was a free country. I hadn’t broken any laws. I had asked an innocent question, and asked it politely. How could anyone take offence at that? Clearly I was being silly to feel any sense of menace. Even so, I found myself glancing frequently into the rear-view mirror and half expecting to see the hill behind me crawling with flashing squad cars and posses of volunteer vigilantes in pickup trucks coming after me. Judiciously, I stepped up my speed from eleven to thirteen miles a hour.",

When he saw me, his eyes nearly fell out of his head, and he struck up a sort of antique chorus: “Mister-é-Bairun mariz bud, Mister-é-Bairun was ill. He has come back. Was ill, was ill. Came back, came back. Mister-é-Bairun was ill, came back, was ill, came back,” etc., till Christopher, not knowing the signs of Afghan affection, thought he was in a mad-house. Do I flatter myself? Moss-roses were placed in our button-holes, the best carpets in our rooms, and pots of geraniums on our tables. Two kinds of sherbet were brought out. Sponge-cakes and my favourite jam would be ready tomorrow. The luggage was up in a twinkling.",

Bartlett was deepening his icecraft and navigation skills, spending time with the Greenlandic Inuit of the region. Peary adopted the practice of explorers before him like Roald Amundsen to emulate the survival skills of the Native peoples, and to employ local guides and interpreters. He relied on their superior knowledge of the harsh region and learned how to live in it. Bartlett benefited immensely from this Arctic apprenticeship. He discovered the importance of keeping his feet dry at all costs to avoid the nightmare that Peary had been through. An Eskimo guide showed him how to line the bottoms of his boots with grasses and lichens as insulation to keep the soles of his feet from freezing.",

He would not even help me unload the luggage. Finally I shook him out of his despair and he consented to hobble the horses. Then he sank on to his tuft again, refused the food I offered him, and tried to refuse the blanket till I tied it round his shoulders. It was very cold; we were again in a thick damp cloud. I spread my own bedding, dined off some egg, sausage, cheese, and whisky, read a little Boswell, and fell fast asleep among the aromatic herbs with my money-bags between my feet and my big hunting knife unclasped in my fist.",

A layer of new snow covered everything, ready to stay. Around the airport, vehicles and workmen and the drainage grates in the runways all emitted steam. Along the top of the newly refurbished airport building (oil money, probably) ran a streak of midnight-blue neon that highlighted the blue-black of the sky. In the company of Anatoly, the bright-eyed, long-nosed, pixie-haired taxi driver who had claimed me, I came out the airport doors and into the parking lot, where other taxi drivers were standing around smoking cigarettes next to their idling cars. The hoarfrost in which each car was covered resembled a fur of white iron filings. My lungs filled with a familiar, delicious Siberian combination of secondhand smoke and bitter-cold air. One basic purpose had been accomplished. I had breathed the air.",

But now the benches were vacant and even when he reached the stone parapet among the old cannon there was nothing of the River but the vast and vacant expanse, only the wet dark cold blowing, breathing up from across the vast empty River so that already he was buttoning the cotton jumper over his cotton shirt; no sound here at all: only the constant unsleeping murmur of the city behind him, no movement save the minute crawl of the automobiles on the bridge far down the River, hurrying, drawn also toward and into that unceasing murmur of passion and excitement, into this backwash of which he seemed to have blundered, strayed, and then abandoned, betrayed by having had to be away so long. And cold too, even here behind one of the old cannon, smelling the cold aged iron too, huddled into the harsh cotton denim too new to have acquired his own body’s shape and so warm him by contact; it was going to be too cold here before much longer even though he did have peace and quiet to pass the rest of the twelve hours in. But he had already remembered the other one, the one they called Court Square, where he would be sheltered from the River air by the tall buildings themselves provided he waited a little longer to give the people who might be sitting on the benches there time to get sleepy and go home.",

Although that sounds like a lot, it was only enough to permit a single attempt for three guides, eight clients, and four Sherpas. And the meter was running: even as we reclined in our tents, we were using up precious gas. If need be we could turn off our oxygen and safely remain up here for perhaps twenty-four hours; after that, however, we would need to either go up or go down.",

He came marching along at his strong and even stride, his bat upon his shoulder, as steady and as unperturbed as a soldier, and, as he passed, he turned his fearless face upon the boy across the street—looked at him with his black-eyed Indian look, and, without raising his voice, said quietly in a tone instinct with quiet friendliness:",

I knew exactly where I was: just a few hours upriver was the Turliamos with its lovely beach, cave, and tamarind tree. I would walk there, stuff my pack with as much fruit as I could, and then walk back to Curiplaya. I could live on the fruit for two weeks, going back for more when necessary. I would save as much of the rice and beans as I could, using them only when I couldn’t find anything else in the jungle. I would build myself a shelter on the hillside, where I would store all my belongings in case of a flood. If necessary, I could easily flee up there myself. At the same time I would reinforce the hut down here, perhaps put up some walls to keep the wind out. Inside I would gather a large reserve of firewood, light the fire once, and never let it go out. It would burn perpetually, day and night.",

    "target_paragraph": "We drive to the end of a road near our house and get out. We discovered this walk purely by chance one day when we walked this road and spotted a path at the end of it. We kept walking and made a fantastic discovery. It was one of the great walks I’ve ever had and we decided then to come back at Christmas. Water is flowing where I’ve never seen it in summer. Sudden streams gush out of crevices and wash over the road. We come to a waterfall and several torrents. Soon we’re in a chestnut and pine forest of huge ancient trees. We see a few patches of snow in the woods and more snow higher up in the distance. The air, deeply moist, smells of wet pine needles. We come to paving stones laid end to end. “Look, a path,” Ashley says. “What is this? It’s wider up ahead.” Out here in nowhere, we’re on a Roman road in incredibly good condition for long stretches. We never have reached the end but Beppe, who knows it from childhood, told us it goes to the top of Monte Sant’Egidio, twenty kilometers away. Instead of winding and skirting, Roman roads tend to go straight to the top. The chariots were light and the shortest distance between two points seemed to have governed their surveyors. I’ve read that some of their roadbeds go down twelve feet. We’re on the lookout for the distance markers but they have disappeared. Cortona lies below us, and below the town the valley and the horizon look polished and gleaming. We see mountains in the distance we’ve never seen, and the hilltowns of Sinalunga, Montepulciano, and Monte San Savino rise sharply like three ships sailing against the sky. The last knot of my unrest unravels. I start to hum “I saw three ships come sailing in on Christmas Day, on Christmas Day in the morning.” A red fox leaps down onto the path ahead of us. He sweeps his plumy tail back and forth, regards us for a moment, then darts into the woods.",

Having forgiven my attempt to pay for an act of kindness, the driver indicated a café where I might – he didn’t sound optimistic – find sustenance. The street door led directly into a small low-ceilinged room where an elderly widow, dressed all in black and wearing too-loose Wellingtons, peered doubtfully at me through the early twilight. She had nothing to offer, not even herbal tea or acorn coffee, and seemed slightly scornful of my naïve hopes. Suddenly I felt the effects of having walked so far after a sleepless night. Collapsing into a wobbly easy-chair, I took out my last mini-cigar – provoking a yelp of horror. The widow indicated a ‘No Smoking’ notice, referred agitatedly to the police, beckoned me to the door and pointed out a nearby restaurant.",

The slingshot looked small. I should add, with admiration, Johan never again removed the slingshot from his pocket.",

Today little remains from that afternoon. The factory buildings are long gone, as are the cafes and small businesses that stood scattered along the street. Braintree is no longer a factory town, but a pleasant suburb, twelve miles south of Boston. Pearl Street is a busy thoroughfare with turning lanes and traffic lights on gantries above the road. Where Parmenter and Berardelli fell is the site of a neighborhood shopping center, Pearl Plaza, anchored by a Shaw’s supermarket and an Office Max supplies store. Beside a railroad bridge that wasn’t there in 1927 is a small memorial to the two victims of the crime, erected in 2010 on the ninetieth anniversary of the robbery.",
