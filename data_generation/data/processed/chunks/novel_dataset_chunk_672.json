The narrow gaps between the islands allow the tidal waters to pass. Once a day the millions upon millions of gallons of tidal waters from the Atlantic are forced through the gaps created by the islands. Then once a day the process reverses and the Bahama Banks water is forced between the islands. This sets up tremendous currents between the islands which scour a channel between the closely spaced islands.",

    "target_paragraph": "At first Ann Eliza wrote, shyly but persistently, entreating for more frequent news; then, as one appeal after another was swallowed up in the mystery of Evelina’s protracted silence, vague fears began to assail the elder sister. Perhaps Evelina was ill, and with no one to nurse her but a man who could not even make himself a cup of tea! Ann Eliza recalled the layer of dust in Mr. Ramy’s shop, and pictures of domestic disorder mingled with the more poignant vision of her sister’s illness. But surely if Evelina were ill Mr. Ramy would have written. He wrote a small neat hand, and epistolary communication was not an insuperable embarrassment to him. The too probable alternative was that both the unhappy pair had been prostrated by some disease which left them powerless to summon her—for summon her they surely would, Ann Eliza with unconscious cynicism reflected, if she or her small economies could be of use to them! The more she strained her eyes into the mystery, the darker it grew; and her lack of initiative, her inability to imagine what steps might be taken to trace the lost in distant places, left her benumbed and helpless.",

Tea is at one of several picnic benches, all outfitted with a metal plate on which to put your stove so that you will not incinerate said picnic bench. Since I have not seen this arrangement anywhere, the metal plate installation argues strongly for a past conflagration. Perhaps they knew I was coming? Fifty metres above the Kyle, the view is of the torrent below with an array of Munros in the background. Invisibly nestled amongst them is the Ratagan Pass. It all looks very daunting. This is a major estuarine area with all that implies: molluscs, fish, seals, sea eagles, and a cornucopia of other birds. Otters, too (HA!). I am not feeling too flash but the tea and view have rejuvenated me. My survival bells and whistles also have initiated an adrenaline flow as I more closely watch the ferry and its volunteers not get sucked out to sea. Just. I am not going back up that hill. The only way is down. Muttering a prayer for a change in the tide that will make the crossing less life threatening, I tidy up.",

It was on one of the couch-burning plots that she laboured with her fork, its four shining prongs resounding against the stones and dry clods in little clicks. Sometimes she was completely involved in the smoke of her fire; then it would leave her figure free, irradiated by the brassy glare from the heap. She was oddly dressed to-night, and presented a somewhat staring aspect, her attire being a gown bleached by many washings, with a short black jacket over it, the effect of the whole being that of a wedding and funeral guest in one. The women further back wore white aprons, which, with their pale faces, were all that could be seen of them in the gloom, except when at moments they caught a flash from the flames.",

For all that, old Koppen was no fool. Half a million buttered tea-cakes could not impair the lively workings of a brain which had long ago mapped out a swift and sure path to worldly success. He had wind of this project; his answer was carefully prepared. It was a mathematical certainty that not one cent of those half-million francs would ever leave his pocket. For he knew what the Committee did not know—the real character of his friend Keith. Keith was a good fellow but a hopeless crank; Keith was perfectly capable of impoverishing himself in order to keep Miss Wilberforce out of prison. As to subscribing to the schemes of a pack of meddling fools who proposed to intern the dear lady—Keith would see them all damned first. This is how Mr. van Koppen, a profound student of human nature, would have argued, had he lacked the opportunity of discussing the question with his good friend. As a matter of fact he had enjoyed that opportunity only a few days ago. He had warned Keith of what was coming, and had found him equally alert to the plans of the Committee and more desirous than himself, if possible, of frustrating them. They had chuckled vastly over a bottle of dry sparkling Nepenthe in anticipation of the event.",

The limestone fountains, home to lizards and to Fanta cans, do not play; they look spongy in decay; the satyrs and nymphs that adorn them are scabrous with age. We walk down avenues of listless trees, to a topiary garden in which old people take their rest. Au pairs and Filippinas sit on shaded benches with preternaturally decorous children. There is a redundancy of gazebos with tired ducks and pigeons here. A few intrepid children, dressed as if for church, make use of an imaginative playground—ropes and wood, slides, monkey bars—but adult hands are outstretched to catch them lest they fall onto the uncushioned concrete below. Under such circumstances, it is an act of rebellion to play. (Play is always an act of rebellion.) On a merry-go-round with an odd assortment of horses, a miniature locomotive cab, spaceships, and a coach-and-four, only a teenager, nodding out on drugs, rides. Everything is dusty here; Julia likes it here. Next to the villa, dedicated in 1932 to the people of Italy in the name of Goethe (words of praise for Mussolini have been erased by chisel from the facade), is a shack with video games.",

In truth, it was usually too rough for learning to surf—the nearest beginner breaks were outside the city. And there was a contingent among the Ocean Beach regulars who had learned their chops elsewhere—in Hawaii, Australia, or Southern California—and had moved to the city as adults.

The ribbon of frozen meltwater had ended three hundred feet up and was followed by a crumbly armor of frost feathers. Though just barely substantial enough to support body weight, the rime was plastered over the rock to a thickness of two or three feet, so I kept plugging upward. The wall, however, had been growing imperceptibly steeper, and as it did so, the frost feathers became thinner. I’d fallen into a slow, hypnotic rhythm—swing, swing; kick, kick; swing, swing; kick, kick—when my left ice ax slammed into a slab of diorite a few inches beneath the rime.",

Think how they organize, roll out, smooth, dip in dyes, and drive tunnels blasting the rock. Lifts rise and fall; trains stop, trains start as regularly as the waves of the sea. This is what has my adhesion. I am a native of this world, I follow its banners. How could I run for shelter when they are so magnificently adventurous, daring, curious, too, and strong enough in the midst of effort to pause and scrawl with a free hand a joke upon the wall? Therefore I will powder my face and redden my lips. I will make the angle of my eyebrows sharper than usual. I will rise to the surface, standing erect with the others in Piccadilly Circus. I will sign with a sharp gesture to a cab whose driver will signify by some indescribable alacrity his understanding of my signals. For I still excite eagerness. I still feel the bowing of men in the street like the silent stoop of the corn when the light wind blows, ruffling it red.",

Probably all brides had a time of being disillusioned, and got over it, and settled down, and it would be most wrong if outsiders gave ear to them during their brief preliminary restiveness, and meddled in any way. Interference, she was sure, was a profound mistake—any interference, with anybody. The married must be let alone; and so must the unmarried be let alone. It was no more fair for the married to come to the unmarried, in search of bolstering up, and upset their peace, than it would be for the unmarried to go to the married, in search of company, and upset their husbands. She had been absolutely right to make Netta go back, and absolutely right not to go back with her. It wasn’t just selfishness—why, who said it was?",

At once they stood even straighter, and removed their hands, and seemed ready to attend their Sovereign, if need be, to the cannon’s mouth, as their ancestors had done before them. The white busts and the little tables in the background covered with copies of the Tatler* and bottles of soda water seemed to approve; seemed to indicate the flowing corn and the manor houses of England; and to return the frail hum of the motor wheels as the walls of a whispering gallery* return a single voice expanded and made sonorous by the might of a whole cathedral. Shawled Moll Pratt with her flowers on the pavement wished the dear boy well (it was the Prince of Wales for certain) and would have tossed the price of a pot of beer—a bunch of roses—into St James’s Street out of sheer lightheartedness and contempt of poverty had she not seen the constable’s eye upon her, discouraging an old Irishwoman’s loyalty.

I looked out the window and saw that a local, Inuit couple had arrived on a sled pulled by ten dogs. Bo told us later over breakfast, that the Inuit, who are the indigenous people of Greenland, make up 90 per cent of the population and originally migrated from Alaska through Northern Canada. This couple was probably on its way to hunt caribou, muskox, seal, or fish. He said, ‘Inuit don’t wander aimlessly in search of meat, they visit the same seasonal hunting and fishing camps each year to harvest food.’ Indeed, with the use of sled dogs, kayaks and the toggle-headed harpoon, the Inuit were able to thrive along the majority of Greenland’s coastline. Their remarkable nomadic lifestyle revolves around hunting, fishing and a rich oral tradition of storytelling passed down from generation to generation.",

It was very warm, and for a while they did nothing but exchange remarks about the heat, the sun, the glare. But there was a breeze blowing, a choppy stiff wind that whipped the water into froth. It fluttered the skirts of the two women and kept them for a while engaged in adjusting, readjusting, tuck-ing in, securing hair- pins and hat- pins. A few persons were sporting some distance away in the water. The beach was very still of human sound at that hour. The lady in black was reading her morning devotions on the porch of a neighboring bath- house. Two young lovers were exchanging their hearts’ yearnings beneath the children’s tent, which they had found unoccupied.",

On boggy areas of Dartmoor, fragments of white china clay were placed to show safe paths at twilight, like Hansel and Gretel’s pebble trail. In mountain country, boulders often indicate fording points over rivers: Utsi’s Stone in the Cairngorms, for instance, which marks where the Allt Mor burn can be crossed to reach traditional grazing grounds, and onto which has been deftly incised the petroglyph of a reindeer that, when evening sunlight plays over the rock, seems to leap to life.",
