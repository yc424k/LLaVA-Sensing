An hour later the chopper set down at Tribhuvan International Airport, and we stepped out the door into a thicket of microphones and television cameras. As a journalist, I found it edifying to experience things from the other side of the fence. The throng of reporters, mostly Japanese, wanted a neatly scripted version of the calamity, replete with villains and heroes. But the chaos and suffering I’d witnessed were not easily reduced to sound bites. After twenty minutes of grilling on the tarmac, I was rescued by David Schensted, the consul from the American Embassy, who delivered me to the Garuda Hotel.",

It was cold, the sky was clear now; there would be a heavy frost by sunup and the ground was already frozen beneath the horses’ feet and the wheels and beneath their own feet as they crossed Major de Spain’s yard and entered the house, the warm dark house, feeling their way up the dark stairs until Major de Spain found a candle and lit it, and into the strange room and the big deep bed, the still cold sheets until they began to warm to their bodies and at last the shaking stopped and suddenly he was telling McCaslin about it while McCaslin listened, quietly until he had finished. “You dont believe it,” the boy said. “I know you dont——”",

But she stood her ground. At last they realised the extent of her folly. Whatever the risk might be they must give way to her.

Gradually the colony dwindled, but in 1960 new migrants arrived and turned the San Carlos Institute into a Cold War battleground. Built by the Cuban government in the 1920s, it became the only US public school (in the transatlantic sense) maintained by a foreign power. Because it was for the education of Cuban children, it was also among the earliest racially integrated schools in the US. Conspicuously Cuban-Spanish, San Carlos stands out on Duval Street like an exiled bit of Havana. The lobby’s majolica tiles are quite stunning, the auditorium is splendid in a restrained way and the curving mahogany staircase leads to a long, high-ceilinged library where any bibliophile interested in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Cuba would convulse with excitement.",

But Jaques had dissuaded me from participating. ‘That wat is a very sacred site, sacred since the tenth century when King Nanthasen of Sii Khotabun built a wat there. Now its festival has got so run-down it’s what Christians would call a sacrilege. I went last year and left after fifteen minutes, it’s all commercialized, a pop music festival and junk market and fun fair. All our Buddhist festivals are fun, I’m not against the fun input, but this is the wrong conjunction. It’d be OK if it wasn’t where it is when it is. That place, on this night, should have another atmosphere. OK, so you might enjoy it, observing the natives at play – but I doubt that. I guess you’d be upset same way I was.’",

    "target_paragraph": "Another incident a few days later showed how widely they were separated, who had been so close, how little Flush could now count on Miss Barrett for sympathy. After Mr Browning had gone one afternoon Miss Barrett decided to drive to Regent’s Park with her sister. As they got out at the Park gate the door of the four-wheeler shut on Flush’s paw. He ‘cried piteously’ and held it up to Miss Barrett for sympathy. In other days sympathy in abundance would have been lavished upon him for less. But now a detached, a mocking, a critical expression came into her eyes. She laughed at him. She thought he was shamming: ‘… no sooner had he touched the grass than he began to run without a thought of it’, she wrote. And she commented sarcastically, ‘Flush always makes the most of his misfortunes – he is of the Byronic school – il se pose en victime’. But here Miss Barrett, absorbed in her own emotions, misjudged him completely. If his paw had been broken, still he would have bounded. That dash was his answer to her mockery; I have done with you – that was the meaning he flashed at her as he ran. The flowers smelt bitter to him; the grass burnt his paws; the dust filled his nostrils with disillusion. But he raced – he scampered. ‘Dogs must be led on chains’ – there was the usual placard; there were the park-keepers with their top-hats and their truncheons to enforce it. But ‘must’ no longer had any meaning for him. The chain of love was broken. He would run where he liked; chase partridges; chase spaniels; splash into the middle of dahlia beds; break brilliant, blowing red and yellow roses. Let the park-keepers throw their truncheons if they chose. Let them dash his brains out. Let him fall dead, disembowelled, at Miss Barrett’s feet. He cared nothing. But naturally nothing of the kind happened. Nobody pursued him; nobody noticed him. The solitary park-keeper was talking to a nursemaid. At last he returned to Miss Barrett and she absent-mindedly slipped the chain over his neck, and led him home.",

Her eyes went right to the ugly scar above her right breast where the first pacemaker had been implanted and then had to be torn out. Down on her left side, inches above the cesarean scar from Oscar’s birth, was another gash where the new pacemaker had been sewn in. She raised her hand and touched the beef roll that ran from her sternum practically to her navel, a thick braid of keloid scar tissue that made her look like some clumsy seamstress had sewn her together, which was how she felt about her life. She had walked away from her job as vice minister, a position that confirmed her accomplishments and hard work, and left behind the entitlements that had made life bearable for her family, all in exchange for what?",

It was still too small, really, but we were so surf-starved by then that we scrambled out at the first hint of a swell. Thigh-high waves zipped down the reef, most of them too fast to make. The few we made, though, were astounding. They had a slingshot aspect. If you could get in early, top-turn, gather just enough speed that the hook didn’t pass you by, and then set the right line, the wave seemed to lift the tail of the board and hurl it down the line, on and on and on, with the lip throwing just over your back continually—a critical moment that is normally no more than a moment but that seemed to last, impossibly, for half a minute or more. The water got shallower and shallower and even the best rides didn’t end well. But the speed runs were dreamlike. I had never seen a wave peel so mechanically.",

Some were many miles long, while others were confined to a single city or even building, but each aimed to understand a different aspect of the Netherlands’ culture and history – the battle against the rising tides, the ‘Golden Age’ of empire, the Second World War, the effects of immigration, the liberal approach to drugs and prostitution – and how these shaped the Dutch themselves. This book is the story of those journeys. In the course of undertaking them I not only saw the new King inaugurated in Amsterdam, but dressed as a tiger for Easter, got drunk in a world-famous art gallery, had a picnic in a concentration camp, found Noah’s Ark near the North Sea and watched small children put on blackface before Christmas. I even broke the habit of a lifetime and went to a football match. I learned why the Dutch are always cleaning their windows, why prostitutes pay income tax, and why the Netherlands are not quite as liberal as they seem.",

But the radio was invented for a much grander scheme, and if it has a high enough antenna, it can reach its potential. Suddenly, with Fred’s improvements, I could receive all sorts of medium-wave music and news stations in different languages from the surrounding islands.

    "target_paragraph": "Stepping cautiously, they observed the women, who were squatting on the ground in triangular shapes, moving their hands, either plaiting straw or in kneading something in bowls. But when they had looked for a moment undiscovered, they were seen, and Mr Flushing, advancing into the centre of the clearing, was engaged in talk with a lean majestic man, whose bones and hollows at once made the shapes of the Englishman’s body appear ugly and unnatural. The women took no notice of the strangers, except that their hands paused for a moment and their long narrow eyes slid round and fixed upon them with the motionless inexpressive gaze of those removed from each other far far beyond the plunge of speech. Their hands moved again, but the stare continued. It followed them as they walked, as they peered into the huts where they could distinguish guns leaning in the corner, and bowls upon the floor, and stacks of rushes; in the dusk the solemn eyes of babies regarded them, and old women stared out too. As they sauntered about, the stare followed them, passing over their legs, their bodies, their heads, curiously not without hostility, like the crawl of a winter fly. As she drew apart her shawl and uncovered her breast to the lips of her baby, the eyes of a woman never left their faces, although they moved uneasily under her stare, and finally turned away, rather than stand there looking at her any longer. When sweetmeats were offered them, they put out great red hands to take them, and felt themselves treading cumbrously like tight-coated soldiers among these soft instinctive people.. But soon the life of the village took no notice of them; they had become absorbed into it. The women’s hands became busy again with the straw; their eyes dropped. If they moved, it was to fetch something from the hut, or to catch a straying child, or to cross the space with a jar balanced on their heads; if they spoke, it was to cry some harsh unintelligible cry. Voices rose when a child was beaten, and fell again; voices rose in song, which slid up a little way and down a little way, and settled again upon the same low and melancholy note. Seeking each other, Terence and Rachel drew together under a tree. Peaceful, and even beautiful at first, the sight of the women, who had given up looking at them, made them now feel very cold and melancholy.",

As I find that a lady can travel alone with perfect safety, I have many projects in view, but whatever I do or plan to do, I find my eyes always turning to the light on the top of Mauna Loa. I know that the ascent is not feasible for me, and that so far as I am concerned the mystery must remain unsolved; but that glory, nearly 14,000 feet aloft, rising, falling, \"a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night,\" uplifted in its awful loneliness above all human interests, has an intolerable fascination. As the twilight deepens, the light intensifies, and often as I watch it in the night, it seems to flare up and take the form of a fiery palm-tree. No one has ascended the mountain since the activity began a month ago; but the fire is believed to be in \"the old traditional crater of Mokuaweoweo, in a region rarely visited by man.\"",

The datura is sacred (to certain cultists) because of its content of atropine, a powerful narcotic of the alkaloid group capable of inducing visionary hallucinations, as the Indians discovered long before the psychedelic craze began. How they could have made such a discovery without poisoning themselves to death nobody knows; but then nobody knows how so-called primitive man made his many other discoveries. We must concede that science is nothing new, that research, empirical logic, the courage to experiment are as old as humanity.",

She hugged us on first sight, as is the Cuban way, then led us through a short hallway into a spacious drawing-room, rarely used, where the burnished mahogany furniture was nineteenth-century imperial and the high ceiling, of collar-and-beam trusses, had been copied, we later realised, from Casa Diego Velasquez. Here dozens of frighteningly valuable china ornaments were displayed on window ledges, in wall niches and corner cabinets, on numerous frail occasional tables. They ranged from tiny figurines of courting couples to ornate jugs, tall slim vases, dogs sitting and lying, transparent coffee sets, delicate floral bouquets, birds perched on branches and angels perched on clouds. Urgently I warned the Trio – ‘Never run through this room!’",

Run after a cab!” Her mother, frightened and helpless in the depths of the conveyance, entreated: “Oh, don’t let him, Winnie. He’ll get lost. Don’t let him.”",

The walls rise from the cobbles as from lagoons, only people are out all along them, under the laundry which is a drastic exposure in itself, more than for any Kinsey or Gallup, and unless they are playing football they are most often mending something. That is one of three occupations you see anywhere in Europe that are no longer known in America: people walk, they carry, and they mend. Not only women; men are mending too, in thousands of dark bicycle and mattress shops and tiny individual foundries opening on to the same streets, and which may be the family’s windowless kitchen and bedroom as well. What makes these streets Roman, and not those of any old European city, is the demonic energy that goes into everything, and the divine disregard for any other form of life, especially in the football players; also an element of miracle in the way the motorcycles and other traffic get through, shooting straight from hell, without anyone’s changing his expression or pace or direction at all. If a Roman does have to move an inch for your car he looks at you like an affronted emperor; but on the whole American cars are objects of as pure a passion as Romans are capable of. “Oh, what a fine machine!” a woman calls out. “When Baffoni comes that’ll be for me!” Baffoni is Big Whiskers or Stalin—but it was only a gaiety this time, at the sight of a Buick in her living room.",

The road to Mt Airy led through the most beautiful city park I had ever been in. Called Fairmount Park and covering almost 9,000 rolling acres, it is the largest municipal park in America and it is full of trees and fragrant shrubs and bosky glades of infinite charm. It stretches for miles along the banks of the Schuylkill River. We drove through a dreamy twilight. Boats sculled along the water. It was perfection.",

Some had little corrugated-iron shelters that served as changing rooms by the side of the road, and I passed a group of elderly women sitting about five yards from National Highway 223 with their naked breasts and bellies hanging out over their petticoats, waving at me with vigor. Overhead, invisible above the rainclouds, jetliners growled toward Kagoshima airport, and after snaking for thirty minutes through a wet gray gorge, the highway dumped me at the entrance to the Shiohitashi Hot Spring ryokan, which was so crumbling and shabby that I hadn’t the heart to pass it by. I spent the evening there, the only guest, with a painfully hot sulfur bath all to myself; and for conversation, a tired-looking woman with dyed red hair, an azalea-leaf kimono, and a fag hanging out of the corner of her mouth, who lent me her Givenchy soap.",
