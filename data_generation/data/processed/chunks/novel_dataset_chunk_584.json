The Venetian blinds were rose, as was the ceiling, and the walls were covered with a pale gray paper that had a tiny, widely spaced flower design in violet. On one wall hung a silver screen, the kind that rolls up, and against the opposite wall, on each side of a cherrywood table, was a row of chairs covered with rose and gray, glazed chintz bound in violet piping. There was a small projection machine on the table and a young man in evening dress was fumbling with it.",

In the morning there was the smoky old-gold yellow of the sun, the numb excitement of the foggy air, a smell of good tobacco, beer, grilled kidneys, ham and sausages, and grilled tomatoes, a faint nostalgic smell of tea, and incredibly, somehow, in that foggy old-gold light, a smell of coffee – an intolerable, maddening, false, delusive smell, for when one went to find the coffee it would not be there: the coffee was black liquid mud, bitter, lifeless, and undrinkable.",

It is also, like many capitals in politically unstable countries (like Cairo, or Delhi, or Manila, say), a city of whispers. At the next table in the Beijing Restaurant, two Africans were thrashing out “Realpolitik” and “alternative programs,” while, outside, the Mercedes of the hotels and the purring BMWs of the Amhara elite carried their passengers to Christmas feasts, or to places like the Ghion Riviera, where a black-tie band was serenading the plump, and girls were crooning love songs in front of the sunlit swimming pool (“It is strictly forbidden to swim immediately after taking meals”).",

The time had come when he went through all these accustomed acts of pacification as mechanically as a nurse soothing a fretful child. And once he had thought her weeping eloquent! He looked about him at the spacious room, with its heavy hangings of damask and the thick velvet carpet which stifled his steps. Everywhere were the graceful tokens of her presence—the vast lace-draped toilet-table strewn with silver and crystal, the embroidered muslin cushions heaped on the lounge, the little rose-lined slippers she had just put off, the lace wrapper, with a scent of violets in its folds, which he had pushed aside when he sat down beside her; and he remembered how full of a mysterious and intimate charm these things had once appeared to him. It was characteristic that the remembrance made him more patient with her now. Perhaps, after all, it was his failure that she was crying over....",

Toward that end she’d contacted Butch Killian, the Healy coal miner who’d been present when Chris’s body was discovered, and he agreed to drive Walt and Billie into the bus on his all-terrain vehicle. But yesterday Killian called their hotel to say that the Teklanika River was still running high—too high, he worried, to cross safely, even with his amphibious, eight-wheeled Argo. Thus the helicopter.",

I wandered on, smoking contentedly, and at noon sat on a log and looked at the sun shining on the Little Carpathian mountains to the left of the road as I ate my brioches, speck and a banana.

Our goal was to enjoy our passage from West End on Grand Bahama and then sail through the entire Bahama chain. We anticipated several months of smooth sailing before arriving in the northern Turks. We were particularly looking forward to indulging our desire for solitude in the many sparsely populated anchorages along our route. Before we could hide out on deserted islands we had one short detour. The plan was to dock at a marina about half way down Grand Bahama Island for the evening and leave at 2 AM the next morning for Great Stirrup Island. The marina would put us within walking distance of a sight seeing trip and fresh grocery run to Freeport. Because of its close proximity to Florida the Grand Bahama Island marinas can get busy so Wendy volunteered to call up Running Mon Marina and see if she could book a slip.",

Meanwhile, Ned and Dopey had to drive almost non-stop between Fort Worth and the Jolly Trucker over 500 miles one way, relentlessly all week. How quickly they changed their tune when they feared I, a woman driver, might have a better slice of the pie. I clocked their response then put the truck in gear for Texarkana with the pair still looking remarkably somber. Somber and sober. In fact, that was the most sober I ever saw Dopey.",

Feeling extremely guilty, we rang the bell and braced ourselves for a bedraggled hostess rubbing her puffy eyes and pulling at her robe. But when the door flung open, Cecilia was clad in her usual spandexed glory, her eyes wide and lively. Every light was on in the house and we could hear the sound of music and laughter. Grabbing our hands, she led us through the foyer to the kitchen, where neighbors had gathered around the table. A light-skinned man with a handlebar mustache was strumming a flamenco guitar; a coffee-and-cream man was beating a conga. A black woman kept time by rapping a spoon against a half-drunk bottle of rum, while Gregorio— Cecilia’s Creole husband—tilted his chair back and sang.",

The belfry is built separate from the church, and commands a view into the room of the inn that was my bedroom. I could see the small boy walking leisurely from bell to bell, giving each a pull, and then refreshing himself by leaning out and staring hard at me. I got my opera-glasses and examined him with equal care, trying to stare him out of countenance; but though a small he was also a bold boy and not to be abashed, and as I would not give in either we stared at each other steadily between the tolls till nine o'clock, when the bell-ringing ceased, service began, and he reluctantly went down into the church, where I suppose he had to join in the singing of the tune to which in England the hymn beginning 'All glory, laud, and honour,' is sung, for it presently floated out into the quiet little market-place, filling it with the feeling of Sunday. While I lingered at the window listening to this, I saw Mrs. Harvey-Browne emerge from the inn door in her Sunday toque, and, crossing the market-place followed by Brosy, go into the church. In an instant I had whisked into my hat, and hurrying downstairs to the Professor who was strolling up and down a rose-bordered path in the garden at the back of the house, informed him breathlessly that the Harvey-Brownes might now be looked upon as circumvented.",

    "target_paragraph": "Near the end of the nineteenth century, the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius attempted to uncover the cause of ice ages. He calculated that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had the effect of a thermostat; if CO2 levels declined, an ice age resulted. If levels rose, temperatures would rise, too. (As a resident of frosty Sweden, Arrhenius saw this potential warming as a positive development.) The vast majority of the world’s climate scientists now agree that global warming is primarily the result of increased concentrations of gases in the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide, which is emitted during the burning of fossil fuels. Starting around 1850 with the late Industrial Revolution, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have accelerated. Humans have been cranking up the earth’s thermostat ever since.",

Perhaps the horses continually running by, while he had to remain stationary on a little platform with a signboard Honest Jo Pulling, made him restless. He used to say that one race meeting merged into another and life went by as rapidly as a yearling out of Indian Queen. He wanted to slow life up and he quite rightly felt that by travelling he would make time move with less rapidity. You have noticed it yourself, I expect, on a holiday.

The boy was tall, thin, and rather fragile-looking, his face had the sullen, scowling, almost feverish intensity that boys have on such occasions; he stood there indecisively, as if trying to make up his mind, resolve himself, toward his next action; he put a cigarette into his mouth and lighted it and as he did so his hands trembled. He turned up the collar of his overcoat impatiently, glanced grudgingly and nervously about him and stood there smoking.",

Afterwards we settled into our corners with two Charlie Chan detective stories. Jamshyd fell asleep in the front.

In the end, despondent, I trudged back to the station plaza, to the office of the VVV, the state tourist bureau, where I assumed there would be a room-finding service. I went inside and up some stairs and found myself in a hall that brought to mind Ellis Island. There were eight straggly lines of weary tourists, with at least thirty people in each queue. The VVV staff were sending people all over ? to Haarlem, to Delft, to Rotterdam, to The Hague ? because there was not a single hotel room left in Amsterdam at any price. This was only April. What on earth can it be like in July? They must send people to Iceland. A big sign on the wall said NO TICKETS FOR THE VAN GOGH EXHIBITION. SOLD OUT. That was great, too. One of the reasons I had come when I did was to see the exhibition.",

We seemed to frighten them, for they quickened their pace to hurry by without greeting us. A few other groups drove loaded burros up the river bed; green, red and blue skirts, and striped ponchos, made gay flares of colour against the grey stones. There is nothing here for Juana to eat – not even withered weeds – so we firmly waylaid an old man, almost invisible under a load of dry maize stalks, and bought a bundle for ten soles. I wanted him to take twenty but he refused: evidently ten is the market price.",

The lorry reached the incline to the ford, flew headlong into the water, upset and all but killed the men in front, and in ten seconds had been carried too far down by the current to make the exit on the other side. It backed, turned its nose from the stream, and sailed along the river at thirty miles an hour, followed by a yelling mob of bearded torsos in skull-caps, who were just in time to give it a further shove on to dry land at a second ford further down. Not a drop of water had reached the vital parts of the engine.",

For the time being all bright points in his life were blotted out; all prominences levelled. At first he made himself believe that Katharine had treated him badly, and drew comfort from the thought that, left alone, she would recollect this, and think of him and tender him, in silence, at any rate, an apology. But this grain of comfort failed him after a second or two, for, upon reflection, he had to admit that Katharine owed him nothing. Katharine had promised nothing, taken nothing; to her his dreams had meant nothing. This, indeed, was the lowest pitch of his despair. If the best of one’s feelings means nothing to the person most concerned in those feelings, what reality is left us? The old romance which had warmed his days for him, the thoughts of Katharine which had painted every hour, were now made to appear foolish and enfeebled. He rose, and looked into the river, whose swift race of dun-coloured waters seemed the very spirit of futility and oblivion.",

Our side of the piazza was already in the shade; but the sun still shone on the palace and its tall slender tower, making their rosy brickwork glow as though by inward fire. An immense concourse of people filled the square and all the tiers of seats round it. There were people in every window, even on the roofs. At the Derby, on boat-race days, at Wembley I have seen larger crowds; but never, I think, so many people confined within so small a space.",

Durbanites are inexplicably proud of their ‘modern infrastructure’, some of which now lay below me: six motorways, on three separate levels, turning and twisting and twining around one another like a pit of demented snakes. I had to walk the last few miles to the centre, past serried blocks of commercial high-risery. This port city is almost as uncongenial as Jo’burg, without the highveld compensation of a pleasant climate; Durban’s humid heat is hellish. The friends with whom I am staying, in the most affluent Indian ‘location’, tell me I’m seeing the place at its worst. During the Easter holidays multitudes of Vaalies descend on this ‘Fun Capital of South Africa’ to enjoy the Golden Mile – in fact three and a half miles of beach where everything in sight is the very quintessence of vulgarity – and to romp amidst the gaudy plastic and concrete delights of Funworld and Waterland: go-karts, boat rides, motor chutes, aerial cableways. The Vaalies’ unpopularity may be gauged from a remarkable advertisement in today’s Natal Mercury:",

Then we were addressed by Calin Nemes, a frail-looking young actor who works in Cluj’s puppet theatre and was the first to defy the armed forces on 21 December, when he is said to have emerged from the crowd, knelt in front of the soldiers (some, it is believed, were disguised Securitate) and shouted, ‘Kill me if you will! Jos Ceausescu!’ A moment later Captain Dando Carp cocked his pistol and Calin was shot in the stomach. The following burst of automatic fire killed eight. Later the army alleged that Calin had just left a nearby bar and was drunk. The shooting was immediately investigated by Colonel Tit Liviu Domsa, who arrested two officers and sent a report to Bucharest – whereupon the officers were released and the Colonel was posted elsewhere. Subsequently the editor of the army newspaper, Colonel Gheorghe Vaduva, wrote an article alleging that ‘The army was provoked into shooting and a terrible tragedy ensued … They did not shoot at the people. They fired warning shots into the air, but the guns moved around in their hands.’ As the Professor remarked, this was yet another example of the impossibility of establishing the truth about any aspect of Rumania’s revolution.",

Having rung the Viazul office to book our seats, she organised a cut-price taxi to the terminus and arranged for us to lodge in Santiago with her old friend Irma.\n\nCHAPTER III",

We packed more than Katz wanted—I insisted on sleeping bags, warm clothes, and our tents on the grounds that this could be a good deal more demanding than Katz appreciated—but I agreed to leave behind the stove, gas bottles, and pots and pans. We would eat cold stuff—principally Snickers, raisins, and an indestructible type of salami product called Slim Jims. It wouldn’t kill us for a fortnight. Besides, I couldn’t face another bowl of noodles. Altogether we saved perhaps five pounds of weight each—hardly anything really—but Katz seemed disproportionately happy.

    "target_paragraph": "The horror of today’s trek really was extreme with heat visibly flowing towards me in malevolent waves off the mountainsides and the dreadful desert stench of burning sand – which still persists here – nauseating me; the terrifying dehydration of mouth and nostrils and eyes until my eyelids could barely move and a sort of staring blindness came on, with the ghastly sensation of scorching air filling my lungs, and the overpowering drug-like effect of the wild thyme and sage, that grow thickly over the last few miles, being ‘distilled’ by the sun; and above all the despair of coming round corners and over hilltops time and time again, hoping always to see water – and never seeing it. I have often thought that death by thirst must be grimmer than most deaths and now my surmise has been confirmed. The irony of it all was that all day the vast, swirling Indus flowed beside me, inaccessible. But what a magnificent valley it is! Though I could have done without this afternoon’s instalment, I wouldn’t have liked to miss this morning’s panoramas; the rough track soared up and up and up the sheer black and beige mountainsides till even the tremendous roar of the Indus was inaudible and it looked a mere bit of brown ribbon, coiling for miles in both directions between its colossal, but now dwarfed, cliffs. From these the desert swept flatly to the foot of gigantic peaks, some of them almost level with the track. Occasionally, on the other side of the river, there was an unexpected oasis, around a nullah, inhabited by Indus gold searchers. These are a brown-skinned people unlike the other tribes of the area and they are much despised by the local farming-folk, who consider that searching for gold is a menial occupation! (From my distance those meagre oases, as they stood out on the level ‘table’ of sand, reminded me of the little wooden trees I had as a child with my toy farm. I saw several of the ‘gold-men’ by the river’s edge, perilously scooping and sieving in quest of that Indus gold which is supposed to be one of the best in Asia. Incidentally, a peculiar kind of precious stone is found around Punial and Gilgit – like an opal but better. I don’t know if they belonged to ancient peoples or not but all local women have at least one in their necklaces.) Sometimes the ‘gold-men’ cross the river by inflating two goatskins, laying planks across them and paddling over; naturally they land about ten miles downstream because of the ferociously swift current, but they rarely have an accident.",
