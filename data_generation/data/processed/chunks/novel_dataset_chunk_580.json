Soon we came to the rock wilderness where Abdul Rahim, who had up to now been travelling barefooted with his shoes slung round his neck, stopped to put them on. I could see no difference in the going, most of the way the track itself had been equally rough. Perhaps like Irish peasants who are reputed to carry their boots to the church door, he sensed that he was nearing civilization.",

I lay in wait for them, letting them land on my bare legs and stroll about a bit looking for a choice, juicy spot, and just as they were getting ready to dig in, I took them by surprise. I squished one fly between two fingers, impaled it on a small hook with no float or sinker, and cast the line into the river. It floated on the surface first, but after the fly got wet, it went under. I lost a few flies before I succeeded in catching a minnow.",

I do not say that it is always—or often—to be seen on our tables, for the steaming of a potato is one of the great achievements of culinary art; but, when it is set before you, how flesh and spirit exult! A modest palate will find more than simple comfort in your boiled potato of every day, as served in the decent household. New or old, it is beyond challenge delectable. Try to think that civilized nations exist to whom this food is unknown—nay, who speak of it, on hearsay, with contempt! Such critics, little as they suspect it, never ate a potato in their lives. What they have swallowed under that name was the vegetable with all its exquisite characteristics vulgarized or destroyed. Picture the \"ball of flour\" (as old-fashioned housewives call it) lying in the dish, diffusing the softest, subtlest aroma, ready to crumble, all but to melt, as soon as it is touched; recall its gust and its after-gust, blending so consummately with that of the joint, hot or cold. Then think of the same potato cooked in any other way, and what sadness will come upon you!",

    "target_paragraph": "Legend has it that Dwarka was once the kingdom of Lord Krishna, submerged in the ocean after the epic Mahabharata war. Archaeologists believe that Dwarka emerged and then disappeared under water on a further seven occasions, but the town’s main interest was now the Dwarkadhish temple, which sits on the banks of the Gomati river. Around the corner from the limestone structure a carnival of pilgrims bopped along the street, pushing a wooden cart fixed with three megaphones. Revellers wore marigold cravats and pumped both arms in the air, as shop owners and residents leant out of doors and windows to join in the merriment. Kids jiggled on fathers’ shoulders and families danced their way towards the water’s edge, carrying paper boats filled with flowers and flames to immerse beside shoes that were now bobbing on the water, lapped off the steps by the rising tide.",

Eileen welcomed me to the bar where beer cans from all over the world decorate walls and ceiling. My fellow-drinkers, a bunch of tall tanned sinewy young sheep-farmers, ignored the uitlander. ‘Their English is poor,’ Eileen apologized. ‘And they could be shy, we’re not on the tourist route.’ Then Marie arrived, an attractive young woman who was automatically served with a gin and tonic – a sign she does not belong to the dorp scene, where everyone drinks beer or brandy and Coke. Eileen introduced her as an SADF officer from Stellenbosch.",

In the grocers’ shops I stopped in for refreshment I was told again and again and again how small a country Japan is, and asked what military base I was from. If I was in a conversational mood, I would sometimes take the opportunity to point out that Japan is twice the size of my country, larger than all but three of the something-like-thirty countries of Europe, that Holland (from where many of Japan’s original ideas about the outside world came from) is one-twentieth Japan’s size, and that Switzerland (which Japanese advertisements depict as a vast, airy country with great tracts of pasture and limitless ski slopes) would fit comfortably inside the island of Kyushu. I didn’t take this opportunity too often, though, because I could see that I was not believed; and if I had added that I was neither in the military nor even an American, I should have run the risk of being hounded out of the shops as an inveterate liar.",

There was clangour, excitement, vast curiosity in the family about the purchase, but no clear conception of what had really happened. Gant and Eliza, although each felt dumbly that they had come to a decisive boundary in their lives, talked vaguely about their plans, spoke of Dixieland evasively as ‘a good investment,’ said nothing clearly. In fact, they felt their approaching separation instinctively: Eliza’s life was moving by a half-blind but inevitable gravitation toward the centre of its desire – the exact meaning of her venture she would have been unable to define, but she had a deep conviction that the grouping urge which had led her so blindly into death and misery at Saint Louis had now impelled her in the right direction. Her life was on the rails.",

The thick, dusty air of Achinsk coats grass blades to death and desertifies everything in a wide radius around the city. Still forty minutes away from it, we rolled up the windows and sweltered in the van rather than breathe the emanations of Achinsk. Skirting the city at a far remove, we never actually saw it but only its cement-dust cloud, which densified to a dark gray at what I took to be the city’s middle. For a second or two a haze-blurred smokestack could be seen.",

The pastel-perfect new hotels are less than a day away from barrier reefs, crocodile forests, and sere spaces: even the high-flying elegance of Sydney’s Opera House is shadowed by the rooted, runic magic of Ayers Rock. Some of the popular myths about Australia may be little more than myths (a visitor can spend three weeks in the country without seeing a ’roo or meeting a Bruce), but some are undoubtedly true. They do play lagerphones here, made entirely of beer-bottle caps; the long a is an endangered species; and in the “Red Centre,” fat flies do drop like men.",

For Boylston had one quality which always impresses youth: Boylston knew everybody. Whether you went with him to a smart restaurant in the rue Royale, or to a wine-shop of the Left Bank, the patron welcomed him with the same cordiality, and sent the same emphatic instructions to the cook. The first fresh peas and the tenderest spring chicken were always for this quiet youth, who, when he was alone, dined cheerfully on veal and vin ordinaire. If you wanted to know where to get the best Burgundy, Boylston could tell you; he could also tell you where to buy an engagement ring for your girl, a Ford run-about going at half-price, or the papier timbré on which to address a summons to a recalcitrant laundress.",
