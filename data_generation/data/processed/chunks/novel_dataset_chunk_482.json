Roy went off in the early morning with a .22 rifle to bag game; I wandered in the village bazaar, Burma rubies and eggs in banana-leaf baskets and pretty little Burmese women bathing under a tap. The Japanese usually bombed Kunming between 10 and 11 a.m. but it was unsafe to count on their schedule. Today they were late. We hung about sweating, which made a nice change, until the radio reported that twenty-seven Jap planes had bombed Kunming at 1 p.m. for half an hour but were now gone, so we could take off. Back as we’d come, over the Burma Road by daylight, beautiful, hopeless country, jagged mountain after mountain and a brown ribbon of road. Those hot green mountains were breeding grounds for the malarial mosquito; malignant malaria, which is fatal, was another hazard of the road journey. We landed at Kunming at five-thirty in the afternoon dark, a city shrouded in smoke and lit by fires.",

A fast-dealing black marketeer who seemed to run an entire network of agents in Maymyo commanded the eternal fealty of his minions through nothing more than his honey-tongued English—“Mr. Ahmed,” announced his followers with pride, “was educated at St. Albert’s Mission School.” A bookseller in Rangoon, as I tried to peddle a paperback copy of Mailer’s latest novel, engaged me in a learned discussion on the prospects of the Great American Novel. And one bright afternoon, a withered old crone suddenly emerged from the shadows of one of the capital’s lofty monuments to civic disrepair. “Money breeds money, brother,” she began, tugging at my sleeve. “Brother, I ask for two minutes of your time, maybe three.” She proceeded to make a spirited case for some ad hoc redistribution of income. Then, with Latinate decorum, she concluded by restating her principal theme: “You see—money, I believe, breeds money.”",

There were men of power, with areas of influence; there were regional elected courts. And such regulations were necessary because the lake was full of people and the lake was rich. It provided for all. It provided weeds and mud for vegetable plots. A boy twirled his bent pole in the water, lifted, and he had a bundle of rich, dripping lake weed. It provided fodder for animals. It provided reeds for thatching. It provided fish, so numerous in the clear water that they could be seen just below the steps of the busy ghat. On some days the lake was dotted with fishermen who seemed to be walking on water: they stood erect and still on the edge of their barely moving shikaras, their tridents raised, their eyes as sharp as those of the kingfishers on the willows.",

    "target_paragraph": "George Seferis, a contemporary Greek poet, wrote in one of his poems: “we are made of grass.” I never quite liked that analogy. It attempts to photosynthesize our animal nature! So, let us make an insolent retort in raw prose: We are made of tender, juicy, warm, tasty flesh. Edible flesh, just like the meat of any other animal. It is because of this that we are all cannibals still! Not because we eat one another (although killing one another is just as bad). We are cannibals because we are potentially edible flesh. Apologizing to psychologists and other possible research scientists studying the subject, I have my own strange theory: Our never-ending fascination with the subject of human cannibalism, as well as the lure of stories and movies on the subject, is traceable to our ability to visualize our own bodies being consumed by any animal, including another human. In the same way the death of another person disturbs us, in great part because we can project onto him thoughts of our own mortality, the act of cannibalism disturbs us because we can project on the human who is being devoured our own edible flesh. And the reason we can instinctively do this is that deep down, we are still cannibals.",

The whole thing looked dangerous and unsteady, as if any minute it would topple over. She knew John was there. Something awful was happening to him, and he wanted her.\nWhen she stepped on the bridge the river swelled and humped itself up to the arch. It flooded. The bridge walls made a channel for the gush. It curled over the bank and came curving down the slant road from the ramparts, heavy and clear, like melted glass.\nShe climbed up and up through the water and round behind the fortress to the street at the top. She could see the thin tower break and lean forward like a red crane above the houses. She had to get to the top before the street fell down. John was shut up in the last house. She ran under the tower as it fell.\nThe house stood still, straight and tall. John was lying in the dark room behind the closed shutters. He wanted her. She could hear him calling to her \"Jeanne! Jeanne!\" She couldn't see in. She couldn't open the door.\n\"Jeanne!\"\nThe wall split off and leaned forward.\nShe woke suddenly to the tapping and splashing of the rain.",

If she could only cry now, cry for a long time, over everything, beginning with her first place and the cruel cook, going on to the doctor's, and then the seven little ones, death of her husband, the children's leaving her, and all the years of misery that led up to Lennie. But to have a proper cry over all these things would take a long time. All the same, the time for it had come. She must do it. She couldn't put it off any longer; she couldn't wait any more... Where could she go?\n\"She's had a hard life, has Ma Parker.\" Yes, a hard life, indeed! Her chin began to tremble; there was no time to lose. But where? Where?\nShe couldn't go home; Ethel was there. It would frighten Ethel out of her life. She couldn't sit on a bench anywhere; people would come arsking her questions. She couldn't possibly go back to the gentleman's flat; she had no right to cry in strangers' houses.

Beyond Thabazimbi I turned off the R510 and soon low mountains surrounded me – steep, rocky, thinly forested – and for hours the landscape was dominated by a shapely, conical 6,000-footer slightly to the north. Sometimes the track was squeezed between high cliffs, creeper-draped. Sometimes the mountains drew back, leaving grazing-space for herds of glossy red-brown Afrikaner cattle who thrive on the matching red-brown bush as imported breeds do not. A few farm entrances appeared but no farmstead – or any other building. We met only two bakkies; both farmers were nonplussed when I declined their kind offers of a lift. As I brunched on a bridge, high above a wide, dry, rocky river-bed, hundreds of baboons entertained me – the babies playful, the adolescents daring, the mothers anxious, the fathers abusive. All day it remained overcast, the breeze cool: perfect cycling weather.",

In Denali, leaders were far more involved with deciding the way things got done. We ordered equipment, designed and gave trainings, kept inventories, surveyed trails, wrote evaluations, and oversaw progress. Most of which was satisfying stuff. Gabe, whose job became subject to furlough a few seasons in (a step up from seasonal, yet blessedly, still impermanent), did even more logistics—parkwide presentations, all-employee meetings, NPS indoctrination trainings. In exchange for these upgrades, Gabe got us health insurance and the first 401(k) plan of our lives, and we both got new challenges. The trouble is, sometimes I’d go a whole day without picking up a shovel. Between the supervisory role and light-duty months because of persistent injuries, I often traded the mattock for the keyboard, the chainsaw for the camera.",

It was Mr. Weston who piled up these definitions; his wife, with nervous frowning lips, remarked that such a long journey would wear Vance out, and do away beforehand with all the good of the rest he had been ordered to take; and that, if the sea was too far off, she didn’t see why the air of the Lakes wasn’t just as bracing.

This was the house built, according to the natives of Bolahun, with forced labour.

Hermann Pape had offered to drive us in his car, and we so gladly accepted. It was a lively party in Hermann’s sedan with plenty of food and things to drink. We bumped along the rocky road and passed people walking briskly with youth. Old people padded along and stepped aside to let us pass. Women and men rode bourriques and horses. They went any way they could, but they went. It is the great annual “going up” in Haiti. When it came time to ford a river with the car, we paused. The men went in for a swim and the women spread the table beside the stream and we ate, ascended spiritually a little on the beauty of the scenery and drove on to Ville Bonheur.",

Think of the racist Archie Bunker, who you nonetheless loved like your own father. As you’d imagine, coming up with your parents’ flaws is not difficult. But what I found wonderful was how easy it was to come up with what was special about them as well. The process of writing all of us, even in an only partially accurate way, was the most therapeutic thing I’d ever done. Years of actual therapy had helped me understand my family better, but hadn’t really made a dent in the amount my parents could drive me crazy. But writing the pilot did. My dad and stepmother and I had moved past the lawsuit and four-year estrangement a few years earlier, but I still had lingering resentment toward them for causing the first and biggest heartbreak of my life. Writing the pilot somehow finished all of that off.",

These, it is argued (usually by people who have never set foot in Africa) would enhance Black children’s self-esteem, allegedly damaged by pictures of shanty towns, mud huts, medicine men in sinister attire, women carrying water from distant wells and other such ‘stereotyping’ images. Yet city centres like Nairobi’s illustrate the most shameful aspect of modern Africa, not its achievements. Millions live in shanty towns, patients must depend on medicine men and women must carry water because African politicians are so addicted to motorways, limousines and architectural excesses. However, facing such facts is as distasteful to extreme anti-racists as to the West’s donor governments, the World Bank, and the many UN and other agencies who find it expedient to evade or distort African realities.",

Yet sun it was not, and space-ship it was.\nCape Canaveral was just beyond the dark horizon, and the light was being produced by a Space X rocket, hauling a satellite into orbit. I had read about the scheduled rocket launch but was expecting it for the following evening, as it was scheduled for 1:21 am, May 6, and we had departed St Augustine the evening of May 5th, but of course, it was now early in the morning on May 6th.\nAfter deploying its payload into the sky, the rocket safely returned to Earth, landing on a floating barge in the ocean, and a dim light shown on the eastern horizon as it decelerated for a successful touchdown, only the second rocket ever to return to earth without being destroyed in the process. In addition to the rocket launch, I also had the Aquarid meteor shower to view during my late-night watch. This was the meteor shower I had planned to watch while canoeing and camping in the Okefenokee. Our trip to the Bahamas was off to a good start!",

And the pressing sense on every side of the end of Empire pushes him towards much larger thoughts of ruin and decline (to a Buddhist, he might be reminding us, every meeting ends in a departure). The book begins with its narrator in a hospital “in a state of almost total immobility.”",
