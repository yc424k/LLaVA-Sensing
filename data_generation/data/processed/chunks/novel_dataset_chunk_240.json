It was in Audrey's house in Chelsea, the little brown house with discreet white storm-shutters, that stands back from the Embankment, screened by the narrow strip of railed plantation known as Chelsea Gardens. Here or hereabouts Hardy was to be met with at any hour of the day; and late one July evening he had settled himself, as usual, near a certain \"cosy corner\" in the big drawing-room. His face, and especially his nose, was bronzed with recent exercise in sun and wind, his hair was limp with the steam of his own speed, and on his forehead his hat had left its mark in a deep red cincture. His loose shooting jacket, worn open, displayed a flannel shirt, white, but not too white. This much of Hardy was raised and supported on his elbow; the rest of him, encased in knickerbockers, stockings, and exceedingly muddy boots, sprawled with a naïve abandonment at the feet of the owner of the drawing-room. Lying in this easy attitude, he delivered himself of the following address—",

I find myself in the kitchen: an old gas cooker stands in the corner, its white front splattered with what looks like ink; an assortment of empty jugs and other vessels are lined up along the mantelpiece. The air smells stale, dead. I rest my backpack on a chair, sitting it upright as if it were a friend.",

When the burial party reached Doo Lough, where so many had died, there was not enough earth to bury the bodies, except in the little glen or ravine which ran down the brow of the cliff between Stroppabue and Doo Lough. ‘So,’ recorded Berry, ‘they had to gather all the corpses and carry them to the little glen where they buried them in pits just as on a battlefield, and there they lie sleeping where the sighing of the winds through the tall, wild ferns which wave above their nameless graves forever sings their requiem.’",

Just down the street from Cary and Pipo, Lili Durand Hernández went around her apartment shutting all the windows and doors as much to keep out the storm as to keep in her elderly father, who had started to wander. About a mile away, in the rundown center of Guanabacoa, María del Carmen López Álvarez remembered what her own father had always told her about their sturdy little house, which the family had owned for more than a century. If it survived the big ones in 1926 and 1944, he’d say whenever a storm approached, it’ll make it through any others. She had so much faith in the old house that the only precautions she took were to have the TV antenna taken down and the big clay pot, called a tinajón, in the patio filled with fresh water. And just to be safe, she asked her son to take the life-size busts of Julius Caesar and Raphael off their pedestals and lay them on the floor.",

To think of it was mind-boggling. Some of them could have been alive at the time of the Louisiana Purchase, or during the reign of Napoleon. One of these animals might have already been a hundred years old before construction of the Panama Canal started. Reluctantly, we made our way back to the taxi. Oscar waited patiently.",

One, La Stella, is connected to the island; and two, Lo Scopolo (home of the blue lizards) and the prosaically named Grotta dell'Arsenale, are joined by a natural archway, through which one sails in bliss. One feels that this rock is more than rock, that if one looks hard enough—or loves hard enough—it will yield meaning. One never forgets the Faraglioni; that is meaning enough. Perhaps these rocks are a lesson in the meaning of time and the intersection of time and space—it is impossible to imagine the world without this landscape—they obliterate time by looking as if they had been there forever . . . and also by looking sculpted, for which another word is created.",

It remained popular well into the 1950s—as late as 1956 it had thirteen hundred hotels and guesthouses, ten times the number it has today—but its descent from greatness had begun long before. The famous Central Pier was extensively damaged by a fire in the 1930s, then gradually sank into an embarrassing wreck. By 1990 the town officials had removed it from the local map—simply pretended that the derelict heap projecting into the sea, dominating the front, wasn’t there. The West End Pier, meanwhile, was swept away by a winter storm in 1974. The magnificent Alhambra music hall burned down in 1970 and the Royalty Theatre was razed to make way for a shopping center two years later.",

Crossed roof beams supported the thick thatch and split bamboo walls were nailed to a wooden framework; on one hung sheaves of tobacco leaves, on another a small phi shrine. Between the doors, Mr Phyvan had built a large mud-brick fireplace, a foot high, edged with stones. The smoke escaped through two little windows until at sunset the shutters were closed and it drifted around the room. But everyone took care to feed the flames cleverly, keeping smoke to the minimum. High above the fire hung an enormous shallow wicker basket containing soup bowls, cooking implements, condiments and precious seeds for the next rice planting. Only a few age-polished stools – six inches high, eight inches wide, twelve inches long – furnished the Phyvan home. For me a mat was unrolled in a corner near the fire.",

    "target_paragraph": "Sam departed. He would not live in the camp; he had built himself a little hut something like Joe Baker’s, only stouter, tighter, on the bayou a quarter-mile away, and a stout log crib where he stored a little corn for the shoat he raised each year. The next morning he was waiting when they waked. He had already found the colt. They did not even wait for breakfast. It was not far, not five hundred yards from the stable—the three-months’ colt lying on its side, its throat torn out and the entrails and one ham partly eaten. It lay not as if it had been dropped but as if it had been struck and hurled, and no cat-mark, no claw-mark where a panther would have gripped it while finding its throat. They read the tracks where the frantic mare had circled and at last rushed in with that same ultimate desperation with which she had whirled on Sam Fathers yesterday evening, and the long tracks of dead and terrified running and those of the beast which had not even rushed at her when she advanced but had merely walked three or four paces toward her until she broke, and General Compson said, “Good God, what a wolf!”",

    "target_paragraph": "We purchased cups of warming coffee and took them to a set of long tables, where we sat with a sprinkling of other steamy hikers and ate our packed lunches. The lodge was very congenial in a basic and rustic sort of way, with a high ceiling and plenty of room to move around. When we’d finished, I was beginning to stiffen up, so I got up to move around and looked in on one of the two dormitories. It was a large room, packed with built-in bunks stacked four high. It was clean and airy, but startlingly basic, and presumably would be like an army barracks at night when it was full of hikers and their equipment. It didn’t look remotely appealing to me. Benton MacKaye had nothing to do with these huts, but they were absolutely in accord with his vision—spare, rustic, wholesomely communal—and I realized with a kind of dull shock that if his dreams of a string of trailside hostels had been realized this is precisely how they would have been. My fantasy of a relaxed and cosy refuge with a porchful of rockers would actually have been rather more like a spell at boot camp (and an expensive one at that, if the AMC’s fees were anything to go by).",

    "target_paragraph": "Another, more successful attempt to tighten liberal rules concerned prostitution. As with the permissive drug rules, a laissez-faire attitude to sex-for-sale, provided it was voluntary and no children were involved, had long been one of the defining features of the tolerant Dutch state. And like cannabis, the effects of this approach were most evident in Amsterdam – including on my walk to work. Living in Rotterdam, I would take the train to the Dutch capital each morning, and then walk for about twenty minutes to my office in the canal district, passing through alleyways with high black-painted walls that zig-zagged like a river canyon. About halfway to work, deep in the canyon, I would pass by a row of windows used by prostitutes. Squeezed in between a small butcher’s shop and a youth hostel, the half dozen windows were decorated with a single red lamp outside and red velvet curtains on the inside, usually pulled back to reveal the plastic-covered beds awaiting within. The women themselves (and they were always women) would sit on high stools between the curtains, pouting at passers-by or fiddling with their mobile phones. Childishly scrawled signs in the windows gave the women’s names together with some of the services they offered: ‘TANYA – MASSAGE’, ‘ANNA: SPEAKS ENGLISH’, ‘EVELYN: S&M, ANAL’.",

When Honey saw that I was approaching the exit she went into her noisy leaping, blowing and chattering routine, ripping back and forth in front of me. Only after I had finished my reconnaissance and turned back into the lagoon did she calm down. She swam up beside the motoring dinghy and kept pace with an almost imperceptible movement of her tail, once again putting her pectoral fin over the side for me to hold.",

When darkness fell I donned my luminous vest though the traffic had almost ceased. On Entebbe’s maze of unlit streets there was nobody around of whom to ask directions; during the Terror Ugandans developed the habit of retreating indoors at dusk. Then at last I was rescued by a kind askari who deserted his post outside the posh Victoria Hotel and leaped on his bicycle to lead me through impenetrable blackness to the secluded EC compound – so secluded that without guidance I might not have found it before dawn.",

Although Michel Aflaq, one of the founders of the Ba’ath Party, was a Christian, as was Faris al-Khuri, a leading figure in the Syrian Nationalist movement who later became Prime Minister, anti-Christian feeling was widespread (and, in the post-colonial circumstances, understandable). There were attempts to make Islam the official religion of the country, and at one stage the imam of the Great Mosque in Damascus declared that as far as he was concerned, an Indonesian Muslim was closer to him than al-Khuri, his own (Christian) Prime Minister. The increasingly Islamic tone of the Syrian establishment led to perhaps a quarter of a million Christians leaving Syria throughout the 1960s; from Aleppo alone as many as 125,000 Armenians emigrated to Soviet Armenia. These refugees included the current Armenian President, Levon Ter Petrosyan.",

Unfortunately, several factors still stood in the way of peace. First was the question of trust. In 1982, the government of Belisario Betancur had declared a general amnesty, leading to a cease-fire that brought the FARC to the negotiating table two years later. From these talks emerged the Unión Patriótica, the Patriotic Union, a party conceived as the legitimate political arm of the FARC, a first step toward bringing the entire revolutionary movement out of the hills and potentially into the halls of Congress, as legally elected representatives of their constituents.",
