The chicha stalls also offered buckets full of salted pigs’ trotters, and dishes of delicious firm brown trotters’ jelly which we were told is rich in protein; some campesinos are unexpectedly nutrition-conscious. Down a side-street several merchants were selling, for a few soles each, what looked like fifth-hand sex-and-violence comics and soft-porn magazines. These prompted negative thoughts about the value of literacy in the sierra.",

The road was all downhill, but cycling remained out of the question – one simply pushed and edged one’s way through dense masses of buffaloes, cows, camels, horses, mules, donkeys, jennets, goats, sheep, kids, lambs, men, women and children. Of course, every day since crossing the Top I’ve been meeting these caravans, but today the migration was in full swing. Fortunately all the animals are blasé, widely-travelled creatures who take Roz in their stride. It was difficult for me, and dangerous for the riders, when a bicycle appeared suddenly in those parts where machines are almost unknown, causing horses and mules to shy and buck on the verges of precipices. (Today, I almost shied and went over a precipice when I saw my first machine – a jeep – since leaving Chilas a week ago!)",

But I had got so far to the front now that I didn’t want to turn back.

At the same time we were supplied with the splendid full-length cloaks of lambskin for which we had lately been measured. For each of these, sixty skins were used. On the same day we went for a walk in the town and in our Tibetan cloaks attracted no attention. We wanted to see everything. The inner town is composed of nothing but stores. Shops extend in unbroken lines and the dealers overflow into the street. There are no shop-windows in our sense of the word. One finds numbers of general stores containing a large range of goods from needles to rubber boots; near them smart shops selling draperies and silks. Provision stores contain, as well as local produce, American corned beef, Australian butter and Scotch whisky. There is nothing one cannot buy, or at least order. One even finds the Elizabeth Arden specialities, and there is a keen demand for them. American overshoes, dating from the last war, are displayed between joints of yak’s meat and chunks of butter. You can order, too, sewing-machines, radio sets and gramophones and hunt up Bing Crosby’s latest records for your next party. The gaily dressed crowds of shoppers laugh and haggle and shout. They find a special pleasure in bargaining, which to be enjoyed must be long drawn out. Here you can see a nomad exchanging yak-hair for snuff, and nearby a society lady with a swarm of servants wallowing for hours in a mountain of silks and brocades. The nomad women are no less particular in selecting Indian cotton lengths for their prayer-flags.",

There was humor even in his nose with its\nsubtle curve, the slender length of its bridge, and its tip, wide\nspread, and like his mouth and eyes, slightly uptilted.",

Most small-town Bon dances take place in school playgrounds or in the spaces in front of public buildings. Here, as usual, a little tower had been set up in the middle of the dancing area and hung with red and white festival cloths that twisted and flapped in the northern wind. The tower houses the source of the music, whether live or recorded, and the two small makeshift taiko tied to the rail at the top of this one were hardly larger than saucepan lids. Children clambered up and down the tower ladder and took turns banging the taiko, but the sound they produced was inaudible above the hideously amplified noise of The Ventures playing ‘Jingle Bell Rock’.",

When the hop-scotchers gave up at noon Zea and I settled to rummy, the others being in sudoku mode. Not long after an elderly man approached – wiry and fine-featured, wearing a kind expression and an air of authority. Shaking hands with Rachel and me he addressed us both as compañera and introduced himself as Wilfredo. (First names are the norm in Castro’s Cuba; the President being universally known as ‘Fidel’ is not quirky.) Were we waiting for public transport or expecting a friend to arrive? If no vehicle came we could sleep in the Turquino National Park rangers’ hut: he pointed to it, on a ledge beyond the village. Meanwhile would we like some refreshment? A milky hot chocolate drink? Fresh orange juice? Like puppies at feeding time the Trio yelped with excitement.",

The men were bad enough, but the women were worse and the children were the worst of all. Nothing could keep them off, and the excitement reached a climax when ’Abd ul Hamed Pasha Druby, the richest man in Homs, came to call, bringing with him the Kādi Muhammad Sāid ul Khāni. I could not pay as much attention to their delightful and intelligent conversation as it deserved, owing to the seething crowd that surrounded us, but an hour later I returned their call at the Pasha’s fine new house at the gate of the town, accompanied thither by at least three hundred people. I must have breathed a sigh of relief when the door closed upon my escort, for as I established myself in the cool and quiet liwān, ’Abd ul Hamed said:",

Dave pointed out the exit doors for use in case of emergency, the seven days’ worth of provisions in case of an emergency touchdown in a remote area and the Mossberg .540 shotgun “in case we need to walk anywhere” after an unscheduled landing. The plane was loud, and we talked through headsets. Kyle ran through the now familiar list of dos and don’ts with regard to bear encounters?do make noise, don’t run?and I have to admit I zoned out a bit, as one tends to do while hearing safety instructions prior to takeoff for the thousandth time. Kyle’s enhanced bear safety techniques left me more concerned about any animal’s potential welfare than my own anyway. “Obviously, I do have a firearm and I’ll fire a warning shot,” he said. “If that doesn’t work, I’ll use deadly force.”",

Music played a leading part in all these households. The sound of practising winds along passages, sheet music and bound scores scatter the furniture. The variously shaped instrument cases gathering dust in the attics, bear witness to palmier days when the family and its staff and its guests would assemble for symphonies. Now and then, the pipes of an organ cluster in the hall, and a gilt harp gleams in a corner of the library with all its strings intact.",

John Sartoris had sat so on this veranda and watched his two daily trains emerge from the hills and cross the valley into the hills, with lights and smoke and a noisy simulation of speed.

The monstrous pig is spread-eagled across the mud, snoring, oblivious to the people having to step over her. I know it’s the same pig because the lacy bra is next to her like bounty. There’s a racoon-type creature making a loud, aggressive beeping noise, his tail at a right angle to the ground, working hard to dig underneath the door of one of the buildings. It’s also the way the jungle just hangs over everything, shutting out any semblance of light or space. I haven’t come far from the road. The sky was turning red there, now I cannot see the sky.

This money slipped quickly through their careless fingers. Down to a few coins again, with the next pay-day almost two weeks off, Sinker gambled at dice with the checkers, behind the great fortress of sacked oats upon the pier – lost, won, lost, rose penniless and cursing God. Eugene knelt beside the checkers, with his last half-dollar in his palm, heedless of Sinker’s bitter taunt. He had never thrown dice before: naturally, he won – $8.50. He rose exultantly from their profane surprise, and took Sinker to dinner at the best hotel.",

The sheer volume of material cut loose from the frozen heights defies measurement. The entire landscape was transformed. Massive headwalls reveal where the mountain once stood, until carried away as a river of mud capable of dislodging anything in its path, sweeping boulders the size of houses into its flow. As William and I gazed over the vast chasm carved from the mountain, neither of us spoke, though we shared the same thought. This was not the slow march of geological time. It was evidence of a force capable of reconfiguring a mountain and rewriting the history of the earth in an afternoon. We both shuddered to imagine what we would see when we reached the valley floor at Armero, a town that, unlike Murillo, had absorbed the full force of the mountain’s wrath.",

It is the task of friends to diagnose the anguish and exorcize it; not always an easy task. This lurking demon, resembling the tribulatio et angustia of the Psalms, the Greeks call stenachoria. But the problem acts both ways: should distress assault one, they recognize its symptoms with an almost feminine intuitiveness and try, with tact and solicitude, to resolve it; and even if they are mistaken about the cause, this kindness may allay the effect. Their need and their talent for friendship is the obverse of implacable hatred for enemies.",
