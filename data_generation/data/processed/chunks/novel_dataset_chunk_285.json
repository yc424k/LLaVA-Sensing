He was an active boy with a buzz cut who loved chopping things, running and swimming. Another visitor was Omo, my nearest neighbor. Omo – short, stocky and handy with everything – was the classic cheerful woodsman. He lived with his four daughters in a thatched house about a hundred meters away. Just below his house was a smaller thatch-roofed cottage, the ‘retirement house’ where his father and stepmother lived. Later, Omo became my teacher in the ways of Iya, helping with every aspect of my house, including the roof thatching when the time came.",

The necropolis was like a Byzantine village sitting amid the dunes: long streets of simple café-au-lait mud-brick tomb-houses and chapels: some flat-topped, others with domes, a few decorated with blind arcading or naïve frescoes, many severely plain. Some of the tombs had clearly held the bodies of saints or holy men, for their walls were marked with pious Byzantine graffiti: ‘Pray for the soul of Zoe’, ‘Blessings on Theophilus’, ‘Remember Menas’. But the tombs had decayed in the winds of 1,500 winters, so that the brick was cracked and brittle, and many of the buildings were left like skeletons, without a roof or a back wall. Many had been attacked by tomb-robbers, and deep pits had been dug to reveal the hidden burial chambers. Others had collapsed altogether. The whole complex was windswept and eerie, and a gathering breeze wailed through the broken doorways.",

And our noses, even mine (which hardly works), they’re so good, so primitive, so sensitive at detecting the tiniest amounts of pre-conscious or conscious molecules of interesting smells in the air … But they can’t tell the difference between rotten fish and rotting feet. So there you go, Luke, when you get ashore, you can’t help it, you’re carrying a mimic of the human sex-pheromone in your skin and in your hair, in your clothes, all over you, the rotten-fish pong, the unwashed-foot-pong, and you, like every trawlerman—you’re a nasal sex-bomb delivered direct to the most primitive part of her brain!”",

This, then, was the famous bandit of whom Europe had heard with interest. He put on a high-crowned sombrero with a wide flat brim; a rosary of wooden beads was twisted about his right wrist.

Baskets, water jars, sickles and rakes were heaped up, half a dozen ponies were grazing and conical bee-hives were set in rows along the edge of the enfolding trees. As they moved forward and reaped and gathered and gleaned, an old woman’s high quaver sang the lead of a never-ending sequence of verses to a grave and rather haunting tune; the others joined in at each second line. I had heard it on the climb to the little plateau; it still floated up diminuendo long after the harvesters themselves had dropped out of sight, and when it died away, I could see them far below in occasional foreshortened glimpses among the sheaves and the ricks as though I were looking at them backwards through an ever-lengthening telescope, dwindled to specks by now. Then tree-tops hid them.",

It gave her wide, polished spaces and clean, brilliant backgrounds, yards of parquetry for the gliding of her feet, and monstrous mirrors for reflecting her face at unexpected angles. These distances fined her grace still finer, and lent her a certain pathos, the charm of figures vanishing and remote.",

People wonder sometimes why people like him, or Melville, or Stevenson, choose to take themselves away from the comfort of what they know to a place that does not even have a site of higher education. They ask me why I elect to spend much of my time in a Benedictine hermitage—though no Benedictine—or in a two-room flat in rural Japan where I have no car or bicycle or Internet connection or newspapers. When I speak of “infinite riches in a little room” and the twenty thousand sites on the World Wide Web already devoted to information overload, they look more bewildered still.",

As they walked along past the railway station and towards the carnival grounds, the street, and all the streets that led to it, began to swarm with people. Most of them were native Müncheners, but a great number were also Bavarian country people. These Bavarians were brawny men and women who stained the crowd brilliantly with the rich dyes of their costume—the men in their elaborately-embroidered holiday shorts and stockings, the women in their bright dresses and lace bodices, marching briskly along with the springy step of the mountaineer. These peasants had the perfect flesh and the sound teeth of animals. Their smooth, round faces wore only the markings of the sun and the wind: they were unworn by the thought and pain that waste away man’s strength. Monk looked at them with a pang of regret and of envy—their lives were so strong and so confident, and, having missed so much, they seemed to have gained so greatly. Their lives were limited to one or two desires. Most of them had never read a book, a visit to this magic city of Munich was to them a visit to the heart of the universe, and the world that existed beyond their mountains had no real existence for them at all.",

Ahead flew a little, squat, black figure, with the Mexican flag streaming over him; he wore a floppy sombrero loaded with five pounds of tarnished gold braid,—once probably the pride of some imperial\nhacendado. Following him closely were Manuel Paredes, with riding boots up to his hips, fastened with silver buckles the size of dollars, beating his mount with the flat of a saber; Isidro Amayo, making his horse buck by flapping a hat in his eyes; José Valiente, ringing his immense silver spurs inlaid with turquoises; Jesus Mancilla, his flashing brass chain around his neck; Julian Reyes, with colored pictures of Christ and the Virgin fastened to the front of his sombrero; a struggling tangle of six behind, with Antonio Guzman trying to lasso them, the coils of his horsehair rope soaring out of the dust. They came on the dead run, all Indian shouts and cracking revolvers, until they were only a hundred feet away, then jerked their little cow-ponies cruelly to a staggering halt with bleeding mouths, a whirling confusion of men, horses and dust.",

She and MacLeod had become fascinated by the trails that exist on the moor, each of them an archive of past habits and practices. So they began to create and record their own songlines, recording paths taken, events that occurred or were observed along the way. On a June day they walked between An Talamh Briste, Na Feadanan Gorma, Gleann Shuainagadail and Loch an Ois, and they saw along the way ‘drifts of sparkling bog-cotton’, ‘scarlet damselflies’, ‘a long wind, carrying bird-calls’. They ‘crossed a greenshank’s territory’ and ‘disturbed a hind in long grass’, before stopping ‘at a shieling where an eagle had preened’. ‘I merely walked and recorded what I saw in each place,’ Anne said. ‘A merlin flying by, a dragonfly laying its wings out to dry.’ MacLeod delved further back, beyond the verifiable, making speculative reconstructions of atavistic memory maps ‘of those who traversed this landscape before and after the peat grew, naming features to navigate their way around, or to commemorate stories and people’.",

Was it possible that he was already that? By God, no! His smouldering wrath against Mrs. Tracy blazed up again. It was all her doing, whatever had happened. She wouldn’t rest till she had separated him from Laura Lou. . . . He was beginning to feel a sort of terror at the silent house and the unknown behind it. He saw the son of a neighbour walking down the lane, and stood up and hailed him. “See here--I’m just home, and I guess I’m locked out. Seen my womenfolk round anywhere?” he asked facetiously.",

Backcountry meals were simpler, but the mules packed in Coleman two-burners and coolers with ice so we didn’t suffer. Abby made rich desserts, Max ruled at Dutch oven cuisine, trout jumped from creeks onto our plates. The default meal was burritos, or any version of innards you could wrap in a tortilla and eat with both hands. (With Indian filling instead of Mexican, we coined currito long before the franchises.) Carbohydrates were critical—pasta, a loaf of bread, skillet potatoes. Frozen homemade soups and stews served double purpose: they chilled the cooler for the first half of the hitch and thawed into a one-pot meal a few days in.",

There was a good chance of our gaining perhaps fifteen or twenty years on the bare promise of a democratic referendum. This would be a valuable gain – indeed an inestimable one – for it would give us time to overhaul the entire administrative machinery as well as the police; neither was fit to take the strain of a modern emergency. And while (pace Potter) I was prepared to believe that the Cypriots were cowards and would never show fight I was gravely alarmed at the thought of Cretans or Rhodians coming in to show them how; I had seen something of them, and in the present state of the police I wasn’t sure that public opinion, as yet sluggish and inert, couldn’t be roused by example. The state of our unpreparedness for any real crisis was frightening.",

These dreary little dwellings lack the charm of bohios but are supplied with electricity, indoor loos, showers and fridges, evidence of Fidel’s wish to modernise rural Cuba.

The boy, his family have decided, needs educating and Burnet, an Anglican churchman possessed of a prodigious and restive imagination, has taken what will be a decade-long sabbatical from his fellowship at Christ’s College, Cambridge, to act as chaperone and cicerone to a succession of teenage aristocrats – of whom the young earl is the first.",

The belt slithered back into place with a clunk. The Mercedes S600 paused at the traffic lights and a child’s hand appeared at the window. It was splayed out, revealing missing tips from the third and index fingers. A small boy blew his lips against the glass, puffed out his cheeks and cupped his hands around his eyes. A sliver of dried saliva ran from the corner of his mouth and his lip was split and crusted over. No matter how much time you spend in India or your immunity builds against the dirt, poverty and squalor, some things will always catch you off guard. I reached for my handbag and eased down the window. It hummed, but halfway through the descent, jerked and crawled back up again.",

The whole place was beyond words hideous and to go there of one’s own free will was certifiable. The diseases were revolting and inescapable.

The strippers’ tents behind the rides would be covered with wildly erotic paintings of the most beautiful, silky-haired, full-breasted, lithe-bodied women you ever saw – women whose moist and pouty lips seemed to be saying, ‘I want you – yes, you there, with the zits and glasses. Come and fulfil me, little man.’ Aged fourteen and delirious with lust, you would believe these pictures with all your heart and many of the neighbouring organs. You would hand over a crumpled dollar and go inside, into a dusty tent that smelt of horse manure and rubbing alcohol and find on stage a weary stripper looking not unlike your own mother. It was the sort of disappointment from which you never really recover, and my heart went out now to the lonely sailors and Japanese photocopier salesmen who were down there drinking sweet, warm cocktails and having a night of overpriced disappointment. ‘We learn from our mistakes,’ I remarked sagely to myself with a rueful smile and told a panhandler to piss off.",

Each family has one room and a larder sort of place, and shares the kitchen with the family on the opposite side of the entrance; but the women prefer doing their cooking at the grate in their own room rather than expose the contents of their pots to the ill-natured comments of a neighbour. On the fashionable side there is a little fenced-in garden for every family, where fowls walk about pensively and meditate beneath the scarlet- runners (for all the world like me in my garden), and hollyhocks tower above the drying linen, and fuel, stolen from our woods, is stacked for winter use; but on the other side you walk straight out of the door on to manure heaps and pigs.",

He was wrong in saying no-wrong on technical grounds, because Professor Kahlenberg's consent would have been enough for any dean in a reasonable mood, and wrong in principle, because a student should be allowed to select his own teachers.

Not long ago the locals grew their own rice on this land; now they are wage-labourers. Next came a bumpy footpath winding through woodland until Lao Pako’s boundary blocked the way: a high wire fence, a massive wooden gate, a neat notice in Lao and English saying, ‘You may come through this gate but please close it.’ As the construction in question resembled a fortification rather than a gate, all my efforts to open it failed. It seemed I was stymied – one person could not lift Hare over – but in such situations Fate rarely lets me down. A wood-collecting Hmong boy appeared – aged perhaps twelve – and I shouted and beckoned. Slowly he approached, looking sullen, and indicated that I must not continue; his manner suggested an understandable dislike of ecotourists, for whose benefit so much land has been enclosed. Pointing to the notice, I assumed a worried expression and requested assistance. Reluctantly the boy laid down his load and helped me heave Hare over, then quickly disappeared into the bushes. I walked the rest of the way on a hilly footpath; all around was original vegetation of the sort known as ‘dry monsoonal forest’, the trees small to medium sized, interspersed with wild banana and bamboo.",
