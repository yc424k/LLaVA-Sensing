    "target_paragraph": "It was a merry day of bright sun and busy breeze. Everything was moving and glancing and fluttering. I felt cheerful to hilarity when we were fairly out in the fields that lie between the Greek temple and the village of Vilmnitz—privately hilarious, of course, for I could not be openly so in the sober presence of Gertrud. I have observed that sweet smells, and clear light, and the piping of birds, all the things that make life lovely have no effect whatever on Gertruds. They apparently neither smell, nor see, nor hear them. They are not merely unable to appreciate them, they actually do not know that they are there. This complete unconsciousness of the presence of beauty is always a wonder to me. No change of weather changes my Gertrud's settled solemnity. She wears the same face among the roses of June that she does in the nipping winds of March. The heart of May, with which every beast keeps holiday, never occupies her respectable interior. She is not more solemn on a blank February afternoon, when the world outside in its cold wrapping of mist shudders through the sodden hours, than she is on such a day of living radiance as this third one of our journey. The industrious breeze lifted up the stray hairs from her forehead and gave it little pats and kisses that seemed audaciously familiar applied to a brow of such decorum; the restless poplar leaves whispered all the secrets of life in her unhearing ears; the cottage gardens of Vilmnitz, ablaze that day with the white flame of lilies, poured their stream of scent into the road, and the wind caught it up and flung it across her sober nostrils, and she could not breathe without drawing in the divineness of it, yet her face wore exactly the same expression that it does when we are passing pigs. Are the Gertruds of this world, then, unable to distinguish between pigs and lilies? Do they, as they toss on its troublesome waves, smell perpetual pigs? The question interested me for at least three miles; and so much did I want to talk it over that I nearly began talking it over with Gertrud herself, but was restrained by the dread of offending her; for to drive round Rügen side by side with an offended Gertrud would be more than my fortitude could endure.",

The window was closed now, curtains drawn across it. Anything might exist on the other side of the window if one had (as Fayne hinted) bodies beyond these bodies and these bodies were just nothing, minds beyond these minds and these minds were just nothing. “Fayne says we are underdeveloped, are all of us racially babies in development or sort of moles. We have, she says, only mole eyes that see in the dark, that we are in the dark. She herself sees—we don’t see.” “Oh that girl.” A thing not of Her’s creating, not of George’s had entered the room. It stood heavy in the corner, a hand lifted to adjust a headband. “She’s so—so classic.” George with his affectation pretended to have hysterics. “Oh, Oh, Oh,” he chortled between painful convulsions, “Hermione, you are funny.” “Funny?” “She’s out of a tu’penny ha’penny” (he said tu’penny ha’penny) “bad playlet. She isn’t in a real play.” “Wh-aa-at Georgio?” “She is so darn theatric.” “Not theatric, not theatrical—dramatic in the best sense.” Again George had convulsions. “My dear, she’s simply shoddy.”",

The team of hunters drove the two bears into a narrow gorge, where Harriman was waiting with his Winchester. The odds were heavily stacked in the railroad man’s favor, since he was encircled by men “with enough firepower to tear the bear to pieces,” should his nerve fail him, one participant recalled. Harriman dropped the sow with a single shot. Guide Yellowstone Kelly completed the ambush by dispatching the cub.",

As usual Sisi was busy outside her door, having that morning loaded a supermarket trolley (the commonest township vehicle) with sheeps’ hoofs and shanks discarded by a Mitchells Plain butcher. These she grills slowly over a tin of charcoal until they themselves become like charcoal – crunchy and (Georgina affirms) nutritious. Sisi scrapes off the outer layer of burned skin and hair before selling them for ten cents each. Ndima was shoe-mending outside his one-roomed shack, a handmade shoe hanging over the door to advertise his craft. Blossom was boiling water for a client on her new oil stove; she expects to have an exceptionally busy week because of an approaching wedding. Mrs Mgidlana and her fellow-seamstresses were busy making attractive children’s garments from offcuts. Mrs Sekgonyane was washing bullocks’ guts in a baby bath and hanging them out to dry on the clothes line; they brightened the scene, glistening pink and ivory and purple. When dry these too are grilled, in strips, and bought for a few cents each as a special treat. In the ANC Women’s League-run crèche, donated food was being cooked for twenty-six toddlers whose parents are too ill to cope with them. The crèche is an unfurnished and seriously leaky shack, its floor always damp. Outside, Women’s Leaguers sat in the sun teaching a few small girls how to weave village-style. Spaza shops were selling minute quantities of essentials. A carpenter was converting three broken tables, retrieved from a dump, into one sound table. A tinsmith was converting dog-food tins, also retrieved from a dump, into trays for domestic use – price: fifty cents. When you look closely at a corner of Khayelitsha, many people are hard at work. Unemployment statistics belie the industry and inventiveness of the ‘informal sector’.",

Reflecting on its dramatic presence, I can’t say that in that moment I was able to envision Hannibal and his troops camping out on the then bare point of land or turbaned Saracen marauders wielding their curved blades on the beach. I was distracted by the panorama as it was, along with the plate of pasta and glass of local Cirò wine before me. The full-bodied, dry red produced in the nearby town of the same name was Calabria’s first DOC wine. The Cirò rosso (red) consists of ninety-five percent of the Gaglioppo grape, a vine imported by the ancient Greeks. In fact, wine from the area of Cirò Marina was so highly esteemed by the historic peoples that it was awarded to winning athletes in the original Olympic games.",

And here she had dozed while the drowsy afternoon wore away, and waked to lengthening shadows and a sound of piano keys touched softly below stairs. I’ve slept all afternoon, she told herself in a sort of consternation; yet she lay for a time yet while the curtains stirred faintly at the windows and the sound of the piano came up mingled with the jasmine from the garden and with the garrulous evensong of sparrows from the mulberry trees in the back yard. She rose and crossed the hall and entered Narcissa’s room, where the child slept in its crib; beside him the nurse dozed placidly. Miss Jenny tiptoed out and descended the stairs and entered the parlor and drew her chair out from behind the piano. Narcissa stopped playing.",

I ate plate after plate of the pork and decided that it was official: I can never be a vegetarian, not with food like this in the world. And then we went out dancing at this local nightclub, if you can call it a nightclub. It was more like a groovy beach shack, only without the beach. There was a live band of Balinese kids playing good reggae music, and the place was mixed up with revelers of all ages and nationalities, expats and tourists and locals and gorgeous Balinese boys and girls, all dancing freely, unself-consciously. Armenia hadn’t come along, claiming she had to work the next day, but the handsome older Brazilian man was my host. He wasn’t such a bad dancer as he claimed. Probably he can play soccer, too. I liked having him nearby, opening doors for me, complimenting me, calling me “darling.” Then again, I noticed that he called everyone “darling”—even the hairy male bartender. Still, the attention was nice…",

    "target_paragraph": "During the next, easy, stage we scanned the enormous chaos of peaks ahead, wondering how any path could possibly find a way through. Shifting clouds produced a changing pattern of subtle nameless shades; and from our height we could relish the contrast between the immobility of the mountains and the restlessness of the sky. A few families were driving laden burros from Huamachuco and when the track became vague we sought the guidance of their footprints. Passing a tiny pueblo, with no one in sight, we realised that what had seemed to be a shed was in fact a church of sorts; crosses were painted on a door that looked as though it hadn’t been opened for years. A large surrounding graveyard was enclosed by a seven-foot adobe wall oddly roofed with withered cactus. When the descent became violently steep Rachel dismounted, as another icy shower swept our mountain. We stopped for water at a clear spring; one loses an amazing amount of sweat at this altitude and our liquid intake had been spectacular all morning. As the sky cleared, we could see an elongated pueblo very far below in a narrow, tree-filled valley. This part of the descent was far more leg-taxing than the climb, though lung-resting. Our path changed to a rock-stairs for the last stage and wriggled its way past red-tiled shacks piled one above the other on a precipice. Crossing a puny river on stepping stones we stopped at the first open shop at 1.15 p.m., after six hours walking during which we had covered some fifteen miles.",

    "target_paragraph": "On the one hand, wildness has been perceived as a dangerous force that confounds the order-bringing pursuits of human culture and agriculture. Wildness, according to this story, is cognate with wastefulness. Wild places resist conversion to human use, and they must therefore be destroyed or overcome. Examples of hostility to the wild are ubiquitous in cultures ancient and modern, Eastern and Western. ‘Except for the true civilisation builders,’ hallelujahed the American preacher and writer James Stalker in 1881, ‘the very land in which we live would still be an undiscovered wilderness! These men see teeming cities, and thriving factories upon the desert, where others see only sage brush and alkali plains . . . these men have tunnelled our mountains, have spanned our great rivers, and opened our mines of wealth!’ The Old English epic poem Beowulf is filled with what the poet calls wildéor, or ‘savage creatures’. In the poem, these monstrous dragon-like beings inhabit a landscape of wolf-haunted forests, deep lakes, windswept cliffs and treacherous marshes. It is against these wild places and wildéor that the civilisation of Beowulf’s tribe, the Geats - with their warm and well-lit mead halls, their hierarchical warrior culture - sets itself.",

There was a looking-glass in a carved frame on the wall, but she was ashamed to look at herself in it, and she sat with her hands folded on her knee till the clergyman returned. Then they went out again, along a sort of arcaded passage, and into a low vaulted room with a cross on an altar, and rows of benches. The clergyman, who had left them at the door, presently reappeared before the altar in a surplice, and a lady who was probably his wife, and a man in a blue shirt who had been raking dead leaves on the lawn, came in and sat on one of the benches.",

The contrast is uncomfortably striking. The girl is standing barefoot outside the van in the dirt parking lot. She leans over our six pairs of shoes that are strewn about on the ground (flip-flops and sneakers each), and boldly places a bunch of bananas on the table next to Lilly’s piles of textbooks and art supplies. She’s by herself, carrying a heavy bucket full of bananas, trying to earn 50 cents per bunch. I buy more bananas than we can possibly eat.",

On either side rose thickly uninviting forest; guidance would have to be sought in the hamlet of Sakamaliwa, a few miles back. I turned – and found myself face to face with an elderly man who might have illustrated Speke’s Journal. His short tunic was of bark-cloth, he had wild shoulder-length locks decorated with leaves, he wore many copper anklets and carried a sheathed spear longer than himself and a leather shield studded around the edges with coloured beads. His unsurprised expression suggested that he had heard of my presence in the area. And of course the path only seemed to end there; below the black mud of the swamp lay a firm causeway of tree-trunks, doubtless visible in the dry season. My companion made no attempt to communicate verbally. Handing me his spear he took charge of Lear, then pointed to my shoes. I removed them and turned up my trousers, wondering if he would remove his anklets. He didn’t. The spear was to be used as a walking-stick, an essential aid as the half-mile causeway was calf-deep in slithery mud. Being unable to estimate its width I could not possibly have negotiated it with Lear, even had I noticed its existence. At the far side my guardian angel silently retrieved his spear and, still without any change of expression, returned the way we had come. Plainly he had followed me to the swamp’s edge, knowing the mzungu would need help. Such gestures are never forgotten.",

A familiarity with Alec D’Urberville’s presence – which that young man carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue, and by jestingly calling her his cousin when they were alone – removed most of her original shyness of him, without, however, implanting any feeling which could engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind. But she was more pliable under his hands than a mere companionship would have made her, owing to her inevitable dependence upon his mother, and, through her comparative helplessness, upon him.",

The wind came round the corner, as a north-easter will, and through the window-sash, chilling her as she stood. \"There's nobody more surprised than myself,\" she said. \"And yet I might have known that if I went in for this sort of thing, I should make a mess of it.\" She went back to the fire, and settled herself in the attitude of thought. There was no end to her thinking now. Perhaps that was the reason why she was always tired. Hitherto she had triumphed over fatigue and privation by a power which seemed inexhaustible, and was certainly mysterious. Much of it was due to sheer youth and health, and to the exercise which gave her a steady hand and a cool head—much, doubtless, to her unflinching will; but Katherine was hardly aware how far her strength had lain in the absence of temptation to any feminine weakness. Hitherto she had seen her object always in a clear untroubled air, and her work had gained something of her life's austere and passionless serenity. Now it was all different, and she was thinking of what had made that difference.",

The temple bells of Kipling’s poem are hung at the highest tip of the pagoda on the hti, a small crown of bells and jewels that tinkles gently in the breeze.

The Front after all had a countrywide post-revolutionary upscuttlement on its agenda and could not reasonably be expected to attend to the trivial request of a dishevelled wanderer. For want of a chair, I perched on a little table in a corner; to be sitting was such bliss I hoped no one would focus on me for some time. Then suddenly I fancied that I was glimpsing history in the making; all around was, apparently, chaos, yet out of it would come – surely – a new order for Rumania.",
