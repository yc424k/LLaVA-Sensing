I used up the whole film, tenderly stroked Uncle G’s alabaster forehead, and then gave the camera back to my aunt.",

We dumped bags at a dormitory near the station and walked into the blue-walled city of jhari bedspreads and masala markets, on a primal hunt for meat. After Gujarat’s vegetarian cuisine, our carnivorous cravings had taken over and we devoured a biryani filled with hunks of soft mutton draped in ribbons of fried onion, as the Umaid Bhawan Palace shimmered in the distance.

I had never before stayed in a really fancy hotel, never ordered from room service, never called on the services of a concierge or valet, never tipped a doorman. (Still haven’t!)",

I did not in the least realize that it would be a sort of crime if mother (“our” mother) did not have her lilies-of-the-valley on this and that occasion. Such were my erotic orgies, lilies for my mother. There was also the birth-day and the death-day of a father and two brothers. Around these days, aunts stood like crows, waiting their turn at carrion. It was not Larry who had been picked by vultures nor was it Robert. I began to curse Larry, to curse Bob.

In the back-street bazaars, newly rebuilt after the destruction of the mediaeval town, we stumbled across a world very different from the regimented drabness of the modern communist town. The traditional ways of the Uigurs had gone to ground for a few years, then quietly reasserted themselves when it was safe to do so again. Wandering past low mud houses through dusty lanes, we suddenly came across a wider space. On either side of the road lean-to shacks had been erected, and in the centre a long tarpaulin had been hung over a brick dais. Under this, and in and around the shacks, sat vendors arranged in groups according to produce. First we came to the hat sellers, then the wood turners, ironmongers and knife makers. Beyond lay a range of cay stalls, an expanse of carpets partitioned into separate cubicles by canvas slats. On the far side was the fruit and vegetable market. The road was blocked by a gaggle of donkey carts piled high with figs, grapes, apples and apricots. Squawking chickens dangled from handlebars. One escaped from a coup and hopped off over a crowd of carts pursued by the owner. Donkey carts reversed into stalls, collapsing tarpaulins on squatting groups of tea drinkers. Little boys poked sitting dromedaries, who got up and disturbed herds of sheep. The sheep scattered over crowds of cross-legged fruit sellers. Runaway donkeys sent old men flying; little children got their feet stood on; stall-holder mothers were tripped up by nasty boys in flat caps playing hide and seek. There was a ringing of bicycle bells and camel bells and a smell of dust and charcoal and spicy cooking. It was a far cry from the days of the Cultural Revolution when a boy selling peanuts could be arrested as a capitalist. We had seen finer bazaars in the East, but none so unexpected. Coming to it from the wide empty streets of the Chinese town was like discovering some rare animal thought long extinct.",

You have observed, have you not, that there is no running water on this island? That old Duke built the fountains all the same, and to every one of them he attached a cistern, to hold the winter rains; then a pumping apparatus. Relays of slaves had to work underground, day and night, pumping water for these twenty-four fountains; it fell back into the cisterns, and was forced up again. The Arabs had fountains. He meant to have them too. Particularly at night! If anything went wrong with the machinery at that hour, there was the devil to pay. He swore he could not sleep unless he heard the music of the water. And his sleepless nights were bad for his subjects. They generally hid in caves till the fountains were reported to be in working order again. That is the way to run an island, Mr. Heard. One must be a stylist.\"",

There groweth hemp and flax of two sorts, the one called the male, the other the female: there falleth Manna from heaven, truly a thing very rare; and although there is not gathered such abundance of Silk, yet I dare say there is not had so much in all _Italy_ besides. There are also bathes, both hot, luke-warm, and cold, to cure many diseases. Near the Seaside, and likewise on the Mediterrane are goodly Gardens full of Oringes, Citrons, and Lemons of divers sorts. It is watered with many Rivers. There are on the hils of the Apennine, thick Woods of high Firrs, Holms, Platanes, Oaks, where grows the white odoriferous Mushrome which shineth in the night. Here is bred the soft stone _Frigia,_ which every month yields a delicate and wholesome Gum, and the stone _Aetites,_ by us called the stone _Aquilina._ In this Province there is excellent hunting of divers creatures, as wild Hoggs, Staggs, Goats, Hares, Foxes, Porcupines, Marmosets. There are also ravenous beasts, as Wolves, Bears, Luzards, which are quick-sighted, and have the hinder parts spotted with divers colours. This kind of Beast was brought from _France_ to _Rome_ in the sports of _Pompey_ the great, and Hunters affirm this Beast to be of so frail a memory, that although he eateth with hunger, if he chance to look back, remembreth no more his meat, and departing searcheth for other.” Who would not visit Calabria, if only on the chance of beholding the speckled posterior of the absent-minded Luzard?",

Thinking maybe I had misunderstood when the train would come, I hurried back to the platform. The women had just finished wrestling their cart up the platform steps. I went over to them, said hello, and explained I had taken the wrong train. The women were unmistakably a pair. Both wore two head scarves, a light one underneath and a heavier, coarser one on top. One woman was thin and her long wool coat was brown. The other woman was stout, and sturdy-looking as a bollard, and she wore a wool coat of a particular red I have never seen except in displays of British soldiers from the American Revolutionary War. Both had weathered, wrinkled-shoe faces, multiple warts, and lively pale-blue eyes.",

Although his matching maroon turban was testament to his faith, he felt no loyalty towards its traditions and was in the middle of his seventh stint of volunteering at the resort’s café. He wheeled out the bins, dusted his hands off and straightened up to his full, towering height.",

From down the end of the corridor came the wail of a screaming baby. In another room, whose door was open, we saw what I took to be his father, an enormously fat Arab gentleman who was sprawled toad-like on a bed. He had button-black eyes, wore a dirty shift and in his mouth was lodged the brass filter of an out-sized hubble-bubble. In the following twelve hours we passed the door of that room several times, yet Hamoudi’s father never seemed to move. He never blinked, never scratched himself, never left his station to eat or to wash. He certainly never spoke. The only indication that the man was alive were the aquarium-like sucking noises that emerged from his nargile.",

In the morning, a twenty-minute walk past a disused factory and some hideous small unoccupied villas brought me to a café by the sea, which provided unspeakable food and a closet half filled with mouldy potatoes for undressing. And so to the beach, like a minor garbage pit, the sea having cast up rubbish to join the crushed cigarette packs, tin cans, dirty papers, bottles left by previous swimmers. Anyhow nobody else was here and the water looked fine, transparent and calm over sand but too shallow for swimming. Beyond the little promontory, the waves were choppy with whitecaps, no obstacle to a dedicated swimmer. Once out into the deep water the current grabbed me and began to move me at speed westwards. Next stop Malta.",

Why did you go away? When will you come again?”—takes us to his house; and this is hard to take in: We are in a cobblestoned courtyard of noble and felicitous proportions. Dramatic stone arches lead into cavelike spaces where sacks of meal and flour and olive presses are stored and hams are hung for curing and cheeses ripen (all indications of prosperity), and animals take refuge (this, a cave, is absolute refuge) from the cold. On some of the arches numbers are stenciled, as if, in the not so distant past, this building (this accumulation of buildings) had honor or at least administrative significance. Several staircases, each with wrought-iron rails (a sign of wealth, which word is relative), lead to landings off which are sleeping chambers. On these steps are plastic containers, cans of olive oil, children's toys. On these landings there are rudimentary balconies, roughly hewn of wood, and on them pots of tomato and basil, and over them grapevines. The cooking is done either in the open—where are distributed, for the use of the extended family, mismatched chairs—or in one of the caves. Children, animals, chickens, adults, plants, stone, shovels, pots, laundry, tools—the coexistence of animate and inanimate things.",

A crawl space had been inserted under the main gas tank in the middle of the plane so that the crew could move between the front and the back, but no one had thought to test it while fully kitted out in cold-weather gear. Byrd got stuck and spent ten minutes trapped with no one able to hear his calls above the engines’ roar. Noville, cramping up in his confined space, stretched his leg at one point and inadvertently put his foot through some wires, knocking out the radio and rendering himself pointless. Somewhere over the Atlantic, Balchen asked Acosta to take the wheel for a minute while he felt under his seat for a packet of sandwiches. In that short interval, Acosta put the plane in a spiral so severe that its airspeed rose to 140 miles per hour, just short of the speed at which the wings would be torn off. Balchen had to wrestle the plane back to stability. “You’d better handle it from now on,” Acosta told him quietly, and Balchen flew virtually all the rest of the way. According to Time magazine, Byrd was so seized with anxiety at one point that he struck Acosta across the head with a flashlight. They were supposed to make landfall at Bray Head, Ireland, but in fact missed Ireland altogether and hit Europe at Brest, in France, more than two hundred miles from where they expected to be.",

The Semitic man paddled around with that rather ludicrous intentness of a fat man swimming. Gordon sat on the rail, looking on. Fairchild and Major Ayers at last succeeded in driving the ladies back into the tender, about which they splashed and yapped with the tactless playfulness of dogs while Pete refraining “Look out goddam you look out christ watcher doing lookout” struck at their fingers with one of his discarded and sopping shoes.",

I read Tom Neale’s book ‘All in the Same Boat’, then Nigel Calder’s ‘Manual of Mechanical and Electrical Systems’. Many others followed. In a month the weather moderated. The ice melted.

    "target_paragraph": "In the days that followed, I continued working on Sobrius and running errands. I took two of the sails, the torn genoa and another “racing” genoa to Advanced Sails for repair. The sail loft was a big open room, big enough to unroll very large sails on the plywood floor. Two sewing machines occupied spaces cut into the floor, so the operator could sit comfortably at a sewing machine that was at floor level. I met Keith, a friendly man with glasses, who inspected my sails and came up with a very reasonable price to fix them. I expected Keith to say that the genoa was torn beyond repair, but it didn’t seem like a big deal to him. I then went in search of someone who could copy the key to start the Yanmar diesel engine.\nFirst I went to Home Depot, but they could not copy the key. Then I tracked down a locksmith, who told me the same thing. A second locksmith told me that he would have to come out to the boat in order to make a key, and that sounded prohibitively expensive. I was beginning to worry about this key, and I wondered how other sailors dealt with this problem, which must be common. I finally went to a Yanmar dealer who sold me two keys right off the shelf. Apparently Yanmar keys are all the same and mine didn’t need to be copied, just replaced.\nBack aboard Sobrius I did some repair to the fiberglass gelcoat on the deck and I tried, unsuccessfully, to remove the traveler. I was thwarted by frozen bolts and gave up. I wanted to replace the traveler-car, because it looked like the point where the shackle attached to it was almost worn through and about to break. This is where the mainsheet attaches and is very necessary for a sailboat, but the car had two other attachment points, for blocks, and I just moved the shackle to another point and moved on to the next project.\nI also realigned the bow pulpit, which was off-center, perhaps from a collision in the past. This required drilling new holes, new bolts, and using block and tackle to pull it into position. I removed a large piece of ugly wood from the bow deck and filled the holes beneath it. I still don’t know why it was there. I usually don’t remove things until I know what they are, but for this I made an exception, and as I removed it I hoped that its purpose wouldn’t become painfully obvious in the future.\nFor my evening mini-project, I wanted to go ahead and pull the trigger on an autopilot. I was torn between getting one of the major brands (Simrad or Raymarine) or a more-expensive handmade Pelagic. The Pelagic was made by a sailor/engineer who lived in San Francisco and looked pretty cool. After much hand-wringing and consternation, I ordered the Pelagic, which was recommended by some folks on the St Augustine Cruiser’s Net Facebook group. This had been a very difficult decision requiring more than a few e-mails and phone calls to Brian, the sailor/engineer who made each unit by hand in his shop in California. But in the end, I decided that I should order the best one.\nOne of the recurring themes I read about singlehanding was that tillerpilots break all the time. The Pelagic was a bit more expensive than the major brands, but I hoped the extra expense would yield more longevity. The last thing I wanted was to be without autopilot during my journey back to St. Augustine. I knew the journey was going to be difficult, and I wanted the things I bought to work properly. I wasn’t disappointed.",

The moon blazed down on 18,000 miles of coast, on the million sucks and scoops and hollows of the shore, and on the great wink of the sea, that ate the earth minutely and eternally. The moon blazed down upon the wilderness, it fell on sleeping woods, it dripped through moving leaves, it swarmed in weaving patterns on the earth, and it filled the cat’s still eye with blazing yellow. The moon slept over mountains and lay like silence in the desert, and it carved the shadows of great rocks like time. The moon was mixed with flowing rivers, and it was buried in the heart of lakes, and it trembled on the water like bright fish. The moon steeped all the earth in its living and unearthly substance, it had a thousand visages, it painted continental space with ghostly light; and its light was proper to the nature of all the things it touched: it came in with the sea, it flowed with the rivers, and it was still and living on clear spaces in the forest where no men watched.",

Its most prominent structure is the sheet-metal high school on the edge of town. Dirt-and-gravel streets climb the hill above the bluff. Houses are low, frame. Some are made of logs. Behind the town, a navigational beacon flashes. Drawing closer, we can see caribou antlers over doorways—testimony of need and respect. There are basketball backboards. We are closing a circuit, a hundred water miles from the upper Salmon, where a helicopter took us, from Kiana, at the start. Under the bluff, we touch the shore. Kiana is now high above us, and mostly out of sight. The barge is here that brings up supplies from Kotzebue. The river’s edge for the moment is all but unpopulated. Fish racks up and down the beach are covered with split drying salmon—ruddy and pink. We disassemble the Kleppers, removing their prefabricated bones, folding their skins, making them disappear into canvas bags. I go up the hill for a carton, and return to the beach. Into envelopes of cardboard I tape the tines of the caribou antler that I have carried from the mountains. Protecting the antler takes longer than the dismantling and packing of the kayaks, but there is enough time before the flight to Kotzebue at midday. In the sky, there has as yet been no sound of the airplane—a Twin Otter, of Wien Air Alaska, the plane that brought us here to meet the chopper. Stell Newman has gone up the beach and found some people at work around their fish racks. He now has with him a slab of dried salmon, and we share it like candy.",

The shoot was apparently over because the two boats were idling back toward the staging area at the front of the fleet, followed by a large runabout with a camera pod hanging out to its side on a long articulated boom. We thought, quite foolishly as it turned out, that the scene was finished and the director would then move on to the next action sequence, but weren’t too surprised when they repeated the scene a few minutes later. This time the runabout went to our starboard side once more but the inflatable, holding who we assumed to be the two bad guys, blasted past our port side, firing over the top of Caribee as they went. Of course we knew they were shooting blanks, but it was still disconcerting to have the deck raked by machine gun fire. Surely something was being ejected from the ends of those gun barrels, and we were afraid burnt packing might get all over the decks.",

It was, he knew, one of the great moments in his life – he lay, greedily watching the mastery of the grape over his virgin flesh, like a girl for the first time in the embrace of her lover. And suddenly, he knew how completely he was his father’s son – how completely, and with what added power and exquisite refinement of sensation, was he Gantian. He exulted in the great length of his limbs and his body, through which the mighty liquor could better work its wizardry. In all the earth there was no other like him, no other fitted to be so sublimely and magnificently drunken. It was greater than all the music he had ever heard; it was as great as the highest poetry. Why had he never been told? Why had no one ever written adequately about it? Why, when it was possible to buy a god in a bottle, and drink him off, and become a god oneself, were men not forever drunken?",

I went and peered over the edge. The water slapped the stone and smelled of fish. Two miles out you could see the island of Fort Sumter where the Civil War began. The promenade was crowded with cyclists and sweating joggers, who weaved expertly among the pedestrians and shuffling tourists.

The point had been fiercely disputed in those obscure quarters of the hotel inhabited by the management. The manager's wife was for turning Mrs. Tailleur out on the bare suspicion of her impropriety. The idea in the head of the manager's wife was that there should be no suspicion as to the reputation of the Cliff Hotel. The manager, on his side, contended that the Cliff Hotel must not acquire a reputation for suspicion; that any lady whom Miss Lucy had made visibly her friend was herself in the position so desirable for the Cliff Hotel; that, in any case, unless Mrs. Tailleur's conduct became such as to justify an extreme step, the scandal of the ejection would be more damaging to the Cliff Hotel than her present transparently innocent and peaceful occupation of the best room in it. He wished to know how a scandal was to be avoided when the place was swarming with old women. And, after all, what had they got against Mrs. Tailleur except that she was better looking by a long chalk, and better turned-out, than any of 'em? Of course, he couldn't undertake to say—offhand—whether she was or wasn't any better than she should be. But, in the absence of complaints, he didn't consider the question a profitable one for a manager to go into in the slack season.",

    "target_paragraph": "Chasing waves remains for me a proximate cause of vivid friendships. My education in the vagaries of local jetties, sandbars, wind patterns, shore-town cops, and desperate wetsuit-changing spots around New York has come mainly from a goofyfoot dancer named John Selya. He and I met when Mollie was small. Selya lived just a few blocks from us, on the fuddy-duddy Upper West Side, but he was also renting a house, with a bunch of other surfers, in Long Beach, on Long Island, in the wintertime, when rents were almost nothing. Long Beach gets waves. It has a train station. It’s less than an hour by car from Manhattan. If we surfed there, or anywhere nearby, the house was a place to change, dry wetsuits, leave boards, even sleep in the event of a two-day swell. But the house wasn’t essential. If the winds blow out of the west, as they often do, we go to New Jersey, not Long Island. Selya’s main surf buddies were another dancer named Alex Brady and a goofyfoot geophysicist whom they called the Lobbyist. I didn’t even notice when they let the house go. By then, I was in the rotation, permanently on call, dropping everything when the planets (and the buoys) lined up, going alone half the time, in borrowed cars.",

Temporarily though, the stock of food allows me to concentrate my energy on designing new water-catchment systems. The first is simple. I stretch plastic from the cut-up still along the shaft of the spear gun. I can hold it out, away from the sheltering canopy, pulling a corner with my mouth. Next I set the blown still on the bow. I punch it into a flat, round plate and curl up the edges like a deep-dish pizza pie. Even in light showers, I can see that the two devices work. A fine mist collects into drops, that streak into dribbles, that run into wrinkled, plastic valleys, where I can slurp them up. I must move quickly to tend to each system and collect water before it’s polluted by waves or the canopy. I am far enough west that the clouds are beginning to collect, and occasionally I see a “black cow,” as some sailors call squally cumulus, grazing far off, its rain streaking to earth.",
