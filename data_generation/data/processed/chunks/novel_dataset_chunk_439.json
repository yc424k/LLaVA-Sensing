We shot crazily through the crowded streets of Taftan, pursued by a pack of hobbling beggars, before tearing off into open country, raising half the Baluchistan desert into a thick cloud in our wake. The road was terrible, reflecting the state of Irano-Pak relations, but that only added to the excitement. The Toyota nose-dived into great potholes then lurched out again to the accompaniment of drunken cries from our driver and equally enthusiastic cheers from ourselves. We would cruise along for a few minutes, then down we would plunge into another wadi or a deep wind-eroded shell-hole before emerging into the open desert and the moonlight. All the time the radio blared loud music from Indian films which the Pakistanis enjoy just as much as their Hindu neighbours:",

A change seemed to have come over the climate of England. Rain fell frequently, but only in fitful gusts,* which were no sooner over than they began again. The sun shone, of course, but it was so girt about with clouds and the air was so saturated with water, that its beams were discoloured and purples, oranges, and reds of a dull sort took the place of the more positive landscapes of the eighteenth century. Under this bruised and sullen canopy the green of the cabbages was less intense, and the white of the snow was muddied. But what was worse, damp now began to make its way into every house—damp, which is the most insidious of all enemies, for while the sun can be shut out by blinds, and the frost roasted by a hot fire, damp steals in while we sleep; damp is silent, imperceptible, ubiquitous. Damp swells the wood, furs the kettle, rusts the iron, rots the stone. So gradual is the process, that it is not until we pick up some chest of drawers, or coal scuttle, and the whole thing drops to pieces in our hands, that we suspect even that the disease is at work.",

With a shock of emotion one feels, “There are figures without features robed in beauty”. In the pause that follows while the ripples spread, the girl to whom one should be talking says to herself, “He is old”. But she is wrong. It is not age; it is that a drop has fallen; another drop. Time has given the arrangement another shake. Out we creep from the arch of the currant leaves, out into a wider world. The true order of things—this is our perpetual illusion—is now apparent. Thus in a moment, in a drawing-room, our life adjusts itself to the majestic march of day across the sky.",

I suppose in that way it’s similar to places like Key West, Florida, or Oaxaca, Mexico. Most expats in Ubud, when you ask them how long they’ve lived here, aren’t really sure. For one thing, they aren’t really sure how much time has passed since they moved to Bali. But for another thing, it’s like they aren’t really sure if they do live here. They belong to nowhere, unanchored. Some of them like to imagine that they’re just hanging out for a while, just running the engine on idle at the traffic light, waiting for the signal to change. But after seventeen years of that you start to wonder…does anybody ever leave?",

However, overt camera use at a funeral would obviously be unacceptably intrusive, so I sought out a suitable vantage point on the first floor of a derelict building. From an open window, I was able to surreptitiously capture the unique scenes unfolding below me, without being observed. Or so, I thought. After around twenty minutes, I was joined by Arup, an eighteen year old wearing a matching combo of green slacks and anorak, and enormous, polished black, clown-shoe brogues. He explained that the body being ignited on the closest pyre was that of his uncle, Harish, who had died suddenly from a mysterious fever a couple of days earlier. Arup seemed quite cheerful as we observed his father apply a flaming torch to the sandalwood, expressing more interest in my camera than the funeral ceremony he was supposed to be attending.",

I walk through the pristine quiet of the suburban bush, crush its leaves to smell freshness and marvel at the wide empty streets during rush hour. I prickle with pleasure when I see the sea and gasp at the open joy and the jokes and the intimacy between friends. But most of all, I adore the liberty of being ignored! I deliberately buy a pair of skintight jeans just to enjoy walking around in them without attracting a riot. One day when I’m with a friend, a buffed bloke passes, looks us straight in the eyes and drawls, “G’daaaaay, girls.” I have to restrain myself from giving him a huge hug. To be acknowledged, to be appreciated by a stranger without feeling like a prostitute is so wonderful, so liberating. Close to the thrill of jumping in the car and going to a supermarket to buy chocolate and a bottle of wine. My Sydney life seems so easy and so picture-perfect.",

    "target_paragraph": "I strolled around the business district. The whole area was a dispiriting combination of auto parts stores, empty buildings and vacant lots. I had always thought that all river towns, even the poor ones, had something about them – a kind of faded elegance, a raffish air – that made them more interesting than other towns, that the river served as a conduit to the larger world and washed up a more interesting and sophisticated brand of detritus. But not Hannibal. It had obviously had better days, but even they couldn’t have been all that great. The Hotel Mark Twain was boarded up. That’s a sad sight – a tall building with every window plugged with plywood. Every business in town appeared to trade on Twain and his books – the Mark Twain Roofing Company, the Mark Twain Savings and Loan, the Tom ’n’ Huck Motel, the Injun Joe Campground and Go-Kart Track, the Huck Finn Shopping Center. You could even go and be insane at the Mark Twain Mental Health Center – a possibility that would, I imagine, grow increasingly likely with every day spent in Hannibal. The whole place was sad and awful. I had been planning to stay for lunch, but the thought of having to face a Tom Sawyer Burger or Injun Joe Cola left me without any appetite for either food or Hannibal.",

Britain in particular reacted with a mixture of horror and fascination at this apparent waste of life. Blue British blood had been spilt in the pursuit of altitude, and many rightly sensed that there was considerably more spillage to come. Charles Dickens, an armchair aficionado of that sanest of endeavours, polar exploration, thought mountain-climbing ludicrous and trumpeted his opinion about town. ‘BRAG!’ he bellowed unsympathetically. ‘The scaling of such heights … contributes as much to the advancement of science as would a club of young gentlemen who should undertake to bestride all the weathercocks of all the cathedral spires of the United Kingdom.’ The weathercock newspapers, which only a few months previously had been praising the intrepidity of mountaineers, turned with the wind of the hour and inquired dolefully why Britons were so bent on ‘reaching the unfathomable abyss never to return’, or denounced mountaineering as ‘a depraved taste’.",

    "target_paragraph": "So he believed that he was not even waiting: just watching. It was winter again now, the long unbroken line from Alps to sea lying almost quiescent in mud’s foul menopause; this would be the time for them, with even front-line troops free for a little while to remember when they were warm and dry and clean; for him and the other twelve—(thinking, almost impatiently, All right, all right, they are thirteen too),—a soil not only unfallow now but already tumescent even, having a little space to think now, to remember and to dread, thinking (the runner) how it was not the dying but the indignity of the method: even the condemned murderer is better off, with an hour set and fixed far enough in the future to allow time to summon fortitude to face it well, and privacy to hide the lack in case the fortitude failed; not to receive both the sentence and its execution all in one unprepared flash, not even at rest but running, stumbling, laden with jangling iron like a pack-mule in the midst of death which can take him from any angle, front rear or above, panting, vermin-covered, stinking with his own reek, without even privacy in which to drop the dung and water he carried. He even knew what he was watching for: for the moment in the stagnancy when Authority would finally become aware of the clump of alien incongruous blue in its moat. Which would be at any time now; what he was watching was a race. Winter was almost over; they—the thirteen—had had time, but it was running out. It would be spring soon: the jocund bright time beginning to be mobile and dry underfoot; and even before that they in the Whitehalls and Quai d’Orsays and Unter den Somethings and Gargleplatzes would have thought of something anew, even if it had to be something which had already failed before. And suddenly he knew why it would not matter to Authority whether they knew about the thirteen men or not. They didn’t need to, having not only authority but time too on their side; no need for them to hunt down and hoick out and execute a mere thirteen men: their very avocation was its own defender and emollient.",

It merely lay hot and hard inside her. “Come on,” she said, “dont quit.” But he wouldn’t get up, and she stood over him, her muscles flinching and jerking with exhaustion and terror. She began to jeer at him. “Call yourself a man, a bold, bad man, and let a girl dance you off your feet.” Then her face drained, became small and haggard and sincere; she spoke like a child, with sober despair. “Popeye.” He sat with his hands on the table, finicking with a cigarette, the second glass with its melting ice before him. She put her hand on his shoulder. “Daddy,” she said. Moving to shield them from the room, her hand stole toward his arm pit, touching the butt of the flat pistol. It lay rigid in the light, dead vise of his arm and side. “Give it to me,” she whispered. “Daddy. Daddy.” She leaned her thigh against his shoulder, caressing his arm with her flank. “Give it to me, daddy,” she whispered. Suddenly her hand began to steal down his body in a swift, covert movement; then it snapped away in a movement of revulsion. “I forgot,” she whispered; “I didn’t mean.…I didn’t.……”",

Women and the elderly, “the people they least esteem,” carried all loads. Fathers sometimes buried their young sons alive, in obedience to dreams, and fed newborn daughters to their dogs. They did this rather than let the girls be taken by the other tribes with whom they were constantly at war. “If their enemies were to marry their daughters, they would multiply so much that they would conquer them and take them as slaves.”",

It was a laborious process that took three days owing to the 1400 downpour that occurred every day, which required the partially dried sails to be bundled up and stowed before it started to rain. They weren’t nicely folded until they were dry, which meant bundles of sails stuffed daily into the already stuffed forepeak. They had to do the same for all the halyards and sheet lines. First, they ran messenger lines up through the mast and then washed the lines and hung them all over the boat – hundreds of feet of them. The halyards and sheet ropes took even longer to dry than the sails, and they too needed to be dragged undercover at the first sign of rain.",

I longed for some development and one morning I suggested to Ali that Kashmiri songs were better than the commercials from Radio Ceylon. He looked up from his toast with alarm. Then I discovered that in the few short weeks of the tourist season, of tourist transistors tuned to Radio Ceylon, his taste had changed. He liked the commercial jingles, he liked the film songs. They were modern, an accessible part of that world beyond the mountains from which the advanced, money-laden Indian tourists came. Kashmiri music belonged to the lake and the valley; it was rude. So fragile are our fairylands.",

The nightshirt was flannel too, open at the throat to reveal a small cloth bag, not new and not very clean and apparently containing something which smelled like asafoetida, on a soiled string like a necklace. The youth stood beside the bed in a brocade dressing gown. ‘They were blank shells,’ the runner said in his light dry voice. ‘The aeroplane—all four of them—flew right through the bursts. The German one never even deviated, not even going fast, even when one of ours hung right on its tail from about fifty feet for more than a minute while I could actually see the tracer going into it. The same one—aeroplane—ours—dove at us, at me; I even felt one of whatever it was coming out of the gun hit me on the leg here. It was like when a child blows a garden pea at you through a tube except for the smell, the stink, the burning phosphorus. There was a German general in it, you see. I mean, in the German one. There had to be; either we had to send someone there or they had to send someone here. And since we—or the French—were the ones who started it, thought of it first, obviously it would be our right—privilege—duty to be host. Only it would have to look all right from beneath; they couldn’t—couldn’t dare anyway—issue a synchronised simultaneous order for every man on both sides to shut their eyes and count a hundred so they had to do the next best thing to make it look all regular, all orthodox to anyone they couldn’t hide it from——’",

Worried about what the Trump administration might do next, Oscar felt that it made sense to look south rather than just focusing on the United States for his future. He was the son of Cubans, but his roots went back to Jamaica, where his great-grandmother Sarah had been born. He decided to apply for Jamaican citizenship. Just in case. He wasn’t looking for a new identity, but Cubans had such a troublesome reputation as prospective immigrants in the rest of the world that getting a visa for anywhere but Russia or Haiti and a few other countries was difficult. He believed that a Jamaican passport would make it easier to travel, and to open a bank account or rent a car in other countries, if that’s what he decided to do.",

From afar we could see the ban on the lower slopes of a precipitous mountain at the head of the valley; ledges had been laboriously created by the original Lao Lum settlers, leaving all the valley floor available for rice growing. These seventy-six houses were unstilted, windowless, the walls of bamboo, the thatches – raggedy, not panels – extending over the doorways to form a porch of sorts. All the women wore their traditional floppy black trousers and blue or green turbans piled high; the men, except for a few ancients, were sartorially Westernized. This was not a poor ban though there was no school, no health centre, no transport apart from a few bullock-carts and bicycles. The children looked well fed and bouncy, if unwashed; the adults were adequately clothed and generally in good health. The livestock were flourishing and the vegetable plots bountiful – irrigated by streams off the mountain.",

There were sporadic attempts to escape to unoccupied China, a few of which succeeded, and several officers and men were shot because of their contacts with the British Army Aid Group.

The open skywell afforded a glimpse of the other floors, which contained a study room, children’s space, and an audiovisual room.

Now cheap continental jewellery is laid upon plush trays. Now the stately woman stands naked, save for a wave of drapery above the knee. No form can he set on his sensations as he strolls, one blazing afternoon, along the Parisian boulevard and skips out of the way of the royal landau which, looking indescribably ramshackle, rattles along the pitted roadway, saluted by citizens of both sexes cheaply dressed in bowler hats and continental costumes; though a shepherd in kilt, cap, and gaiters very nearly drives his herd of goats between the royal wheels; and all the time the Acropolis surges into the air, raises itself above the town, like a large immobile wave with the yellow columns of the Parthenon firmly planted upon it.",

    "target_paragraph": "Sometimes, Japanese teams tried to solve the problem by simply jettisoning American players who would not play by Japanese rules, while keeping those who would (the Chunichi Dragons recently got rid of the American who was their leading home-run hitter, while hanging on to a less troublesome gaijin who was hitting .190). Yet even that did not get around the most difficult problem of all: that many American imports, however accommodating and acclimatized, were simply too good for the league. Cromartie, for example, had won over many Japanese by graciously giving his newborn child the middle name of “Oh”; yet still the fact remained that every time he came up to the plate, it looked as if he could hit the ball into the next prefecture, almost at will. The first three times I saw him hit, he smashed three solid singles without even appearing to exert himself; over the previous six games, he had hit five home runs. Another American, Boomer Wells, had been virtually pushed out of the Minnesota Twins organization and forced against his will to move to Japan. A failure at home, he had won the Triple Crown in his second season in Japan.",
