Inside the fence, the low thatched huts, looking as if they had grown from the earth and not been built upon it, extended in a haphazard circle. Their walls were made of logs cut from the forests, placed upright and caulked with mud. Each hut had a single door, a low door that could only be entered by crouching, and there were no windows. Smoke curled upward through the leaves of the thatch and on a still day made the singiri seem, from a distance, like a patch in the prairie wreathed in the last wisps of a burned-out fire.",

None other than dried Norwegian cod, this fish is sometimes confused with the similar baccalà, which is dried, salt-cured cod. Stocco is dried in the open air, resulting in a different flavor.4 Importation into Calabria began in the sixteenth century, reaching Mammola by way of old mule trails. The dried fish was then reconstituted in running water over a three-day period. Many traditional recipes were created, particularly in the province of Reggio Calabria where lo stocco has been customarily eaten on Fridays, especially on Good Friday and Christmas Eve. Today, the fish is hydrated following time-honored traditions, and cherished recipes are passed from one generation to another.",

It is still warm on deck, and from the glow of light coming from the saloon I am able to return once more to the pages of Mrs Lewis, who in 1893 made the same voyage as ourselves, and who, in A Lady’s Impressions of Cyprus, has left us a spirited and observant record of life in the island when British suzerainty was only a few years old. She came within a few years of Rim­baud’s visit – the last one. With his talent for tasting every extreme the French poet not only baked himself raw in the oven-like quarries of Larnaca, but succeeded in freezing himself almost insensible on the bony heights of Troodos, building the Governor’s summer lodge, with a small team of mules and workmen. What did he think of Cyprus? He does not say. It was simply a place where a few decently paid jobs existed under the British. His two brief visits have left us a few whining references to the heat and the cold – that is all.",

Uniformed officials of obscure significance were falling over each other in their anxiety to ensure that the infinitesimal Tashi did not break loose and overnight turn the nation rabid. An absurdly large van stood waiting to transport the basket to the State Quarantine Kennels ten miles north of Dublin, and I was firmly refused permission to accompany Tashi on her journey into the unfamiliar cold wetness of an Irish winter night. However, the kennels are excellently run and, during her long imprisonment, Tashi remained in perfect condition, growing a little more and suffering none of the possible ill-effects of quarantine. On the day of her release she obeyed commands as promptly and took life as calmly as she had ever done – perhaps because I had visited her regularly, taking a book and sitting for a few hours on the straw in her kennel, while she untied my shoe-laces for Auld Lang Syne. She always greeted my visits with joy, but accepted my departures with composure – and at last came the day when she departed too, into the breezy green fields and bright June sunshine. Nor can the joy she then showed at racing free have been any greater than my own on seeing that little black body again unfurling its ridiculous brown tail in the wind.",

While still deep in the desert, we pass another LaSalle, its driver puzzling over some problem with the engine. Seeing Rally cars stopped in the desert has become a common sight. When I saw them on our first day in Mongolia, I thought they were stopping to take pictures or have a snack, but I soon learned that nearly every one of them needed a repair. Sometimes a mechanic’s van would be parked alongside, everyone working furiously to get the car back in the race. But with broken cars numbering in the high double-digits and only a handful of mechanic vans, most teams struggled on their own. Of the two signs the organizers gave us on Day 1, one saying SOS and the other saying OK, this man has put the OK sign on his windshield. As Bernard drives by I recognize the car. “Hey,” I shout. “That’s Gustav.” Bernard slams on the brakes and backs up. “Oh come on, Bernard. Their sign says they’re OK. This is the first time we’re making good time. Let’s keep going.” We only know Gustav and his wife, Laure, through a handshake when we happened to park our similar cars near each other. From this I know they’re French speakers, but I don’t know anything else.",

Though dramatic, the arrival of water in a region once known as “the Valley of the Dead” was not entirely unwelcome; “while naturally such an unexpected turn has caused a great deal of inconvenience,” commented a local paper, “the flood will really prove a great benefit.” The barren land might be irrigated, and some respite found from the desiccated air. “The effect of breezes blowing over the hot valley from a salt sea* would temper the climate to a delightful balminess that would make this part of the state one of the most attractive home spots to be found anywhere.”",

The admission fee was $5. The pace of my father’s rotating quickened as I looked into my wallet, and then sped to a whirring blur as I fished out a five-dollar bill and guiltily handed it to the unsmiling woman in the ticket booth. ‘What the hell,’ I thought as I went inside, ‘at least it will give the old man some exercise.’",

For weeks and weeks I traveled through the taiga, most of which in Siberia rests on permafrost. Because the permafrost covers four hundred thousand square miles of Siberia to an average depth of eighty-two feet, and because the end of a drunken forest is a dead forest is a swamp, most of the taiga I saw may be future swamp. A melting of the permafrost will add gigantically to Siberia’s already plentiful supply of swamps.

Earth, the unbelievable ribbon of the road, crashed beneath them and away behind into mad dust con-volvulae: a dun moiling nausea of speed, and the roadside greenery was a tunnel rigid and streaming and unbroken. But he said no word, made no other sound, and when Bayard glanced the lipless cruel derision of his teeth at him presently, Simon knelt in the floor, his old disreputable hat under his arm and his hand clutching a fold of his shirt on his breast. Later the white man glanced at him again, and Simon was watching him and the blurred irises of his eyes were no longer a melting pupilless brown: they were red, and in the blast of wind they were unwinking and in them was that mindless phosphorescence of an animal’s. Bayard jammed the throttle down to the floor.",

Upon which he told her of the stags in the snow at home, and how they would stray into the great hall* for warmth and be fed by an old man with porridge from a bucket. And then she praised him; for his love of beasts; for his gallantry; for his legs. Ravished with her praises and shamed to think how he had maligned her by fancying her on the knees of a common sailor and grown fat and lethargic at forty, he told her that he could find no words to praise her; yet instantly bethought him how she was like the spring and green grass and rushing waters, and seizing her more tightly than ever, he swung her with him half across the river so that the gulls and the cormorants swung too. And halting at length, out of breath, she said, panting slightly, that he was like a million-candled Christmas tree (such as they have in Russia) hung with yellow globes; incandescent; enough to light a whole street by; (so one might translate it) for what with his glowing cheeks, his dark curls, his black and crimson cloak, he looked as if he were burning with his own radiance, from a lamp lit within.",

A shaft of sunlight shined through a large crack where the roof had once been. Efrain was right. It looked just like one of the buildings in the photographs Bingham had taken in 1911.",

It was starting to snow again, steadily, prettily. We set off down the road for the campground and had walked about a quarter of a mile when from behind there was the crunching sound of a motorized vehicle proceeding cautiously through snow. We turned to see a big jeep-type car rolling up beside us. The driver’s window hummed down. It was Jim and Heath. They had come to let us know they had made it, and to make sure we had likewise. “Thought you might like a lift to the campground,” Jim said.",

The study of medicine grows greater every day, so that a doctor who wishes to establish his standing in the profession can dispense with the need for any proof, by merely saying that he trained at Alexandria.’ This seems to have been true: it was in Alexandria that Caesarius, brother of the theologian Gregory of Nazianzen, obtained the qualifications that won him the post of Byzantine Court Physician.",
