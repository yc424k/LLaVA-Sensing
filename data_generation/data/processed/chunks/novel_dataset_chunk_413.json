We lurched from crater to crater at walking speed, while the loose seats rattled, a free-swinging roof panel threatened to guillotine me and mud sprayed my legs through a gaping hole in the floor. At two villages, barely discernible through whirling wet snow, we picked up three more passengers. In Buteni, a large village on a tarred road, I made to get off – thereby reducing the driver to apoplectic anxiety. His agitation was so obviously genuine that I agreed to continue to the town of Sebis; it seemed he wished to hand me over to the army.",

Clouds creep after us, up the canyon, and for once skies look more promising ahead: a shaft of sun that lights the snow at the head of the Seng Khola is a beacon. Then come the first gray drops of rain, this cold rain with a cold wind behind it that overtakes us every afternoon. The river is somber, with broken waterfalls and foaming rock, in a wasteland of sere stubble and spent stone, and I wonder why, in this oppressive place, I feel so full of well-being, striding on through the rain, and grateful in some unnameable way—to what? On the path, the shadow of my close-cropped head is monkish, and the thump of my stave resounds in the still mountains: I feel inspired by Milarepa as described by one of his disciples, walking “free as an unbridled lion in the snowy ranges.”",

Stein turned round with the chair, and in the same movement his spectacles seemed to get pushed up on his forehead. He welcomed me in his quiet and humorous voice. Only one corner of the vast room, the corner in which stood his writing-desk, was strongly lighted by a shaded reading-lamp, and the rest of the spacious apartment melted into shapeless gloom like a cavern. Narrow shelves filled with dark boxes of uniform shape and colour ran round the walls, not from floor to ceiling, but in a sombre belt about four feet broad — catacombs of beetles. Wooden tablets were hung above at irregular intervals. The light reached one of them, and the word Coleoptera written in gold letters glittered mysteriously upon a vast dimness. The glass cases containing the collection of butterflies were ranged in three long rows upon slender-legged little tables. One of these cases had been removed from its place and stood on the desk, which was bestrewn with oblong slips of paper blackened with minute handwriting.",

Then we came out on a wide, snowy ledge at the foot of a sheer dark precipice at least 1,000 feet high: the scale of everything here is fantastic, dream-like. And there was Ronda, the only place-name to appear between Gilgit and Skardu on Bartholomew’s map. Yet it cannot be described as even a small town. It is simply a jumble of wood and stone dwellings, some almost neolithic, scattered in groups over a ledge about one mile long by three furlongs wide. Many houses have animal shelters built on their flat roofs, to evade the snow and catch as much sunlight as possible, and crude stone steps lead up to these. The most conspicuous building was a large and very ancient square two-storey dwelling, standing on its own with four unglazed upper-storey windows whose carved wooden panels reminded me of Tamang houses along the Nepal–Tibet border. Indeed, the whole place recalled the photographs one has seen of Tibetan towns and villages.",

This is a unit of progress and it is also a unit of thought. ‘I can only meditate when I am walking,’ wrote Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the ninth book of his Confessions, ‘when I stop I cease to think; my mind only works with my legs.’ Søren Kierkegaard speculated that the mind might function optimally at the pedestrian pace of three miles per hour, and in a journal entry describes going out for a wander and finding himself ‘so overwhelmed with ideas’ that he ‘could scarcely walk’. Christopher Morley wrote of Wordsworth as ‘employ[ing] his legs as an instrument of philosophy’ and Wordsworth of his own ‘feeling intellect’. Nietzsche was typically absolute on the subject – ‘Only those thoughts which come from walking have any value’ – and Wallace Stevens typically tentative: ‘Perhaps / The truth depends on a walk around a lake.’ In all of these accounts, walking is not the action by which one arrives at knowledge; it is itself the means of knowing.",

He held his trident like a spear, and from the trident a gauze-like pennant fluttered. He walked apart, like one to whom the journey was familiar. He was a young man of complete, disquieting beauty. His skin had been burned black and was smeared with white ash; his hair was reddish-blond; but this only made unnatural the perfection of his features, the tilt of his head, the fineness of his limbs, the light assurance of his walk, the delicate play of muscles down his back and abdomen. Some days before the pilgrimage I had seen him in Srinagar, resting in the shade of a chenar, languid genitals arrogantly exposed. He had seemed out of place, an idler, an aboriginal come to town. His ash-smeared nudity, implying an indifference to the body, had made his beauty sinister. Now he lent his nobility to all the pilgrims: his goal was theirs.",

Then he washed the gun. When he first got it, when the gun was new, or new at least to him, he had had a cleaning rod for it. He had made it himself, of cane, chosen carefully and trimmed and scraped carefully and eyed neatly at the tip to take the greasy rag, and during the first year or so, when he had had money to buy powder and shot and caps to load the shells with and could hunt a little now and then, he had been no less particular in the care of the cleaning rod than of the gun because he had only bought the gun but the rod he had made. But the rod was gone now, he did not remember when nor know where, vanished along with the other accumulations of his maturity which had been dear to him too once, which he had shed somehow and somewhere along the road between the attaining of manhood and this hour when he found himself with nothing but an empty and foodless house which did not actually belong to him, and the gun, and that irremediable instant when the barrels had come level and true and his will had told his finger to contract, which nothing but his own death would ever efface from his memory. So he tipped water from the bucket over the gun and removed his shirt and wiped it dry and picked up the shoes and returned to the house and, without lighting the lamp again, stood in the dark at the cold stove and ate with his fingers from the pot of cold peas which sat on it and went and lay down, still in his overalls, on the pallet bed in the room which was empty at last even of the loud shades, lying flat on his back in the darkness with his eyes open and his arms straight beside him, thinking of nothing.

The next morning dawned clear and cold, the sun hidden beyond the cliffs of the fjord as the team made preparations to return home. As the sun emerged above the peaks to the east, “we were startled by the sudden appearance of a red light burning with a strange unearthly splendor on the topmost peak of the Fairweather Mountains,” Muir wrote. “Instead of vanishing as suddenly as it had appeared, it spread and spread until the whole range down to the level of the glaciers was filled with the celestial fire.” The crimson intensified until the peaks above seemed to glow like molten iron. Slowly, the blazing light descended, catching every peak and glacier “until all the mighty host stood transfigured, hushed, and thoughtful, as if awaiting the coming of the Lord.”",

Yet he managed somehow to run past her in the door, she grasping at him as Varner, eel-like, followed. “Stop the fool!” she shouted, following again as Varner and Jody thundered back down the stairs and into the ground floor room which Varner still called his office though for the last two years now the clerk, Snopes, had slept on a cot in it, where Varner now overtook Jody bending over the open drawer of the clumsy (and now priceless, though Varner did not know it) walnut secretary which had belonged to Varner’s grandfather, scrabbling a pistol from among the jumble of dried cotton bolls and seed pods and harness buckles and cartridges and old papers which it contained. Through the window beside the desk the negress, the cook, could be seen running across the back yard toward her cabin, her apron over her head, as negroes do when trouble starts among the white people.

Perhaps that is why it has scarcely been approached in poetry or fiction, music or painting; every region of the United States except the arid West has produced distinguished artists or has been represented in works of art which have agreed-upon general significance. Only the hacks rush in where genius hesitates to tread, and the baffling reality is lost behind the dust clouds thrown up by herds of Zane Greys and Max Brands, by the anonymous painters of sugar-sweet landscapes and Roman-Indian portraits that clutter up certain galleries, and by those tough old humorous retired cowladies whose memoirs are so lovingly reprinted by the regional university presses – No Life for a Lady, No High Adobe, No Time for Tea, No Sin in the Saddle, etc. Behind the dust, meanwhile, under the vulture-haunted sky, the desert waits – mesa, butte, canyon, reef, sink, escarpment, pinnacle, maze, dry lake, sand dune and barren mountain – untouched by the human mind.",

The peace and the bygone beauty of the cathedral created the glow of the great past. And in the market-place they were selling chestnuts wholesale, great heaps of bright, brown chestnuts, and sacks of chestnuts, and peasants very eager selling and buying. I thought of Como, it must have been wonderful even a hundred years ago. Now it is cosmopolitan, the cathedral is like a relic, a museum object, everywhere stinks of mechanical money-pleasure. I dared not risk walking to Milan: I took a train. And there, in Milan, sitting in the Cathedral Square, on Saturday afternoon, drinking Bitter Campari and watching the swarm of Italian city-men drink and talk vivaciously, I saw that here the life was still vivid, here the process of disintegration was vigorous, and centred in a multiplicity of mechanical activities that engage the human mind as well as the body. But always there was the same purpose stinking in it all, the mechanizing, the perfect mechanizing of human life.",

It was a scorch-hot day and the ice cream had melted to a chocolate milkshake in a carton. I could have swallowed the whole thing, but sharing seemed appropriate—some for Gabe the courier, some for our friend Peach, who hiked in with him, and for Cassie, as hot and dust-covered as I was. After they finished, politely refusing the last sludge, I ran my fingers around the edges of the carton, finally tore it apart at the seam to slurp every last drip, and came up with the tip of my nose sticky and brown.

Vacant storefronts lined several quiet floors around a central concourse. Elevators and escalators sat motionless and waited for shoppers that never come. The power was out, of course, and the only light was that of the sun reflected off the Nile and through another magnificent glass wall. We stopped to admire the view. There are seventeen million people in greater Cairo, yet we had that brand-new shopping center – and the view – to ourselves. We eventually found the bank, and the loo, on the far side of the mall. The bank was open, but the loo was closed. Teresa ran down a guard to unlock the door for her while I exchanged another wad of euro for pound. On our way out, I suggested we stop for a fruit cocktail in the bar, but Teresa was in a hurry.",

The road beneath my window was quite quiet except for the occasional clatter past of a child in wooden shoes. Of all the places I had stayed at in Rügen this place was the most countrified and innocent. Idly I sat there, enjoying the soft dampness of the clover-laden air, counting how many stars I could see in the pale sky, watching the women who had been milking the cows far away across the plain come out of the dusk towards me carrying their frothing pails. It must have been quite late, for the plain had risen up in front of my window like a great black wall, when I heard a rattle of wheels on the high road in the direction of Bobbin. At first very faint it grew rapidly louder. 'What a time to come along this lonely road,' I thought; and wondered how it would be farther along where the blackness of the pines began. But the cart pulled up immediately beneath my window, and leaning out I saw the light from the inn door stream on to a green hat that I knew, and familiar shoulders draped in waterproof clothing.",

    "target_paragraph": "More weeks passed. Even before I learned that there would be a long delay in getting my second stipend—the sum I'd intended would take me back to America, after Kivu—I had become so much a part of Tange, or vice versa, that I made no firm plans for going away. Once or twice, I proposed a departure date, but Stewart always had objections, and finally we agreed that I might as well count on a year, or even two, at Tange. As he said, things sounded pretty depressing back in New York. Actually, we didn't want to alter the state of affairs, simply because to do so was too much trouble. The air had that effect. There were no seasonal changes as we know them in America—no bracing autumn breezes, only the rainy and the dry months, and in Tange even these weren't clearly separated; I recall wet days and dry days, but no pattern. Once in a great while, some Belgian official or other would come along, on a tour of inspection or doing a little hunting. Usually these men were accompanied by menageres, who were entertained by Stewart's wives while the gentlemen talked. Such guests never stayed more than a night or two, but even that short a visit seemed to me an interruption rather than a wistful reminder of life outside. Letters from home didn't bother me in the same way—I could enjoy them because I was free to choose my own time to reply—but visitors called for effort. Not that I was lazy. I wasn't. In Tange fashion, I lived strenuously, making expeditions by pirogue to other villages and busying myself with the clinic, as well as with a variety of animals— a baby wild pig, a very young baboon and about eight others who were older, five or six goats, other monkeys, a parrot, and a deer. But I didn't like social effort. I liked peaceful afternoons when nothing happened, when Chimpo slept in a cool spot, her arms outflung, and chickens strutted and pecked, when somebody down on the riverbank conversed gently with somebody else hundreds of yards away on the other side, and the goats bleated, and the girls did each other's hair. At such times, all three of them got on well, gathered on that part of the veranda that overlooked the yard where they cooked. Our European meals were prepared by a man, but each girl had her own fire and cooking pot.",

Just after starting out, we passed a large wooden sign carved with what looked like a stock price chart. It was a graph of the trail’s changing elevation. Today’s walk, which gained almost a mile in altitude, rose like the dot-com bubble of 1998; tomorrow’s moderate ups and downs looked like normal market turbulence; our fourth and final day on the trail nosedived like the sort of crash that had investors leaping from windows.",

It was still gray outside and there were different pine trunks than the ones he usually woke to see and a longer gap beyond them toward the sea. His right arm was stiff because he had slept on it. Then, awake, he knew he was in a strange bed and he saw Marita lying sleeping by him. He remembered everything and he looked at her lovingly and covered her fresh brown body with the sheet and then kissed her very lightly again and putting on his dressing gown walked out into the dew-wet early morning carrying the image of how she looked with him to his room. He took a cold shower, shaved, put on a shirt and a pair of shorts and walked down to his working room. He stopped at the door of Marita’s room and opened it very carefully. He stood and looked at her sleeping, and closed the door softly and went into the room where he worked. He got out his pencils and a new cahier, sharpened five pencils and began to write the story of his father and the raid in the year of the Maji-Maji rebellion that had started with the trek across the bitter lake. He made the crossing now and completed the dreadful trek of the first day when the sunrise had caught them with the part that had to be done in the dark only half finished and the mirages already making as the heat became unbearable. By the time the morning was well advanced and a strong fresh east breeze was blowing through the pines from the sea he had finished the night at the first camp under the fig trees where the water came down from the escarpment and was moving out of that camp in the early morning and up the long draw that led to the steep cut up onto the escarpment.\nHe found he knew much more about his father than when he had first written this story and he knew he could measure his progress by the small things which made his father more tactile and to have more dimensions than he had in the story before. He was fortunate, just now, that his father was not a simple man.\nDavid wrote steadily and well and the sentences that he had made before came to him complete and entire and he put them down, corrected them, and cut them as if he were going over proof. Not a sentence was missing and there were many that he put down as they were returned to him without changing them. By two o’clock he had recovered, corrected and improved what it had taken him five days to write originally. He wrote on a while longer now and there was no sign that any of it would ever cease returning to him intact.",

How tolerable is the life of little shopkeepers, I would say, as the train drew through the suburbs and one saw lights in bedroom windows. Active, energetic as a swarm of ants, I said, as I stood at the window and watched workers, bag in hand, stream into town. What hardness, what energy and violence of limb, I thought, seeing men in white drawers scouring after a football on a patch of snow in January. Now being grumpy about some small matter—it might be the meat—it seemed luxurious to disturb with a little ripple the enormous stability, whose quiver, for our child was about to be born, increased its joy, of our married life. I snapped at dinner. I spoke unreasonably as if, being a millionaire, I could throw away five shillings; or, being a perfect steeple-jack, stumbled over a footstool on purpose. Going up to bed we settled our quarrel on the stairs, and standing by the window looking at a sky clear like the inside of a blue stone, “Heaven be praised,” I said, “we need not whip this prose into poetry. The little language is enough.” For the space of the prospect and its clarity seemed to offer no impediment whatsoever, but to allow our lives to spread out and out beyond all bristling of roofs and chimneys to the flawless verge.",

In Balata eight or ten people commonly share two small rooms yet I was being allocated a salon 25 x 10 feet with two big security-barred windows facing an enormous new girls’ primary school recently built by UNRWA. Beyond and slightly below lay the ‘real’ Balata, sunless and sullen, while I could look out at a wide sky. Behind a partition were the loo, a mini-hand basin and what might one day be a shower; that depended on Nablus municipality’s water supply and other mysterious variables. A second partitioned corner held a plywood cupboard and a large earthenware sink but no cooking appliance. This bothered Ismail but I assured him it didn’t matter as I never cook for myself when living alone. Furniture comprised a camp bed, one warm blanket, a small table and chair below a wall socket. There was also a central ceiling bulb but one had to remember never to touch its loose switch with wet fingers. Apart from being accessible to sunlight, these cliff-face Balata houses enjoy an important advantage over the rest; two entrances make it less difficult (though never easy) to elude invading IDF troops.",

Here the mountain was again wooded and, this being its northern side, the road suddenly became a menacing mass of black ice. Now we really were back where we had started from and as soon as I saw the stuff I could most vividly visualise the road from the ferry-berth at Dunkirk on 16 January 1963! I struggled on over this glassy slide for about half a mile, but both Roz and myself were continually losing our grip; with the road so narrow and winding, and the traffic so heavy, and the drop beyond the edge so horrific my nerve soon broke. Military assistance seemed the solution and having waited some twenty minutes we were rescued by an officers’ snow-chained Land-Rover, en route back to Simla; the officers had some rude things to say about my sanity, especially when I declined their kind offer of a lift all the way and insisted on being unloaded at Narkanda. Despite the lower altitude it’s very much colder on this treeless, windswept ridge than on the wooded Jalori Pass. This camp is in a fairly sheltered spot, on the southern slope, yet it’s still bitterly cold. There are about 300 adults here and 62 children, one of whom has pneumonia; I’m very much afraid he’ll die during the night. This crisis puts me in a heartbreaking position, because his mother comes and kneels in front of me at intervals, touching my feet with her head and beseeching me to give him pills. She won’t accept my repeated affirmations that I’m not a doctor, and at such moments I feel acutely frustrated by that inherent stupidity which prevents me from learning foreign languages; I would give anything to be able to talk to this woman.",
