We went up every yard of that sheer, 3000-foot precipice – on which the Malanis have carved a stairway in the rock – and before we had got halfway the ache of my legs and lungs was torture; I almost wept with relief when we came to a ledge where there was space for all of us to collapse speechlessly for another rest. By now my clothes were saturated with sweat and I avidly ate the snow which lay within reach and rubbed its delicious hard coldness on my face and neck – to the wonder of my companions, who were still feeling chilly. Soon we set off again, pulling ourselves up and up and up. Then we saw our first Malanis – three young women, carrying loads as big as themselves, who effortlessly overtook us and disappeared ahead. Their swift agility made me feel like something left out too long in the rain, as I fought for the breath and the energy to drag one foot in front of the other. (I realise that the descent tomorrow, when I intend to return to Jari, will be even more difficult, as it will involve constantly looking down at that unspeakable drop into the nullah.) At 4.15 p.m. we finally crawled over the edge of a little plateau astride the mountain-top and threw ourselves full length on the close-cropped grass.",

It is a place for people to congregate in the terrific force of their gregariousness, their mass cravings, like cattle around a water-hole; and when it is empty, when there is no saint being made or other spectacle, it is lifeless: very admirable in its lines but cold, with a hollow look, like the scene of a dream in which after standing with a great crowd one has suddenly been left alone. But then as suddenly you find it filled another way; another sequence has begun. It is a sunny winter afternoon, and now even this enormous space has become a living room, or public nursery. The Dome, announcing itself for miles around as the center of the world, is actually presiding like a hen over thousands of babies and mothers and lovers and very ancient people strewn all over the steps of Bernini’s colonnade and the awesome area it encloses, not as if they owned it but really owning it. It is where they live. The fountains, those two high waving flags of world Catholicism, are as local as a barnyard pump. There is no distance; there is no awe of anything.",

The farmer’s wife, a big good-natured Swedish woman, received him with friendly curiosity. She’d known one or two young fellows to come down as late as December, she said, but she’d never had a honeymoon before. The idea amused her, and she started at once warming up a can of tomato soup, and offered Vance a saucepan to heat the milk for breakfast. While she warmed the soup he sat in the window of the kitchen and looked out to the sea. What a place to live in always--solitude and beauty, and that great unresting Presence calling out night and day with many voices! (“Many voices”--where’d he read that?) There, the woman said; she guessed the soup was good and hot; maybe he’d like some crackers with it? Oh, he could settle when he went away--that was all right. She even rummaged out a tin of prepared coffee, left there with some of the camp stores; he could have that too, and a couple of towels. Soap was more difficult to come by, but she decided that they could have her youngest boy’s, as he was off clamdigging for a week, and no great hand at washing anyhow. Carrying the pot of hot soup carefully, his other supplies in his pockets, Vance walked back through the twilight. . . .",

With Buster’s doom-laden message still hanging in the air I saw all that remained of the old bridge was a metal framework set on top of concrete posts sunk into the ground far beneath the water’s surface. While I realized the bridge would have been closed if the crossing had been dangerous, the structure looked fragile. I could see the wavelets under the grid of the damaged bridge. They proceeded in their unending march to the shoreline underneath both bridges and our truck. A driver couldn’t help but think about the dangers of steering tens of thousands of pounds over a wide stretch of seawater, even over a bridge of solid concrete. If a bridge gave way, it would be a catastrophe. Yet, what could any of us do? The old expression of “Keep on trucking,” took on a bright, fresh meaning!",

On both sides, a few tiny bans lay at the base of low, rounded mountains – the foot-hills of a distant jagged range. The cold morning mist had dispersed, the sun shone pleasantly hot, the tributary by the track gleamed golden brown, matching the stubble on which buffaloes grazed – rather bony buffaloes as at the end of January not much stubble remained. The traffic was all two-wheeled, cyclists bringing loads of forest produce – including several pheasants and squirrels – to the market. One young woman had to wheel her bicycle; a large pig, its throat neatly slit, was tied to the carrier. Everyone looked more dark skinned, blunt featured and stockier than the Lao Lum. And everyone seemed taken aback by the falang cyclist, probably an unprecedented phenomenon on that track.",

    "target_paragraph": "This mistaken view has to be firmly debunked. The relationship between taking a cruise along the Li River in China and experiencing the otherworldly landscape of the Guilin karsts enveloping the boat – full of fellow Chinese travelers – and the watching of a film about Guilin is akin to the relationship between seeing a photo of a person you love and having the actual person next to you. The visual portrayal of a place, whether it be a photo or a movie, as well as any verbal description of it, are incommensurable with the immersive living experience. There is no comparison between Guilin-the-photo and Guilin-the-place-and-experience. Another analogy is comparing the photo of a French cheese platter with eating the real cheeses. One is dead, the other alive. The real cheeses have a wealth of smells, textures, and tastes; the photo is a mere representation. Often, modern man lives in his mind and forgets that Guilin is a real place situated in a three-dimensional universe with a sky above it, a real river running through it, and surrounding rice fields with farmers tending them. No digital reproduction or literary description, however good or poetic, can replace the feeling of a breeze on one’s face or the little droplets from the river’s spray. At best, any description is a pointer to what one may experience if one gets off the couch and sets out to discover the actual place.",

A tin bucket full of ice with two or three bottles of wine stood in a corner. As our eyes became accustomed to the light, we saw the gigantic, khaki-clad figure of Don\nVenustiano Carranza sitting in a big chair. There was something strange in the way he sat there, with his hands on the arms of the chair, as if he had been placed in it and told not to move. He did not seem to be thinking, nor to have been working,—you couldn’t imagine him at that table. You got the impression of a vast, inert body—a statue.",

Money changes hands around the world over this lure of heaven and desire, a place superior to the here and now; a place you can get to if only you’re one part lucky, one part hardworking. We celebrate the wealthy and ignore the poor, chase the money and waste the moment. Though this is a global issue, in India the puppet strings are more obvious, the production more awkwardly executed. The truth hangs out like a fly undone.",

The building itself has nothing to commend it except the memory of its author whose work is commemorated in a finely worded plaque, for it is of traditional Public Works design, and resembles any one of a thousand such villas in the Indian hill-stations. Indeed the whole of Troodos looked like some unlovely and ill-considered hill-station, with its primitive latrines and general air of hope­less desolation. The thought of spending a holiday there, even in one of the three or four well-found hotels, would hardly commend itself to any but the bed-ridden. One would yawn oneself to death.",

Forty years on the inside, this impatient advocate of the commercial potentialities of Alaska is said to be one of the two wealthiest people in the state, the other being his brother-in-law. “Idealists here in town see a need for a park in every housing development,” Atwood told me one day. “They want to bury utility lines, reserve green belts, build bicycle paths. With these things, the bowl could only contain three hundred and fifty thousand. They’re making it very difficult for man, these people. They favor animals, trees, water, flowers.

    "target_paragraph": "In 1562 the Council of Trent excluded from churches all music that introduced anything impure or lascivious. According to Luigi Barzini, “Most of the choirs sang holy words to ribald tunes. . . . Masses bore the titles of popular melodies on which they were founded, names . . . suited for contemporary perfumes. . . . The very explicit words of love ditties and obscene ballads rang out often during religious services. . . .” Barzini's cynicism—a trait he attributes to all Italians—may have led him to hyper-bole. But it is a fact that Pope Pius IV directed a congregation of eight cardinals to determine whether music could suggest anything but the impure or lascivious. The cardinals determined that it could. But the dampening effect of this procedure remains with us to this day . . . at least in cold climates.",

    "target_paragraph": "I was in New Hampshire now, which pleased me, because we had recently moved to the state, so I was naturally interested to explore it. Vermont and New Hampshire are so snugly proximate and so similiar in size, climate, accent, and livelihood (principally, skiing and tourism) that they are often bracketed as twins, but in fact they have quite different characters. Vermont is Volvos and antique shops and country inns with cutely contrived names like Quail Hollow Lodge and Fiddlehead Farm Inn. New Hampshire is guys in hunting caps and pickup trucks with license plates bearing the feisty slogan “Live Free or Die.” The landscape, too, differs crucially. Vermont’s mountains are comparatively soft and rolling, and its profusion of dairy farms gives it a more welcoming and inhabited feel. New Hampshire is one big forest. Of the state’s 9,304 square miles of territory, some 85 percent—an area somewhat larger than Wales—is woods, and nearly all the rest is either lakes or above treeline. So apart from the very occasional town or ski resort, New Hampshire is primarily, sometimes rather dauntingly, wilderness. And its hills are loftier, craggier, more difficult and forbidding than Vermont’s.",

Schoolchildren were coming from every direction, walking or cycling home to lunch – lucky children, free of adult escorts. Irina shouted angrily at litter-droppers, ordering them to bin the offensive scraps. Most obeyed her, muttering and pouting but not disputing the elder’s authority.

It was beginning to change, turning now, under my clouding glance, into the scenery for some terrible Germanic saga, where snow vanished under the breath of dragons whose red-hot blood thawed sword-blades like icicles. It was a place for battle-axes and bloodshed and the last pages of the Nibelungenlied when the capital of Hunland is in flames and everybody in the castle is hacked to bits. Things grew quickly darker and more fluid; the echo, the splash, the boom and the roar of fast currents sunk this beer-hall under the Rhine-bed; it became a cavern full of more dragons, misshapen guardians of gross treasure; or the fearful abode, perhaps, where Beowulf, after tearing the Grendel’s arm out of its socket, tracked him over the snow by the bloodstains and, reaching the mere’s edge, dived in to swim many fathoms down and slay his loathsome water-hag of a mother in darkening spirals of gore.",

Florida’s railway link has enabled me to reach the city centre independently – otherwise, my social life has been limited.

When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.",

But at only a quarter a piece, until he could reach Memphis and actually have the pistol in his hand, there was no foreseeable point within the twelve remaining dollars where he would have peace; already, before he was even outside the store, he was saying Be a man, Be a man. You got to be a man, you got too much to do, too much to resk; and, walking again, he was still sweating a little, not panting so much as simply breathing deeply like one who has just blundered unwarned into then out of the lair, the arms, of Semiramis or Messalina, still incredulous, still aghast at his own temerity and still amazed that he has escaped with his life.",

I preferred to believe that at least my escape was back in the direction from which humans had evolved. That somehow digression was superior to being dispassionate. But that drive, to be here, on the Pacific Crest Trail, attempting the record alone, had led to a dangerous crossroads. I pulled out my SPOT tracking beacon. I held it in my hand and opened the cover on the SOS button. All I had to do was push it and help would come. Local emergency personnel would receive my coordinates almost instantly. They would bring me fluids. Fly me to safety. I would sleep in a cool room and eat and drink until my body recovered. I wouldn’t have to walk anymore. I could forget that I’d ever tried this.",
