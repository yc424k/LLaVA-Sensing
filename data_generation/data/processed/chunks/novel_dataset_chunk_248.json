As mentioned in a following email, after a glass or two of wine, I sometimes play the role of one of the two partners and try to woo the other to the braai. My success in this venture has been limited, although on a few occasions I have managed to get the owls to fly toward me at least temporarily. On one occasion I actually saw one of the owls. His look of confusion followed by a look of disgust still sits in my memory. As soon as he realized that he had been duped, he flew off and resumed calling his appropriate partner. Since the pair came back the next evening, I have always assumed that my intervention was nothing but a harmless flirtation.",

But he had picked up, in the course of his long humanitarian career, a good deal of general knowledge. Old Koppen was no fool. He was intelligent; intelligence, as the Count had said, being perfectly compatible with progress. The millionaire could put two and two together as fast as most men; he was celebrated, even among his quick-witted compatriots, for an uncanny faculty of walking round people without getting off his chair.

Slowly Puttgarden receded behind us in a wake of foam and before long Lolland appeared over the horizon and began to glide towards us, like a huge low-lying sea monster.",

As the light increased a bud here and there split asunder and shook out flowers, green veined and quivering, as if the effort of opening had set them rocking, and pealing a faint carillon as they beat their frail clappers against their white walls. Everything became softly amorphous, as if the china of the plate flowed and the steel of the knife were liquid. Meanwhile the concussion of the waves breaking fell with muffled thuds, like logs falling, on the shore.",

The earlier explorers of the Lake Victoria region had cautiously skirted Masailand because these pastoralists, who migrated from Southern Sudan a few centuries ago, long remained determined to prevent any European encroachment on their territory. However, by the early 1890s the clan quarrel between the Ilmasai and the Iloikop – combined with epidemics of cholera, smallpox, rinderpest and consequent famine – had so reduced Masai numbers and vitality that the British were able to negotiate a treaty with Olonana, their laibon or religious leader-cum-chief. The subsequent construction of the Mombasa-to-Uganda railway bisected Masailand and, when the settlers arrived, the Masai were banished to two reserves, north and south of the railway. As settler demands increased, the colonial authorities compelled the Masai to leave the northern reserve and move south. Ever since, they have grazed that reserve and parts of northern Tanzania, but having to share their territory with protected wildlife naturally causes some conflict between tribesmen and game wardens.",

He gave me a pill, and a tin cup of water to help it down. I stared around curiously. There were cardboard boxes piled against the walls, and an instrument cabinet. A patch of sunlight lay on the floor matting. The room was very hot. Sweat rolled down Bobby's face. Though smokers have little sense of smell, I could distinguish a reek of disinfectant. I asked what kind of cases the hospital cared for, and Bobby said it took in everything. He spoke absently, pacing up and down, waiting for the pill to work on me.",
