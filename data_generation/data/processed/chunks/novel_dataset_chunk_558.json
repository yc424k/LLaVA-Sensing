I first went there about twenty years ago to escape the cold, grey, soggy Scottish winter. I started a Fair Trade business exporting jewellery, did the buying in Thailand every winter, returned each year for longer and longer, and eventually just stayed. When that business folded, I still stayed. I re-trained to teach English to foreign speakers, initially face to face and later online – a very fortunate change, and an ironic one – since I scowled at it, at first. Later this is what rescued me.",

Mirrors caught the light on shoulder bags, long dresses streamed from carved wooden balconies, scarves fluttered in the breeze, demons stared out of rice-paper calendars. On every side, irregular, nine-storied temples jutted up, and then were obscured by a flutter of pigeons. Squeaky-voiced elves chattered around the shrines where they peddled Bhutanese stamps, Niwari paintings, English chocolate. A ramshackle hut advertised the “Unique Typing Institute” and its only customer, standing patiently outside, was a cow. Everywhere, the dusty streets spun and whirled and revolved like a mandala. Freaks and flute sellers wandered in circles around a main square where long-haired men from East and West, hipsters and hawkers, hustlers and heretics, ricocheted counters off the sides of Carom boards. Snakelike icons wriggled from cardboard signs and elephant-headed gods sat in the middle of yellow-wreathed shrines and everywhere, staring down from walls and homes and streamers, were eyes, eyes, narrow, painted pairs of eyes.",

To Monk, the first, because it was the most definite of all the smells of Paris—the one that belonged to Paris and to no other city—was the smell of stale and slightly wetted sawdust. It was a smell that came up from the entrances to the underground and up through the pavement gratings. It was a smell of lifeless life, of dead vitality; it was a smell of dead air, used-up, tainted oxygen. It was a smell of millions of weary and unwashed people, who had come and gone and breathed the air and used it up and left it there—dead, stagnant, poisoned, tainted, and corrupted, carrying upon its dead waves the smell of weary and exhausted sweat, the dead, denuded breath of lifeless energy.",

    "target_paragraph": "At five this morning we were at anchor in the roads of Lahaina, the chief village on the mountainous island of Maui. This place is very beautiful from the sea, for beyond the blue water and the foamy reef the eye rests gratefully on a picturesque collection of low, one-storied, thatched houses, many of frame, painted white; others of grass, but all with deep, cool verandahs, half hidden among palms, bananas, kukuis, breadfruit, and mangoes, dark groves against gentle slopes behind,—covered with sugar-cane of a bright pea-green. It is but a narrow strip of land between the ocean and the red, flaring, almost inaccessible, Maui hills, which here rise abruptly to a height of 6,000 feet, pinnacled, chasmed, buttressed, and almost verdureless, except in a few deep clefts, green and cool with ferns and candlenut trees, and moist with falling water. Lahaina looked intensely tropical in the roseflush of the early morning, a dream of some bright southern isle, too surely to pass away. The sun blazed down on shore, ship, and sea, glorifying all things through the winter day. It was again ecstasy \"to dream and dream\" under the awning, fanned by the light sea-breeze, with the murmur of an unknown musical tongue in one's ears, and the rich colouring and graceful grouping of a tropical race around one. We called at Maaleia, a neck of sandy, scorched, verdureless soil, and at Ulupalakua, or rather at the furnace seven times heated, which is the landing of the plantation of that name, on whose breezy slopes cane refreshes the eye at a height of 2,000 feet above the sea. We anchored at both places, and with what seemed to me a needless amount of delay, discharged goods and natives, and natives, mats, and calabashes were embarked. In addition to the essential mat and calabash of poi, every native carried some pet, either dog or cat, which was caressed, sung to, and talked to with extreme tenderness; but there were hardly any children, and I noticed that where there were any, the men took charge of them. There were very few fine, manly dogs; the pets in greatest favour are obviously odious, weak-eyed, pink-nosed Maltese terriers.",

Why had she bidden him to come early if she was having people to dine? On a closer inspection of the garments besides which Nastasia was laying his own, his resentment gave way to curiosity. The overcoats were in fact the very strangest he had ever seen under a polite roof; and it took but a glance to assure himself that neither of them belonged to Julius Beaufort. One was a shaggy yellow ulster of \"reach-me-down\" cut, the other a very old and rusty cloak with a cape—something like what the French called a \"Macfarlane.\" This garment, which appeared to be made for a person of prodigious size, had evidently seen long and hard wear, and its greenish-black folds gave out a moist sawdusty smell suggestive of prolonged sessions against bar-room walls. On it lay a ragged grey scarf and an odd felt hat of semiclerical shape.",

Eventually, lunch abandoned, Lesthouse abandoned, I rounded the last descending curves of the highway, passed the black-roofed houses of the last village in Niigata, and with the sun squinting hazily through the afternoon clouds, I crossed the prefectural boundary and emerged from a filthy, mile-long tunnel onto the flat coastal plain of Toyama. Straw-hatted women pedaled their bicycles, children marched trimly home from their schools, a grandfather with a fuzzy-haired baby strapped to his back stood by the side of the highway eating toast and jam, and in the green, close-packed, watery fields the rice slowly ripened.",

    "target_paragraph": "But today I don’t think anyone who saw Yakutsk would be reminded of Elwood, or of anyplace like it. Elwood is another small American town that has passed through stages of early settlement, enthusiastic development, industrial boom, and recent decline. In those terms, its frontier years ended ages ago. Yakutsk, on the other hand, is still a frontier place, still hanging on to the writhing wilderness by its fingernails. The Lena River, which Yakutsk is technically on the left bank of, has moved away from most of the city, and even to get to the river heading due east from the center of town you have to cross a no-road zone of islands and former river channels and oxbow lakes. The river itself, once you do reach it, is at least four miles wide. There is no bridge across it at Yakutsk, nor is there any farther downstream; upstream, the closest bridge is more than seven hundred miles away. To travel from Yakutsk to Nizhni Bestyakh, just on the other side of the river, you go by ferry in the warmer months and by ice road in winter. When the river is not yet frozen but too dangerous for boats because of the floating ice, people either don’t go, or fly.",

So close was the latticework of leaves and branches, and so tall the sides of the holloway that light penetrated its depths only in thin lances. Roger and I moved slowly up the bed of the roadway, forcing a way through the undergrowth, through clumps of chest-high nettles, past big strong-holds of bramble, and over hawthorns that had grown together, enmeshing across the roadbed. Occasionally we came to small clearings in the holloway, where light fell and grass grew. From thorn thickets, there was the scuttle of unseen creatures. Any noise we made thudded into the banks, and was lost. A person might hide out undetected in such a place for weeks or months, I thought.",

    "target_paragraph": "These brothers were friendly, shy, self-reliant men with a lean, sweated look and hazel eyes so used to gazing half-shut at the sun and the wind that the wrinkles at the corners expanded over their tanned cheeks in small white fans. They wore moccasins and their white homespun tunics, caught in with wide belts, expanded to the volume of kilts. Their father was identical in feature and garb, except that his hair was white and that he was still jerkined in a fleece cojoc and hatted in a conical fleece caciula. He sat on the ledge, his hands crossed on the helve of an axe. The face of Radu’s wife was sad in repose, gay in motion, and strikingly beautiful; she and another woman span as they went about their tasks. Their worn, heavily carved distaffs were stuck in sashes of black braid. Elaborate detail but sober colours marked their attire: headkerchiefs and aprons of faded blue over white and many-pleated skirts, and intricately worked oblongs of the same faded hue which panelled their wide sleeves. Their torsos were enclosed in dashing-looking soft leather hauberks, shiny with wear and lacing up the side. When one of them started a new thread, Radu’s wife licked the tip of her thumb and forefinger like a bank-teller, pulled some wool from the yarn which, drawn tapering to her other hand, span with the twirl of her spindle; all as unconsciously as knitting. She sang a doina to herself as she moved about the yard, each verse beginning ‘Foaie verde!’ – ‘Green leaf’ – or ‘Frunze verde!’ – ‘Green frond’. These green-leaf invocations always struck me as a sort of woodland salute to beech, ash, oak, pine and thorn, as if the trees and their foliage held some mysterious and beneficent power.",

To a young man with the least fire in him that little upward lift in the middle of her red top lip was distracting, infatuating, maddening. He had never before seen a woman’s lips and teeth which forced upon his mind with such persistent iteration the old Elizabethan simile of roses filled with snow. Perfect, he, as a lover, might have called them off-hand. But no – they were not perfect. And it was the touch of the imperfect upon the would-be perfect that gave the sweetness, because it was that which gave the humanity.",

Some were in (very large) family groups, some walked alone still reading half-aloud from prayer books. Most men carried heavy weapons and wore the self-designed uniform of those vigilante units which occasionally clash with the IDF if the latter seem ‘over-protective’ towards Palestinians (a rare circumstance). In general Hebron’s settlers are US-born, with a soupçon of newish immigrants from France. I feigned friendliness: big smile, jolly ‘Good morning!’ Most pretended not to see me (we were within touching distance), a few looked briefly at me with hate in their eyes. Beyond question these people are severely disturbed; some consider them psychotic. If that diagnosis is accepted, one can’t blame them for what they do. The blame lies elsewhere.",

The sound of the lines gave her the same nice feeling that she had when Mrs. Propart played the March in Scipio after Evening Service. She tried to make lines of her own that went the same way as the lines in Milton and Shakespeare and Pope's Iliad. She found out that there was nothing she liked so much as making these lines. It was nicer even than playing the Hungarian March. She thought it was funny that the lines like Pope's Iliad came easiest, though they had to rhyme.\n\"Silent he wandered by the sounding sea,\" was good, but the Greek line that Mark showed her went: \"Be d'akeon para thina poluphloisboio thalasses\"; that was better. \"Don't you think so, Mark?\"\n\"Clever Minx. Much better.\"\n\"Mark—if God knew how happy I am writing poetry he'd make the earth open and swallow me up.\"\nMark only said, \"You mustn't say that to Mamma. Play 'Violetta.'\"\nOf all hateful and disgusting tunes the most disgusting and the most hateful was \"Violetta,\" which Mr. Sippett's sister taught her. But if Mark would promise to make Mamma let her learn Greek she would play it to him twenty times running.\nWhen Mark went to Chelmsted that autumn he left her his brown Greek Accidence and Smith's Classical Dictionary, besides Macaulay's Lays of Ancient Rome. She taught herself Greek in the hour after breakfast before Miss Sippett came to give her her music lesson. She was always careful to leave the Accidence open where Miss Sippett could see it and realise that she was not a stupid little girl.\nBut whether Miss Sippett saw the Accidence or not she always behaved as if it wasn't there.",

Three times the engine broke down and once, in the middle of the night, repairs took so long that by the time we were ready to start again an impassable snowdrift had formed in front of us. But the two drivers and I agreed afterwards that this was a blessing, because by the time we had dug ourselves out with spades carried for the purpose we were almost warm.",

He sloshed through ankle-deep water and listened to the sounds of the ship bearing up against the pressing ice: “The poor old Karluk,” he jotted in his log, “began to suffer worse than ever. She creaked and groaned and, once or twice actually sobbed as the water oozed through her seams. There is nothing more human than a ship in ice pressure.” The ship’s engine was currently down and under repair, so as there was no steam to run the pumps, Bartlett ordered teams of two men to hand-pump in two-to-three-hour shifts, and eventually they managed to pump the water out.",

They are supposed to indicate an upward movement, some vague step in the direction of betterment which, frankly, I confess myself unable to perceive. What is the use of civilization if it makes a man unhappy and unhealthy? The uncivilized African native is happy and healthy. The poor creatures among whom I worked, in the slums of London, are neither the one nor the other; they are civilized. I glance down the ages, and see nothing but—change! And perhaps not even change. Mere differences of opinion as to the value of this or that in different times and places.\"",

Beyond those, more, and beyond those, still more, over the divide to the east side of the park, the rain shadow where red talus slopes run into prairie’s edge. Gunsight, Bearhat, Two Medicine, Sentinel, Apikuni, Rain Shadow, Bad Marriage. Animal names, Native names, white men’s names—mountain names. Rainbow Peak’s name nods to three snowy couloirs on the south face that mimic, in monochrome, the spooned arcs of refracted sun. Kintla is the Kootenai word for sack: the drainage that leads up to that peak is like a loose bag, wide at the bottom, drawn tight at the top where the creek rockets down off the cliffs through a tapered gap. The summit ridge of Gunsight looks like the notch on the muzzle of a shotgun, from such height the world a target below.",

Having awakened the street, securing the support of the common people, he then seduced the wealthy, the rich criollos long embittered by Spanish policies and in a position to aid his cause. With money in hand, he recruited an army, offering glory and advancement, not to mention food and clothing, to the forgotten and abandoned: runaway slaves, landless peasants, slum dwellers without work. George Washington’s soldiers, by contrast, were mostly white farmers and militiamen, strong, self-sufficient, decently fed, and familiar with firearms since childhood; they brought their own muskets to the fight. Bolívar’s recruits came to him shoeless, hungry, and unarmed, with tattered rags as clothing and perhaps a flea-ridden blanket for the cold. From the dregs of colonial society, Bolívar, himself an aspiring soldier with no formal military training, pulled together the beginnings of an army that, in time, would take on the world.",

Across the road stands a small, recently restored early nineteenth-century church dedicated to Nuestra Señora de la Virgen de Regla, who has a dual personality. She is also Yemaya, the Santería patroness of the sea and mother of all men. This statue arrived from Spain in a hermit’s luggage in 1696 and fourteen years later was appointed patroness of Havana and of all Cuban fishermen; nobody knows its origin. Two black hands hold a fair, pink-cheeked Infant Jesus on the Virgin’s lap and her shrine is surrounded by a bank of white and blue artificial flowers – Yemaya’s colours. Each Santería orisha has his/her own combination of colours. (In West Africa’s Yoruba religion orishas are spiritual messengers from Olofi/God.) I sat for a little time in the comparative coolness of this agreeably simple church, watching Yemaya’s worshippers offering half a cigar, a banana, a bunch of blue and white wild flowers, a sprinkle of rum. Two old men came together, and three young men wearing dockers’ uniforms, and a few women on their way to the market.",

Bernini designed the colonnades for processionals of cardinals and princes—the central aisle of columns is wide enough for coaches to pass each other—but few people choose to walk here, even on a day of killing sun. There seems to be a tacit agreement to give the space over to the very old, the indigent, and the unhappy young, who sprawl and prowl here, sipping warm soda, looking sullen and bored, a threatening combination. Life is never boring, and it is particularly not boring in Rome, how discontented they must be.",

The structures of the barns, footless in the mist, seemed even more ark-like. The copses and spinneys stood out like islands. I walked three miles north, back through the mist, to St Cedd’s. Near the abbey I sat down on a bench that faced out to sea, to rest and to watch the birds.",

Eleven other conscripts lounged nearby, all wearing woolly balaclavas and scarves and gloves but looking cold and extra-bad tempered. Beside the final checkpoint, a walk-through metal detector, one elderly Israeli policemen sat slumped in a chair, fast asleep – until my purse full of coins caused the machine to squeal. Scrambling to his feet, the sergeant fell over his weapon and had to grab my shoulder to steady himself. Blearily he groped for my purse, then waved me on before shouting angrily at the conscripts who had sniggered as he stumbled.",

To see her there in his garden . . . nothing in it, no white flower, was whiter, more exquisite.\n\n\"Please,\" said Scrap, still more earnestly, \"won't you clear your mind of everything except just truth?

Getting there means the ride of death. The ferries that land on Islay are large. The ferry traffic is voluminous to which is added giant articulated lorries hauling whiskey here and there. Thanks again to the council and its transport, I walk to the bus stop across the street from the campground and continue on routes that will take me to Bowmore, Islay’s centre of the commercial universe and home of a distillery of the same name, then down to Port Ellen and east to Laphroaig, Lagavullin, and Ardbeg, the centre of the whiskey tourist universe.",
