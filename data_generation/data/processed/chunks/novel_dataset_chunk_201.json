Within the discreetly wire-fenced park boundary we had 500 hectares to ourselves, a silent undulating expanse in the Judean foothills. Here, midway between the coast and Hebron or Jerusalem, a thriving traders’ crossroads became urbanised in Biblical times. A kind breeze tempered the almost-too-hot sun as Shirley and Elie wandered off across the grey-brown barrenness; everything exciting is subterranean. Limor commented, ‘I wouldn’t put my shirt on this project.’ Like other Anglo-Israelis of a certain age, she often used phrases I hadn’t heard for decades.",

The boy holds up a rusty iron scale with discs of different sizes for counterweight. His arm muscle jumps up like Popeye’s and the breeze brings me a whiff of his scent of dry grasses, onions, and dirt. In big storms, lightning drives a jagged stake into the ground and hailstones bounce in the yard, bringing back the smell of ozone to me from Georgia days when I’d gather a bowlful the size of Ping-Pong balls and put them in the freezer.",

Amid warnings of oppressive heat and a solar index of eleven (whatever that meant), Teresa and I decided to find a taxi for our trip uptown, to Karnak. We didn’t stand a chance. The hantour drivers circled their wagons in front of the hotel. When we stepped to the curb, they wrangled their carriages straight toward us. We jogged in the street, toward oncoming traffic, but the hantour drivers showed no fear. They drove their horses through moving traffic for several blocks. Where you go next? You cannot go that way! By the time we reached the traffic circle at Salah el Deen, just half a mile away, our clothes were soaked in sweat, and I could barely breathe. We followed the river to the Winter Palace Hotel where we expected to find a line of taxis. There were none. We passed the Luxor Temple; a pair of hantour drivers slept on the ground under the trees, their sickly horses stared blindly at the ground. The parking lot by the temple, where we saw several taxis the day before, was empty except for one lonely tour bus.",

A few of them begrudgingly agreed to help haul some of the weighty coal sacks from the upper deck down to the boiler room, but most deemed such manual labor the responsibility of the ship’s crew, not theirs. Instead, they lazed on deck when it was warm enough, dazzled by the near-continuous light of the midnight sun. As the ship crept north, cold winds funneled furiously through the Bering Strait, the frigid air cutting through the men’s thick woolens and oilskins. They retreated belowdecks to drink coffee and smoke, and even passed the time by engaging in and wagering on friendly boxing matches.",

But from the moment of the ill-fated encounter with the wandering Princes, his position had changed as much as that of his employers. He was no longer, to Mr. and Mrs. Hicks, a useful and estimable assistant, on the same level as Eldorada and Mr. Beck; he had become a social asset of unsuspected value, equalling Mr. Buttles in his capacity for dealing with the mysteries of foreign etiquette, and surpassing him in the art of personal attraction. Nick Lansing, the Hickses found, already knew most of the Princess Mother's rich and aristocratic friends. Many of them hailed him with enthusiastic \"Old Nicks\", and he was almost as familiar as His Highness's own aide-de-camp with all those secret ramifications of love and hate that made dinner-giving so much more of a science in Rome than at Apex City.",

As the Mongol empire shrank and the feared horsemen retreated to the steppes where the empire had begun, many Mongols converted to the Tibetan version of Buddhism, persuaded by its leader, Sonam Gyatso, the Dalai Lama, who made a missionary trip to Mongolia in 1577. According to Tibetan Buddhist belief, Sonam Gyatso lives today in the person of Tenzin Gyatso, his latest incarnation and the current Dalai Lama, known to many from his political activism and his computer ads. As Tibetan Buddhists, the Mongol descendants of Genghis’s legions renounced not only warfare but all other forms of violence, including hunting and hawking. From being the most violent people on the planet in the thirteenth century they became, within a few hundred years, some of the most peaceable.",

From Firenzuola the road follows the Santerno. The river has tunnelled a winding passage through the mountains. The valley is deep and narrow; here and there road and river run between perpendicular walls of rock, banded slantwise with the lines of tilted stratification. Slowly the valley broadens out, the mountains degenerate into bare bleak downs. At the foot of the hills is the plain, narrowed here between the mountains and the sea, but expanding and expanding as one travels northwards into the immense unbroken flatness of the Po valley.",

I shuddered – unreasonably. That tree trunk was some five feet in circumference; any Lao peasant would have trotted across without even noticing it. I looked around in wild surmise, up and down the mountain, craving an alternative route. There was none. So I ‘rode’ across, sitting astride, inching my way forward, remembering an identical experience, more than thirty years ago, in Nepal. How did people contrive to put such a massive tree trunk in place? But I only wondered about that afterwards.",

It was constant, but it had vagaries, weak spots, eddies—sometimes, at different tides, even deep slow troughs slightly outside—and its patterns changed with the swell size and direction and the movement of the sand. There were relatively few guys exploiting those vagaries, and we got to know each other. We competed so hard, trying to make each stroke count, that we rarely spoke, but a rough wave-sharing arrangement emerged nonetheless, out of some combination of necessity and respect. I began to get more waves. And I began to learn what to do with them.",

He stood\npoised, with head uplifted, his keen mouth tight shut, his nostrils\ndilated, his eyes gazing forward, intent on the signal for the start.\nHis brown hair, soaked in the sweat of the first heat and then\nsun-dried, was crisped and curled about his head. Under his white gauze\n\"zephyr\" and black running-drawers the charged muscles quivered. His\nwhole body was a quivering vehicle for the leashed soul of speed.",

It was called Jeffreys Bay, and no circumnavigation on a surfboard would be complete without a stop there. The Endless Summer, a 1964 film that warped the career goals of many young surfers, including me, climaxed near Jeffreys, when two American surfers found “the perfect wave” at Cape St. Francis. The spot featured in the film turned out to be a fickle creature, not often ridable, but Jeffreys Bay was the real thing: a long right point of the highest quality, with heaps of swell in the winter and frequent offshore winds. I tried to keep my eye on conditions, and I made a couple of quick trial runs from Cape Town without catching it especially good. Then, in August, I went for a week on a promising weather map: two big low-pressure spirals in the Roaring Forties. They looked like wave-generating storms spinning right in the window for Jeffreys.",

This always proved unnecessary, however, because the stove would flicker to life only for a few seconds before puttering out, and my father would spend many hours turning it this way and that to keep it out of the wind, simultaneously addressing it in a low, agitated tone normally associated with the chronically insane. All the while my brother, sister and I would implore him to take us some place with airconditioning, linen table-cloths and ice-cubes clinking in glasses of clear water. ‘Dad,’ we would beg, ‘you’re a successful man. You make a good living. Take us to a Howard Johnson’s.’ But he wouldn’t have it. He was a child of the Depression and where capital outlays were involved he always wore the haunted look of a fugitive who had just heard bloodhounds in the distance.",

Around a corner, among a configuration of caves and rocky outcrops, a hundred southern sealions raised their fat necks and blunt faces. They hooted and grunted, and they smelt very strong. On land they were chestnut brown and suedey, and when they got wet they went slippery black, like rubber rings. The younger bulls sat together, apart from the others on a high ledge, and on one side of a choppy channel the patriarch lounged, inscrutable and alone. He was the size of a small elephant, and he had extra-long whiskers and wrinkles around his eyes like spectacles.",

Instead he stood a little aside while the line of patrons crept slowly past the ticket window until the last one passed inside. Then the glare and glow of light from beyond the fence blinked out and into a cold flickering; approaching the fence and laying his eye to a crack he could see through the long vertical interstice a section, a fragment—the dark row of motionless heads above which the whirring cone of light burst, shattered into the passionate and evanescent posturings where danced and flickered the ephemeral hopes and dreams, tantalising and inconsequent since he could see only his narrow vertical strip of it, until a voice spoke from the ticket window behind him: “Pay a dime and go inside. Then you can see.”",

The Professor, who was a great walker and extraordinarily active for his years, came with me part of the way. He intended, he said, to go into Sassnitz that afternoon if Charlotte did not appear before then and make inquiries, and meanwhile he would walk a little with me; so we started very gaily down the same zigzag path up which I had crawled dripping a few hours before. At the bottom of the ravine the shore-path from Stubbenkammer to Lohme begins. It is a continuation of the lovely path from Sassnitz, but, less steep, it keeps closer to the beach. It is a white chalk path running along the foot of cliffs clothed with moss and every kind of wild-flower and fern. Masses of the leaves of lilies of the valley show what it must look like in May, and on the day we walked there the space between the twisted beech trunks—twisted into the strangest contortions under the lash of winter storms—was blue with wild campanula.",

Their uniform looks different from that of the police who brought me to the hospital, and it turns out they are the gendarmerie. In the middle of our lengthy interview, there is a phone call for me. An orderly wheels me back across the portico and into one of the doctor’s offices, where there is one of the few telephones in the hospital. The call is from Mr. Dwyer, the U.S. consul in Martinique, who extends his welcome to the islands, assures me there will be no problem about my lack of a passport, and extends an offer of any assistance he can render. The news has traveled very quickly. Even as I speak, my mind drifts around sleepily. But back in my room there are more officials and more questions to answer. Finally everyone leaves and I’m left in peace. The old man across from me smiles. I hear dishes clattering in a kitchen below. The breeze blows lightly across my face. A black spiritual sung in a beautiful baritone echoes from the kitchen and through the hospital grounds. I drift off into dreamland.",

She knew that nothing frightened and disorganized Pauline as much as direct contact with physical or moral suffering—especially physical. Her whole life (if one chose to look at it from a certain angle) had been a long uninterrupted struggle against the encroachment of every form of pain. The first step, always, was to conjure it, bribe it away, by every possible expenditure—except of one’s self. Cheques, surgeons, nurses, private rooms in hospitals, X-rays, radium, whatever was most costly and up-to-date in the dreadful art of healing—that was her first and strongest line of protection; behind it came such lesser works as rest-cures, change of air, a seaside holiday, a whole new set of teeth, pink silk bedspreads, lace cushions, stacks of picture-papers, and hothouse grapes and long-stemmed roses from Cedarledge. Behind these again were the final, the verbal defenses, made of such phrases as: “If I thought I could do the least good”— “If I didn’t feel it might simply upset her”—“Some doctors still consider it contagious”—with the inevitable summing-up: “The fewer people she sees the better . . .”",

I was so cold and miserable that I didn’t even notice that the roar of the river had increased in volume. Suddenly I fell. The river bottom had been swept from under my feet, and I found myself being carried downriver by the current. Now I was well aware of the river’s roar. It was the familiar sound of water breaking over rocks. God, I was being swept over a waterfall!",

Then, the water heated at last and there produced from somewhere he was never to know, she herself perhaps never to know until the need comes, no woman perhaps ever to know, only no woman will even wonder, that square of something somewhere between sackcloth and silk;—squatting, his own wet garments steaming in the fire’s heat, he watched her bathe the child with a savage curiosity and interest that became amazed unbelief, so that at last he stood above them both, looking down at the tiny terra cotta colored creature resembling nothing, and thought And this is all. This is what severed me violently from all I ever knew and did not wish to leave and cast me upon a medium I was born to fear, to fetch up at last in a place I never saw before and where I do not even know where I am.",

Then he insisted we must be hungry. He knew a few excellent restaurants, he exclaimed, and he offered to show us the way. Still we ignored him. Two guards blocked our entrance to the security checkpoint. One of the guards scolded us, but the only word we understood was No. The other guard cursed Sayid for a very long minute. Sayid pleaded and whimpered. I can only imagine what he said, but I’m sure it involved baksheesh. Eventually, the guards relented and let us through. A crowd of touts stood in the shade near the checkpoint. They teased Sayid, and he waved them off with an angry flip of his hand. Teresa climbed the staircase and stormed back to the Sphinx. Sayid and I could barely keep up with her.",

He pulled her forcefully close, and then, just as quickly, he let go and moved his face away. She could hear his rapid breathing. She unbuckled his trousers and moved back to pull them down and laughed because they got stuck at his shoes. She took her dress off. He was on top of her and the carpet pricked her naked back and she felt his mouth limply enclose her nipple. It was nothing like Odenigbo’s bites and sucks, nothing like those shocks of pleasure. Richard did not run his tongue over her in that flicking way that made her forget everything; rather, when he kissed her belly, she was aware that he was kissing her belly.",
