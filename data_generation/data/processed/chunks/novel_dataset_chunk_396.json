In the dwindling light the silhouettes of the dogs appeared, coming at a trot right for us. “Nothing is as successful as these guys at hunting. They’re like wolves. They just run and run and run, until their prey is exhausted. Then they disembowel it, which is messy looking but more efficient than strangling like the cats do.” I paused, watching as the dogs slowed to a walk, sniffing as they approached us. “When the dogs hunt, they kill.” I was loving this and looked at Nick’s face to see if he was having as much fun. He didn’t appear to be at all enjoying the sight of the seven dogs that were now directly opposite us, sniffing and making the occasional low growl. “Of course,” I whispered, “there’s no record of them attacking people, so this is relatively safe.”",

We were now directly above the river and a few months ago that landslide would have seemed to me an insuperable obstacle. But I’ve become Andeshardened; and so has Juana, who as a beginner created major scenes about far less challenging perils. She calmly followed Rachel diagonally across and down that 500-yard expanse of loose grey slates and shale. Rachel has a monkey-like flair for coping with such slopes but I myself couldn’t keep upright on this mixture. As I fatalistically slid on my bottom across the shifting débris, overlooking what can only be described as a raging torrent, it occurred to me that I may have a suppressed death-wish …",

But he could not help thinking of Elizabeth, and the quarter of the horizon in which she lived. Out of this it happened that the centrifugal tendency imparted by weariness of the world was counteracted by the centripetal influence of his love for his stepdaughter. As a consequence, instead of following a straight course yet further away from Casterbridge, Henchard gradually, almost unconsciously, deflected from that right line of his first intention; till, by degrees, his wandering, like that of the Canadian woodsman, became part of a circle of which Casterbridge formed the centre. In ascending any particular hill he ascertained the bearings as nearly as he could by means of the sun, moon, or stars, and settled in his mind the exact direction in which Casterbridge and Elizabeth-Jane lay. Sneering at himself for his weakness he yet every hour—nay, every few minutes—conjectured her actions for the time being—her sitting down and rising up, her goings and comings, till thought of Newson’s and Farfrae’s counter-influence would pass like a cold blast over a pool, and efface her image. And then he would say of himself, “O you fool! All this about a daughter who is no daughter of thine!”",

Such a meal would be a particularly grave sufferance in the Pollino towns of Altomonte and Cerchiara di Calabria, proud members of the prestigious Associazione nazionale città del pane (National Association for the Cities of Bread). Only fifty communities nationwide have thus far proved their adherence to the organization’s strict mandate of traditional methods in the baking of their bread. Needless to say, the artisan breads are heavenly. The cheese and sausages of the area are also particularly tasty, as they are throughout the region. The Pollino is especially noted for the quality of an unusual Calabrian cheese, the butirro, also called burrino or butirrino. The fresh, stretched-curd cheese made with cow’s milk hides a soft butter at its core. I recommend pairing it with a glass of the Pollino’s dry, ruby-red, DOC wine.",

The air was yet thick with moisture, though somewhat less dense than during the afternoon, and a steady smack of drops upon the fallen leaves under the boughs was almost musical in its soothing regularity. It seemed better to be out of the house than within it, and Bathsheba closed the door, and walked slowly down the lane till she came opposite to Gabriel’s cottage, where he now lived alone, having left Coggan’s house through being pinched for room. There was a light in one window only, and that was downstairs. The shutters were not closed, nor was any blind or curtain drawn over the window, neither robbery nor observation being a contingency which could do much injury to the occupant of the domicile. Yes, it was Gabriel himself who was sitting up: he was reading. From her standing-place in the road she could see him plainly, sitting quite still, his light curly head upon his hand, and only occasionally looking up to snuff the candle which stood beside him. At length he pulled out his watch, seemed surprised at the lateness of the hour, closed his book, and arose. He was going to bed, she knew, and if she tapped it must be done at once.",

The church is located in the sleepy outskirts of Twante, about a fifteen-minute walk down winding dirt lanes lined with towering palm trees, past thatched houses with sagging bamboo fences. In a ditch along one of the streets I watched an ominous-looking snake with yellow stripes, a young cobra, swim with its head held gracefully above the water like that of an elderly lady doing breaststroke at the public pool. Children played in the streets—hopscotch and a kind of boule with cheap plastic models of Chinese warriors. Because Twante is just a few hours from Rangoon and tourists make day trips to view the town’s age-old pottery industry, people were more friendly here than in parts of the Delta that were less used to foreigners. As I asked directions to the church, I was guided along with delighted giggles and shouts.",

It was dusk when she drew near to Flintcomb-Ash, and in the lane at the entrance to the hamlet she approached a girl and her lover without their observing her. They were talking no secrets, and the clear unconcerned voice of the young woman, in response to the warmer accents of the man, spread into the chilly air as the one soothing thing within the dusky horizon, full of a stagnant obscurity upon which nothing else intruded. For a moment the voices cheered the heart of Tess, till she reasoned that this interview had its origin, on one side or the other, in the same attraction which had been the prelude to her own tribulation. When she came close the girl turned serenely and recognized her, the young man walking off in embarrassment. The woman was Izz Huett, whose interest in Tess’s excursion immediately superseded her own proceedings. Tess did not explain very clearly its results, and Izz, who was a girl of tact, began to speak of her own little affair, a phase of which Tess had just witnessed.",

They use single and double long-springs—the sort of trap that has a “pan” held by a “dog” (trigger), which releases snapping jaws. They use coilspring traps and jump traps. They use Conibears—traps made of rectangles of heavy steel rods that are brought together with enough force to destroy vertebrae. The Gelvins might cut a hole in lake ice and dangle a snare that is baited with cottonwood. A beaver, caught in the snare, drowns. Most of their trap sets are cubbies, though—contrived shelters of cut boughs—with a grouse wing or a piece of lynx or beaver inside. They make rounds every three days. When they find, say, a lynx in a trap, the cat is generally just sitting there, patiently waiting for another surprise. They choke it with rope or wire. If a fox is alive, they rap the snout with a stick. The fox loses consciousness. Standing on its chest will cause its heart to stop. Mink and marten ordinarily freeze, but if one is alive it is taken in hand and squeezed. Caught in a Conibear, a wolverine or a fox is usually dead. If not, it is shot with a .22. (Some trappers shoot everything.) Wolves, standing in their double long-springs, are shot in the ear. Owls, hawks, and ravens occasionally get into the traps. Ginny tried to trap a bear once, within a few feet of their cabin in Central. She strewed grouse carcasses in a tempting circle. The bear sat on the trap, leaped six feet in the air, and ran off defecating cranberries. Despite such failures, the take of a typical recent season has been ten thousand dollars’ worth of fur.",

The kicking, biting, squealing donkeys wakened everyone; and an hour after they had been separated, and tied to opposite walls, the populace again rose as one man to intervene between a pair of apoplectic cocks, one of whom was imprisoned, with difficulty, in a sack. The other then returned sulkily to his roost, some two feet above my head, and at about 3 a.m. he caused me to leap like a shot rabbit when he made a machine-gun-like noise with his wings before beginning to crow stridently. During the rest of the night he crowed every ten or fifteen minutes. If I had been capable of feeling anything at 6 a.m. I would have felt glad that the sun had risen.",

The photographs showed a frankly worried-looking female patient being variously covered in tar, blown around a shower stall with a high-pressure hose, forced to recline in bubbling copper vats and otherwise subjected to a regimen that in other circumstances would bring ineluctably to mind the expression ‘war crimes’. I looked at the list of the town’s approved doctors to see if Josef Mengele appeared anywhere, but the only memorable name was a Dr Pitz.

I laughed myself into uncontrollable hiccoughs, further stimulated by seeing the neat composed Japanese officers drive ahead in fine cars which we followed in ratty old trucks. When the troops caught sight of bare Balinese breasts, they cheered. Breasts were covered at once throughout the island.",

I offered a R500 reward – NO QUESTIONS ASKED – on the front page of the Natal Witness, this being the local price of a new mountain-bike. To publicize my loss the Witness also ran a half-page interview complete with a pathetic photograph; I didn’t have to feign looking stricken. The SABC did a long radio interview, broadcast countrywide. The local Zulu-language radio station gave a detailed description of Lear (but how easy it is to change a bicycle’s appearance!) with a passionate plea for his return and much emphasis on the reward. The local ANC offices displayed enlarged photographs of Lear accompanied by further passionate pleas. All, predictably, to no avail.",

Before him, piled up as if giant waves had broken on a shore and frozen in time, was an immense wall of ice, with crenellated ridges jutting over one hundred feet high.

The sons and nephews took their departure, wadded quilts were brought in and piled into three beds, one on each of the three sides of the immense divan, the sheikh, Yūsef and I tucked ourselves up, and I knew no more till I woke in the sharp frost of the early dawn. I got up and went out into the fresh air. Sāleh was fast asleep in the snow; even the little stream that tumbled in and out of a Roman fountain in the middle of the village was sleeping under a thick coat of ice. In the clear cold silence I watched the eastern sky redden and fade and the sun send a long shaft of light over the snow field through which we had toiled the day before. I put up a short thanksgiving appropriate to fine weather, roused the muleteers and the mules from their common resting place under the dark vaults of the khān, ate the breakfast which Muhammad en Nassār provided, and took a prolonged and most grateful farewell of my host and his family. No better night’s rest and no more agreeable company can have fallen to the lot of any wanderer by plain and hill than were accorded to me at Sāleh.",

It didn’t stop me, and the chief engineer — they had got him out of his bunk by then — raised the boat-stretcher again. Somehow I had no mind to be surprised at anything. All this seemed natural — and awful — and awful. I dodged that miserable maniac, lifted him off the deck as though he had been a little child, and he started whispering in my arms: ‘Don’t! don’t! I thought you were one of them niggers.’ I flung him away, he skidded along the bridge and knocked the legs from under the little chap — the second. The skipper, busy about the boat, looked round and came at me head down, growling like a wild beast. I flinched no more than a stone. I was as solid standing there as this,” he tapped lightly with his knuckles the wall beside his chair. “It was as though I had heard it all, seen it all, gone through it all twenty times already.

I put the arrow on the shaft of the handle in the normal manner, but I pull the arrow out through the plastic loop on the end of the handle shaft in order to lengthen the weapon as much as possible. I wind two long lashings around the arrow and shaft. I use the heavy codline, which is better than synthetic line because it shrinks when it is wetted and then dried, thereby tightening the lashings. The smooth arrow still rotates, so I add a third lashing, then I add frappings to the lashings. These are turns of the line around the lashings at right angles. When pulled tight the frappings cinch up the lashings and should keep them from spreading out haphazardly. There are notches in the butt of the arrow which normally fit into the trigger mechanism in the handle. Through these notches and back through the trigger housing I pass loops of line to keep the arrow from being pulled out forward by an escaping fish.",
