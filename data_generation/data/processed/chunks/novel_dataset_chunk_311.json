However, being a qualified hairdresser in Khayelitsha doesn’t get you very far; not many can afford hairdos. Five customers per week is Blossom’s average, at R4 for a three-hour session – three hours because water heats slowly on a paint-tin stove. Then a plastic tub is put on a tin chair, in that small space between the three sofas, and the process is under way. At the final stage Blossom’s younger sister, 15-year-old Beauty, assists, holding a pot of sticky stuff with which the coiffure is completed. (Only reckless parents name a baby ‘Beauty’ but in this case the gamble came off.)",

But Zenaida had come to Havana from Tacajó, and there was no family burial plot in either place.

There were the bulrushes and the Strand magazines; and the linoleum sandy from the boys’ boots. A daddy-long-legs shot from corner to corner and hit the lamp globe. The wind blew straight dashes of rain across the window, which flashed silver as they passed through the light. A single leaf tapped hurriedly, persistently, upon the glass. There was a hurricane out at sea.",

In this five-star foyer the only sign we are in Pakistan is a bronze statue of Allah’s name mounted on a big black marble block. To many of the cameramen, it’s a handy place to park their arses unaware of the offense it causes. It’s a five-star front line complete with poolside analysis—legs jiggle with stress, excitement fills the air, egos clash, war stories and hangover comparisons are exchanged.",

Undine vaguely wondered why the grave and grey-haired Mr. Bowen formed so invariable a part of that lady’s train; but she concluded that it was the New York custom for married ladies to have gentlemen “’round” (as girls had in Apex), and that Mr. Bowen was the sole survivor of Laura Fairford’s earlier triumphs.",

The sun shone its hottest while we slowly surmounted this last obstacle—a hard one to encounter when it is long past dinner time. I am aware that by English clocks it was not past it, but what was that to me? My watch showed that in Storchwerder, the place our inner natures were used to, it was half-past two, a good hour beyond the time at which they are accustomed daily to be replenished, and no arbitrary theory, anyhow no perilously near approach to one, will convince a man against the evidence of his senses that he is not hungry because a foreign clock says it is not dinner time when it is.",

Why, your poor mother wasn’t even able to see your father this morning before he went down town, though she thinks it’s all wrong to let him go off to his office like that, without finding time for a quiet little chat first . . . Just a cheery word to put him in the right mood for the day . . . Oh, by the way, my dear, I wonder if you happen to have heard him say if he’s dining at home tonight? Because you know he never does remember to leave word about his plans, and if he hasn’t, I’d better telephone to the office to remind him that it’s the night of the big dinner for the Marchesa—”",

Plan ahead so you don’t have to rush and be humble enough to slow down when it will help in traffic instead of only speeding up. Next, look up ahead on the roadway so you can be ready for stopped traffic or whatever else fate has in store. If you cultivate this practice, you will notice you are ready for what lies ahead while other motorists charge forward obliviously. And last, but not least: Don’t drive for your ego! Next to controlling speed this would probably make the biggest difference in reduced collisions. The point of driving is not to put your car in front of everyone else’s. Just drive to get to your destination and enhance your sense of self-worth in a safer venue, like a racquetball court, not a roadway. One thing is for sure. Trucking made me a more mellow driver. I began to drive cool, so to speak. Not like a hothead. As a result, ordinary driving or commuting became much less stressful, even enjoyable.",

Today is my day of reckoning, the day I put everything I have learned and all my preparations to the test. There is no more time to prepare Sobrius for the journey, no more time to study, nothing else I can learn and no more questions to ask before leaving. Tonight, and for the rest of the journey, I will only sleep 20 minutes at a time. I will sail 24 hours a day in what will probably be three legs of three or four days each. Whatever weather comes, I must deal with it accordingly. Whatever breaks or fails on Sobrius I must fix or do without. Whatever obstacles get in my way, I must sail around. The time has come for me to assume the role of singlehand sailor. This is what I have wanted for a nearly a year now, and the day is here!\nThis morning I made coffee and ate an apple, then began final preparations for the journey. I installed plastic anti-chafe covers on the lifelines at the bow, to protect them from the headsail, and the headsail from them. I washed the deck, as I didn’t want to start the journey with bird-droppings on Sobrius. I stopped service on my electrical account at the marina; I removed fenders and docklines from the dock and put them aboard. I hanked on the genoa, and called the marina office to let them know I was coming to drop off my key. Sobrius and I departed at 9:00 am under clear skies and very light wind.",

Over a banana lassi, we watched as scores of teenagers ran through the streets flinging colours in the air, heralding the change of season when new shoots grew, buds burst open and winter was forgotten.

A choir of young gay men was warming up, singing doo-baah, doo-baah, doo-baah, doo-baah in an ascending scale. Other young men lounged on the sofa reading novels while women typed energetically on laptops in the kitchen. They looked up briefly to smile at me. It was like walking in on a friendly sharehouse where no one knew you, but no one minded you being around. If you pulled aside the rainbow curtains, the 21st-floor view was impressive: you could see the scalps of Beijing’s buildings and a rooftop basketball court where teenage guys had stripped out of their tops to shoot hoops. If you were a young gay dude in this city, I could see a few reasons why you’d want to spend time here.",

What things one did in the dark! How differently one behaved. The memory of these kisses pulverised her morale, made the bones of her pride go to water within her. If only, only she had insisted on walking on. But it had seemed so natural to sit down, especially when there was nowhere to walk to.

The Giant manager prepared for the season by purifying himself at a Buddhist retreat, and after disappointing showings, he delivered public apologies to the fans. The man who made the slugger’s bat wandered through a forest in search of a tree whose soul would match the soul of the hitter. And perhaps the closest thing to a hero in the story was Oh’s sensei, Hiroshi Arakawa, the batting coach who trains him in aikido, Zen, Kabuki and, ultimately, the traditional arts of swordsmanship, teaching him how to hit by showing him how to wait.",

    "target_paragraph": "The trails season begins in May, with “logging out.” Clearing trails of winter downfall can take months, and is among the most satisfying work we get to do. Long miles, constant cutting, a duet with a beat all its own. A saw team consists of two, the swamper and the sawyer. The sawyer hikes with the saw and saw kit and does the felling, limbing, and bucking, leaving a load of debris behind. The swamper follows the sawyer, carries the gas, bar oil, and a falling axe, and tidies the mayhem in the saw’s wake. A good sawyer can leave behind even a fast swamper in little time. The sawyer’s work is glamorous work, the pace frenetic yet deliberate, but without a swamper, the trail would remain impassable. Swamping is not a technical skill, but it’s the hardest labor on trails, lifting and hauling huge log rounds, dragging limbs through brush, and hiking fast in between, trying not to fall too far behind. A swamper sweats buckets even in cold, and must remain psychologically hardy to follow in the shadow of the sawyer, a nearly impenetrable wall of work always just ahead. Usually swamper and sawyer switch jobs every tank of gas or two. The sawyer will say he’d rather keep cutting if asked, but really, the tradeoff is nice. When the saw disappears, you fall into the quiet smell of wood, the task of cleanup predictable and important. Absent the aggressive glamour of the chainsaw, work takes on a purposeful cadence, a solo effort metered by the rasp of a dry throat (always thirsty), a growling stomach (always hungry), heart pushed against skin.",

They did so. “The first who withdraws his arm or turns his head is a dead man,” he said. “March!” They stepped out together, rigidly; he followed, and at the side the girl, in a trailing white gown, her black hair falling as low as her waist, bore the light. Erect and swaying, she seemed to glide without touching the earth; the only sound was the silky swish and rustle of the long grass. “Stop!” cried Jim.",

To the east rose a convulsion of snow-crowned mountains. To the south, seen at the far end of a cleft in a massive rock-wall – as though through a kaleidoscope – eucalyptus plantations marked the pueblo of Acollo Marco. Those trees then seemed so close that we felt confident of reaching them by sunset and dining on baked potatoes. But that was not to be. It took us an hour to reach Tingo Paccha, using a precipitous redura through ploughland, and another hour to get off a wide grassy ledge swarming with donkeys, ponies, oxen, cows, sheep, pigs and poultry. From the many scattered hovels dogs of every shape, size, colour and texture came racing towards us barking hysterically – yet simultaneously wagging their tails. (Few Peruvian dogs are genuinely dangerous.) At 5.45 we were still in that narrow cleft, between rusty-red cliffs, walking not far above a frenziedly frothing tributary of the Rio Montaro. When we emerged into slanting sunlight, via a dicey tree-trunk bridge of which our mula was rightly suspicious, Acollo Marco was still several miles away and there was no accessible grazing to be seen. (At Tingo Paccha we had been able to buy only a poncho-full of chopped straw; no Alf is grown there.) But soon a semi-circle of soft green grass, some fifty yards long, appeared just below the track on the bank of the curving tributary.",

Pulling back the curtains, I was greeted by the blue skies of a primary-school painting. Cotton-wool clouds and an egg-yolk sun shone overhead and a motley crew of ducks and one goat splashed around in leftover puddles. The oedipal puppies had vanished. A man was sitting in a wicker chair in a tight red polo neck and flares, smiling from under a fine bouffant. He spotted my head in the window and waved.",

The cast-iron verandah and balustrades and cornices—and everything such terms evoke—will still mark out the property as unique.

None of them would talk to her of anything but the things of love, and how foolish and fatiguing that became after a bit. It was as though a healthy person with a normal hunger was given nothing whatever to eat but sugar. Love, love . . . the very word made her want to slap somebody. \"Why should I love you?
