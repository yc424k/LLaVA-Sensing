He missed, indeed, at times the fine freedom of his forest life, and was always apt to chafe at the tedious Court ceremonies that occupied so much of each day, but the wonderful palace—Joyeuse, as they called it—of which he now found himself lord, seemed to him to be a new world fresh-fashioned for his delight; and as soon as he could escape from the council-board or audience-chamber, he would run down the great staircase, with its lions of gilt bronze and its steps of bright porphyry, and wander from room to room, and from corridor to corridor, like one who was seeking to find in beauty an anodyne from pain, a sort of restoration from sickness.",

The room itself was a cheerless one to return to at this inauspicious hour. A flattened sofa would, later in the evening, become a bed; one of the tables concealed a washing apparatus; his clothes and boots were disagreeably mixed with books which bore the gilt of college arms; and, for decoration, there hung upon the wall photographs of bridges and cathedrals and large, unprepossessing groups of insufficiently clothed young men, sitting in rows one above another upon stone steps. There was a look of meanness and shabbiness in the furniture and curtains, and nowhere any sign of luxury or even of a cultivated taste, unless the cheap classics in the book-case were a sign of an effort in that direction. The only object that threw any light upon the character of the room’s owner was a large perch, placed in the window to catch the air and sun, upon which a tame and, apparently, decrepit rook hopped dryly from side to side. The bird, encouraged by a scratch behind the ear, settled upon Denham’s shoulder. He lit his gas-fire and settled down in gloomy patience to await his dinner.

There followed four men, carrying a sort of canopy made of gay-colored bunting. A woman walked beneath it, though the canopy hid her down to the waist; but on top lay the body of a little girl, with bare feet and little brown hands crossed on her breast. There was a wreath of paper flowers in her hair, and her whole body was heaped with them. A harpist brought up the rear, playing a popular waltz called \"Recuerdos de\nDurango.\" The funeral procession moved slowly and gaily along, passing the ribota court, where the players never ceased their handball game, to the little Campo Santo. \"Bah!\" spat Julian Reyes furiously. \"That is a blasphemy to the dead!\"",

For some reason she always felt that she was the youngest person in an omnibus, but today, since she had won her scrap with Judd, she felt that she was grown up. The grey line of houses jolted up and down before her eyes as the omnibus trundled along the Bayswater Road. The shops were turning into houses; there were big houses and little houses; public houses and private houses. And here a church raised its filigree spire. Underneath were pipes, wires, drains… Her lips began moving. She was talking to herself. There’s always a public house, a library and a church, she was muttering.",

As we rolled along the coast-road he exclaimed delightedly at every glimpse of the sea through the carobs and olives, puffing at his cigarette, his spectacles gleaming. ‘Today we shall forget everything – even the situ­ation, eh?’ he smiled, settling himself firmly in the front seat with the air of a man determined upon pleasure, whatever it may cost. I did not tell him that I had a small radio under the front seat, and that I would have to keep in touch with the news bulletins to see whether or not there might be a sudden call for my services which would send me racing back to the capital. The dreadful tug of my work was still there – yet in this benignly slumbering morning we seemed to be far from the bondage of politics or war. The little pistol itself seemed an anachronism in all this pastoral blue and yellow – the young barley struggling to its feet upon the tobacco-coloured winter fields. We ran on round the loops and curls of the road, the sea marching bravely with us, until we came to the little village dedicated by its name to a saint about whom nobody knew anything. Epictetus the philosopher might have been intended, but the ascription is doubtful; it is more likely that some rock hermit with the same temperamental predisposition as Saint Hilarion had lived and died there, bequeathing in the memory of his name something of the austerity and pain of a solitary life to which the villager could cling as a symbol for holiness.",

Below me, as far as could be seen in every direction, stretched a chaos of cliffs and wadis, mounds and clefts, peaks and boulders, an incomparable diversity of shapes, textures and hues – yellow, brown, red, black, gold, white, all changing dramatically in response to the sun’s movement. A mega-hotel was being built close to the Visitors’ Centre, also on the cliff edge. Still worse, in the Centre’s bar I met Amos, a developer, who talked excitedly of a row of chalets along the crater’s rim and a tarred road along the crater’s floor. When I registered shock/horror he pointed to the benefits for Mitzpe Ramon’s unemployed. But there is ample evidence that the construction of luxury accommodation in ‘backward’ places only temporarily alleviates local joblessness. Multi-starred hotels are not staffed by the simple labourers who build them.",

On my first visit to Merton, it struck me that while this library was built nearly seven hundred years ago, the books, shelves, chairs and even the very concept of a ‘library’ have remained virtually unchanged over the intervening centuries. The children of Kameoka could visit Merton library and feel at home there. But if they visited the sutra (Buddhist scripture) storage rooms of a Japanese temple, with shelves filled with folding albums wrapped in silk, or the studios of the literati, lined with hanging scrolls and handscrolls, they would have no idea what they were looking at. These things are so far removed from what the Japanese use today, that they could almost come from a different planet.",

Coming out of conditions so narrow that those he offered her seemed spacious, she fitted into her new life without any of those manifest efforts at adjustment that are as sore to a husband’s pride as the critical rearrangement of the bridal furniture. She had given him, instead, the delicate pleasure of watching her expand like a sea creature restored to its element, stretching out the atrophied tentacles of girlish vanity and enjoyment to the rising tide of opportunity. And somehow—in the windowless inner cell of his consciousness where self-criticism cowered—Glennard’s course seemed justified by its merely material success. How could such a crop of innocent blessedness have sprung from tainted soil?",

Wayra flattens herself against the ground. Her neck is angled unpleasantly, eyes storm-tossed, flashing fury. She spins, slaps her paw against a tree and growls. I stumble backwards. I remember my elation, only hours ago. I remember ten-foot flames crossing the firebreak. I remember the way she hissed at me the first day we met, and how it felt like she’d punched me. I remember the flash of grey as she attacked me in quarantine. And I try to breathe, to remind myself that I survived all that. That this is just Wayra and we’re fine, we’re going to be fine.",

At noon the sun pours gold into narrow, quiet streets where the complacent carved façades of only slightly decaying mansions seem unaware that the Spanish Empire is no more. In the several market places rickety stalls sell a contrasting array of goods ancient and modern, including dried llama foetuses for use in magical rites. The air is pure, clear, invigorating: never too hot or too cold. Across the intense blue of the mountain sky high white clouds occasionally wander, their shadows seeming to alter the textures and colours of the nearby ranges. Long centuries before the Spaniards arrived – or indeed the Incas – this valley was settled and cultivated. And somehow one is aware of the tentacles of its experience stretching back through millenia of unwritten but not unimportant history. It has an old and secret soul; the colonial mansions seem quite modern.",

I’m going to bring a boxful of Christmas tree decorations – silver-blue tinsel, red candles, peppermint canes, silver bells, golden stars and frosted baubles – and I’m going to pick out the loneliest, most forlorn of those little junipers and dress it in splendor, gay and glittering, and leave it there shining in the wilderness for a season or two, until the winds and the sun and the birds strip it bare again.",
