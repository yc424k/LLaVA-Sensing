The waves looked funky from a distance, with a west wind chopping up the takeoff, which was why there was nobody out, but by now I knew a few things about Pequena—how this wind, for instance, could bounce off the cliffs and blow offshore across the shelf, turning the inside wall into something spectacular. And so it was. I surfed alone for an hour, catching big mushburgers outside, skiing over the ledge, and then red-lining it through the barrel section on my sturdy Owl. Eventually I was joined by three Portuguese pros, including their top dog, Tiago Pires. They had obviously kept their binoculars ready to hand in Jardim. There were still plenty of waves to go around, but Pires ripped so hard that I found him unpredictable, and he and I got tangled up and went over the falls together on the biggest wave that had come through. We were both lucky not to get hurt. It was a long hold-down, and then we got pounded by a heavy set. He seemed none the worse for wear, but I was shaken.",

Here, on the scrubby hillsides, unkempt shambas (small farms) surrounded the square huts of Masai families who had been forced to settle and cultivate – a shaming occupation for pastoralists, some of whom hire Kikuyu women to work for them. The road wound from ridge to ridge, each higher than the last, and the pedestrian traffic consisted mainly of Masai. An aura of privilege and aristocratic poise surrounds even the younger generation – tall, lean young men with features that seem carefully sculpted. Each carried a long herding stick and a short polished knobkerrie, the only weapon now allowed to men who in former days would never have been seen without a spear. Some, too, had ear mutilations that involved the lower half being completely cut off, not merely elongated. So there is no hope for the local donkeys, many of whom have cropped ears – only one-third left – as this is believed to check braying.",

The combination of buzzes and bangs and whizzes and whines and bumps and drones adds up to quite a din. What is worse, the floor is swarming with big black ants – in addition to my permanent army of tiny red ones – and with cockroaches. I must admit that when sleeping on the floor cockroaches seem to me expendable, though I’m not neurotic about them as I am about spiders. Luckily – almost miraculously – spiders seem to be the only form of insect life not represented in the room at the moment.",

The track switch-backed across a wide ledge between a dark chaos of mountains on the left and the deep gorge of the Indus on the right. When we came this way a month ago the whole area was white but now the thaw is complete. Beyond the Indus stark cliffs rose sheer from the water and at a little distance seemed to have the texture of brown velvet. We watched three spectacular rock-falls on these but our track was rarely at risk. Over the uninhabited twelve-mile stretch from Gol to Gomo Thurgon we saw only one other person – a mail-runner jogging along with a small sealed sack on his back. He looked at us with a strange expression, as though he didn’t believe it was true, and never for an instant altered the rhythm of his jog-trot.",

No, really, you can not fall. Once you get going, your momentum can take you into those rocks headfirst.”",

In his Western boots, his dungarees, his bright-red down jacket with bluebanded shoulders, he seemed somewhat incongruous there—an Eskimo, many miles from home, dressed apparently for a rodeo or a basketball game in which he might star. He was slender, physically adroit, and his high Mongolian cheekbones, his soft black hair ruffling in the wind, his Asian-myna-bird look all seemed to suggest that he had recently walked across the land bridge to have a look around. Willie in the committee was first among equals. The others had long since made him their chairman.",

They had kicked out their “store” shoes, as she called them, that first day, curious to see what lay beyond the familiar stretch. They were rewarded, for lack of faith in the herd instinct, with broken shins, cactus scratches, the fact that the further beach was more or less dedicated to a row of squalid bungalow huts, concealed this end and from the distant fashionable “plage” ipse, by flowerless oleander, dusty sea-rosemary and thorn-like bundles of dried gorse. There seemed to be a dead stream runnel. One fisherman was perched on the dividing wall that possibly ran, for some sordid purpose, on out toward deep sea. They decided the seals had already pegged out the best ground. They would follow from now on, herd instinct. They imagined a mild chuckle from the seals, on their return, though none spoke. No seal looked at them for some days. Then, seals looked. She had plunged to the nearest of the far rocks and had meant to sun herself nonchalantly on the furthest to-day, but here was that packet.",

And at that moment, Eugene felt an instant, overwhelming revulsion of shame, despair, and sick horror, such as he had never known before. For a moment all the blood seemed to have drained out of his heart and left it a dead shell. He thought he had killed Starwick – broken his neck or fractured his skull: even in death – or unconsciousness – Starwick’s frail body retained its languorous dignity and grace. His head dropped heavily to one side, the buckling weight of the unconscious figure slumped in a movement of terrible and beautiful repose – the same movement that one sees in a great painting of Christ lowered from the cross, as if, indeed, the whole rhythm, balance and design of that art which Starwick had observed with such impassioned mimicry had left its image indelibly upon his own life, so that, even in death or senselessness, his body would portray it.",

    "target_paragraph": "Several ideas clicked into place. When I had first read through the Fraser correspondence, I had noticed that the letters—generally full of observations about the passage of the seasons—were curiously mute about the terrible heat inside Delhi houses during the summer. From my own experience of the hot season, I knew this to be an extraordinary omission. Even with the use of an electric ceiling fan, the Delhi summer is pure torture; it is inevitably the first thing every letter writer mentions when he puts pen to paper. How could William and Aleck have written as they did, I had wondered, unless like the Mughals, they had built themselves a tykhana (underground cool room) to keep themselves sane? In one letter Aleck ambiguously remarks how in the hot season it is best to spend as much time as possible inside ‘a cool house’. By this did he mean a tykhana? And was it possible that the basement described by Mr Prashad was the remains of such a structure?",

They developed the lagoon as a stopover and refueling station for the new Boeing 314 Pacific Clipper “flying boat” airliner. The service began on July 12, 1940, but was destined to be short-lived. On December 4, 1941, the last civilian Clipper departed the lagoon bound for New Caledonia. Three days later Japanese warplanes rained bombs onto the American fleet in Pearl Harbor, marking a shift of power in the Pacific and the end of the flying boat service. The pilings that marked the aquatic runways still stand, crisscrossing the western end of the lagoon in perfectly straight lines. On the British side, the remains of the old Clipper beaching ramps can be seen stretching along the shore.",

And he didn’t even know where to turn when he got out of the train, where to find a lodging for the night. In the car there were people who could no doubt have told him, friendly experienced-looking people; but no familiar face was among them, and a rustic caution kept him from questioning strangers on the approach to a big city. As the train entered the Grand Central he hurriedly consulted the black porter, and the latter, after looking him over with a benevolent eye, gave him an address near the station. He found a narrow brick hotel squeezed in between tall buildings, with a dingy black-and-gold sign over the door. It looked dismal and unappetizing enough; but his bed there, and his coffee next morning, cost him so much that he decided he must not remain for another night, and wandered out early in search of a rooming house.",

Then McConnell saw the scene clearly and confirmed it with the captain: “We could only see a dilapidated four-man tent, a flag-pole, and a cross.” Captain Jochimsen blew the ship’s whistle, the high-pitched wail piercing the sharp Arctic air, and they watched and waited anxiously for any signs of movement, any signs of life.",

    "target_paragraph": "For Ludwig Wittgenstein, following lines of enquiry on foot as well as in the mind was integral to his philosophy. Studying in Cambridge under Bertrand Russell, he would stride up and down Russell’s room in agitated silence, sometimes for hours, covering miles in a room of yards. ‘Are you thinking about logic or your sins?’ Russell asked once, half jokingly, of his striding student. ‘Both!’ answered Wittgenstein instantly. In 1913 Wittgenstein retreated to Skjolden, a tiny village on a remote Norwegian fjord, and spent a long dark winter there, contemplating logic and walking the paths that bordered the fjord and led up into the mountains. The landscape – ascetic, decisive – matched the thinking he undertook, and in the course of that winter he solved a major philosophical crux concerning the symbolism for truth functions. ‘I can’t imagine that I could have worked anywhere as I did there,’ he wrote to his sister years later. ‘It seems to me that I had given birth to new thoughts within me’: ‘Es kommt mir so vor, als hätte ich damals in mir neue Denkbewegungen geboren.’ The word Wittgenstein used for ‘thought’, Denkbewegungen, is a coinage that might be translated as ‘thought movements’, ‘thought-ways’ or ‘paths of thought’: ideas that have been brought into being by means of motion along a path (Weg).",

The meal consisted of one round of tasty maize bread and a tin plate of watery lentil soup flavoured with garlic and wild thyme. Thyme grows abundantly on these mountains and is still aromatic if one crushes the wiry brown clumps on which some dried leaves remain. A staple diet of thyme doubtless explains why the local goat-meat is so appetising. We stood up to go the moment we had finished our meal, for by then the wind was vicious, and as we moved away a woman’s voice called Akbar. When he rejoined us he was bearing a gift for Rachel of three tiny eggs, which at this season cannot be bought at Dambudass bazaar for love or money.",

It also gave him time to reflect on all of the people who get up in the morning and take a glance out the window. Both of them had watched hundreds of sunrises and sunsets from beginning to end. Even the timing of the tides at the passes based on the timing of moonrise and moonset was amazing. Out here, they learned and relied on the Earth’s rhythms. Those rhythms had been the same for thousands of years, and most people living in today’s world were completely oblivious to them. Time did march on, but amazingly it did so in stunningly beautiful order in patterns that gave comfort in knowing that they did repeat when they were supposed to repeat.",

They ate some of the meat raw, standing there over the bear, blood running down their chins and freezing, then took some of the fresh meat inside the igloo to boil into a stew. Later, they went outside and cut hunks from the carcass and fed the dogs as much as they could eat. Bartlett could hardly believe that the dogs had not barked, had made no noise at the bear’s arrival. Apparently, they’d been too exhausted to even notice or care about it. This gave the captain pause, for he figured the bear must have been tracking them all day, likely following the scent of the seal they’d killed earlier. The next morning, they packed up and bore south with the bloody hindquarter lashed to the sled. Bartlett looked back over his shoulder from time to time, chills running through him: every hummock, every boulder of ice resembled the outline of a bear.",

    "target_paragraph": "The inns in these remote and winter-bound thorpes were warm and snug. There was usually a picture of Hitler and a compulsory poster or two, but they were outnumbered by pious symbols and more venerable mementoes. Perhaps because I was a foreigner, politics seldom entered the conversations I had to share in; rather surprisingly, considering the closeness of those villages to the fountain-head of the Party. (It was different in towns.) Inn-talk, when it concerned the regional oddities of Bavaria, was rife with semi-humorous bias. Even then, many decades after Bismarck’s incorporation of the Bavarian Kingdom into the German Empire, Prussia was the chief target. A frequent butt of these stories was a hypothetical Prussian visitor to the province. Disciplined, blinkered, pig-headed and sharp-spoken, with thin vowels and stripped consonants – every ‘sch’ turning into ‘s’ and every hard ‘g’ into ‘y’ – this ridiculous figure was an unfailing prey for the easy-going but shrewd Bavarians. Affection for the former ruling family still lingered. The hoary origins and the thousand years’ sway of the Wittelsbachs were remembered with pride and their past follies forgiven. So august and gifted and beautiful a dynasty had every right, these old people inferred, to be a bit cracked now and then. The unassuming demeanour of Prince Ruprecht, the actual Pretender – who was also the last Stuart Pretender to the British throne – was frequently extolled; he was a distinguished doctor in Munich, and much loved. All this breathed homesickness for a past now doubly removed and thickly overlaid by recent history. I liked them for these old loyalties. Not everyone is fond of Bavarians: their fame is mixed, both inside Germany and out, and one hears damning tales of aggressive ruthlessness. They seemed a rougher race than the civilized Rhinelanders or the diligent and homely Swabians. They were, perhaps, more raw in aspect and more uncompromising in manner; and – trivial detail! – an impression remains, perhaps a mistaken one, of darker hair. But there was nothing sinister about the farm people and foresters and woodcutters I spent these evenings with. They have left a memory of whiskers and wrinkles and deep eye sockets, of slurred speech and friendly warmth and hospitable kindness. Carved wood teemed in every detail of their dwellings, for from the Norwegian fiords to Nepal, above certain contour-lines, the upshot of long winters, early nightfall, soft wood and sharp knives is the same. It soars to a feverish zenith in Switzerland, where each winter begets teeming millions of cuckoo clocks, chamois, dwarfs and brown bears.",

Strangers called him Eric. Friends called him Ravilious. Close friends called him ‘The Boy’: a Peter-Panish nickname – a charm against ageing, a chrism against death. He was handsome: an angular face, large dark eyes, a sloped nose, dark hair, long fingers always holding brush, pen or cigarette. He liked tennis, billiards, propellers, winter, the shadowlessness of sea light, northerliness, ceramic, boxwood, crystal and ice. Fastidious but also impetuous, he had a habit of putting his head out of train windows and losing his hat to the wind.",
