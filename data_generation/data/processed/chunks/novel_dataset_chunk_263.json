The building had been lovingly restored not long after the Second World War, its resurrection a symbol of the rebirth of the Netherlands’ second city. For an ancient Protestant church it was surprisingly light and airy, a titanic space with a curved wooden roof resembling the upturned hull of a boat. The slender pipes of an enormous organ towered over a nave lined with candles and statues. Orb-like golden chandeliers hung from the high ceiling, and the shadows of the trees outside danced on the stained-glass windows.",

The northern ‘tramontana’ which closes the pores (speak not of love to these folk when the ‘tramontana’ blows), and the scirocco that relaxes them, are the best known, but not the most popular; the latter may well have increased since ancient times, perhaps on account of the deforestation of northern Africa, else the Romans, who had absurdly sensitive skins and nerves, would have execrated it even more than they did.",

Thousand. Thirty. Sixteen. Seven.” We stared at him in wonder. “Nineteen. Fifty. Four. Seven.” What on earth was going on? “Fifty. Sixteen. Twenty. Thousand.” Wild-eyed now, the Frenchman muttered something poisonous and scribbled down a few more figures. Again the girl shook her head no. Then, without a warning, the pilot broke off from his demented chant and tried to broker a four-part deal involving my watch, his watch, foreigners’ currency and people’s money. Foiled in an instant, he struck up again his terrible cry. “Thirty Seven. Fifteen. Four.” The Frenchman and the girl huddled together. “Nineteen. Forty. Three…” Then, just as the pilot’s call was hitting a crescendo, the place was plunged into darkness. Lights-out at the Airpot Hotel!",

I leaned out the window, into the cold air, looking back. He stood there beside the gaunt rabbit of a mule, the two of them shabby and motionless and unimpatient. The train swung around the curve, the engine puffing with short, heavy blasts, and they passed smoothly from sight that way, with that quality about them of shabby and timeless patience, of static serenity: that blending of childlike and ready incompetence and paradoxical reliability that tends and protects them it loves out of all reason and robs them steadily and evades responsibility and obligations by means too barefaced to be called subterfuge even and is taken in theft or evasion with only that frank and spontaneous admiration for the victor which a gentleman feels for anyone who beats him in a fair contest, and withal a fond and unflagging tolerance for whitefolks’ vagaries like that of a grandparent for unpredictable and troublesome children, which I had forgotten. And all that day, while the train wound through rushing gaps and along ledges where movement was only a laboring sound of the exhaust and groaning wheels and the eternal mountains stood fading into the thick sky, I thought of home, of the bleak station and the mud and the niggers and country folks thronging slowly about the square, with toy monkeys and wagons and candy in sacks and roman candles sticking out, and my insides would move like they used to do in school when the bell rang.",

I noticed that my swaying foot had rubbed against him, leaving a dusty mark on his navy trousers. I further discovered, with cautious movements of my foot, that it was possible to extend the mark from just above his knee almost to his ankle, leaving an interesting streak on the trouser leg. In this means I amused myself for some minutes until I turned my head a fraction and discovered that the old lady was watching me.

After each one passed a gloomy calm would descend over the anchorage while we waited for the next assault. It was definitely time to go, maybe past time. I climbed over the lifelines and into Stubby, our eight-foot fiberglass-sheathed plywood pram. Cheryl handed me two sealed five-gallon plastic buckets packed with things we thought might be essential in a worst case scenario, along with things we didn’t want to lose: cash and other valuables, passports and documents, a change of clothes, toothbrushes and personal items, binoculars, a few photos and a radio receiver. Though we didn’t want to believe it, there was a good chance we’d be homeless in a foreign country in the middle of a disaster area before sundown.",

The splendid neo-Byzantine Synagogue on the Lungotevere Cenci was built in 1904.",

Meanwhile their husbands drank beer under a distant tree, their male offspring kicked a rugger ball and their female offspring bickered over the dressing of dolls. Then the women were stimulated to converse (muttered remarks, certainly rude) by the arrival of six Tswanas from Gaborone in a luxurious camper-van. Botswana’s rich are very rich and these youngsters displayed the latest gaudy Outdoor Life fashions and state-of-the-art music-making machines. Having unloaded a giant ice-box of booze they set up their braai, laughing and arguing and singing. This is how the new South Africa hits your average Vaalie. The invasion of hitherto ‘white’ space is the measure of change.",

He loved the increasing heat of the Venetian summer, the bruised peach-tints of worn house-fronts, the enamelling of sunlight on dark green canals, the smell of half-decayed fruits and flowers thickening the languid air. What visions he could build, if he dared, of being tucked away with Susy in the attic of some tumble-down palace, above a jade-green waterway, with a terrace overhanging a scrap of neglected garden—and cheques from the publishers dropping in at convenient intervals! Why should they not settle in Venice if he pulled it off!",

There are steps leading into sand-filled bunkers, gun-slits in concrete slabs, air-shafts protruding from the ground, underground corridors which lead nowhere but are marked with names like Shaftesbury Avenue or Regent Street. It is a very haunted place. The wind blows constantly over the ridge and whistles in the cables above. The derelict subterranean chambers are littered with rubbish, foul with excrement, and sometimes your heart leaps when, like a demon out of the earth, a scavenging dog suddenly appears from a dark tunnel and leaps crazily past you into the daylight. The rolling country to the north looks desolate. The familiar blocks of Kwai Chung, just out of sight, seem all too far away.",

Evidently the rather grumpy Vietnamese proprietor hoped to capture backpackers but misunderstood their minimum requirements. (Anyway, who but a cyclist would choose to stop overnight in Nem Thone?) The tin-roofed windowless hut, built of wood scavenged from loggers, was a stifling inferno. My room had a plank bed without sheets, a torn mosquito net, an earth floor strewn with the last occupant’s litter. When I firmly requested washing water a handpump had to be primed with cloudy brown water drawn from a very deep, almost dry well. The loo – shared with two neighbouring families – was some forty yards away, down a grassy slope scattered with chunks of concrete from a nearby building site where a little wooden house was being erected on ‘modern’ stilts.",

He saw nothing but the Greek in front of him. But as he read, his brain gradually warmed; he was conscious of something quickening and tightening in his forehead. He caught phrase after phrase exactly, firmly, more exactly, he noted, making a brief note in the margin, than the night before. Little negligible words now revealed shades of meaning which altered the meaning. He made another note; that was the meaning. His own dexterity in catching the phrase plumb in the middle gave him a thrill of excitement. There it was, clean and entire. But he must be precise; exact; even his little scribbled notes must be clear as print. He turned to this book; then that book. Then he leant back to see, with his eyes shut. He must let nothing dwindle off into vagueness. The clocks began striking. He listened. The clocks went on striking. The lines that had graved themselves on his face slackened; he leant back; his muscles relaxed; he looked up from his books into the dimness. He felt as if he had thrown himself down on the turf after running a race. But for a moment it seemed to him that he was still running; his mind went on without the book. It travelled by itself without impediments through a world of pure meaning; but gradually it lost its meaning. The books stood out on the wall: he saw the cream-coloured panels; a bunch of poppies in a blue vase. The last of the strokes had sounded. He gave a sigh and rose from the table.",

The pies were both cooked to order and pre-made, ready to be served by the slice to youngsters lined up for the treat. They didn’t seem bothered by soggy French fries. Sadly, the famed Mediterranean diet floundered in many a pizzeria where standard appetizers consumed before the pizza were French fries (routinely eaten with mayonnaise squeezed out of little packets), Würstel, potato croquettes and fried cheese.",

The authority of the Governor, sitting up here looking so bored, poor fellow, as the Honourable the Financial Secretary moved into the second phase of his argument about the relationship between inflation and exchange rates – the Governor’s authority was derived ‘from Letters Patent passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom’, and was subject only to decisions of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in London, or of the monarch. Like all his predecessors, he was not just the Governor. He might no longer be accredited to countless millions, as Sir John Bowring had been, but he was the titular Commander-in-Chief, the President of Legco and the representative of the Crown, ‘exerting’, so the official Hong Kong handbook said in a delicate periphrasis, ‘a major influence over the direction of affairs’. He had an Executive Council to advise him, whose fourteen members were all ex officio or officially appointed, but he presided over it and decided what it should advise him about, and constitutionally he need not accept its advice anyway.",

As the tree had fallen, it had torn up in its roots a circular cliff of mud. The upper rim of roots had dried as hard as rock, and had turfed itself over, providing a roof of a foot or more. The snow was coming faster now. I cleared an area at the foot of the bole, cast around for fallen pine branches, and layered them so that they formed a springy mattress. Then I leaned larger boughs against the sides of the bole to provide a rough triangular porch.",

At the front of each row, white-gloved cheerleaders with megaphones were telling the audience when to clap; in the aisles, men in black coats and golden headbands banged heartily on drums to intensify the noise. Most of the time, the fans sat obediently, without a word, in their uniform rows; as soon as they were given their cue, however, they thrust their yellow bullhorns into the air, in perfect unison, and joined together in a thunderous chant.

And yet all was silent; all was concealed. The brothers and sisters came in and out as usual; Mr Barrett came as usual in the evening. He looked as usual to see that the chop was finished, the wine drunk. Miss Barrett talked and laughed and gave no sign when anyone was in the room that she was hiding anything. Yet when they were alone she pulled out the box from under the bed and filled it hastily, stealthily, listening as she did so. And the signs of strain were unmistakable. On Sunday the church bells were ringing. ‘What bells are those?’ somebody asked. ‘Marylebone Church bells’, said Miss Henrietta. Miss Barrett, Flush saw, went deadly white. But nobody else seemed to notice anything.",

Not merely did it bleach faces and raise red spots on noses; it tweaked up skirts; showed stout legs; made trousers reveal skeleton shins. There was no roundness, no fruit in it. Rather it was like the curve of a scythe which cuts, not corn, usefully; but destroys, revelling in sheer sterility. With one blast it blew out colour – even a Rembrandt in the National Gallery, even a solid ruby in a Bond Street1 window: one blast and they were gone. Had it any breeding place it was in the Isle of Dogs2 among tin cans lying beside a workhouse drab on the banks of a polluted city. It tossed up rotten leaves, gave them another span of degraded existence; scorned, derided them, yet had nothing to put in the place of the scorned, the derided. Down they fell. Uncreative, unproductive, yelling its joy in destruction, its power to peel off the bark, the bloom, and show the bare bone, it paled every window; drove old gentlemen further and further into the leather-smelling recesses of clubs; and old ladies to sit eyeless, leather-cheeked, joyless among the tassels and antimacassars of their bedrooms and kitchens. Triumphing in its wantonness it emptied the streets; swept flesh before it; and coming smack against a dust cart standing outside the Army and Navy Stores, scattered along the pavement a litter of old envelopes; twists of hair; papers already blood-smeared, yellow-smeared, smudged with print and sent them scudding to plaster legs, lamp-posts, pillar-boxes, and fold themselves frantically against area railings.",

In 1883 W. W. Macnair, an enterprising officer of the Indian Survey, disobeying the strict orders of the Indian Government that no European should cross the frontier without permission, penetrated the eastern marches as far as the Bashgul Valley. Macnair wore the dress of a Muhammadan Hakim and stained himself with a disagreeable mixture of weak caustic soda and walnut juice. He was accompanied by a native ‘known in The Profession as the Saiad’ and two Kaka Khel Pathans, a tribe respected by the Afghans and to some extent by the Kafirs. With him he took an enormous book decorated with cabalistic signs which concealed within it a plane table for mapping and other surveying instruments. As Hakim he was much given to solitary meditation and generally chose high peaks for this purpose.",
