    "target_paragraph": "Juneau, bright at night from across the channel, is dense and galactic under the dark shapes of the mountains. From the same perspective in the day—with its ships at wharfside, its small-craft anchorage, its buildings all crowded before an uprising wilderness—it is a pocket city in a setting as wondrous as the setting of a city could ever be. Juneau is Alaskan, and American, and it has its oil-storage tanks in the heart of town. It holds its own in junk and crud. Gold Creek, the rushing stream that was named by Harris and Juneau, now runs through town in a concrete trough, a large storm sewer. The State Capitol is a six-story yellow brick-and-limestone building with big windows of the sort that are opened with a pole. In appearance, it is an abandoned junior high school. The governor’s mansion is Southern and decadent, tired in its innards. On the edge of town is the abandoned mine—abandoned during the Second World War—of the Alaska-Juneau Gold Mining Company, a flooded ruin now, fronting the mountain like the façade of a theatre that has long since played its last show. From Calhoun Avenue to Willoughby Avenue, old wooden steps go far down the cliffside and around the new State Office Building, which soars into the air and goes down the hill, too. People approaching the building on the uphill side walk in on the eighth floor—into a high atrium of light and space, of glass-walled, unpartitioned offices that look down into the interior as well as out upon the mountains and the channel. A sign on the ground floor says, “POSITIVELY NO DOGS.” SO much for old Alaska.",

The same went for the almonds in chocolate bars; they were never crunched along with the chocolate, but had to be singled out, rolled around and savored. Cans of food lasted forever as I made little designs in the soups, pastes or sauces with my tongue on the spoon and admired them; and that same spoon prolonged cups of coffee, which had to arrive in my mouth spoonful by spoonful. Crawling out on deck with a gingersnap for the evening’s entertainment, I stared at the water and watched Varuna nod slowly west. As we rocked downwind, I began nibbling away like a gerbil, around and around the cookie, letting the spicy little pieces crumble up in my mouth.",

Perched on a hill above the bath complex, the community of roughly 2,000 inhabitants was settled sometime between the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries by Valdesi (Waldensians), adherents to a Protestant movement that originated in France. As the town’s name implies, the group came from Italy’s Piedmont area. A few centuries after the Waldensians’ peaceful arrival, however, their protestant religion was squelched by the Inquisition, as highlighted by the Porta del Sangue (Blood Gate) from which the blood of the inhabitants was said to have flowed in 1561 and through which we entered the partially walled village for a pleasant walk through the historic center’s medieval lanes.",

Charlotte, he explained, had left Sassnitz by the Berlin train, and had taken a ticket for Berlin, as he ascertained at the booking-office, a few minutes before he took his. He arrived at the very last moment, yet as he jumped into the just departing train he caught sight of her sitting in a ladies' compartment. She also caught sight of him.

I went outside the hotel and found a taxi-driver there who spoke a little English. He told me he was Greek, but that he knew Istanbul as well as if it were his own city. ‘Safe,’ he kept on saying, ‘safe with me,’ waving his hand as though to indicate that there were wolves lurking by the walls and alleys. I told him to show me the city. He drove down narrow street after narrow street with no vista anywhere and very little light, and then drew up at a dark and forbidding door with a bearded night watchman asleep on the step. ‘Safe house,’ he said, ‘safe, clean. Very safe,’ and I was reminded uncomfortably of something I would have gladly forgotten, the house with the sofas behind the Messaggero.",

All day we hear the rhythmic pounding of well-drilling equipment rising from the valley below us. Others, it seems, don’t have deep wells either.

Hoping for a clean burn, they set fire to the brush on all sides, only to watch in horror as a great conflagration flared, leaving them blinded by smoke and trapped within a whirlwind of flames. Both would have perished had it not been for a ranch hand who risked his life to lead them out of the fire.

    "target_paragraph": "Mrs Trenor was still at Bellomont, keeping the townhouse open, and descending on it now and then for a taste of the world, but preferring the recurrent excitement of week-end parties to the restrictions of a dull season. Since the holidays she had not urged Lily to return to Bellomont, and the first time they met in town Lily fancied there was a shade of coldness in her manner. Was it merely the expression of her displeasure at Miss Bart’s neglect, or had disquieting rumours reached her? The latter contingency seemed improbable, yet Lily was not without a sense of uneasiness. If her roaming sympathies had struck root anywhere, it was in her friendship with Judy Trenor. She believed in the sincerity of her friend’s affection, though it sometimes showed itself in self-interested ways, and she shrank with peculiar reluctance from any risk of estranging it. But, aside from this, she was keenly conscious of the way in which such an estrangement would react on herself. The fact that Gus Trenor was Judy’s husband was at times Lily’s strongest reason for disliking him, and for resenting the obligation under which he had placed her.",

You, my hearers, who dine as I now do regularly and well, would hardly if I could still describe be able to enter into my feelings. I found a cool room in an inn with the pleasantly un-English name Fleur de Lys, and a sympathetic waiter who fell in at once with my views about fresh air and shut all the windows. I had a newspaper, and I sipped a cognac while the meal was preparing. I ordered everything on the list except bacon, chickens, and sausages. I also would not eat potatoes, and declined, as a vegetable, cabbage. I drank much wine, full-bodied and generous, but I refused after dinner to drink coffee.",

When the voyage was underway, passengers in all their finery had to endure searing heat and humidity, infestations of mosquitoes and biting flies, the threat of caimans and poisonous snakes, wretched food, and a constant haunting cacophony that left them all yearning for silence. The source of their torment were the blasphemous screams and howls of the bogas as they moved up and down the length of the vessel, a pounding, rotating rhythm that thrust the champán forward with constant pressure against the current.",

I can’t help it if you are offended by my telling you this now – if I can do anything to make you realize the folly of your course, and how deeply she disapproved of it, I shall feel it is the truest way of making up to you for her loss.’",

    "target_paragraph": "Towards the end of the street stood a big new Hyatt Regency hotel, an instantly depressing sight. Massive and made of shaped concrete, it was from the Fuck You school of architecture so favoured by the big American hotel chains. There was nothing about it in scale or appearance even remotely sympathetic to the old buildings around it. It just said, ‘Fuck you, Savannah.’ The city is particularly ill-favoured in this respect. Every few blocks you come up against some discordant slab – the De Soto Hilton, the Ramada Inn, the Best Western Riverfront, all about as appealing as spittle on a johnny cake, as they say in Georgia. Actually, they don’t say anything of the sort in Georgia. I just made it up. But it has a nice Southern ring to it, don’t you think? I was just about at the point where I was starting to get personally offended by the hotels, and in serious danger of becoming tiresome here, when my attention was distracted by a workman in front of the city courthouse, a large building with a gold dome. He had a leaf blower, a noisy contraption with miles of flex snaking back into the building behind him. I had never seen such a thing before. It looked something like a vacuum cleaner – actually, it looked like one of the Martians in It Came From Outer Space – and it was very noisy. The idea, I gathered, was that you would blow all the leaves into a pile and then gather them up by hand. But every time the man assembled a little pile of leaves, a breeze would come along and unassemble it. Sometimes he would chase one leaf half a block or more with his blower, whereupon all the leaves back at base would seize the opportunity to scuttle off in all directions. It was clearly an appliance that must have looked nifty in the catalogue but would never work in the real world, and I vaguely wondered, as I strolled past, whether the people at the Zwingle Company were behind it in some way.",
