I asked about the other swimmers. She said that everyone was friendly, and she guessed that most of the other swimmers were European. That would explain the dress code, I thought. Most of the women in the pool wore one- or two-piece bathing suits, which, like alcohol, are tolerated at tourist hotels. But there was one family that stood out among the others. The mother wore a floor-length, loose robe – the abaya – and a scarf, and she relaxed on a lounge chair by the side of the pool. Her husband wore swim trunks and played with his shirtless sons in the water. The daughter, who was perhaps fourteen or fifteen years old, wore something I had read about, but never seen: a burkini. The burkini comes in several styles of varying modesty. Most versions, like the one the girl wore, include a loose, thigh-length, long-sleeved tunic and matching leggings and scarf. I asked Teresa what she thought of the burkini. “It looks comfortable,” she said.",

Unlike most politicians, he gave straight answers to straight questions. Asked if the ANC was fully in control of MK he replied, ‘People have come back as individuals. They are not in camps, they have gone to their homes. As a movement not yet in government, it’s very difficult for the ANC to monitor the activities of each individual. We try our best to control the situation, but there are instances where we admit the Comrades have really gone out of control. Some have been involved in bank robberies.’",

She had the queerest sensations about the thigh bones. Her hairs seemed to erect themselves. Her arms sang and twanged as the telegraph wires would be singing and twanging in twenty years or so. But all this agitation seemed at length to concentrate in her hands; and then in one hand, and then in one finger of that hand, and then finally to contract itself so that it made a ring of quivering sensibility about the second finger of the left hand. And when she raised it to see what caused this agitation, she saw nothing—nothing but the vast solitary emerald which Queen Elizabeth had given her. And was that not enough? she asked. It was of the finest water. It was worth ten thousand pounds at least. The vibration seemed, in the oddest way (but remember we are dealing with some of the darkest manifestations of the human soul) to say No, that is not enough; and, further, to assume a note of interrogation, as though it were asking, what did it mean, this hiatus, this strange oversight? till poor Orlando felt positively ashamed of the second finger of her left hand without in the least knowing why. At this moment, Bartholomew came in to ask which dress she should lay out for dinner, and Orlando, whose senses were much quickened, instantly glanced at Bartholomew’s left hand, and instantly perceived what she had never noticed before—a thick ring of rather jaundiced yellow circling the third finger where her own was bare.",

There it was going on in the background, for all those thousands of years, this curious silent unrepresented life. Of course we’re always writing about women—abusing them, or jeering at them, or worshipping them; but it’s never come from women themselves. I believe we still don’t know in the least how they live, or what they feel, or what they do precisely. If one’s a man, the only confidences one gets are from young women about their love affairs. But the lives of women of forty, of unmarried women, of working women, of women who keep shops and bring up children, of women like your aunts or Mrs Thornbury or Miss Allan—one knows nothing whatever about them. They won’t tell you. Either they’re afraid, or they’ve got a way of treating men. It’s the man’s view that’s represented, you see. Think of a railway train: fifteen carriages for men who want to smoke. Doesn’t it make your blood boil? If I were a woman I’d blow someone’s brains out. Don’t you laugh at us a great deal? Don’t you think it all a great humbug? You, I mean—how does it all strike you?’",

    "target_paragraph": "Across the Río Magdalena at Isnos, a large horseshoe-shaped mound, clearly of human origins, rises to reveal a dramatic vista to the northwest, toward a forked hill known as Cerro de la Horqueta. The slopes of the cerro, all the land skirting its base, and indeed everything that can be seen was at one time worked by whoever occupied the site. The name, El Alto de los Ídolos, suggests that the entire complex served a purely religious function, which may not be true. On the western arm are six massive tombs, enormous slabs each containing a monolithic sarcophagus. The eastern side features freestanding statues and burial mounds. But these ceremonial features, dramatic as they are, occupy but a small fraction of the surface of an enormous space that may well have supported other societal needs. Excavations in just one of several middens revealed a thick mantle of debris several feet deep. A single one-square-yard plot contained in but eight inches of stratigraphy more than fifteen thousand potsherds, each the story of a life, a memory of a distant morning when water was drawn from a well or a bowl of frothy chicha was passed into the hands of a warrior by a loving wife—each, in short, a window onto the full complexity of the civilization that moved heaven and earth to create this place.",

The team won the Dutch national championship three years in a row, in 1966, 1967 and 1968, and made the final of the European Cup in 1969. In 1971, it won the European Cup at Wembley; it won again the next year, and again the year after that. In the space of a few years, Ajax had gone from a team of middling semi-professionals to one of the best clubs in the world, and the agile new style it had pioneered began to be adopted by other teams. Ironically, a country known for its good sense and unflashy dependability had started to become famous worldwide for its flair and creativity on the pitch. By the mid-1970s, the new style had acquired a new name: ‘Totaalvoetbal’, or ‘Total Football’.",

After­wards we dined by candlelight and talked, and were on the point of going to bed when the silence of the little town began to ripple and bulge all round us.

The door burst open to reveal the dark garden and the heads of flowers tossing in the idle night wind. Then something appeared to go off between our teeth. ‘I take it you are trying to say good-bye to me appropriately,’ said my brother. ‘Believe me, I am honoured.’",

From the little I can see as we drive along, there’s nothing either prosperous or individual about them. In one town after another, the highway simply expires into litter on either edge. Soot from the surrounding coal mines covers everything, leaving doors and windows streaked with gluey grime and turning even the litter underfoot to black. This blackened layer, made up of food peels, strips from plastic bags, glass bottle shards, newspaper pages, and whatever someone didn’t need or couldn’t reuse, is the defacto safe zone for those not moving at high speed. It’s crammed with pedestrians, motorcycles, men wheeling carts, and women pedaling bicycles. They bustle in and out of the single row of shops that parallels the highway on either side. All the shops are identical in size, about twelve feet square, no matter whether a hairdresser, grocer, restaurant, or furniture emporium. Perhaps this egalitarian assignment of space is a vestige of Mao. It seems stifling to me. After all, what would spur someone to build their business if it’s impossible to get a larger space once it started to grow? The riot of prosperity and relentless march forward I saw in Beijing hasn’t reached here. Though everyone has a cell phone, everything else about their lives seems stuck in a time warp.",

As time went on and the benefits he had conferred upon the town receded in time they sat on his store porch while he was busy inside and discussed him. Like one day after he caught Henry Pitts with a wagon load of his ribbon cane and took the cane away from Pitts and made him leave town. Some of them thought Starks ought not to have done that. He had so much cane and everything else. But they didn’t say that while Joe Starks was on the porch. When the mail came from Maitland and he went inside to sort it out everybody had their say.\nSim Jones started off as soon as he was sure that Starks couldn’t\nhear him.\n“It’s uh sin and uh shame runnin’ dat po’ man way from here lak\ndat. Colored folks oughtn’t tuh be so hard on one ’nother.”\n“Ah don’t see it dat way atall,” Sam Watson said shortly. “Let colored folks learn to work for what dey git lak everybody else. Nobody ain’t stopped Pitts from plantin’ de cane he wanted tuh. Starks give him uh job, what mo’ do he want?”\n“Ah know dat too,” Jones said, “but, Sam, Joe Starks is too exact wid folks. All he got he done made it offa de rest of us. He didn’t have all dat when he come here.”\n“Yeah, but none uh all dis you see and you’se settin’ on wasn’t here\nneither, when he come. Give de devil his due.”\n“But now, Sam, you know dat all he do is big-belly round and tell other folks what tuh do. He loves obedience out of everybody under de sound of his voice.”\n“You kin feel a switch in his hand when he’s talkin’ to yuh,” Oscar Scott complained. “Dat chastisin’ feelin’ he totes sorter gives yuh de protolapsis uh de cutinary linin’.”\n“He’s uh whirlwind among breezes,” Jeff Bruce threw in.\n“Speakin’ of winds, he’s de wind and we’se de grass. We bend which ever way he blows,” Sam Watson agreed, “but at dat us needs him. De town wouldn’t be nothin’ if it wasn’t for him. He can’t help bein’ sorta bossy. Some folks needs thrones, and ruling-chairs and crowns tuh make they influence felt. He don’t. He’s got uh throne in de seat of his pants.”",

Five long chains of brightly colored prayer flags* were then strung radially from the pole above our tents to protect the camp from harm. Every morning before dawn our Base Camp sirdar—an avuncular, highly respected, forty-something Sherpa named Ang Tshering—would light sprigs of juniper incense and chant prayers at the chorten; before heading into the Icefall, Westerners and Sherpas alike would walk past the altar—keeping it always on the right—and through the sweet clouds of smoke to receive a blessing from Ang Tshering.",

I shall be charmed;’ but Lady Marvel, a melancholy-looking woman, with brown hair and sentimental eyelashes, entirely declined to have her past or her future exposed; and nothing that Lady Windermere could do would induce Monsieur de Koloff, the Russian Ambassador, even to take his gloves off. In fact, many people seemed afraid to face the odd little man with his stereotyped smile, his gold spectacles, and his bright, beady eyes; and when he told poor Lady Fermor, right out before every one, that she did not care a bit for music, but was extremely fond of musicians, it was generally felt that cheiromancy was a most dangerous science, and one that ought not to be encouraged, except in a tête-à-tête.",

It mixed with the hundreds of insects that had been flinging themselves into the windscreen since Nebraska (what a senseless waste of life!) and turned it into a brown sludge. I attacked it with window washer solution, but this just converted it from a brown sludge to a creamy sludge and I still couldn’t see. I stopped and jumped out to wipe at the window with my sleeve, certain that at any moment a bobcat, seeing the chance of a lifetime, would drop onto my shoulders and rip off my scalp with a sound like two strips of Velcro being parted. I imagined myself, scalpless, stumbling down the mountainside with the bobcat nipping at my heels. This formed such a vivid image in my mind that I jumped back into the car, even though I had only created a small rectangle of visibility about the size of an envelope. It was like looking out of a tank turret.",

Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.",

Every few minutes a man would step to the door and call out a series of numbers ridiculously lower than ours – 220, 221, 222 – and a dozen or so people would follow him into the dining-room. We debated leaving, but a party of fat people beside us told us not to give up because it was worth the wait, even if we had to stay there until eleven o’clock. The food was that good, they said, and where food was concerned these people clearly had some experience. Well, they were right. Eventually our number was called and we were ushered into the dining-room with nine strangers and all seated together at one big trestle-table.",

She was an odd, scowling, shabby figure with the red dye fading from her gray frizzy hair, in her baggy trousers and patched jumper, coughing over her cigarettes, staring at her bottles of whiskey that no one was drinking, waiting for the New Year to come and go and for spring to come back to the crater.",

They put him into an oxygen tent and pumped quarts of glucose into his veins. Mrs. Husk was contacted and came down to see him. But he never saw her. He never came back, never opened his eyes, never spoke. He could not live anymore and after three days even the strongest of the doctors let him go. Then he died.",

Their cuisine consisted largely of simple, earthy, calorific stodge: potatoes and cabbage and heavily processed meat that looked like pink toothpaste. Despite being one of Europe’s smallest countries, the Netherlands was (according to the national statistics agency) responsible for nearly a third of the continent’s total production of French fries. The contrast with the more delicate cuisines enjoyed elsewhere in Europe was stark, as any tourist unfortunate enough to have been treated to a frikandel fried meat-stick could testify. Bread and cheese was viewed by many Dutch people as a fine meal; cheap processed sausage a real treat. Perhaps most damning of all were the Smullers automated vending machines found in many city centres, selling pre-heated junk food that managed to be burnt and soggy at the same time.",

They would hear it going in, running light and fast, the light clatter of the trucks, the exhaust of the diminutive locomotive and its shrill peanut-parcher whistle flung for one petty moment and absorbed by the brooding and inattentive wilderness without even an echo. They would hear it going out, loaded, not quite so fast now yet giving its frantic and toylike illusion of crawling speed, not whistling now to conserve steam, flinging its bitten laboring miniature puffing into the immemorial woodsface with frantic and bootless vainglory, empty and noisy and puerile, carrying to no destination or purpose sticks which left nowhere any scar or stump as the child’s toy loads and transports and unloads its dead sand and rushes back for more, tireless and unceasing and rapid yet never quite so fast as the Hand which plays with it moves the toy burden back to load the toy again. But it was different now. It was the same train, engine cars and caboose, even the same enginemen brake-man and conductor to whom Boon, drunk then sober then drunk again then fairly sober once more all in the space of fourteen hours, had bragged that day two years ago about what they were going to do to Old Ben tomorrow, running with its same illusion of frantic rapidity between the same twin walls of impenetrable and impervious woods, passing the old landmarks, the old game crossings over which he had trailed bucks wounded and not wounded and more than once seen them, anything but wounded, bolt out of the woods and up and across the embankment which bore the rails and ties then down and into the woods again as the earth-bound supposedly move but crossing as arrows travel, groundless, elongated, three times its actual length and even paler, different in color, as if there were a point between immobility and absolute motion where even mass chemically altered, changing without pain or agony not only in bulk and shape but in color too, approaching the color of wind, yet this time it was as though the train (and not only the train but himself, not only his vision which had seen it and his memory which remembered it but his clothes too, as garments carry back into the clean edgeless blowing of air the lingering effluvium of a sick-room or of death) had brought with it into the doomed wilderness even before the actual axe the shadow and portent of the new mill not even finished yet and the rails and ties which were not even laid; and he knew now what he had known as soon as he saw Hoke’s this morning but had not yet thought into words: why Major de Spain had not come back, and that after this time he himself, who had had to see it one time other, would return no more.",

It’s heavy, though, robust enough to jack up a vehicle even weightier than Roxanne. The other isn’t an ordinary jack at all. It’s a balloon of heavy plastic, which Bernard ordered from Taiwan, which inflates with hot air from the exhaust pipe. The idea of it is that, if Roxanne were ever stuck in soft sand, where a normal jack would sink into the ground, the balloon would spread over the soft surface and not sink in at all. As it filled, Roxanne would rise, pressed upward by the inflating mattress underneath her. The idea did not come through in practice, as the one time we tried to inflate the gadget, Roxanne’s heft won out and the inflation device gave one last gasp when the balloon was barely half full.",
