The site was immense. It looked as if someone had filled the Roman Colosseum with wet sand and dumped it onto the side of a mountain, and then built a small village on top of the new plateau. A river flowed in front of the ghost town like a moat.",

You don’t know what it is to me. You don’t” . . . words seemed to fail him. It was a distinct glimpse. He was a youngster of the sort you like to see about you; of the sort you like to imagine yourself to have been; of the sort whose appearance claims the fellowship of these illusions you had thought gone out, extinct, cold, and which, as if rekindled at the approach of another flame, give a flutter deep, deep down somewhere, give a flutter of light . . . of heat! . . . Yes; I had a glimpse of him then . . . and it was not the last of that kind. . . . “You don’t know what it is for a fellow in my position to be believed — make a clean breast of it to an elder man. It is so difficult — so awfully unfair — so hard to understand.”",

Late in the night she heard subdued chanting, the sound of blows in the street approaching the house and looked out of the window. At the moment she did so, she heard the voice of her brother crying out: “Mama! Mama! Sauvez moi!” (Save me!) She screamed and aroused the house and others of the inside looked out and saw the procession and heard the cry. But such is the terror inspired by these ghouls, that no one, not even the mother or sister, dared go out to attempt a rescue. The procession moved on out of sight.

We race around in the snow. But I am not warm, not warm enough to lie down on the snow like on a bed, yet I am warm. The light makes me warm, but not warm enough to lie down on the snow, which is dangerous, if you are too happy, like that man in the snow where the dog brings him a barrel on his collar. Papa will maybe turn round now but he does not, but Gilbert shouts, “Hi, you better catch up, you’ll be late.” He throws his snowball at the next lamppost but it does not hit the next lamppost. Papa does not say, “Hurry, come along,” but on the Lehigh mountains he walks fast, so you have to run sometimes to catch up, but he does not say, “Don’t get lost.” He lets us get lost under the bushes and by the little stream when we go for pansy-violets and mayapples which have a white flower and two big leaves. The mayapple leaves are like an umbrella for the bunch of pansy-violets or the real violets we get.",

Half the battle. …Yes, something like that, delicately but firmly done, so as not to alarm the quarry. Some walls are carried by storm, but all walls are reduced by siege. There is also the fable of the wind and the sun and the man in a cloak. “We’ll change the gender, by Jove,” Mr. Talliaferro said aloud, breaking suddenly from his revery to discover that he had passed Fairchild’s door. He retraced his steps and craned his neck to see the dark window.",

Already a few fishermen were scrambling down the sandy cliffs, wearing winter jackets and woolly hats and in a hurry to set up their lines. They didn’t greet each other and none responded to my ‘Shalom!’ A strong headwind blew. Then a low cloud bank above the horizon took fire and soon my hands were thawing. The sand was agreeably firm, the shells (being collected for granddaughters) were agreeably varied and the waves’ rhythms agreeably soothing. An hour later, within shouting distance of Gaza, I had to turn back. The ‘MINES’ warnings were in Hebrew, Arabic and English. It would be over two years before I was finally able to visit Gaza myself, such is the control exerted by Israel over reporting from the besieged Palestinian territory. I’ve told the story of that visit in A Month by the Sea.",

Then it got “spirit” in it and “wet.” What with the music and the barbaric rituals, I became interested and took up around the place. I witnessed a wonderful ceremony with candles. I asked Brother Levi why this ceremony and he said, “We hold candle march after Joseph. Joseph came from cave where Christ was born in the manger with a candle. He was walking before Mary and her baby. You know Christ was not born in the manger. Mary and Joseph were too afraid for that. He was born in a cave and He never came out until He was six months old. The three wise men see the star but they can’t find Him because He is hid in cave. When they can’t find Him after six months, they make a magic ceremony and the angel come tell Joseph the men wanted to see Him. That day was called ‘Christ must day’ because it means ‘Christ must find today,’ so we have Christmas day, but the majority of people are ignorant. They think Him born that day.”",

Her engagement had been announced only the day before, and she had the delicious sense of being “in all the papers,” and of focussing countless glances of interest and curiosity as she swept through the theatre in Mrs. Fairford’s wake. Their stalls were near the stage, and progress thither was slow enough to permit of prolonged enjoyment of this sensation. Before passing to her place she paused for Ralph to remove her cloak, and as he lifted it from her shoulders she heard a lady say behind her: “There she is—the one in white, with the lovely back——” and a man answer: “Gad! Where did he find anything as good as that?”",

Crazy Diamond was instructed to move forward at idle speed and we were to be ready to add forward or reverse thrust as needed to help steer the raft. As we followed behind the ship the line walkers, as their title implies, walked along beside us holding the ends of our lines, pulling the warps forward as we went. After we passed the next set of gates into the second lock our raft came to a stop behind the ship once more and the line walkers dropped the loops over another set of bollards. The gates swung closed behind us, the Klaxon sounded and the water began to churn.",

In comparison with Bangkok, Central London’s air seems Andean-pure; many Thai wear masks: the traffic police, bus and taxi drivers, building site workers, schoolchildren. In 1997 the number of cars on Bangkok’s streets increased daily by 800. And each year, while vehicles wait at traffic lights, petrol to the value of US$500 million is (mis) used. In December 1993 a local paper complained: ‘Our traffic congestion and pollution are the worst in the world – ever. Never in history have people had to live in the conditions we endure each day.’ One wonders – why does anyone (apart from sex deviates) go to Bangkok for a holiday?",

Only the feel of cold metal in my hands and the solid rock under my feet grounded me. It was 10 p.m. and I was breathless from running the quarter mile up the summit trail from the PCT. Slowly, I let go of the metal and threw my arms wide?embracing the night. I could not pass by this chance to stand on the mountain and touch the heavens.

The tale is set one hot summer afternoon sometime in the late 580s, with Moschos and Sophronius sheltering from the midday heat in the shade of the monumental tetrapylon at the centre of Alexandria. The monks had set out to visit another bibliophile friend, Stephen the Sophist, but Stephen’s maid had shouted out of the top window that her master was fast asleep. So while they waited for the Sophist to finish his siesta, the pair amused themselves by eavesdropping on a conversation between three blind men who were also taking advantage of the tetrapylon’s shade. They were passing the time by telling each other how they had lost their sight, and the last of the men told a strange and macabre story which Moschos records.",

This time they—Clarence—had found a big operator, a hot sport who, Virgil having taken on the customary two successfully, bet them he couldn’t handle a third one without stopping, offering them the odds this time, which Clarence covered with Flem’s other fifty since this really would be a risk; he said how he even gave Virgil a chance to quit and not hold it against him: “ ‘We’re ahead now, you know; you done already proved yourself.’ And do you know, the little sod never even turned a hair. ‘Sure,’ he says. ‘Send her in.’ And now my conscience hurts me,” he said, yawning again. “It was Flem’s money.

These included the festively named Sir Earle Christmas Grafton Page, who was, to be fair, prime minister for less than a month in 1939, but also William McMahon, who held the office for almost two years in the early 1970s and whose existence was until this moment quite unsuspected by me.",

Rotten snow is either granular, like sugar, or forms a crunchy matrix of longer, thinner crystals which have been hollowed out and separated from one another. Either way, it is unstable.",

If you don’t wear pointed-toe boots and a Texas hat, you’re not with it. And that is what would come with a capital here. The capital should go to Fairbanks or Anchorage. They’re already ruined.

The walls and ceilings of the cell were made of some hard slate-like substance of black-grey, scrawled with the familiar obscenities and pictures of its former occupants. Because of these solid walls, each cell was cut off from its neighbours and for this reason he could not see Emmet Blake, who had the cell next to him, nor Robert, who had the cell on the other side of Emmet, but now, as his mind swam from the stupor of its drunkenness, he could hear their voices and began to listen to their conversation.",
