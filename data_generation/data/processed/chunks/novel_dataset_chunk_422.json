Out of the sun, the air is very cold. GS lowers my backpack, then a sack of lentils, then our supply of flour in a big neoprene bag. I work the lentils and the flour over to my right, to a point where they will clear the stretch of shale, then let them fall. The lentils in their squashy sack soon come to rest where the wall becomes steep slope, a hundred yards below, but the slick neoprene bag sails so far down into the bowl, and at such speed, that the Sherpas, whose heads have now appeared over the rim, give it a cheer.",

Thus, between two countries, we have none at all, or only that little space of either in which we finally lay down our discontented bones. . . .",

We were now at 13,800 feet, and directly beneath the northern verge of this plateau lay a fierce, sombre scene of geological anarchy. One fancied that at the time of creation some basic law had here been forgotten – and nothing grew or moved amidst the grotesque desolation of these riven mountains. Then, looking north-east, I saw beneath me the countless strangely-eroded peaks and ridges that from the Ataba valley had looked so high; and beyond them I could recognise the mountains of Adua and Aksum, amongst scores of other ranges. In three directions I was gazing over hundreds of miles though crystal air – away and away to far, far horizons, where deserts and the sea are ‘as a moat defensive …’ No wonder I felt like a mini-Hillary, with all Northern Ethiopia lying at my feet.",

The sun was shining, but the surf was generating a salt mist that filled the air on both sides of the Great Highway—a sharp-smelling haze like some essence from the bottom of the ocean. There was no wind, but gray plumes of spray rose nonetheless from the tops of the largest waves, lifted by the sheer mass and speed of their crests as they plunged. The inside bar was a maelstrom of dredging, midsized killer waves, their dark chocolate faces smeared with drifts of foam. The outside bar looked ill-defined, the swell confused, but the outside waves themselves were smooth and shiny, with clean peaks and sections looming randomly in the mist. Some of them looked ridable—loveliness amid lethality.",

There was also a curious complement of American missionaries, including Mr Panter (‘very tall, very doleful … the voice of Doom’), Mrs Panter (who played the harmonium) and young Mr Titherton (‘on probation, a kind of apprentice missionary’). But the town we saw had a very different character. There were neither missionaries nor soldiers to be seen and Chengde now had the unmistakable air of a summer resort out of season.",

After paddling for about 20 minutes, I could hear music from the beach and I could see the bar that I assumed was Nipper's on a tall sand bluff a half mile south of where I entered the water. I checked the bottom with quick looks through my mask, and after spotting reef in about 50' of water, I pulled out the anchor, untangled the line, and dropped it over sand.\n\"Pauly Dangerous, you got your ears on?\" I heard from my VHF. I pulled it out of the drybag.\n\"Loud and clear\" I responded.\n\"We can see you from Nipper’s\" Eddie said. Loud music was coming through the VHF and was also audible in the air.\n\"Cool\" I said \"I'm glad you guys can see me. I've just dropped anchor and am ready to dive. The bar sounds loud!\".\n\"Have fun, we'll be watching\".\nI put the radio back in the dry-bag and prepared my dive gear. I got in the water quietly and immediately looked all around in a circle to make sure there were no sharks, but as usual there were none. I would have liked to get one on video (besides the nurse shark that I already had) but I really didn’t want to see any while swimming. I relaxed, hovered on the surface, breathing deeply and slowly through my snorkel, then swam down towards the dark mass of reef below.",

(The northern latitude compounds elevation, so high alpine characteristics occur closer and closer to sea level, until farthest north, along the coast, “alpine” tundra grows practically out of the sea.) Sphagnum tundra is lower, thick, wetter than alpine tundra, and mossy, with spongy floating muskeg tussocks in flatland black spruce bog or, on better-drained birch and aspen-forested slopes, a lush carpet you can fall to on your back like a child into a pile of leaves.",

They have been on what amounts to war footing for three generations now. Their government constantly reminds them of the imperialist peril from the north, yet it also demands that the empire drop its embargo so that Cuba can do more business with America and its allies. The regime has used the perpetual threat of American intervention as cover for every misstep, failed program, food shortage, or power blackout over the last six decades, but it also depends on the billions of American dollars that exiles send back in remittances to keep Cuba afloat. State-run media presents the United States as a hellhole of drug addiction, mass murder and runaway consumerism, while portraying Cuba as an egalitarian paradise run by a government that can do no wrong. And yet, when Cubans compare their own lives with what they hear from relatives in Miami or with what they see on the internet, they know it isn’t so.",

The gold hoops didn’t require much cleaning, so I just wiped them with a cloth and returned them to the holes in my earlobes. The diamond studs, however, had become clogged with gunk. As I worked at dislodging the accumulated dirt, I wondered why I continued to wear them. I never liked stud earrings, but I wore them, even had another set of holes punched in my ears to accommodate them, just to please the person who had given them to me. Someone who had deceived me and hurt me. If the earrings brought up such bitter reminders, why wear them? Were they a form of self-flagellation? I was not much different from Colin in stoking a painful memory, I was just better at hiding it. I placed the studs carefully on the night table, then settled into bed and turned out the light.",

It wasn't easy, in 1926, to keep house and go to work as well. There were no drip-dry clothes, no nylon, no refrigeration except what the iceman supplied with his tongs. Because we were out all day, we were constantly toting things upstairs at night or early in the morning—we lived up several flights—from the grocery, the butcher's, the laundry, and the dairy. Annabel didn't mind, but that was natural; we never agreed on anything. I can't conceive of two girls with less in common. On the other hand, we never quarrelled, either. Indeed, as time went on I confided many things to Annabel. Over a gin daisy in the evening, I would expatiate on the frustrations I suffered at the office. I was particularly bitter about Mr. Dixon. I called him an exploiter of science and a sweater of female labor—I had recently discovered that I was being paid less than any of the male geologists. Annabel would listen to all this with no comment, her wide blue eyes full of calm.",

The Río Aracataca, originally a hundred feet across and thirty deep, was reduced to a heavily sedimented stream just twenty-six feet wide with a depth of a foot and a half. In place of glacial flows, cold and pure, the ciénaga increasingly absorbed agricultural runoff tainted with pesticides, nitrogenous fertilizers, and herbicides. In time, the salinity of the wetlands surpassed that of the sea. In June 1994, a much degraded Ciénaga Grande earned the terrible distinction as the site of the largest incident of fish mortality in Colombian history.",

Then the munching would re-commence, when the lively imagination might assist the eye to discern a group of pink-white nostrils, large as caverns, and very clammy and humid on their surfaces, not exactly pleasant to the touch until one got used to them. The mouths beneath them having a great partiality for closing upon any fragment of Bathsheba’s apparel which came within reach of their tongues. Above each of these a still keener vision suggested a brown forehead and two staring though not unfriendly eyes; and above all a pair of whitish crescent-shaped horns like two particularly new moons, an occasional stolid ‘mu!’ proclaiming beyond the shade of a doubt that these phenomena were the features and persons of Daisy, Whitefoot, Bonnylass, Jolly-O, Spot, Twinkle-eye, &c., &c. – the respectable dairy of Devon cows belonging to Bathsheba aforesaid.",

Its wings rise and inflate, shaking forth a loud, weird hissing noise. It waggles crab-like pincers that look like they could slice off your finger. She releases it, and it buzzes about clumsily while I duck and cover my hair. They love this, and take it into their hands. It looks like a tank, but it’s harmless. Now we exchange confessions of creatures we fear. Boon is allergic to the bite of a centipede. Her son can’t stand cockroaches. I volunteer bats. Soo proposes rats, a popular choice.

Day after day to the ache of his body was added the ache and shame of his spirit, but he hung on with a pallid smile across his lips, and envy and fear of their strength in his heart.
