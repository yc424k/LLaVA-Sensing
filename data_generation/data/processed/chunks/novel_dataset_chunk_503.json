The plan was to be back in the Rio by the first of the year and clearing the Panama Canal by the beginning of March so that they could have seven months (through October) doing the Pacific before the southern hemisphere typhoon season started on December first.

Wrangell was like those small western towns, now almost completely vanished, that my family used to stop in during multi-day drives out to national parks in the 1970s. Even my hotel, the Wrangell Extended Stay and Trading Post, had the sort of name that could only be used whimsically nowadays outside of Alaska, perhaps for a mustache wax emporium that served home-brewed rye whiskey. It was certainly the first establishment I’d stayed in that had a sign in the front window advertising the proprietors’ interest in buying animal skins. WANTED: BEAVER IN THE ROUND ALSO MINK, OTTER AND WOLF PUT UP. (“In the round” and “put up,” I now know, refer to skinning and drying techniques.) The owners, Mike and Lydia Matney, could be seen through the front window at all hours, seated at their sewing machines, transforming furs into hats and slippers. In addition to the ferry, intermediate-size tourist boats stopped in Wrangell every few days, and local businesses would put out hand-painted signs and card tables stacked with knickknacks. Having come from Ketchikan, it was like visiting a yard sale after a trip to Macy’s on Black Friday.",

    "target_paragraph": "I had already heard the story of the Pentidattilo massacre several times. Calabrians liked to tell the seventeenth-century tale of jealousy and slashing, one noble family pitted against the other in a castle now reduced to an inconsequential ruin. Perhaps the gruesome bloodbath is more easily associated with the paese fantasma (ghost town) than any marquis or baron’s feudal prosperity. Pentidattilo was completely abandoned by the 1960s, the population having long since settled in Melito Porto Salvo. However, the forsaken village’s unique naturalistic setting has continued to attract the attention of travelers who visit the village primarily in the summer months. Several buildings have even been renovated, a few local artisans have opened tourist shops and a couple of people have made it their home. For a number of years, the ancient burg, a cinematic setting in itself, has hosted an international short film festival. Every August participants fill the small squares and line the staircases for viewings under the night sky.",

At that dull hour, when the glory of morning is gone and the serenity of afternoon has not begun, we arrived at a small grey wooden hotel, separated from the east sea by a belt of fir-wood, facing a common to the south, and about twenty minutes' walk from Thiessow proper, which lies on the sea on the western and southern shore of the point. It looked clean, and I went in. August and Gertrud sat broiling in the sun of the shelterless sandy road in front of the lily-grown garden. Somehow I had no doubts about being taken in here, and I was at once shown a spotless little bedroom by a spotless landlady. It was a corner room in the south-west corner of the house, and one window looked south on to the common and the other west on to the plain. The bed was drawn across this window, and lying on it I could see the western sea, the distant hill on the shore with its village, and grass, grass, nothing but grass, rolling away from the very wall of the house to infinity and the sunset. The room was tiny. If I had had more than a hold-all I should not have been able to get into it. It had a locked door leading into another bedroom which was occupied, said the chambermaid, by a quiet lady who would make no noise. Gertrud's room was opposite mine. August cheered up when I went out and told him he could go to the stables and put up, and Gertrud was visibly agreeably surprised by the cleanliness of both our rooms.",

I think of the ivy I have in pretty jardinières on my mantle in San Francisco, imagine that in my absence they will bolt, strangle the furniture, cover the windows. As I move along this wall, my footing becomes more canted because the terrace starts to angle down. The cool scents of crushed lemon balm and nepitella, tiny wild mint, rise from around my feet. I lean into the wall, cut a runner of ivy, then rip it out. Dirt flies in my face and little stones crumble out, hitting my shoes. I disturb not at all a long snake taking a siesta. Its head is (how far?) in the wall, tail dangling out about two feet. Which way would he exit—back out or go farther in and U-turn? I skip ten feet on either side and begin to snip again.

With her hands on her hips she looked at Temple with cold, blazing eyes. “Man? You’ve never seen a real man. You dont know what it is to be wanted by a real man. And thank your stars you haven’t and never will, for then you’d find just what that little putty face is worth, and all the rest of it you think you are jealous of when you’re just scared of it. And if he is just man enough to call you whore, you’ll say Yes Yes and you’ll crawl naked in the dirt and the mire for him to call you that.…… Give me that baby.” Temple held the child, gazing at the woman, her mouth moving as if she were saying Yes Yes Yes. The woman threw the fork onto the table. “Turn loose,” she said, lifting the child. It opened its eyes and wailed. The woman drew a chair out and sat down, the child upon her lap. “Will you hand me one of those diapers on the line yonder?” she said. Temple stood in the floor, her lips still moving. “You’re scared to go out there, aren’t you?” the woman said. She rose.",

But how excessively he hated all this, how excessively he hated seeing Catherine in these relationships. Why had she made him come in? Why need he ever have seen Virginia, and been introduced, and have to make the fool grimaces of convention? Well, he would soon have put miles between themselves and Chickover, and he fervently hoped he might never see the beastly place again.",

The museum director, who carefully marked her place in the translated Stephen King novel she was reading when I walked in, was a bespectacled woman of late middle age named Revolutsia. Her parents, ardent Communists, had given her the name; she said most people just called her Lutsia. Neither of us being in any hurry, she led me through a detailed tour of the museum’s three small rooms, one of which consisted mainly of drawings by Olga schoolchildren. Lutsia discoursed on the Stone and Iron ages in the Primorskii Krai, and on several stone sculptures from a Chinese empire that had extended this far north in the time of Kublai Khan, and on Olga’s all-time richest man, a nineteenth-century tycoon who made his fortune harvesting sea cabbage along the shore and selling it to Japan. I told her about our just-completed journey and she asked if she could write an item about it for her museum newsletter. Sergei, who had showed up, cheerfully obliged by describing some of our adventures and the book I was writing about the Decembrists.",

In amongst the band are kilted band offspring who are the next generation. The band marches up and down Point Street playing many rousing pieces. Then, a break. A solo piper steps out. He plays, and a contingent of women and girl dancers take to the street performing traditional dances. The amount of time they spend with their arms over their heads and on their toes is truly impressive. People walk by with collection buckets to which everyone generously donates. The buckets become so heavy that the younger girls can’t manage them anymore. The band cranks up again, heads down Point Street, turns right, and is gone.",

The air above the sea was live with scores of birds: fulmars planing the wind in white curves, stubby guillemots like winged cigars, whirring along just above the waves, gulls making their weightless turns and angles, and giving their quick cries. So much life was at work in this place! I picked out one fulmar and followed its motion for a few minutes, watching the laterals of its gliding wings, wondering what sort of pattern its complex flight-path would make if it could be plotted. Out of sight to the east were the Clo Mor Cliffs, home to a far bigger seabird colony: tens of thousands of puffins, razorbills, guillemots, fulmars and kittiwakes.",

Hard physical work out in the fresh air and hot sun, camels to be entertained by, and Gladdy, all made life look promising again. Besides, Kurt, though never exactly kind-hearted, was at least being intermittently civil. He was a wonderful teacher. He forced me to work with the animals in a way that I would have been too cowardly to attempt, but he never pushed so hard that I lost my confidence. The result was that I was fearless. There was nothing those creatures could do that scared me in the least. How I escaped serious physical damage during that time must have a lot to do with guardian angels, Kurt-cleverness and outrageous good luck. He seemed pleased with my progress with the beasts and began introducing me to the secrets of handling them.",

It was the work of a few moments to drag out the man-trap very gently—that the plate might not be disturbed sufficiently to throw it—to a space between a pair of young oaks which, rooted in contiguity, grew apart upward, forming a V-shaped opening between; and, being backed up by bushes, left this as the only course for a foot passenger. In it he laid the trap with the same gentleness of handling, locked the chain round one of the trees, and finally slid back the guard which was placed to keep the gin from accidentally catching the arms of him who set it, or—to use the local and better word—“toiled” it. Having completed these arrangements Tim sprang through the adjoining hedge of his father’s garden, ran down the path, and softly entered the house.",

Thus at one point the narrator leads a madman to the St. Agnes home, and we notice from the date given a little later that it is close to Saint Agnes’ Eve. He tells us the story of Casanova, and we recall, a little unsettlingly, that Stendhal, in the first movement of the book, died on the street now known as rue Danielle-Casanova. The archetypal Sebald moment, you could say, comes when he walks into a pizza parlor in Verona (a pizza parlor!), and sees that the owner’s name is Carlo Cadavero (lest this detail seem too Sebaldian to be true, he offers us a photograph of his bill from the restaurant). Later, returning to the place, he finds it all boarded up, blinds drawn on the apartment above, and the photographer next door so silent that we can only assume that the poor Cadavero has attained the state of his name. The odd keepsakes pasted into the text—here we see a picture of the shuttered restaurant—have the almost desperate air of pieces of evidence in a trial, aimed to show us (or the narrator himself) that all this really happened and he is not, in fact, mad.",

After holding the shrunken hand for a moment he was convulsed with an agonising sob, and had to turn away.\nAmy saw that her husband wished to speak to her; she bent over him.\n‘Ask him to stay, dear. Give him a room in the hotel.’\n‘I will.’\nBiffen sat down by the bedside, and remained for half an hour.
