    "target_paragraph": "LATER, I LOOKED UP, FEELING chilly in the sea breeze, and saw that the moon had come up behind us. The gangster-acolyte still lay beside me. Now he was silvered in the light of the newly risen moon. His head cast a long shadow over his chest for the moon was low. Each nipple cast a small shadow. Every hair was silvered as though with frost. His legs, bent at the knee, disappeared off the bluff as though into the sea itself. A mosquito buzzed.\nI sat up and looked down at him. His tattoo now shone, colorless, all the red, all the blue, lost in the light of the moon. It was a tracery, a black-and-white photograph. He laughed and I saw that his eyes were open.\n“I look like I’m covered with snow,” he said. Then he yawned again, stood up, retied his loincloth, put his kimono on, then his long hakama skirt. When he was dressed he found he had forgotten his haramaki.\n“Konchikusho,” he said. Then: “Oh, well, I’ll carry it.”\nWe walked along the sea back to Miyaura, the town where the shrine is, scuffing the sand with our feet.\n“How long will you stay here?”\n“Not long. I’m going to run away.”\n“You can’t hide in Japan,” I said. And it is true. There is no place for the fugitive in this well-run country. People are curious, everyone is registered, the law is thorough.\n“Then I’ll go abroad. I’ll come stay with you.”\n“All right.”\n“No I won’t,” he said. I’ll stay here. Then I’ll get a job back in Onomichi and I’ll get married—if I can.”\nThe moon sailed higher. It was a long way back to town. The lights were small in the distance, then larger. Mosquitoes buzzed. He slapped them. “They get bigger and bigger,” he said. “Here it is almost autumn—they are enormous.”\nBack in town I asked him to have an ice with me at one of the small shops still open.\n“No, we got a morning service at dawn. I better go back.” Then he smiled and shook his head. “But that’s not it. I got a bad reputation here. They don’t like me in town very much. Then they see me come in with some foreigner and that would make it worse.”\nI smiled at this.\n“But,” he said earnestly, “I enjoyed meeting you, I don’t mean I didn’t. And talking with you and everything was really nice. It does you good to get things off your chest, you know. I feel a lot better, relieved.”\nI smiled again.\nHe turned at the corner to wave, carrying his haramaki in a folded ball, his stiff skirts swishing, his kimono tight at the neck, the living Heian period, a vision from history again. The moon was now half way up the sky. I yawned, felt suddenly chilled, suddenly very much alone. And it had been so warm. Autumn was on its way, though it was here still dead summer. I ate a strawberry ice myself, shivered again, went back to the inn and fell asleep at once.",

It could probably house as many passengers as an Atlantic liner; passengers, because no one goes to Liverpool for pleasure, to the little cramped square and the low sky-signs which can almost be touched with the hand, where all the bars and the cinemas close at ten. But there was a character hidden in this hotel; it wasn’t chic, it wasn’t bright, it wasn’t international; there remained somewhere hidden, among its long muffled corridors, beneath the huge cliff-like fall of its walls, the idea of an English inn; one didn’t mind asking for muffins or a pint of bitter, while the boats hooted in the Mersey and the luggage littered the hall; there was quite probably a Boots. Anyway enough remained for me to understand the surprise of Henry James when he landed in England, ‘that England should be as English as, for my entertainment, she took the trouble to be’.",

As I stepped out into the humid night—bougainvillea all around the perfectly manicured highway—I knew only one name to give the taxi driver as we sped through the night to 1 Beach Road.",

One of the waitresses, in whose flat I was staying, told me they were weekend ‘regulars’. They had just finished a meal – ‘To try to get sober,’ explained my friend, ‘before Josef’s wife comes for him.’ Then the elfin one stood up, swaying, and tried to cross the almost empty restaurant to the toalet, clinging to chairs as he went. But midway he crashed, gashing his cheek-bone on the sharp corner of a tin table. As he lay sobbing hoarsely Josef stumbled to help and with the edge of his jacket mopped up the blood. But unfortunately the crashing sound brought to the scene the restaurant Director, reputedly a loyal Ceausescu man planted in the town to spy on Szekelys. He certainly behaved as such, ordering the elfin one to be dumped on the street, though the evening was cold and very wet. Meekly Josef staggered back to his table and ordered another bottle of wine, making no protest as two kitchen lackeys threw out his friend – still sobbing and bleeding.",

Blue and clear. It made the present real, the sky, because she had never seen the sky in her dreams. She turned and marched down the road to Tanzania Bar. She walked past the dirty curtain at the door and pushed Odenigbo’s cup off the table; a pale liquid spread on the cement floor.",

Inside is an opera house straight out of a Márquez novel: oval, tiered, little boxes and seats upholstered in red, with a small stage on which I once witnessed a ballet troupe from Russia thump around for two hours. It serves now as the movie theater in winter. Midway through the movie, the reel winds down. Intermission. Everyone gets up for coffee and fifteen minutes of talk. It’s hard, when you really love to talk, to shut up for an entire two hours. In summer, the movies are shown sotto le stelle, under the stars, in the town park. Orange plastic chairs are set up in a stone amphitheater, kind of like the drive-in with no cars.",

It was also the moment I had been waiting for. I left the restaurant and took a rickshaw to the hotel. The whole city, its streets now silent, had been coloured for me, from the first, by my association with the Sikh; I had assessed it, whether in contempt or straining love, according to the terms of his special racialism. It was as much by this that I was now sickened as by the violence I had witnessed.",

In the corners of the ceiling were spider webs thick and heavy as Spanish moss and dingy as old lace; and the once-white walls were an even and unemphatic drab save for a paler rectangle here and there where an outdated calendar had hung and been removed. Besides the desk the room contained three or four miscellaneous chairs in various stages of decrepitude, a rusty stove in a sawdust filled box, and a leather sofa holding mutely amid its broken springs the outline of Dr Peabody’s recumbent shape; beside it and slowly gathering successive layers of dust, was a stack of lurid paper covered nickel novels. This was Dr Peabody’s library, and on this sofa he passed his office hours, reading them over and over. Other books there were none.",

The room was empty except for one other party consisting of a middle-aged couple, their teenaged daughter and a Swedish exchange student who was simply radiant – blonde, tanned, soft-spoken, hypnotically beautiful. I stared at her helplessly. I had never seen anyone so beautiful in a Chinese restaurant in Idaho before. After a while a man came in who was evidently a passing acquaintance of the family and stopped at their table to chat. He was introduced to the Swedish girl and asked her about her stay in Idaho Falls and if she had been to the local sights – the lava caves and hot springs. (She had. Zey were vairy nice.) Then he asked The Big Question. He said, ‘Well, Greta, which do you like better, the United States or Sweden?’",

She seems to find her way by instinct in and out among these little tables, touching no one, disregarding waiters, yet comes straight to our table in the corner. When she sees us (Neville, and myself) her face assumes a certainty which is alarming, as if she had what she wanted. To be loved by Susan would be to be impaled by a bird’s sharp beak, to be nailed to a barnyard door.

A wooden-clogged bicyclist would materialize in a peaked cap with circular black ear pads against frostbite, and sometimes his cigar would leave a floating drift from Java or Sumatra on the air long after the smoker had evaporated. I was pleased by my equipment. The rucksack sat with an easy balance and the upturned collar of my second-hand greatcoat, fastened with a semi-detachable flap which I had just discovered, formed a snug tunnel; and with my old cord breeches, their strapping soft after long use and the grey puttees and the heavy clouted boots, I was impenetrably greaved and jambed and shod; no chink was left for the blast. I was soon thatched with snow and my ears began to tingle, but I was determined never to stoop to those terrible earpads.",
