A beast is on the loose, leaping from roof to roof, attacking people sleeping above their hot homes. The stories begin with a small monkey and, as the heat and humidity build, he transforms from monkey to ape-man to monster, from one foot to ten, from having brown eyes to boiling red, and from having hairy hands to wielding clubs with long sharp spikes. A pregnant woman trying to escape his clutches falls down the stairs to her death. Two others die of fright while jumping from a roof. The authorities investigate and put it down to the “usual summer-induced mass hysteria.” But the beast within continues to grow and the bile rises in the most mannered of throats. A model is shot in an illegal bar, a movie star gets drunk and violent with his girlfriend, and there’s a coup for the leadership of the Australian High Commission Women’s Committee. I don’t understand the politics but the women now in charge have heard I know how to use a microphone. They give me my first Indian gig, as the host of a women’s fashion show.",

It was just the hour when Bessy's maid was carrying her breakfast-tray, with its delicate service of old silver and porcelain, into the darkened bed-room at Lynbrook; but early rising and hard scrambling had whetted the appetites of the naturalists, and the nursery fare which Cicely spread before them seemed a sumptuous reward for their toil.",

The rooftop, which bristles with the telephone and television antennas that somehow never show up in pictures of the sloping, projecting roofs of Florence, is an ad hoc affair. There are pots of sweet basil and rosemary and thyme and dill, and tomatoes in old tins, and pansies, a few scattered tables and chairs, strings of laundry, perennially blooming climbing Tuscan roses (“le rose d'ogni mese”) . . . and there is Florence: the pink-black-green-and-white-marble candy-striped Duomo; Brunelleschi's white-ribbed red dome; Giotto's Lily Tower; the sober gray-and-white Uffizi Gallery making its ordered geometric statement. Paintings have so accustomed me to seeing the Annunciation take place in the hills of Tuscany, I half expect to see flights of angels every time I sit here. (I would not be the first to wait in happy expectation: Citizens of the Republic of Florence believed their sacred city would be redeemed by armed angels descending from the skies.)",

Still, he’s on to something, the egocentric positioning that lets us fool ourselves. Sharing space with wild creatures stirs me (blessing), and as soon as I’ve said “stirs me,” I cringe (curse). Sheepish or not, proximity to wild things makes me feel feral—incautious and frisky and willing to gamble on what I cannot prove. And proximity to wild things makes me feel tame—glad I don’t have to hunt for every meal, eager to hunker next to a fire on a cold night. Wherever I am, banging against the glass.",

She dropped her lids after a while, and made a motion to rise again. “But you’ll know me now, won’t you, the next time we meet?”",

When we reached the main street and saw a moving truck he promptly reared in protest – whereupon the load conveniently fell off on to a hotel doorstep. ‘Hotel’ is of course a courtesy title. This sleazy Italian-built doss-house is blatantly a brothel, where harlots (to use the favourite term of English-speaking highlanders) may be observed partially undressing truck-drivers in the bar. I am now installed in an adjacent bedroom, amidst extreme squalor. The once-blue walls are nastily smeared, the floor tiles are stained with food and candle grease and littered with cigarette ends and dead matches, the broken window is patched with cardboard and the three iron beds are spread with revolting blankets. I intend to sleep on the floor; bed-bugs are an occupational hazard, but the likely result of using these foul beds is not.",

They then rise and unite?that is to say, their vestments are tied together by a piece of consecrated cloth beneath which their hands are joined?and walk three times round the sacred fire, each time in seven steps, repeating prayers and Vedic hymns. This concludes the ceremony; they are now man and wife, and he takes her with him back to his home, where she stays for a couple of days in order to meet his relations. The marriage is not, of course, consummated; this is another business altogether, and happens one year, three years, or five years later, at the discretion of the parents. If it is a lower-class marriage the wife has complete freedom and may go where she likes (though she will probably veil her face before any strange and undue interest in the streets); but if she is of the upper classes she disappears, after the consummation ceremony, into purdah, and save by her husband, her near relations, and female friends, is never seen again.",

As the driver prowled above his wheel, his dark and sallow face twisted bitterly by the sneer of his thin mouth, his dark eyes shining with an unnatural lustre like those of a man who is under the stimulation of a powerful drug, he seemed to be--and was--a creature which this furious city had created for its special uses. His tallowy flesh seemed to have been compacted, like that of millions of other men who wore grey hats and had faces of the same lifeless hue, out of a common city-substance--the universal grey stuff of pavements, buildings, towers, tunnels, and bridges. In his veins there seemed to flow and throb, instead of blood, the crackling electric current by which the whole city moved. It was legible in every act and gesture the man made. As his sinister figure prowled above the wheel, his eyes darting right and left, his hands guiding the powerful machine with skill and precision, grazing, cutting, flanking, shifting, insinuating, sneaking, and shooting the great car through all but impossible channels with murderous recklessness, it was evident that the unwholesome chemistry that raced in him was consonant with the great energy that was pulsing through all the arteries of the city.",

The best scene is when Rock removes her bandages and she sputters, “Why, it’s . . . you!” and slumps into an extravagant but comely swoon, but unfortunately does not strike her head on the coffee table and lose her vision again, which would have improved the story considerably, if you ask me. Also, Jane has a ten-year-old daughter played by one of those pigtailed, revoltingly precocious child actors of the fifties that you just ache to push out a high window. I expect also Lloyd Nolan is in there somewhere because Lloyd Nolan is always in 1950s movies with parts for doctors.",

From a hilltop I spied a sprawl of blue roofs about three quarters of a mile off and thought that might be the shopping mall and headed for it. The pedestrian walkways, which had seemed rather agreeable to me at first, began to become irritating. They wandered lazily through submerged cuttings, nicely landscaped but with a feeling of being in no hurry to get you anywhere. Clearly they had been laid out by people who had thought of it as a two-dimensional exercise. They followed circuitous, seemingly purposeless routes that must have looked pleasing on paper, but gave no consideration to the idea that people, faced with a long walk between houses and shops, would mostly like to get there in a reasonably direct way. Worse still was the sense of being lost in a semisubterranean world cut off from visible landmarks. I found myself frequently scrambling up banks just to see where I was, only to discover that it was nowhere near where I wanted to be.",

Fronting the last rise, the road begins to wind through a land­scape dense with orange and lemon trees, and noisy with run­ning water. Almond and peach-blossom graze the road, as improbably precise as the décor to a Japanese play. The village comes down to the road for the last hundred yards or so with its grey old-fashioned houses with arched vaults and carved doors set in old-fashioned mouldings. Then abruptly one turns through an arc of 150 degrees under the Tree of Idleness and comes to a stop in the main square under the shadow of the Abbey itself. Young cypresses bent back against the sky as they took the wind; the broad flower beds were full of mag­nificent roses among the almond trees. Yet it all lay deserted in the rain.",

I plan out the shape and poke “buttonholes” in the blanket, through which I can thread twine to tie it up and to act as anchoring points. I roll the sides to act like gutters, directing most of the water down to the apex of the point to the left. In the point I tie in a piece of tubing to act as a drain. I will pull this apex and drain through the observation port on the back of the raft. I can then direct the drain into a water container. Through the buttonholes, I tie string, and each knot is fitted with a loop to which I attach lanyards that run down to the raft’s exterior handline. The water collection cape is shown in position, with the point pulled through the observation port, the lanyards pulling it down and spreading it out as much as possible, and the top gutter lying along the ridge of the arch tube.",

Probably it was built much earlier, but it is now that you can understand it; it goes with the image of Antinous, it comes from the same need. Ordinary love does not build so tensely, it needs no protection, it can set up its cerebral center like a tent anywhere; but then the whole drive and character of the house, all the luxury and torment of it, come into their own at this time. The ego that everything combined to swell and sicken has now at one blow been nearly severed from the real world, which more and more becomes only an intrusion and a threat; true communication is with an image made flawless by death; the playboy side of the man has come into its grandest justification, among the mysteries of afterlife.",

As for himself, when he went to go to a party, as one was sometimes obliged to, from a wish not to give offence—his niece, for example, had been married the other day—he walked into the middle of the room, said ‘Ha! ha!’ as loud as ever he could, considered that he had done his duty, and walked away again. Mrs Thornbury protested. She was going to give a party directly she got back, and they were all to be invited, and she should set people to watch Mr Pepper, and if she heard that he had been caught saying ‘Ha! ha!’ she would—she would do something very dreadful indeed to him. Arthur Venning suggested that what she must do was to rig up something in the nature of a surprise—a portrait, for example, of a nice old lady in a lace cap, concealing a bath of cold water, which at a signal could be sprung on Pepper’s head; or they’d have a chair which shot him twenty feet high directly he sat on it.",

She raised her hand with a benedictory air and let it rest lightly, ever so lightly, on Ted's hair.",

They were aware of my presence and that of the Land Rover I sat in with my guests. Watching closely I could see their eyes turn toward us, then back to their food without hesitation. Occasionally one of the younger males would trot toward the vehicle, ears flared and trunk held high, challenging me to a fight. But this is typical of all little boys, and they try the same bullying tactics on buffalo, giraffes, and even the occasional palm tree. The rest of the family would walk casually around the car, even brushing against it, rocking it on its springs as they did. On these occasions I rarely had to remind my guests that they should stay still and quiet.",

They had the appearance of crocodiles so fully gorged by their last meal that the future, of the world gives them no anxiety whatever. The only disturbance in the placid bright room was caused by a large moth which shot from light to light, whizzing over elaborate heads of hair, and causing several young women to raise their hands nervously and exclaim, ‘Someone ought to kill it!’",

There were more than a hundred milchers under Crick’s management, all told; and of the herd the master-dairyman milked six or eight with his own hands, unless away from home. These were the cows that milked hardest of all; for his journey-milkmen being more or less casually hired, he would not entrust this half-dozen to their treatment, lest, from indifference, they should not milk them clean; nor to the maids, lest they should fail in the same way for lack of finger-grip; with the result that in course of time the cows would ‘go azew’ – that is, dry up. It was not the loss for the moment that made slack milking so serious, but that with the decline of demand there came decline, and ultimately cessation, of supply.",

The intercapedine is a brick wall constructed part of the way up a humid wall. A gap due dita, two fingers, wide is left between the two so that moisture is stopped by the brick barrier. The contadina kitchen has such a wall on the far end of the house. It looks deeper than is usual. Impatient, Ed and I decide to take down some of it, to see if possibly the intercapedine could be moved farther back toward the wall, thus enlarging the small room. As the bricks fall, we are stunned to find that there is no end wall of the house on the first floor; it was built directly into, onto the solid stone of the hillside. Behind the intercapedine we find Monte Sant’Egidio! Craggy, huge rock! “Well, now we know why this room had a moisture problem.” Ed is pulling out fig and sumac roots. Along the edge of the floor, he uncovers the rubble-filled remains of a moisture canal that must have functioned once.",

Having decided that a full exorcism was in order, the friars raised a cross, piled the kindling around the rock and its adjacent buildings, “recited their orisions,” as Bingham put it, and torched the whole thing. Only the charred boulder remained intact. Calancha proudly recorded that “the cruel Devil never more returned to the rock nor to this district.” Nor, most likely, did the friars, since the Incas were not amused by an act that, had the roles been reversed, could have been equated with blowing up St. Paul’s Cathedral.",

They seated themselves and tea was brought in by a maid-servant.

There were delicate little pastries, cubes, and crusts of things that were so flaky, rich and succulent that they melted away in the mouth; and there were little cubes and squares of sandwiches as well, all dainty, elegant, and small, but wonderfully good. She asked them if they wanted hot-tea or iced-tea or some whisky: the day was hot and Joel took iced-tea, refusing whisky; the other youth took iced-tea too – she poured it for them in marvellous tall frail glasses filled with slivers of bright ice, and put in mint and lemon, doing all things deftly, beautifully, with her small, swift, china-lovely hands, and then turning to Joel’s guest, with her light cool smile, her crisp incisive inquiry, in which there was somehow something good and generous, she said:",

She wanted money, a great deal of money: that was clear, but it was not the point. She was ready to sell her influence, and he fancied she could be counted on to fulfil her side of the bargain. The fact that he could so trust her seemed only to make her more terrible to him—more supernaturally dauntless and baleful. For what was it that she exacted of him? She had said she must have money to pay her debts; but he knew that was only a pretext which she scarcely expected him to believe. She wanted the money for someone else; that was what her allusion to a fellow-victim meant. She wanted it to pay the Prince’s gambling debts—it was at that price that Durham was to buy the right to marry Fanny de Malrive.",
