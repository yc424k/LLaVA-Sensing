Generally, the paint stripe gives drivers a visual aid to pull forward so at least someone behind can fuel while they pay for their fuel, or often in our case, if we couldn’t find better parking. Such paint stripes are placed with standard 53 foot trailers in mind. In a longer doubles rig a driver really needs to pull up a few feet beyond the paint stripe to get the caboose clear of the pumps, not only for the driver who might fuel up behind, but also for the drivers walking back and forth in front of the pumps on the way from their parked trucks.",

And so far as he could now remember, these two men, together with Gant’s mother, his brothers, his sister Augusta, and a few of the others who had known him in his boyhood in Pennsylvania, were the only people who ever had. And this revelation cast a strange, a lonely and a troubling light upon the great gaunt figure of the stone-cutter, which moved her powerfully and which she had never felt before. And most strange of all was the variety of names by which these various people called her father.",

Clito himself was so sur­prised that he forgot to turn off the spigot in the great cask of red wine and a stain began to spread across the dusty flea-bitten floor. Frangos looked as though someone had emptied a slop-pail over him, and I was rather ashamed of taking this easy advantage of him. ‘Your brother,’ he mumbled slowly, swallow­ing, not quite knowing which way to turn, and yet at the same time being unwilling to be so easily discountenanced.",

I kept walking along until the gradient steepened and I had to drop off again into the valley floor. The path took me near a patch of exposed rock perhaps ten square metres in area. I walked over, and crouched down to examine it. The horizontal striations scored into it showed that this rock had once been a scratching-post of the glacier which had created the valley and was one of the places where it had rubbed its tremendous underbelly along the ground.",

Unalaska’s enormous processing plants convert most of it into fillets for fish sticks or a paste called surimi, much of which is frozen in blocks and shipped off to Japan to be reconstituted into budget sushi. “By the time they’re done, it’s odorless, tasteless protein,” Dickrell said. In a century, the local economy had evolved from fur to war to king crab to fake crab.",

The stir of the pulses which his nearness always caused was increased by a slight sense of constraint.

But his greeting expressed no more than the satisfaction which every pretty woman expects to see reflected in masculine eyes; and the discovery, if distasteful to her vanity, was reassuring to her nerves. Between the relief of her escape from Trenor, and the vague apprehension of her meeting with Rosedale, it was pleasant to rest a moment on the sense of complete understanding which Lawrence Selden’s manner always conveyed.",

For she discovered that Edward Ashburnham was paying a blackmailer of whom she had never heard something like three hundred pounds a year … It was a devil of a blow; it was like death; for she imagined that by that time she had really got to the bottom of her husband’s liabilities. You see, they were pretty heavy. What had really smashed them up had been a perfectly commonplace affair at Monte Carlo—an affair with a cosmopolitan harpy who passed for the mistress of a Russian Grand Duke. She exacted a twenty thousand pound pearl tiara from him as the price of her favours for a week or so. It would have pipped* him a good deal to have found so much, and he was not in the ordinary way a gambler. He might, indeed, just have found the twenty thousand and the not slight charges of a week at an hotel with the fair creature. He must have been worth at that date five hundred thousand dollars* and a little over.",

Vendors came aboard, cheerful girls and youths offering vile fizzy drinks, sinister-looking striped sweets, split coconuts, grilled banana strips, sweet over-packaged buns, cellophane bags of sticky rice and Pa dae, grilled half-chickens cleverly herbed. I indulged in the last: it was tough but juicy and tasted of chicken. (How many Rich World citizens know what a real chicken tastes like?) Over the market the hammer-and-sickle flew high, as it did in Vientiane over the bus station and elsewhere. Not everyone was listening in 1991, when the Fifth Party Congress decided to replace it with a silhouette of That Luang.",

Until the Mass Trespass on Kinder Scout of 1932, led by Benny Rothman, access to the moors was restricted to wealthy sportsmen, and the land was patrolled by gamekeepers who would treat walkers as trespassers. These gamekeepers were also responsible for the culling of predators. Raptors, mustelids and other carnivores were killed in their tens of thousands, their deaths recorded dispassionately in the columns of game books.",

People could come for weekends to eat in stylish new seafront restaurants overlooking the bay and perhaps take in a play or concert at the Winter Gardens.

Here grazed scores of cows and calves (small-boned, short-horned) their shiny golden coats matching the stubble. During the dry season temporary bamboo fences confine each herd to its owner’s land. Before planting begins all cattle are moved up to the forest and left to their own devices (tigers being almost extinct) until the harvest is in. They then come down to calve, to dispose of the stubble and to fertilize the fields. I had been told that many herds don’t have to be fetched; the harvesting scents bring them down and they make their way to their owners’ houses. This is true, Mr Tang confirmed, if they are within olfactory reach of home – which often they are not. But now a system effective for millennia is being threatened by ‘development’ – those power tillers. Undeniably it is less strenuous to plough with a machine rather than an animal. However, to buy that machine you must sell twelve or fifteen cattle and to fuel and maintain it you must sell more cattle. Soon not enough are left to fertilize the land and the rest must be sold to pay for chemical fertilizers. When your herd is gone you still need to fuel and maintain your machine and regularly buy fertilizer.",

More horses’ legs have been worn out, more coachmen’s lives consumed, more hours of sound afternoon time vainly lavished than served to win us the battle of Waterloo, and pay for it into the bargain. The little demons are the source of as many reprieves, calamities, and anxieties as the battle itself. Sometimes Mrs Bonham has just gone out, at others she is at home. But, even if the cards should be superseded, which seems unlikely, there are unruly powers blowing life into storms, disordering sedulous mornings, and uprooting the stability of the afternoon—dressmakers, that is to say, and confectioners’ shops. Six yards of silk will cover one body; but if you have to devise six hundred shapes for it, and twice as many colours?—in the middle of which there is the urgent question of the pudding with tufts of green cream and battlements of almond paste. It has not arrived.",

None had the courage to be one thing rather than another. What dissolution of the soul you demanded in order to get through one day, what lies, bowings, scrapings, fluency and servility!

How you snatched from me the white spaces that lie between hour and hour and rolled them into dirty pellets and tossed them into the waste-paper basket with your greasy paws.

Their cache-sexes were made of fresh leaves; it’s very pretty to see them walking along, with the greenery bobbing in front. Their instinctive gesture, when a stranger passes or when talking to me, is to place a protecting hand over these leaves. Modesty is certainly a weird and various human quality. These ladies lined up alongside the car and at first I could not imagine what they were doing. They squatted, pointed, wriggled, stared and shook with laughter. Then I understood that they were looking at themselves in the dusty side of the Citröen, which was apparently the first mirror they had ever seen.",

During the winter he rented a little shack at one edge of the town’s public square, acquired a small stock of marbles, and set up business. But he had little to do at first save to think of the prospect of his death. During the bitter and lonely winter, while he thought he was dying, the gaunt scarecrow Yankee that flapped muttering through the streets became an object of familiar gossip to the townspeople. All the people at his boarding-house knew that at night he walked his room with great caged strides, and that a long, low moan that seemed wrung from his bowels quivered incessantly on his thin lips. But he spoke to no one about it.",

Fairbanks, under the impact of the pipeline, has become (in Willie Hensley’s word) “scroungy”—prostitutes, Texans, ticky-tacky. Maybe Alaska should take a more circumspect look before entering such arrangements again. This was the novel body of thought that helped to produce the 1974 election victory of Governor Jay Hammond —fisherman, homesteader, wilderness man. Hammond was hardly a fierce and fighting conservationist. Alaska had not molted. But Hammond’s prudent, balanced approach to things was an attempt to reconcile what his first Commerce Commissioner, Langhorne Motley, once called “the Sierra Club syndrome and the Dallas scenario.” In the ongoing debate about the new capital, among all the varied reasons for and against the move, those two strands were prominently braided.",

There was no sound of cropping, and no sound of wheels, but only the sudden roar of the wind letting its sails fill and brushing the tops of the grasses. One bone lay rain-pocked and sun-bleached till it shone like a twig that the sea has polished.

The town almost literally blew its brains out. Forty people shot themselves within ten days, and others did so later. And, as so often happens, many of those who destroyed themselves were among the least guilty of the lot. The rest--and this was the most shocking part of it--suddenly realising their devastating guilt to such a degree that they could not face the results of it, now turned like a pack of howling dogs to rend each other. Cries of vengeance rose up from all their throats, and they howled for the blood of Jarvis Riggs. But these cries proceeded not so much from a conviction of wounded justice and deceived innocence as from their opposites. It was the sublime, ironic, and irrevocable justice of what had happened to them, and their knowledge that they alone had been responsible for it, that maddened them. From this arose their sense of outrage and their cries of vengeance.",

I went out to the Palm Court, where songbirds in cages serenaded me as I took toast and tea for breakfast. The outlines of a charming, but rather antiquated, England reminded me of the time I visited my best friend’s grandmother in Cheltenham: a woman of immense wisdom and wit, but one I could more easily associate with the past than with any future.",

Tietjens had assumed the mask of his indolent, insolent self. At the office, but later, he had delivered an extraordinarily forceful—and quite rude—lecture to Sir Reginald on his reasons for differing from the official figures of population movement in the western territories. Sir Reginald had been much impressed. The figures were wanted for a speech of the Colonial Minister—or an answer to a question—and Sir Reginald had promised to put Tietjens’ views before the great man. That was the sort of thing to do a young fellow good—because it got kudos for the office. They had to work on figures provided by the Colonial Government, and if they could correct those fellows by sheer brain work—that scored.",

    "target_paragraph": "I remind GS of the Christian mystics such as Meister Eckhardt and Saint Francis, Saint Augustine, and Saint Catherine of Siena, who spent three years in silent meditation: “All the way to Heaven is Heaven,” Saint Catherine said, and that is the very breath of Zen, which does not elevate divinity above the common miracles of every day. GS counters by saying that all these people lived before the scientific revolution had changed the very nature of Western thought, which of course is true, but it is also true that in recent years, Western scientists have turned with new respect toward the intuitive sciences of the East. Einstein repeatedly expressed suspicion of the restrictions of linear thought, concluding that propositions arrived at by purely logical means were completely empty of reality even if one could properly explain what “reality” means; it was intuition, he declared, that had been crucial to his thinking. And there are close parallels in the theory of relativity to the Buddhist concept of the identity of time and space, which, like Hindu cosmology, derives from the ancient teachings of the Vedas. Somewhere, Einstein remarks that his theory could be readily explained to Indians of the Uto-Aztecan languages, which include the Pueblo and the Hopi. (“The Hopi does not say ‘the light flashed’ but merely ‘flash,’ without subject or time element; time cannot move because it is also space. The two are never separated; there are no words or expressions referring to time or space as separate from each other. This is close to the ‘field’ concept of modern physics. Furthermore, there is no temporal future; it is already with us, eventuating or ‘manifesting.’ What are in English differences of time are in Hopi differences of validity.”)21",

Sometimes I saw gray-beards simply gazing at a building in wonderment; sometimes I saw them gaping at the industrial-strength dimensions of an avenue. Often, I found them assembled in serene fascination on a sidewalk while a couple posed for a photo, or an Australian haggled with a vendor, or a Cadillac drove up to a foreigner’s hotel. Along the wide thoroughfares, rheumy-eyed old men led toddlers in peaked army caps by the hand, each as unsteady as the other, and each, so it seemed, as stunned by the new world around them.",

The idea of doing away with this awning, and revealing the bride to the mob of dressmakers and newspaper reporters who stood outside fighting to get near the joints of the canvas, exceeded even old Catherine's courage, though for a moment she had weighed the possibility. \"Why, they might take a photograph of my child AND PUT IT IN THE PAPERS!\" Mrs. Welland exclaimed when her mother's last plan was hinted to her; and from this unthinkable indecency the clan recoiled with a collective shudder. The ancestress had had to give in; but her concession was bought only by the promise that the wedding-breakfast should take place under her roof, though (as the Washington Square connection said) with the Wellands' house in easy reach it was hard to have to make a special price with Brown to drive one to the other end of nowhere.",
