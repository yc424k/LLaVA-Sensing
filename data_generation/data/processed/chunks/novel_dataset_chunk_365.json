It didn't matter; Dar es Salaam wasn't very urban anyway, and there was little traffic. The bar, a large shady room, was obviously popular. The bead curtain that shielded it from the view of passersby hardly ever stopped swinging from the time I went through it, late in the morning, until lunch. A procession of men passed in and out—small, swarthy men, mostly, who bore a sort of resemblance to George —but one or two Englishmen came in too. There seemed to be some Portuguese and Lebanese drinking beer at the tables, but most of the patrons were Greek. I had met some of these Greeks of East Africa before. Few of them had ever seen Greece, nor did they show any desire or curiosity to do so. They had been born in East Africa, or Cairo, or—in George's case—Istanbul. Their fathers and grandfathers had been traders, and so were they.",

The road ended at a decaying town with a sign by the levee: “Welcome to Historic Arkansas City.” Beside this stood plaques displaying grainy photographs of the great Mississippi flood of 1927, which had drowned the river port. Before that catastrophe, Arkansas City had boasted twelve thousand inhabitants and dozens of fine shops and hotels, even a sports arena that had hosted a Jack Dempsey bout. Now its name was a rueful joke. There was no city anymore, just a struggling community of a few hundred people and no commerce apart from a liquor store, Laundromat, and grocery. “History’s all we got left,” said an old man sitting by the levee. “Not much present and no future, not that I’ll live to see it.”",

The front doors of the private houses were mostly left open at this warm autumn time, no thought of umbrella stealers disturbing the minds of the placid burgesses. Hence, through the long, straight, entrance passages thus unclosed could be seen, as through tunnels, the mossy gardens at the back, glowing with nasturtiums, fuchsias, scarlet geraniums, “bloody warriors,” snapdragons, and dahlias, this floral blaze being backed by crusted grey stonework remaining from a yet remoter Casterbridge than the venerable one visible in the street. The old-fashioned fronts of these houses, which had older than old-fashioned backs, rose sheer from the pavement, into which the bow-windows protruded like bastions, necessitating a pleasing chassez-déchassez movement to the time-pressed pedestrian at every few yards. He was bound also to evolve other Terpsichorean figures in respect of door-steps, scrapers, cellar-hatches, church buttresses, and the overhanging angles of walls which, originally unobtrusive, had become bow-legged and knock-kneed.",

It was certainly no longer a vacation. What was I vacationing from? I had wangled a one-year leave of absence from the railroad, which had run out while we were in Kirra. Officially resigning my job as a trainman, and my precious seniority date—June 8, 1974—had been unexpectedly difficult emotionally. I still believed I would never find another job so satisfying and well paid. But it was done. I panicked sometimes, convinced I was wasting my youth, aimlessly wandering on the dark side of the moon while old friends, classmates, my peers, were building lives, careers, becoming adults back in America. I had wanted to be useful, somehow, to work, to write, to teach, to accomplish great things—what had happened to that? Yes, I had felt compelled, almost required, to take a big surf trip. But did it really need to last this long?",

They saw him plunge to house and shop, they saw him bent above his marbles, they saw him mould in his great hands – with curse, and howl, with passionate devotion – the rich texture of his home. They laughed at his wild excess of speech, of feeling, and of gesture. They were silent before the maniac fury of his sprees, which occurred almost punctually every two months, and lasted two or three days. They picked him foul and witless from the cobbles, and brought him home – the banker, the policeman, and a burly devoted Swiss named Jannadeau, a grimy jeweller who rented a small fenced space among Gant’s tombstones. And always they handled him with tender care, feeling something strange and proud and glorious lost in that drunken ruin of Babel. He was a stranger to them: no one – not even Eliza – ever called him by his first name. He was – and remained thereafter – ‘Mister’ Gant.",

This piqued the man’s interest, and Bartlett handed the loaded pistol to the boy and gestured for him to give it a try, pointing at a branch sticking out of the snow some thirty yards away. The boy raised the pistol to shoulder height, aimed, and fired—the blast echoing in the thin cold air. His shot split the branch in two and sent the dogs skittering. The boy and the man whispered quietly for a minute and finally came over nodding in agreement, leading a well-built little white dog to Bartlett. Old Whitey, now rested and perking up at all the activity, leaped from the sled. Kataktovik harnessed the new dog, which they named Colt in honor of the trade, and with five working dogs, they bore southeast across the tundra once more, with Whitey trotting along behind.",

The contract that Pipo and Cary had looked for never surfaced. “Oscar had no filing system, and you’re just as bad,” she lectured Pipo. Cary spent more time at the workshop, making the arduous trip there almost every day until, nearly exhausted, she limited herself to no more than three days a week. As more responsibility fell on her shoulders, she worried that her health would suffer the way it had when she was vice minister. The operation to replace her pacemaker had been delayed first two months, then six, then an entire year because of a shortage of pacemakers and confusion over how long the old one was supposed to last. Every time she went in for a checkup, doctors determined that her battery still had life and would function properly, as long as she didn’t get too excited. She took the delays in stride, certain that things would turn out all right for her. Good news can balance out troubles, and a month after Oscar left, the Jamaican embassy called to tell her that her citizenship had been granted. She didn’t feel any more Jamaican, or any less Cuban, but she was relieved that she had a backup plan in reserve and that it seemed to be working.",

A few fishermen were drinking beer at the bar; in a corner sat Andrews and Gertrud, beginning a necessarily inarticulate acquaintance over the hold-alls; both window and door were open, and the rain came down straight and steady, filling the place with a soft murmuring and dampness. Across the clearness of my first decision that the Professor must be an absolutely delightful person to be always with, had crept a slight film of doubt. There were some things about him that might possibly, I began in a dim way to see, annoy a wife. He seemed to love Charlotte, and he had seemed to be very fond of me—anyhow, never before had I been so much patted in so short a space of time. Yet the moment he caught sight of the Alsatian bow he forgot my presence and existence, forgot the fluster he had been in to get on after his wife, and attached himself to it with a vehemence that no one could be expected to like. A shadowy conviction began to pervade my mind that the sooner I handed him over to Charlotte and drove on again alone the better. Surely Charlotte ought to go back to him and look after him; why should I be obliged to drive round Rügen first with one Nieberlein and then with the other?",

In the clear air the highveld’s horizons induce a heady sense of freedom; no wonder the Voortrekkers, reaching this remote bright spaciousness, decided that here was their Promised Land and came so passionately to love it. Their descendants’ red-roofed farmsteads usually lie far back from the road, surrounded by stately spreading trees and dominated by the essential water-pump windmill, whirring against a deep blue sky.",

A cenotaph will be unveiled, situated with approximate probability on the site of the poet’s grave. This object, which is almost built, proved a pleasant surprise. A square cone, to be covered with white stone, stands on a broad flight of steps. In front of it lies a long pool, framed by lines of trees and announced by a pair of classical pavilions. Given the limitations of Oriental taste when confronted with a Western idea, the design is admirable. The Western part of it, the cenotaph, is as simple as can be; the Persian part, the garden, is beautiful as always; and the two are blended by good proportions. When the ceremonies are over, and only the tinkling goat-bells are heard again, the Firdaussi-lover may find a grateful peace in this unpretentious shrine.",

Referring to me as ‘aunty’ would normally have made me chuckle, but for some reason it seemed right. After four months and 79 train journeys, these trains had become my home and its passengers my family. I moved up to the window and looked out as Hyderabad began to slip from view. Beneath the sound of the wheels on the tracks was a softer grinding. Had it always been there? I realised that this was the last time I would watch the edges of a city slide from my vision and the thought bored a hollow into my stomach that filled with sadness. For once I did not reach for my iPod to drown it out, or flick open my book to distract my mind. I got up and went to find the only place where I knew I wanted to be.",

She also has lots of tales to tell which spices up the long rides in between sites. Our last stop is The Blackhouse in Arnol. You’d think that one Blackhouse would be much like another but not so. This one was inhabited by a crofting family until 1966. They moved out and the house was preserved as they left it. It feels like you are walking into someone’s home. The museum has done a nice job of rounding out the experience with information, including audios. I head towards the entrance. The animals live off to the right. I turn left. The peat fire is burning in the centre of the living area. A pot is hanging above it. The inside is smoky. It’s dark, too, since there are no windows. A lamp lights the inside showing a dresser with beautiful crockery on display. Because of the thick walls and restored roof, no wind enters. It’s quite snug and comfortable. A bed is in the corner. People used to gather here in the evenings and sing, dance, and tell stories…even though the ministers didn’t much like it. Sound familiar?",

He was wearing his fur cap, Ali Mohammed’s striped blue suit, sandals (Mr Butt had refused to lend his shoes again), and a pair of my socks. He did not have the retinue he would have liked, but no one else on the pilgrimage appeared to be travelling in comparable style. We did, after all, have a staff; and we had a second tent for the staff. And when, at sunset, we halted at the crowded camp in the smoking woods of Chandanwari, he not only managed by his swift, intelligent arrangements to create something like luxury in the midst of restrictions, but he also managed, by his mixture of bustle, of orders sharply given to the pony man and his assistant, and of reverential exaggerated attentions to us, to hedge us around with dignity. The camp was a chaos of tents and guy-ropes and cooking stones and pilgrims defecating behind every bush. The woods were already littered with uncovered excrement; hanks and twists of excrement crowned every accessible boulder of the Lidder River, beside which we had camped. But Aziz made us feel apart; he put us on show. This was his craft, his pride. And just as that morning when we set out from the hotel for Gulmarg he could not hide his pleasure, but had to tell everyone he passed on the lake that he was off to Gulmarg, so now, pouring warm water for me to wash my hands, he said, ‘Everybody asking me, “Who is your sahib?” ’ It was less a tribute to me than to himself.",

Traffic detoured onto narrow, temporary lanes that curved sharply while I guided a rig not less than 73 feet in length around what looked like impossible angles. Signs directed trucks to remain in the right lane. It soon became clear why. While we bumped along on these winding, temporary lanes, the trailers behind the truck’s cab flexed from side to side. Then another truck came along going our way in the left lane, the one for cars only. The other truck’s one long trailer moved side to side, just like our doubles did. The two rigs could easily bump each other or scrape one another down the sides along this detour that felt like a rollercoaster.",

There was no other sound, apart from the scuffling of my feet through dried leaves. At the bottom of the street, I came across the campus of Central College, a small institution run by the Dutch Reformed Church, with a campus of redbrick buildings overlooking a serpentine with an arching wooden footbridge. The whole place was as tranquil as a double dose of Valium. It looked like the sort of tidy, friendly, clean-thinking college that Clark Kent would have attended. I crossed the bridge and at the far side of the campus found further evidence that I was not the only living person in Pella. From an open window high up in a dormitory building came the sound of a stereo turned up far too loud. It blared for a moment – something by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, I believe – and then from someplace indiscernible there came a booming voice that said, ‘IF YOU DON’T TURN THAT THING THE FUCK OFF RIGHT NOW I’M GONNA COME OVER THERE AND POUND YOUR HEAD IN!’ It was the voice of a large person – someone, I fancied, with the nickname Moose. Immediately the music stopped and Pella slept again.",

He seemed to me then an engagingly simple author, verging on the naïve: an elegist for a rural England of ploughmen, hayricks and meadowsweet that was vanishing even as he wrote. It would take me nearly twenty years to understand how drastically limited this account of Thomas was. He is still often thought of as a pastoral poet, celebrating place and belonging, but I now see that his true subjects are disconnection, discrepancy and unsettledness. His poems are thronged with ghosts, dark doubles, and deep forests in which paths peter out; his landscapes are often brittle surfaces, prone to sudden collapse. While he was drawn to the romantic figure of the self-confident solitary walker, he was more interestingly alert to how we are scattered, as well as affirmed, by the places through which we move.",

He stopped a sweep in the village once and asked him to clean his chimney, repeating the one word, ‘Shilling—shilling.’ The sweep began to clean, but he couldn’t finish, in the airless room and the appalling stench. But the stench didn’t keep out the cold of a hard winter, and when a policeman broke in because no smoke had been seen from the chimney, he found Mr Charles Seitz frozen to death on his straw in the upper room. They didn’t care to undress him; he was so verminous that the fleas jumped on them from his wrists; they put round his shoulders the web with which coffins are lowered into the grave, and dragged him head first down the stairs. Then they crammed him quickly into his coffin, rags and all, and nailed him down. It was terrible weather for grave-diggers, the ground hard enough for an electric drill six inches down.",

Half-way to Novosibirsk, the Baraba steppe was once a place of exiles and Tartar nomads, crossed by a string of Cossack forts. Now wild geese and coots flew from the marshes over a glint of lakes fringed by salinated soil. Here and there the old collectives spread long white barns, but they looked uninhabited. The villages, too, were empty. Distance resolved them into the hamlets of Russian fairy-tale, where the witch Baba Yaga might appear, or a formation of swan-princesses fly in.\nIn four hundred miles we stopped only three times. I stared out to a faint, light horizon where the forest made charcoal lines. Occasionally a horseman watched his cattle, or a field of rapeseed broke into buttery flower. More often, for mile after mile, the late summer haze turned this into looking-glass country. Its water-smeared earth wobbled against the sky. All matter looked temporary and dissoluble, all liquid so silted that it was half-way to being earth. Yet a farmer beside me said that the summer rains had been too few, and I noticed how low the rivers dawdled in their banks, and how the shrubs were already taking on the burnish of autumn.\nWe were following the line eastward of the Trakt post road, the precursor of the Trans-Siberian, which by the 1760s stretched from the Urals to the Pacific. In those days the bone-crunching journey–by horse-cart or sleigh–might take a year. When Chekhov embarked on his long tarantas ride towards Sakhalin, coughing up blood and sinking deep into depression, it was raining day and night, the rivers flooded, the ferries groping back and forth in howling wind, and ice-floes on the move. Now, as we rumbled towards Novosibirsk, the largest city in Siberia, trains passed us every three minutes on the busiest freight line in the world, bringing coal from the Kuzbas basin to the smelting furnaces of the Urals.",

I had heard that everyone connected with foreign tourists was obliged to report to the KGB and taxi drivers, whose beat was the tourist hotels, were regular police informers. It is not my imagination that you feel you are living inside a spy thriller in Moscow; it is only that I am used to reading not living this atmosphere and it fussed me badly while resident foreigners’ nerves are better adjusted. With a big bottle of airport whisky, the manila envelope of clippings and orange marmalade, I walked in the Saharan sun searching for a safe non-reporting taxi. Again the driver could not find Mrs M.’s street in the outskirts far beyond the University. By day her building looked worse, a scabby cement box, five or six storeys high, one in a huge congeries of identical cement boxes, a recent housing development already in a marked state of disintegration. Not a tree, not a flower, scrub grass and wasteland.",

I had never seen such a downpour. The drops came down with a sharp sting. I tore off about twenty fronds. The effort wore me out, but I didn’t give up. I arranged the fronds so that they were closely overlapping one another across the poles. I covered every crack through which the rain might seep. I knew that it would take a thick layer to keep the wet out. The jungle outside was well flooded over, as if the end of the world were approaching.

    "target_paragraph": "Perhaps because Fedor was a Russian Jew, he had grown obsessed by the labour camps. His apartment was full of political journals and old samizdat. His mirrors hung by string. The kitchen was littered with empty Moldovan wine bottles, and mountaineering and caving equipment blocked the hall. His beard, I think, had grown by default, and the study of persecution, or perhaps something else, touched him with melancholy.\nIt was he who knew that in this city whose darker past had been casually destroyed, one of the chief transit camps survived as the barracks of security police. ‘They abandoned it five months ago. It’ll probably be bulldozed soon. Everything gets bulldozed here. Now it’s walled up of course.’ His soft eyes assessed me. ‘But I know a way in.’\nSo we returned to Transport Road where it dipped over a stream towards the northern mines. In a silent compound, ringed by cement walls and barbed wire, Fedor had found a crumbling hole. We squeezed through. On the far side, the snow showed no tracks. For a second we stood and stared, covered with cement dust. I wanted time to write down things, to remember. I was the first outsider to see this, he said, and would be the last. But we started furtively to run. Now when I scrutinise my dashed-off notes–their words jagged with cold–the place returns in violent snapshots.\nI remember the canteen (we crawled in under barred windows) which prisoners had painted with naive scenes in pastel tints: a dream of rural peace. Its floor sagged in a storm of crashed timber.\nI remember the dormitories, and the rooms where the prisoners (I imagined) had been issued their bombazine coats and wadded jackets.\nThen I remember Fedor pointing to the three-storeyed block in front. Where a door opened on stone steps, he tugged from his satchel some waders and some helmets strapped with lights, and we lowered outselves into a fetid darkness. Unfrozen water brimmed to our knees. Our words echoed and whispered. ‘This was the punishment block.’\nWe waded down its passageways as down a sewer. I lost count of the iron doors awash with stench, the grilles giving on to blackness. Each dungeon was still fixed with twin wooden platforms bound in iron, and might have held forty prisoners. There were twenty such chambers in the basement alone. Their walls were sheathed in ice. Prisoners here, said Fedor (he had known one), used to press the bodies of the dead against the walls to insulate themselves from the cold. In the stone they had scratched weakly, illegibly, with their spoons. ‘Ser…olenko…1952…Pant…’ Our lights faded over them. In these hopeless caverns, he said, most people died. His friend had survived because he had been young.\n‘What had he done?’ I asked.\n‘He didn’t know,’ Fedor said. ‘He lost his memory.’\nYou lost your memory easily in Kolyma, Shalamov wrote. It was more expendable than lungs or hands. In fact you did not need it at all.",

In this district of wide, almost deserted streets, often in the shadow of elevated motorways, the buildings were drab and featureless, all the shops shut – their windows massively protected – and an odd quietness prevailed. The few pedestrians were ill-clad Latinos, drifting around in small silent groups or slumped on pavement benches sharing bottles of something unlabelled. I paused beside a young seated couple feeding water to their baby from a half-naggin rum bottle with teat attached. Did they know of any nearby source of cerveza? For a moment they stared at me, expressionless. Then the young woman laughed, said something that made her partner smile and pointed to a nearby arcade, under a motorway. Within that long tunnel I saw three pot-bellied rats running across overhead struts. Two premises were open. In a dingy Cuban café, beneath flyblown tourist posters of Havana, threadbare, unshaven elderly men played dominoes. Opposite, in a large general store, Spanish-language newspapers and magazines filled the rack by the door and I was the only customer. My arrival seemed to be ignored by the young mulatto storekeeper but his eyes followed me and this displeased his small son, sitting on the counter; they had been playing some computer game. The little fellow wore his Sunday best, a military uniform with a row of medals across his chest. Beside him were a toy radio-telephone, gas-mask and machinegun. (Was he being groomed for another invasion of Cuba?) As US beer is drinkable only when unavoidable, I bought a European brew. Like many Cuban-Americans, the storekeeper spoke no English and didn’t even try to understand my halting Spanish.",
