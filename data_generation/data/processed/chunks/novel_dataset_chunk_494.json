These men were lords and captains on the sea, and they had given mortal tongue, and meters of mortal time, to timelessness. Yes! they made strong clocks strike sweetly out upon the ocean; they took the timeless, yearless sea and put the measure of their years upon it; they said, “In such-and-such a year we made this sea our own and took her for our ship and country.”",

I discovered Giovanni a few weeks after I’d arrived in Rome, thanks to that big Internet café at the Piazza Barbarini, across the street from that fountain with the sculpture of that sexy merman blowing into his conch shell. He (Giovanni, that is—not the merman) had posted a flier on the bulletin board explaining that a native Italian speaker was seeking a native English speaker for conversational language practice. Right beside his appeal was another flier with the same request, word-for-word identical in every way, right down to the typeface. The only difference was the contact information. One flier listed an e-mail address for somebody named Giovanni; the other introduced somebody named Dario. But even the home phone number was the same.",

I get lost everywhere I go, including Dublin, where I’ve lived the longest of anywhere.

Timing his move, Olivier gave me directions as I balked at our proximity while struggling to keep Tarzoon from jumping over to the meowing Mimine.

In the same way the change of season and the onset of the sledgehammer-heat of summer was exactly marked by another Hindu holiday—the spring festival of Holi.

    "target_paragraph": "Walking along a narrow muddy causeway by a little river overhung with willows, girls ahead of her in single file and girls in single file behind, Miriam drearily recognised that it was June. The month of roses, she thought, and looked out across the flat green fields. It was not easy to walk along the slippery pathway. On one side was the little grey river, on the other long wet grass repelling and depressing. Not far ahead was the roadway which led, she supposed to the farm where they were to drink new milk. She would have to walk with someone when they came to the road, and talk. She wondered whether this early morning walk would come, now, every day. Her heart sank at the thought. It had been too hot during the last few days for any going out at midday, and she had hoped that the strolling in the garden, sitting about under the chestnut tree and in the little wooden garden room off the saal had taken the place of walks for the summer.\nShe had got up reluctantly, at the surprise of the very early gonging. Mademoiselle had guessed it would be a “milk-walk.” Pausing in the bright light of the top landing as Mademoiselle ran downstairs she had seen through the landing window the deep peak of a distant gable casting an unfamiliar shadow—a shadow sloping the wrong way, a morning shadow. She remembered the first time, the only time, she had noticed such a shadow—getting up very early one morning while Harriett and all the household were still asleep—and how she had stopped dressing and gazed at it as it stood there cool and quiet and alone across the mellow face of a neighbouring stone porch—had suddenly been glad that she was alone and had wondered why that shadowed porch-peak was more beautiful than all the summer things she knew and felt at that moment that nothing could touch or trouble her again.\nShe could not find anything of that feeling in the early day outside Hanover. She was hemmed in, and the fields were so sad she could not bear to look at them. The sun had disappeared since they came out. The sky was grey and low and it seemed warmer already than it had been in the midday sun during the last few days.

Darrow was furthermore aware that, though the case of the other couple ought to have made his own less conspicuous, it was rather they who found a refuge in the shadow of his prominence. Madame de Chantelle, though she had consented to Owen's engagement and formally welcomed his betrothed, was nevertheless not sorry to show, by her reception of Darrow, of what finely-shaded degrees of cordiality she was capable. Miss Painter, having won the day for Owen, was also free to turn her attention to the newer candidate for her sympathy; and Darrow and Anna found themselves immersed in a warm bath of sentimental curiosity.",

Many of the prisoners were in for armed robbery, and many for trafficking and possession; these were the areas Madre had seen explode in her many years in the service. This prison was not austere, or even institutional; it was a small, modern community. We strolled between the buildings chatting politely and taking in impromptu and embarrassing visits to sewing and pottery groups, and as we crossed a garden in the sharp sunlight I asked Madre if she thought the government should exercise more responsibility towards the penal system.",

In between these two purposeful flights of stairs (which are at surprising, witty angles to each other) is a third, easily overlooked, bucolic, decorative flight of stairs that appears to curve into a hidden garden—a grace note. To the left of all these stairs there is a tiny garden, which brings us back to human scale. Without such gardens Rome would be a rock-hard place.",

The variables were truly variable. A light head-wind would die away and leave us rolling in a calm for forty-eight hours. Then a light head-wind would spring up, blow for three hours, and leave us rolling in another calm for forty-eight hours. Then—hurrah!—the wind would come out of the west, fresh, beautifully fresh, and send the Snark along, wing and wing, her wake bubbling, the log-line straight astern. At the end of half an hour, while we were preparing to set the spinnaker, with a few sickly gasps the wind would die away. And so it went. We wagered optimistically on every favourable fan of air that lasted over five minutes; but it never did any good. The fans faded out just the same.",

By then, late afternoon, the city had just stirred from its daylong slumber, and the Corniche was impassable. We had seen traffic all across Egypt, especially in Cairo. But Cairene traffic is heavy and thick – it moves in fits and starts. Not so in Alexandria. There, on that stretch of road between us and the beach, we watched as a million cars streaked by – six lanes across. We suddenly understood why the hotel offered a shuttle bus from the hotel to the beach – the beach across the street. Eventually, a delivery truck emerged from a side street next to the hotel. The driver rolled cautiously into traffic and then, for a brief moment, the traffic broke. We darted across the road, in the shadow of that truck, to the beach. Teresa looked at me. “Next time, we’ll take the shuttle bus,” she said.",

When Hector heard that my visa needed renewal he offered me a lift in his 1957 Buick and for twenty minutes we drove along tree-lined colonial streets to a residential area opposite a spacious park. In a bright airy office a cheerful young woman greeted Hector with a kiss, saw to his register, turned to me – and had a problem. My e-mail return ticket was invalido; I must produce a real airline ticket … With difficulty Hector persuaded her that e-mail tickets have become the norm outside of Cuba. Still looking perplexed, she gave me a chit authorising my purchase of a visa stamp at a specified bank far away in the centre. Poor Hector, who had a heavy cold, refused to desert me; happily there was no bank queue. Back at Immigration he stayed in the car while I endured a Santa Clara rerun. Holguin’s senior Immigration officer, an exceptionally nasty woman, pronounced that visas must be renewed within the forty-eight hours before expiry – confirming my suspicion that these ghouls make it up as they go along. Hector and Yamila were furious on my behalf.",
