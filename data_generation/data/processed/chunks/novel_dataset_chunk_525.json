I had never been afraid in the dark, and if I heard a sound I couldn’t place, it didn’t disturb me too much. Besides, Dig had always been there to protect and comfort me. But this? Ripples ran up and down my back. I got up and wandered around camp. Everything was perfectly still, but the noise was now a continuous unmodulated wail. I was beginning to recognize the first tell-tale signs of panic – this noise had to have a rational explanation. Either that, or I was going mad again, or some spirit was out to drive me that way. And then I felt the first stirrings of breeze. Of course, the noise I was hearing was the wind whistling through the top tips of the trees I was under. There had not been a breath of turbulence on the ground, but now the pre-dawn wind, that solid unflagging front of cool air, was chilling me to the bone and making the coals of the fire glow red. I crawled back into my swag shivering, and tried to get back to sleep. I would have given anything just then, to be able to hold that familiar warm dog flesh – the need was like a physical ache. Without her, I was suddenly susceptible to all those swamping, irrational feelings of vulnerability and dread.",

On the corner of the envelope was stamped The Hour. Vance’s hands turned cold. He stood for a few seconds looking at that portentous name; then he tore open the envelope and read: “Dear Sir, The editor of The Hour asks me to say that he will be glad to take your story, ‘One Day,’ though The Hour does not usually publish short stories. I enclose a cheque for $50.” There followed a vague secretarial signature, and underneath, untidily scrawled with a blunt pencil: “Better go back home and write more like it. Frenside.” Vance stood a long time motionless, the letter in his hand. At first he was not aware of any sensation at all; and when it did come it seemed too strong for joy. It was more as if he had been buffeted in a crowd and had the wind knocked out of him, as he had on the day when he and Upton fought their way to the Crans’ car after the ball game. . . .",

    "target_paragraph": "I wear a wetsuit and a weight-belt, and the result is that at the surface I float, and this is useful for relaxing in the minutes before a dive. After meditating and breathing slowly and deeply for a few minutes, I roll forward, push my feet into the air, and begin a vertical descent. As I swim slowly down through the clear green water and the bright yellow shaft of light, I alternately blow little puffs of air into my mask and then hold my nose and blow again, this time putting air into my inner ears. I do this continuously as I descend, so that I never feel any pressure on my face or in my ears, otherwise the air space in my inner ears and mask would decrease in size as the air compressed, creating severe pain in the ears and trying to pull my eyeballs out of my head into the mask.\nThe water is featureless as I descend, and there is nothing to see at all until I get about thirty feet down, where I begin to see a dark blackness down and to my right. I alter my course slightly toward it. Slowly it begins to take shape and at about sixty feet down I can see that it is the cave entrance. At about sixty feet, I become negatively buoyant, and thus sink without having to swim downward. This is because the air in my lungs has compressed to only one quarter of its volume at the surface.\nThe weight of a column of water thirty-three feet deep is the same as the weight of the column of air above a person standing at sea-level. Thus we call the pressure of water at thirty-three feet \"one atmosphere\". The pressure at one atmosphere of depth (33 feet) is double that on the surface, and thus the volume of air is compressed to half its volume on the surface. At a depth of sixty-six feet, air is compressed to one quarter of its volume on the surface.\nA flat rock wall above the cave comes into focus, and soon I am sitting on the sandy bottom, ninety feet deep. The cave entrance is in front of me. The initials of a few divers are carved into the rock. Although I could not see the bottom from the water's surface, I can clearly see the surface from here, a small bright green area with the legs of my dive-buddy Jenn poking into the water, the shaft of sunlight leading from there to me.\nI only sit here for a moment, taking in the view and storing it in my long-term memory, before standing, pushing off the bottom, and slowly swimming up toward the light and Jenn’s legs. As I ascend, the air in my lungs expands, and it feels like breathing in. Likewise the air that I pumped into my mask expands, and bubbles escape from its sides and join me for the trip to the surface, where it will rejoin the atmosphere and endlessly drift about the Earth, perhaps never returning to the Catfish Hotel. I might not return to the Catfish Hotel either, because after a few dives, I got out and eventually read the rest of the sign by the steps, which clearly said “no snorkeling, SCUBA diving only”.",

    "target_paragraph": "I spent one afternoon with Martha, a charming and elegant secondary-school teacher and a Charismatic Christian who ran a ‘support group’ for destitute AIDS patients. We went from hovel to hovel in an overcrowded shanty town where narrow, dusty, child-filled laneways twisted between suffocatingly hot tin-roofed shacks. Every face lit up when Martha appeared. As we sat beside the dying, holding their hands, Martha emphasised (and seemed herself to believe) that ‘Jesus has a special love for all you people with AIDS’. Then she prayed and sang hymns at length and emotionally, the patients’ eyes fixed humbly and gratefully on her ecstatic face. This was not my scene; in any environment, Charismatic Christianity switches me off. I caught myself going all ethnocentric and austerely deploring the mawkish humbug involved in claiming that Jesus has a special love for AIDS victims. Then I felt ashamed. Martha was comforting these most desolate of people, the majority rejected by their families. And in this case the end surely justified the means.",

For my part, I was fascinated by the exquisite grace and beauty of that fluted grove, crowned with pointed leaves and feathery heads, the lightness, the vigour, the charm as distinct as a voice of that unperplexed luxuriating life. I remember staying to look at it for a long time, as one would linger within reach of a consoling whisper. The sky was pearly grey.

It did not matter; there is no distance in either space or geography, no prolongation of time for distance to exist in, no muscular fatigue to establish its accomplishment. They are moving not toward a destination in space but a destination in time, toward the pinnacle-keep of evening where morning and afternoon become one; the sleight hand of May shapes them both, not in the immediate, the soon, but in the now as, facing her, braced against the pull of the rope, he speaks to her implacable and compelling while she tugged back, shaking her head against the rope and bellowing. She had been doing this for the last half hour, drawn backward and barnward by the discomfort of her bag. But he held her, slacking the rope gradually until his other hand touched her, first her head then her neck, speaking to her until the resistance went out of her and she moved on again. They were in the hills now, among pines. Although the afternoon wind had fallen, the shaggy crests still made a constant murmuring sound in the high serene air. The trunks and the massy foliage were the harps and strings of afternoon; the barred inconstant shadow of the day’s retrograde flowed steadily over them as they crossed the ridge and descended into shadow, into the azure bowl of evening, the windless well of night; the portcullis of sunset fell behind them. At first she would not let him touch her bag at all. Even then she kicked him once, but only because the hands were strange and clumsy. Then the milk came down, warm among his fingers and on his hands and wrists, making a thin sharp hissing on the earth.",

She slipped the chain on to his collar and, for the first time since September 1846, they walked up Wimpole Street together. When they came to the door of No. 50 they stopped as of old. Just as of old they waited. The butler just as of old was very slow in coming. At length the door opened. Could that be Catiline lying couched on the mat? The old toothless dog yawned and stretched himself and took no notice. Upstairs they crept as stealthily, as silently as once before they had come down. Very quietly, opening the doors as if she were afraid of what she might see there, Mrs Browning went from room to room. A gloom descended upon her as she looked. ‘… they seemed to me’, she wrote, ‘smaller and darker, somehow, and the furniture wanted fitness and convenience.’ The ivy was still tapping on the back bedroom window-pane. The painted blind still obscured the houses. Nothing had been changed. Nothing had happened all these years. So she went from room to room, sadly remembering. But long before she had finished her inspection, Flush was in a fever of anxiety. Suppose Mr Barrett were to come in and find them? Suppose that with one frown he turned the key and locked them in the back bedroom for ever? At last Mrs Browning shut the doors and went downstairs again very quietly. Yes, she said, it seemed to her that the house wanted cleaning.",

We walked through the bazaars in imminent danger of encountering a mini-avalanche, while piles of shifted snow, eight or ten feet high, blocked many passageways. Today’s foraging was rewarded by a pound of hairy goat’s butter which greatly improves the dog-biscuits. A daily forage is well worthwhile because small quantities of food trickle into the bazaars at irregular intervals. The weather has made most approach tracks to Skardu impassable, so the price of firewood has gone up to Rs.60 a maund. The price of kerosene has followed suit, and also the price of a cup of tea in the chia-khanas, where all cooking is done on wood-stoves. While taking a short cut from the Old to the New Bazaar I saw a frozen corpse in a disused hovel; every winter there are a shocking number of deaths from exposure in Skardu town.",

Then, as we walked along the military road on the mountain-side, we saw below, on the top of the lemon gardens, long, thin poles laid from pillar to pillar, and we heard the two men talking and singing as they walked across perilously, placing the poles. In their clumsy zoccoli they strode easily across, though they had twenty or thirty feet to fall if they slipped. But the mountain-side, rising steeply, seemed near, and above their heads the rocks glowed high into the sky, so that the sense of elevation must have been taken away. At any rate, they went easily from pillar-summit to pillar-summit, with a great cave of space below. Then again was the rattle and clang of planks being laid in order, ringing from the mountain-side over the blue lake, till a platform of timber, old and brown, projected from the mountain-side, a floor when seen from above, a hanging roof when seen from below. And we, on the road above, saw the men sitting easily on this flimsy hanging platform, hammering the planks. And all day long the sound of hammering echoed among the rocks and olive woods, and came, a faint, quick concussion, to the men on the boats far out. When the roofs were on they put in the fronts, blocked in between the white pillars withhold, dark wood, in roughly made panels. And here and there, at irregular intervals, was a panel of glass, pane overlapping pane in the long strip of narrow window. So that now these enormous, unsightly buildings bulge out on the mountain-sides, rising in two or three receding tiers, blind, dark, sordid-looking places.",

How are you. One two three.” Luc laughed and, in a fit of adolescent energy, sprinted to a pile of the red dirt and tried to do a backflip.

Two teenage boys in black hoodies and baseball caps dismounted and joined the line of spectators at the railing; they clearly were old enough to drive a scooter, but not quite old enough to have fallen out of love with Sinterklaas. As the children around them sang songs, one of the boys reached into his pocket and removed a clear plastic bag of crushed green leaves. His friend produced a packet of cigarette papers and they squatted out of the breeze to roll a joint. The parents and children around them looked unconcerned. A policeman approached, tall and faintly menacing in a boxy black jacket, with a hexagonal black hat perched on his head and a squawking radio on his lapel. One hand resting on his pistol, he stopped abruptly and glared down at the boys, who were carefully twisting the ends of a large cone-shaped roll-up. ‘Goeiemorgen, jongens,’ the policeman intoned, wishing them a good morning in a voice dripping with what sounded to me like sarcasm. ‘Goeiemorgen, meneer,’ they replied. ‘Good morning, sir.’ I braced myself for an arrest, an argument, or perhaps an exciting chase over the bridge. But the policeman was already gone, marching away in search of a real crime to prevent. Rolling a joint in public, even at a family event, was barely worth noticing.",

Gillian hoisted him up the mast in the boson’s chair to the spreaders, and he attached the two blocks (pulleys) – one for each spinnaker pole. He also attached the small pullies he had bought for the lazy jacks. Having two spinnaker poles would allow him to pole out the staysail and the Genny or the Genny and the spinnaker. The lazy jacks would help to capture the main as it was lowered. He knew the Pacific run was going to be downwind and that it was essential to be able to pole out both sails but, more importantly, control both poles. With both poles having topping lifts and downward fore and aft control lines, the poles would essentially be locked in place. There was nothing more dangerous on the foredeck than a spinnaker pole flying around. He knew people that had been hit by them, and it wasn’t pretty. He was going to be up on the foredeck solo and couldn’t afford to take any chances.",

There are strange birds as well, no fewer than seventy species, including many endemics, feathered beauties that with all of Colombia to choose from, elect to live out their evolutionary destinies in the confines of an ecological island almost never dampened by rain. So clear and constant are the skies over the Tatacoa that it has long been the site of an astronomical observatory, a lens to the heavens. In the evening, as the sun goes down, warm winds blow off the distant mountains. The entire landscape is bathed in soft lavender light, and the Tatacoa becomes, according to local lore, a gathering place of ghosts.",

The sight of people pawing his plane or leaning on it or waggling its moving parts was naturally horrifying to Lindbergh. He now essentially fled. Within moments of people coming forward, he was in the plane and proceeding with it onto the beach, trusting that people would scatter as he advanced. Luckily, they did. Lindbergh taxied to the far end of the beach, turned the plane into the wind, and raced forward. “It moved smoothly over the sand and in no distance at all?hardly more than a hundred yards?it was in the air,” wrote White. “He tipped and banked and turned swooping low over the beach then rose like a silver winged bird against the blue sky.” Thirty minutes later he was in Portland and facing new hordes of people whose most earnest desire was to crowd in on him and his beloved craft.",

I decided to spend the night there, on the narrow crest, sixteen hundred feet below the summit. The evening sky was cold and cloudless. I could see all the way to tidewater and beyond. At dusk I watched, transfixed, as the lights of Petersburg blinked on in the west. The closest thing I’d had to human contact since the airdrop, the distant lights triggered a flood of emotion that caught me off guard. I imagined people watching baseball on television, eating fried chicken in brightly lit kitchens, drinking beer, making love. When I lay down to sleep, I was overcome by a wrenching loneliness. I’d never felt so alone, ever.",

The club was a three-level converted antiques shop. There was still a huge array of old, cool stuff everywhere, and there were thousands of gorgeous people of all ages eating, drinking, and dancing.

I stood aside, but they stopped, facing me. His gaze was bent on the ground at his feet; the girl, erect and slight on his arm, stared sombrely beyond my shoulder with black, clear, motionless eyes. “Schrecklich,” he murmured. “Terrible! Terrible! What can one do?” He seemed to be appealing to me, but her youth, the length of the days suspended over her head, appealed to me more; and suddenly, even as I realised that nothing could be said, I found myself pleading his cause for her sake. “You must forgive him,” I concluded, and my own voice seemed to me muffled, lost in un irresponsive deaf immensity. “We all want to be forgiven,” I added after a while.",

    "target_paragraph": "But Mark trained for big waves with a joyful masochism. One morning I found myself standing on the embankment at Quintara, watching him try to paddle out. The surf was eight-feet-plus, ragged, relentless, onshore, with no visible channels. Even the trough was not in evidence. Getting out looked impossible, and the waves looked not worth the effort anyway, but Mark was out there still, a small black-wetsuited figure in a world of furious whitewater, throwing himself into the stacked walls of onrushing foam. Each time he seemed to be making headway, a new set would appear on the horizon, bigger than the last and breaking farther out—the biggest waves were breaking maybe two hundred yards from shore—and drive him back into the impact zone. Watching with me was Tim Bodkin, a hyrdrogeologist, surfer, and Mark’s next-door neighbor. Bodkin was getting a huge kick out of Mark’s ordeal. “Forget it, Doc!” he kept shouting into the wind, and then he would laugh. “He’s never going to make it. He just won’t admit it.” At times we lost sight of him altogether. The waves rarely gave him a chance even to clamber onto his board and paddle; mostly he was underwater, diving under waves, swimming seaward along the bottom, dragging his board behind him. After thirty minutes, I began to worry: the water was cold, the surf was powerful. Bodkin, aglow with schadenfreude, did not share my concern. Finally, after about forty-five minutes, there was a brief lull. Mark scrambled onto his board and paddled furiously, and within three minutes he was outside, churning over the crests of the next set with five yards to spare. Once he was safely beyond the surf, he sat up on his board to rest, a black speck bobbing on a blue, windblown sea. Bodkin, disgusted, left me alone on the embankment.",

She was like a Luini madonna, mixed of holiness and seduction, the world and heaven. He held her with reverent care, as one who would not come too near, who would not break a sacred image. Her exquisite and subtle perfume stole through him like a strange whisper, pagan and divine. He was afraid to touch her – and his hot palm sweated to her fingers.",

    "target_paragraph": "When finally I excused myself, at 2:30 a.m., all the partygoers looked decidedly surprised. Outside, the streets were so crowded I could hardly walk. I stopped by my local café, but every one of the thirty or so tables was taken. People buzzed around a kiosk selling the latest issue of House & Garden and Mad. The streets of Recoleta at 3:00 a.m., in fact, were like the runway at some fashion show: one never-ending parade of long-legged, long-haired Dominique Sanda beauties, some of them dressed as nuns, some with stars on their foreheads, all done up in black leather microskirts and flawless makeup. I felt as if I were walking through the pages of Italian Vogue.",
