Then he handed me a large twenty-four-page booklet in Russian, amply illustrated with twenty-six diagrams; the first showed a naked man standing beside my bicycle-to-be, measuring his legs against the wheels. Now came my graphic gestures, conveying horror and despair. The young man shrugged impatiently and produced a formidable document – five foolscap pages, hideously resembling an income tax return form. Presenting me with this sheaf, his manner suggested that now my problem was solved.",

The best hotels in Reykjavik offer little more than a bed, perhaps a TV, and a Bible in Icelandic (with a separate New Testament in German, French, and English); in rural areas, visitors generally stay in boarding schools. The museum in Akranes, the finest I saw in the country, displays a dentist’s drill. On Saturday nights, couples in cocktail dresses and suits munch on sheep’s heads, ram’s testicles, reindeer, and ptarmigan; Auden and MacNeice gnawed, less happily, on “half-dry, half-rotten shark.” One Westman Islander told me that during the terrible volcano eruption of 1973, he went with his grandmother to the harbor, just in time to see the last fishing boat fleeing to the mainland. “Oh, well,” the grandmother said as lava poured toward her, about to bury five hundred houses, “the last boat’s gone. Let’s go home and have a coffee.”",

On a clear day the colour scheme of the glacier bowl – red rock, blue sky, white ice – is as bright and defined as the tricolore itself. Most of the aiguilles have names. There is Le Grand Capucin – The Great Monk – who keeps a silent ministry beneath his habit of brown rock, and La Dent du Géant – The Giant’s Tooth – which angles upwards like a caffeine-stained fang, or a 600-foot version of the accent that tops its name. People climb the aiguilles. Walking along the glacier, you can often see a tiny speck of red or white stuck into a seam on one of the rock faces, thousands of feet up.",

Early in the afternoon they had gone out in the motor, traversing miles of sober-tinted landscape in which, here and there, a scarlet vineyard flamed, clattering through the streets of stony villages, coming out on low slopes above the river, or winding through the pale gold of narrow wood-roads with the blue of clear-cut hills at their end. Over everything lay a faint sunshine that seemed dissolved in the still air, and the smell of wet roots and decaying leaves was merged in the pungent scent of burning underbrush. Once, at the turn of a wall, they stopped the motor before a ruined gateway and, stumbling along a road full of ruts, stood before a little old deserted house, fantastically carved and chimneyed, which lay in a moat under the shade of ancient trees. They paced the paths between the trees, found a mouldy Temple of Love on an islet among reeds and plantains, and, sitting on a bench in the stable-yard, watched the pigeons circling against the sunset over their cot of patterned brick. Then the motor flew on into the dusk...",

Just beneath it stood the photograph of Lily Bart, looking out imperially on the cheap gim-cracks, the cramped furniture of the little room. Could Selden picture her in such an interior? Gerty felt the poverty, the insignificance of her surroundings: she beheld her life as it must appear to Lily. And the cruelty of Lily’s judgments smote upon her memory. She saw that she had dressed her idol with attributes of her own making. When had Lily ever really felt, or pitied, or understood? All she wanted was the taste of new experiences: she seemed like some cruel creature experimenting in a laboratory.",

None had any link with a political party; Natal Pamphlet Distributors had hired them for that reason. A local Inkatha chief told them no voting would be allowed in kwaZulu and ordered their deaths – after some two hours of torture. One 19-year-old, aptly named Lucky Mkhwanazi, escaped by feigning death after his head had been hacked with a panga and two of his fingers shot off. It took him forty-eight hours to walk the fifty miles back to Durban; no one would stop to give him a lift. When Natal Pamphlet Distributors reported the team’s disappearance on Monday evening the KZP refused to investigate. The bodies were found only at noon on Tuesday, by a special Pretoria-based SAP unit. Thanks to Lucky’s evidence, the chief and five other men are now in jail. Had he not survived, no one would have been arrested. It’s easy to get away with murder in kwaZulu/Natal.",

Perhaps it was healthy to forget her poor; with all the greater gusto would she go back to them. But it couldn't be healthy to forget her prayers, and still less could it be healthy not to mind.",

The brick walkway was shaded with tamarind and banyan trees, and scorpions waited under the fallen leaves, their tails arched upwards, like miniature dragons. On the top of the ridge the path wound past sleepy monasteries hidden behind moss-covered walls. The old buildings were topped with layers of rusting corrugated-iron roofs, and the walls were painted a deep orange, the colour of bruised peaches. I had removed my shoes to enter the pagoda grounds, and my feet crunched over a coarse sand of crumbled plaster that had slid from the walls. Scruffy stray dogs were curled up in damp, shady corners, and I saw groups of monks kneeling at their morning meal inside unlit teak structures.",

This is much more fun than the tunnel-and-cutting system.",

Though the regular trades, which blow for nine months of the year, have not yet set in, and the mercury stands at 80°, there is no sultriness; a sea breeze and a mountain breeze fan the town, and the purple nights, when the stars hang out like lamps, and the moon gives a light which is almost golden, are cool and delicious. Roughly computed, the annual mean temperature is 75° 55', with a divergence in either direction of only 7° 55'. As a general rule the temperature is cooler by four degrees for every thousand feet of altitude, so that people can choose their climate to suit themselves without leaving the islands.",

Being rich white Americans in dirt-poor places where many people, especially the young, yearned openly for the life, the comforts, the very opportunities that we, at least for the seemingly endless moment, had turned our backs on—well, it would simply never be okay. In an inescapable way, we sucked, and we knew it, and humility was called for. But we had different ways of interpreting this obligation. Bryan’s conservative instincts thrilled, I thought, to the heavy patriarchy of the Samoan chief system. My romanticism, meanwhile, filled village social interactions with a prelapsarian warmth and psychic health.",

For scientific classification I have little mind; it does not happen to fall in with my habits of thought; but I like to be able to give its name (the \"trivial\" by choice) to every flower I meet in my walks. Why should I be content to say, \"Oh, it's a hawkweed\"? That is but one degree less ungracious than if I dismissed all the yellow-rayed as \"dandelions.\" I feel as if the flower were pleased by my recognition of its personality. Seeing how much I owe them, one and all, the least I can do is to greet them severally. For the same reason I had rather say \"hawkweed\" than \"hieracium\"; the homelier word has more of kindly friendship.",

In time, the planet too may ascend again into life. Every major extinction event on the planet has been succeeded by a burst of evolutionary creativity: rapid diversification as heretofore insignificant species take on the roles left empty by those wiped out by meteor or climate change or supervolcano. Should half the world’s species be wiped out, new creatures will grow up in their place. But it could take a million years or more.

The French contributed a few wide boulevards and many spacious villas, some now decrepit, others recently restored by or for expats. Vietnamese shophouses survive between the Soviet contributions to the commercial district – grim and grey, with flat roofs and façades dismally damp-mottled. In contrast, the numerous renovated wats are colourful: sometimes excessively so. Many old wooden houses on stilts – traditional Lao dwellings – are separated from the streets by dikes in which variegated scraps of litter float on stagnant green water. Malodorous open drains, crossed by wobbly plank footbridges, are to be smelt within yards of the wide Parisian Boulevard Lan Xang. After a few days, one realizes that this capital is in fact an amalgamation of villages – as is London – each centred on its wat.",

Whereas the camp I had worked for in South Africa was made of brick and mortar and connected to the outside world by decent (if dirt) roads and had luxuries like a telephone line, my new home in Botswana was reachable only by air, communicated with the outside world by a crackly radio, and was built out of timber and canvas. In my first year, through a combination of bravado and greenness, I got the experience I was after?and maybe a little more knowledge. Living among wild animals ensured that I would also have adventure. What I hadn’t predicted is what sort of animal would provide most of it.",

There was much to ponder: the location of the Alaska and the Mary Sachs, which he hadn’t seen since leaving Nome; the fate of the Karluk, for he feared she must have drifted in this storm; the fate of the entire enterprise, for that matter.

The tracks reach half the length of the spit to a narrow roundabout where, beneath the protective gaze of a white Madonna perched on a cement pole, everyone gets off to wander. Small children, impeccably dressed, dart about like butterflies. Teenage girls, in tight jeans and tank tops sparkling with rhinestones, defy gravity as they delicately make their way on high heels further down the jetty, tiptoeing among the stones and twisted remnants of the rail tracks. Older women search in vain for shade, settling for a cold drink, perhaps a raspado, a cone of shaved ice drenched in syrup.",

Then Hassan joined the party, driving his little flock home and staggering under a load of ‘grass’ as big as himself. He was finding it hard to manage his heavy shovel, too, and to keep pace with his flock, so I took the shovel over my shoulder and Rachel went bounding ahead of us down the path, shouting Balti swear words at any sheep who showed an inclination to stray from the straight and narrow. (Actually it was crooked and narrow.) The sun still shone warm on our side of the valley and in places the path had become a shallow stream. Twice I slipped and sat down hard, reducing our companions to paroxysms of mirth. My pidgin Balti provoked more laughter and when we were joined by the singing goatherd his obstreperous animals occasioned further mirth by repeatedly trying to steal from Hassan’s load. One could not wish for more accepting, heart-warming companionship. As I deposited Hassan’s shovel outside his home Rachel received three precious little pears from a gnarled and half-blind but very gracious grandad.",

This was the only hotel on miles of wide white sand beach and now, past the high season, it was nearly empty.

Herds of feral horses (mustangs, brumbies, criollos, and so on) move freely across the rangelands of Australia and the Americas. Feral pigeons hobble knock-kneed in city streets. Feral swine cause chaos in the rural American South. Feral dogs snap at heels and scavenge for scraps in urban badlands. This word feral has complicated connotationsthat of viciousness, unkemptness. A certain impurity of nature.",

The three-sided Principal Temple is the most monolithic structure at Machu Picchu. Constructed of gigantic precision-cut stones, it seems to have been built by an entirely different race of people from those who assembled the Torreon. The blocks are so heavy that one corner of the building, behind the massive stone altar, is slowly sinking into the ground. Just a few steps beyond its open side, terraces staircase steeply down the mountainside for a couple hundred feet before dropping off into an abyss. The power plant was down there somewhere, invisible. In The Motorcycle Diaries, Che Guevara wrote about playing a freewheeling game of soccer when he arrived for a life-changing visit to Machu Picchu. It had sounded romantic when I read about it in my early twenties. As I looked over the edge, it seemed suicidal.",

Through the avenues of Bombay stream sadhus and shamans, bullock carts and cows, rickshaws, rusty Ambassadors, turbaned men and veiled women, three-legged dogs, two-toed beggars, buses and bicycles and rites and sights and more people, more soldiers, more cows. Bleeding into this pandemonium is the confusion of the temples—not, as a rule, havens of meditation and quiet, but the Indian compendium all over again, a bombardment of sights and sounds and smells, monkeys, flames, chants, offerings, holy men, pilgrims, wonder-workers, musicians, more rites, more sights, more people. The streets of India are swollen with an embarrassment of riches, a richness of embarrassments. And it is on the streets that millions live, make love, defecate, and die.",

By not looking over the stair-rail, this would be true. Jesuitical? Perhaps. But the picture of him escorting Manby through the streets, Manby who, last time they met, put his hat on for him and would, he had no doubt, have wiped his tears away into the bargain if he hadn't rushed out of the house in time, was too hotly humiliating for him to care. When a man is thrust into such a position, he must use what weapons he can to get out of it. It wasn't his fault that he was in it; it was Fanny's. Fanny had thrust him in, with her orders and her high-handed interference. From the first day he met her to the day she cast him forth she had caused nothing but trouble; and now, after ten years of working out his salvation in Bethnal Green and slowly forgetting her, here she was again, and here again, immediately, was trouble.",

So, too, the past became as real as the present, and he lived in the events of twenty years ago with as much intensity and as great a sense of actuality as if they had just occurred. He felt that there was no temporal past or present, no now more living than any reality of then; the fiction of temporal continuity was destroyed, and his whole life became one piece with the indestructible unity of time and destiny.",
