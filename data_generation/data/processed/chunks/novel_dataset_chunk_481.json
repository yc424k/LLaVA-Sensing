Giles knew nothing of legal procedure, but he did know that for him to step up to Grace as a lover before the bond which bound her was actually dissolved was simply an extravagant dream of her father’s overstrained mind. He pitied Melbury for his almost childish enthusiasm, and saw that the ageing man must have suffered acutely to be weakened to this unreasoning desire.",

Leaving them to it, I rounded a corner and entered the neighbouring Catholic Basilica through a doorway decorated with scores of small stone statues, lined up along the overlapping door frames like repeating reflections in a house of mirrors. Beyond the entrance was a low vaulted passageway running along three sides of a pretty internal courtyard, with large arched windows offering views of the neatly trimmed trees and fountain within. It reminded me of the Cambridge college where I had, as a nervous eighteen-year-old, been interviewed for a place to study Economics, and rejected when it became clear I didn’t know what inflation was.",

Thus her days. Man became amphibious and lived in mud and filth and died and was buried in it; the world looked on in hysterical amazement. But she, within her walled and windless garden, thought of them only with a sober and pointless pity, like a flower’s exhalation, and like the flower, uncaring if the scent be sensed or not. She gave clothing and money to funds, and she knitted things also, but she did not know where Saloniki was and was incurious as to how Rheims or Przemysl were pronounced.",

Then he saw the German aeroplane too, watched it fly arrow-straight and apparently not very fast, enclosed by the pocking of white British archie which paced it, back across No-man’s Land, the three S.E.’s in their pocking of black hun archie zooming and climbing and diving at the German; he watched one of them hang on the German’s tail for what must have been a minute or two, the two aircraft apparently fastened rigidly together by the thin threads of tracer. And still the German flew steadily and sedately on, descending, descending now even as it passed over him and the battery behind—near—which he lurked opened on it in that frenzy of frantic hysterical frustration common to archie batteries; descending, vanishing just above the trees, and suddenly he knew where: the aerodrome just outside Villeneuve Blanche, vanishing sedately and without haste downward, enclosed to the last in that empty similitude of fury, the three S.E.5’s pulling up and away in one final zoom; and, as if that were not enough to tell him what he had to do, he saw one of them roll over at the top of its loop and, frozen and immobile, watched it in its plan as it dove, rushed straight down at the battery itself, its nose flicking and winking with the tracer which was now going straight into the battery and the group of gunners standing quietly about it, down and down past what he would have thought was the instant already too late to save itself from crashing in one last inextricable jumble into the battery, then levelling, himself watching the rapid pattering walk of the tracer across the intervening ground toward him until now he was looking directly into the flicking wink and the airman’s helmeted and goggled face behind and above it, so near that they would probably recognise one another if they ever saw each other again—the two of them locked in their turn for a moment, an instant by the thin fiery thread of a similitude of death (afterward he would even remember the light rapid blow against his leg as if he had been tapped rapidly and lightly once by a finger), the aeroplane pulling level and with a single hard snarling downward blast of air, zooming, climbing on until the roaring whine died away, he not moving yet, immobile and still frozen in the ravelling fading snarl and the faint thin sulphur-stink of burning wool from the skirt of his tunic.",

A rich warm wind was blowing, turning all the leaves back the same way, and making mellow music through all the lute-strings of flower and grass and fruit. The wind moaned, not with the mad fiend-voice of winter in harsh boughs, but like a fruitful woman, deep-breasted, great, full of love and wisdom; like Demeter unseen and hunting through the world. A dog bayed faintly in the cove, his howl spent and broken by the wind. A cowbell tinkled gustily. In the thick wood below them the rich notes of birds fell from their throats straight down, like nuggets. A woodpecker drummed on the dry unbarked bole of a blasted chestnut-tree. The blue gulf of the sky was spread with light massy clouds: they cruised like swift galleons, tacking across the hills before the wind, and darkening the trees below with their floating shadows.",

One end of the rainbow rises up from the lush vegetation; the other end stops just off our starboard side.

It was less than three weeks to Christmas; every afternoon after school and all day Saturday he was either in the Square or where he could see it, watch it. It was cold for another day or two, then it got warm, the wind softened then the bright sun hazed over and it rained yet he still walked or stood about the street where the store windows were already filling with toys and Christmas goods and fireworks and colored lights and evergreen and tinsel or behind the steamy window of the drugstore or barbershop watched the country faces, the two packages—the four two-for-a-quarter cigars for Lucas and the tumbler of snuff for his wife—in their bright Christmas paper in his pocket, until at last he saw Edmonds and gave them to him to deliver Christmas morning. But that merely discharged (with doubled interest) the seventy cents; there still remained the dead monstrous heatless disc which hung nightly in the black abyss of the rage and impotence: If he would just be a nigger first, just for one second, one little infinitesimal second: so in February he began to save his money—the twenty-five cents his father gave him each week as allowance and the twenty-five cents his uncle paid him as office salary—until in May he had enough and with his mother helping him chose the flowered imitation silk dress and sent it by mail to Molly Beauchamp, care of Carothers Edmonds R.F.D. and at last he had something like ease because the rage was gone and all he could not forget was the grief and the shame; the disc still hung in the black vault but it was almost a year old now and so the vault itself was not so black with the disc paling and he could even sleep under it as even the insomniac dozes at last under his waning and glareless moon. Then it was September; school would begin in another week. He came home one afternoon and his mother was waiting for him.",

He took an immaculate handkerchief from his breast pocket and wiped his face carefully with it and Wilbourne noticed too that the morning breeze from the sea had dropped, gone on, as if the bright still cumulus-stippled bowl of sky and earth were an empty globe, a vacuum, and what wind there was was not enough to fill it but merely ran back and forth inside it with no schedule, obeying no laws, unpredictable and coming from and going nowhere, like a drove of bridleless horses in an empty plain. Rittenmeyer went to the door and rattled it, not looking back. The jailor appeared and unlocked the door. He was not going to look back. “You’ve forgotten the money,” Wilbourne said.

The prohibition on reproducing the human form that Mohammed was later to impose on all Muslims still affects a billion people today, and it is fascinating to see the roots of that unease – a feeling that to depict man, to erect graven images, was somehow pagan and obscene – clearly apparent in these mosaics. Certainly the exuberance and vivacity of late antique and early Christian work – the crowding of living forms, of horsemen and their quarry, leaping lions, fleeing gazelles, the Emperor and his consorts, even the querulous saints and the prophets of the Ravenna baptistries – have already given way to a cold, carpet-like abstraction.

This is in part because the bottom of Snake Eyes at times intersects the bottom of the river, which is shallow at many of the riffles. The hull has become so abraded in places that it has developed leaks. The Grumman canoe is wider, longer, more heavily loaded. It carries at least half of all our gear. Nonetheless, it rides higher, draws less water, than Snake Eyes. Fortunately, the pools are extensive here in the lower river, and are generally a little deeper than a paddle will reach. Pockets are much deeper than that. Miles slide behind us. A salmon, sensing the inferiority of Snake Eyes, leaps into the air beside it, leaps again, leaps again, ten pounds of fish jumping five times high into the air—a bravado demonstration, a territorial declaration. This is, after all, the salmon’s eponymous river. The jumper moves on, among its kind, ignoring the dying. These—their spawning done—idly, sleepily yield to the current, their gestures slow and quiet, a peaceful drifting away.",

Indeed, in those instances, poor judgement kills, adaptability is key. A topographic map only tells you part of the story; it does not show you the changing weather, transitory snow, recent glacier movement and human exhaustion or injuries.

It was that there was just too much of what she was for any just one human female package to contain and hold: too much of white, too much of female, too much of maybe just glory, I dont know: so that at first sight of her you felt a kind of shock of gratitude just for being alive and being male at the same instant with her in space and time, and then in the next second and forever after a kind of despair because you knew that there never would be enough of any one male to match and hold and deserve her; grief forever after because forever after nothing less would ever do.",

Some entrepreneur has recently built a covered market opposite the only hotel, the Holiday Inn. But the local hawkers (cheerful rural folk, warmly welcoming) cannot afford to rent stalls and continue to spread their wares on dusty patches of wasteland while cattle and goats wander through the enormous empty market. Unrestrained livestock are Ulundi’s most agreeable feature; all developers had to guarantee animal freedom of movement when doing a deal with the villagers who previously dwelt here. Entering the bank, I was followed by a kid (four-legged) with whom I had already established a meaningful relationship in the Spar supermarket. Both staff and customers took our relationship for granted; when I tried to imagine reactions to his presence in Florida’s branch of the same bank my imagination failed me.",

Here, surrounded by hundreds of unblushing naked men, women, and children, we wandered about and saw the sights. We had our revolvers strapped on, and the boat's crew, fully armed, lay at the oars, stern in; but the lesson of the man-of-war was too recent for us to apprehend trouble. We walked about everywhere and saw everything until at last we approached a large tree trunk that served as a bridge across a shallow estuary. The blacks formed a wall in front of us and refused to let us pass. We wanted to know why we were stopped. The blacks said we could go on. We misunderstood, and started. Explanations became more definite. Captain Jansen and I, being men, could go on. But no Mary was allowed to wade around that bridge, much less cross it. \"Mary\" is beche de mer for woman. Charmian was a Mary. To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo. Ah, how my chest expanded! At last my manhood was vindicated. In truth I belonged to the lordly sex. Charmian could trapse along at our heels, but we were MEN, and we could go right over that bridge while she would have to go around by whale-boat.",

Then I’d start working the hotel’s crackly phone line. If I was lucky enough to reach someone, I’d hop in a taxi and sit in heavy traffic, haggling over the fare until I reached an office where the person I’d come to see wasn’t there. Then I’d take a taxi back to the Zona, drink more café con leche, and walk around until the caffeine and my sweat glands gave out. By eleven A.M., I’d surrendered hope of interviewing anyone. By noon, I no longer cared. And by my third day, I realized that without a superhuman expenditure of will and pesos, I’d accomplish nothing at all during my entire stay.",

In undertones, low but venomous, they commented upon the undue haste of Mr. Hopkins and its probable motives. Later on they understood everything.

I was surprised by her brilliant red hair, monumentally piled, and her two big front teeth which gave her a vital Neanderthal air. Somebody said, ‘Hush,’ and a clergyman began a prayer which I believe he must have composed himself. I had never heard it at any other funeral service, and I have attended a great number in my time. A bank manager is expected to pay his last respects to every old client who is not as we say ‘in the red’, and in any case I have a weakness for funerals.

This was the great number of booths, large and small, given over to the sale of hot and cold meats. Great sausages hung in ropes and festoons from the walls of some of these places, while in others there was a constant exhalation from steaming and roasting viands of all kinds and sizes.

Most recipes call for a white-fleshed fish such as snapper, but king mackerel (kingfish) or Spanish mackerel also works well—especially when you’ve just caught one of each and each one measures 3 feet. The technique involves first frying and then marinating the fish, a marriage of two culinary traditions: African (frying the fish) and Native American (preserving or pickling the fish in vinegar or lime juice, as with ceviche).\nIslanders serve escabeche both chilled and hot, as an appetizer and as a main course. Because it can be made in advance and kept in the fridge, it’s a lovely dish for a warm-weather dinner party or buffet.\n4 tablespoons olive oil (approx.)\n1 large white or yellow onion, thinly sliced\n1 red onion, thinly sliced\n2 green bell peppers, thinly sliced\n2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced\n1⁄2–1 teaspoon hot pepper, seeded and finely chopped (or to taste)\n2 pounds fish fillets or steaks\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\n2 bay leaves\n1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped\n6 whole black peppercorns\n6 whole allspice berries\n1⁄8 teaspoon mace\n3⁄4 cup white or malt vinegar\n1⁄2 cup black olives\n2 tablespoons capers\n1⁄2 cup roasted red peppers, sliced\n1. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan. Add the onions, green peppers, garlic, and hot pepper, and cook over medium heat, about 10 minutes, until the onions are soft and golden. Remove from pan and set aside.\n2. Dust the fish with salt and pepper and fry in the same pan until lightly browned on both sides and just cooked through, adding more oil as necessary.\n3. Place the fish in a large, nonreactive dish. Put the onions and peppers on top.\n4. In a saucepan, combine the spices with 1 cup water and salt and pepper, and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Add the vinegar and simmer for 2 minutes more.\n5. Strain the liquid and pour over the fish. Serve hot or let cool and chill before serving. Garnish the fish with the olives, capers, and red peppers right before serving.\nServes 4 as a main dish, 8 as an appetizer",

No sign marked its rusty barbed wire fence, interwoven with forest undergrowth, and the high, crudely-made plank gate refused to open. Cautiously we climbed over, glad of Ernesto’s help, then for an hour walked in single file through green coolness. (That was one of those blessed days when the sun never shone and occasionally it rained.) At intervals a balancing act was required when the path became a knife-edge ridge of volcanic rock. Ernesto provided refreshment by kicking off his shoes, swarming up the forty-foot naked bole of a coconut palm, hacking off three nuts with his machete and flinging them down after warning shouts. The Trio were mesmerised – and felt challenged. Our future hikes were slowed by frequent attempts to ‘do an Ernesto’, success only limited by shortness of limb.",

That’s because the MTC is in UB’s Sukhbaatar Square, an immense gray quadrangle rimmed by austere, colonnaded Soviet-era buildings. The city elders have organized a major welcoming and bon voyage ceremony for us. It seems half of UB is streaming in that direction, so I close the route book and instruct Bernard to follow them. The morning is warm, and with the window open I can hear the ceremonial band playing syncopated versions of Beatles classics and an occasional Souza march from many blocks away. When we round the corner to the square, we see a parade ground so vast that the triple row of Rally cars parked on one side look like tinker toys. Across from them is a juryrigged bandstand draped with red polyester skirting. It’s replete with a full swing band of horns and percussion, and a mike at which stands a significant person declaiming good wishes to the assembled multitudes. At least, that’s what I assume he’s saying, since not only is the mike weak and the sound system crackling with static, but the official is speaking Mongolian. Townsfolk mill about, some in city clothes, others in embroidered silk tunics and brocaded caps. I open Roxanne’s door so a child can be placed on her seat and a photo taken. This time, though, I’m not invited to participate.",

    "target_paragraph": "When, with immense labour and infinite conversation, this meagre fare was at last placed upon the tables it was so late that we had to light our lanterns in order to be able to see it; and my hearers who had never been outside the sheltered homes of Storchwerder and know nothing about what can happen to them when they do will have difficulty in picturing us gathered round the tables in that gusty place, vainly endeavouring to hold our wraps about us, our feet in wet grass and our heads in a stormy darkness. The fitful flicker of the lanterns played over rapidly cooling eggs and grave faces. It was indeed a bad beginning, enough to discourage the stoutest holiday-maker. This was not a holiday: this was privation combined with exposure. Frau von Eckthum was wholly silent. Even Mrs. Menzies-Legh, although she tried to laugh, produced nothing but hollow sounds. Edelgard only spoke once, and that was to say that the coffee was very bad and might she make it unaided another time, a remark and a question received with a gloomy assent. Menzies-Legh was by this time extremely anxious about the girls, and though his wife still said they were naughty and would be scolded it was with an ever fainter conviction. The two young men sat with their shoulders hunched up to their ears in total silence. No one, however, was half so much deserving of sympathy as myself and Edelgard, who had been travelling since the previous morning and more than anybody needed good food and complete rest. But there were hardly enough scrambled eggs to go round, most of them having been broken in the jolting up the lane on to the common, and after the meal, instead of smoking a cigar in the comparative quiet and actual dryness of one’s caravan, I found that everybody had to turn to and—will it be believed?—wash up.",
