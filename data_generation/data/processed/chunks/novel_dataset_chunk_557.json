In a book, now, it would be kind of terrible; if you forced characters in a book to eat as much grapefruit as we do, both the art boys and the humanitarians would stand on their hind legs and howl. But in real life—In life, anything might happen; in actual life people will do anything. It’s only in books that people must function according to arbitrary rules of conduct and probability; it’s only in books that events must never flout credulity.”",

Taking advantage of a menu-reading pause, I asked when Echiel’s family had moved to Israel. While answering, my companion changed in tiny but telling ways – his body language, the timbre of his voice, the set of his jaw. Perhaps dwelling on the remote past – with an oddly forced frivolity – was more than a scholar’s engaging obsession. It might well be an escape from the recent past.",

At times, when the wind was head on, we would take two steps forward and one back. When it came from an angle, it gave us a stiff shove towards the edge of the ridge. There was no telling in the fog how far the fall would be on either side, but it looked awfully steep, and we were after all a mile up in the clouds. If conditions had deteriorated just a little—if the fog had completely obscured our footing or the gusts had gathered just enough bump to knock a grown man over—we would have been pinned down up there, with me pretty well soaked through. Forty minutes before, we had been whistling in sunshine. I understood now how people die in the White Mountains even in summer.",

From the Piazza Massimo the fountains of Piazza Navona are visible; they play but make no sound. This is wonderful. In this palazzo, on March 16, 1583, San Filippo Neri brought the lifeless body of Paolo Massimo back from death. But the boy, safe in the bosom of his family, declared that he was ready to die, and San Filippo said: “Go and be blessed and pray to God for me.” Every March 16, Masses are celebrated in memory of this miracle in the second-floor chapel of the palazzo belonging to this august family, and all who wish may come, from the humble to the high, a good and wonderful thing.",

Rowing in the tropical sun is always a hot and sweaty business no matter how you try to pace yourself, and it’s much worse if it’s humid and there’s no wind, usually the case on Rio mornings. Yet another reason to get the outboard fixed as soon as possible. We tied the dinghy’s painter to a tree and walked away from the river, keeping to the shadows between the concrete bridge pilings. I carried the little twenty-seven-pound motor over my right shoulder. The land is low and flat on the south shore, meaning the bridge is elevated for a considerable distance.

During the night there is the sizzle of hard driving snow against the sides of the tent. Even in their eiderdown sleeping-bags the climbers shiver. The sardines they are meant to eat for supper freeze into little stone shoals which Mallory and Bullock have to thaw out by holding them in their hands. While they are melting snow for water, the two men take turns to lean over the pot so that the steam which tendrils off its surface warms their eyes. The wind rages continually at the tents, slapping the layers of canvas together, trying to rip the whole structure from the mountainside. Without the tent, without these few crucial millimetres of canvas, they wouldn’t stand a chance.",

They assumed that I would have had more in common with the British or other English-speakers than with the Italians. “Every group has their characteristics, but people are people,” I would respond. In Calabria, I had British, Irish, Canadian and Australian colleagues, several of whom had blood ties to Italy. Some could barely say “hello” and “goodbye” in Italian, while others spoke fairly well. A few didn’t even express themselves satisfactorily in English.",

Murky brown water flowed past Varuna’s hull, testament to the heavy rainfall and runoff from the lush Marquesas. I inhaled the perfumed air, musky with the underlying essence of smoke from the morning fires, and remembered that this was a place where only a few people had the luxury of a stove. Tied stern to the jetty were two other sailboats, brightly painted fishing boats and the local sailing pirogues. Double-checking to be sure everything was secure aboard Varuna, I dived into the water and swam to my friends.",

There was a teenage historian from Cambridge, and a social worker from Singapore. There was a pair of his-and-hers fitness freaks from Boulder, Colorado—Mr. Good Health a gentle, bearded craftsman, Ms. Good Health a radiant cowgirl—who were bicycling at a leisurely pace across the Himalayas.

Outside in the windy street August and the horses were waiting patiently. The stars were coming out in the pale green of the sky over Göhren, but from the east the night was dragging up a great curtain of chill black cloud. For the best part of an hour Gertrud and I went from one hotel to another, from one lodging-house to another. The hotels all promised rooms if I would call again in four weeks' time. The lodging-houses only laughed at our request for a night's shelter; they said they never took in people who were not going to stay the entire season, and who did not bring their own bedding. Their own bedding! What a complication of burdens to lay on the back of the patient father of a family. Did a holiday-maker with a wife and, say, four children have to bring six sets of bedding with him? Six sets of Teutonic bedding, stuffed with feathers? Six pillows, six of those wedge-like things to put under pillows called Kielkissen, and six quilted coverlets with insides of eider-down if there was a position to keep up, and of wadding if public opinion could afford to be defied? Yet the lodging-houses were full; and that there were small children in them was evident from the frequency with which the sounds that accompany the act of correction floated out into the street.",

They came in all the uniforms of the armies of Victorian Europe: girls in Prussian shakos and English busbies, their tunics frogged with gold and silver, their fluffy pompons looking like splats of melted ice cream in the rain.\n“Well! Ain’t that just a lovely thing to happen on!” a black woman laughed at me out of the crowd on the sidewalk. She was weighed down with shopping in brown paper sacks. “That’s the best thing I seen in weeks. Ain’t they so pretty?”\nDrums, cornets, bugles, pipes. The bands filled the town with bangs and skirls. They were marching through Georgia, burying John Brown’s body, Yankee Doodling and hailing the Chief; but the tunes had all leaked into each other like wet colors, leaving the musical and military equivalent of a Jackson Pollock painting in the air.\nA boy bandleader went by in war paint and feathers, tossing his baton as high as the roof of the cigar store across the street. I thought I saw the face of a real Indian in the crowd, and studied him; but he had the same expression of empty good humor as the rest of us.\nHurrah! hurrah! we bring the Jubilee!",

Slipping into journalist mode, he asked me to describe myself. Having gone from kindergarten to high school with the same people, I had developed an identity before I was even cognizant of it, and I’d been trying to shake it ever since. So I really loved questions like that, responding not with who I actually was, but with the labels I hoped someday to acquire. And back then, it was a militant-vegetarian-Chicana-feminist. The first part baffled Vova and Karina (Kak?), the second confused them (Shto?), but when I got to the feministka part, they laughed so hard, their margaritas fizzled out their noses.",

He hooked into the port jack line and slowly and deliberately climbed out on deck. The spray was flying and stinging his eyes. Each step, each hand-hold was thought through in advance. One slow-motion movement after another. When he made it to the mast, he inched his way up to a standing position with one hand around the Baby Dink webbing tie-down and one on the main halyard. He let go of the halyard and hooked in his short tether to the ‘D’ ring on Baby Dink. He then braced and leaned ever so slightly backward. The ‘D’ ring was perfect. Using both hands, he got the main down and started tying the reef lines through the foot of the sail. It took a while but having both hands to do it was a godsend.",

When I was small, billboards thirty feet wide and fifteen feet high stood in fields along every roadside. In places like Iowa and Kansas they were about the only stimulation you got. In the 1960s Lady Bird Johnson, in one of those misguided campaigns in which Presidents’ wives are always engaging themselves, had most of the roadside billboards removed as part of a highway beautification programme. In the middle of the Rocky Mountains this was doubtless a good thing, but out here in the lonesome heartland billboards were practically a public service. Seeing one standing a mile off you would become interested to see what it said, and would watch with mild absorption as it advanced towards you and passed. As roadside excitements went, it was on about a par with the little windmills in Pella, but it was better than nothing.",

    "target_paragraph": "All day they waited, shrouded in haze and fog. As darkness fell, Bartlett heard the deflating sound of the engines shutting down again, “and the ship was hove hull to and allowed to drift.” For the next two days, they drifted slowly to the south-southeast, away from Wrangel Island. At 4:12 on the morning of August 27, Captain Cochran ordered the engines fired and said they must return to Nome for more coal. Bartlett felt sick with disappointment and regret. He knew in his heart that Captain Cochran was right—they’d used up most of the ninety tons of coal in the bunkers, and they needed enough to get to the island and, importantly, return. It would be too dangerous to run out of coal and be powerless out here. But even so, his heart sank as they steamed southeast: “The days that followed were days to try a man’s soul,” he said. “I spent such a wretched time as I had never in my life.”",

It is amazing to wake up in the morning with a coca tea delivered to our tent, sit down to a hot breakfast that we don’t have to carry or cook or clean up, then saunter up the trail with a small daypack holding only snacks and water. Wow, it will be hard to return to normal backpacking after this luxurious trip.",

In the eighteen-sixties and eighteen-seventies, people began to transplant them to the cleared and excavated bogs where ore raisers had removed bog iron, and that was the beginning of commercial cranberry growing in the Pine Barrens, where about a third of the United States total is now grown. Cranberry bogs are shallow basins, dammed on all sides, so that streams can fill them in late autumn and keep cold winter winds from drying out the vines. The older bogs were turfed out by hand, and the dams were built from the turf. In the fall, the berries were harvested by hand, with many-tined wooden scoops that went through the vines like large claws. Cranberry scoops are so primitive in appearance that they are sold as antiques in shops on Third Avenue and in Bucks County. In a few bogs in the Pine Barrens, scoops are still used, and only five years ago all bogs used them.",

Rather, some of it dripped below by way of those weepy chain plates and dribbled into the spice locker. If I procrastinated pumping out the locker for more than one hour, it overflowed onto my bed and proceeded to submerge all the food in the locker beneath the mattress. I hand-pumped the locker every hour thereafter?day and night?for four days.

Because he knew now he had anticipated something like what had happened and he would need his wits about him.

Finding the drawing-room dark, he went upstairs, and spent some time between the bedroom and the dressing-room, changing his clothes, going to and fro with the air of a thoughtful somnambulist.

I offered half a case of tobacco, but the blacks grinned and held their canoes bow-on to the breaking seas. A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds. In two hours, even against the strong wind and sea, a man could have carried the letter and received in payment what he would have laboured half a year for on a plantation. I managed to get into a canoe and paddle out to where Mr. Caulfeild was running an anchor with his whale-boat. My idea was that he would have more influence over the natives. He called the canoes up to him, and a score of them clustered around and heard the offer of half a case of tobacco. No one spoke.",

There are no “usual offices” in this establishment; the court at the back serves instead, for men and beasts alike. As I reached the outside staircase, I slipped. The lantern went out; my only garment, a mackintosh, flew over my head; and I found myself lying naked in a bed of snow and excrement, which clove to my body in the frost.

    "target_paragraph": "Willie Hensley was born in Kotzebue, in Arctic Alaska, and grew up some ten miles out of town in a kind of family commune, with uncles, aunts, and cousins all around him as well as his immediate family. In winter, they lived in an ivrulik, which was an iglu made of sod. “Iglu” means “house”—any kind of house—and the kind that is made of blocks of snow in the shape of a dome was unknown to Willie, the nearest one being in Arctic Canada, more than a thousand miles away. Kotzebue was distant, too (“It seemed like a thousand miles”), and during Willie’s early youth the whole family went there only twice a year, at Thanksgiving and at Christmas, for dinners, pageants, and the communal opening of what he remembers as “a mountain of gifts.” All this took place in Friends Church—a mission derived from Whittier, California—and Willie grew up a titular Quaker, but the most lasting impression he took away with him was of the great amounts of food there: seal oil, piles of frozen fish to dip into the seal oil, and pyramids of berries—altogether “so much you took it home.” The sod house was across an arm of Kotzebue Sound of the Chukchi Sea of the Arctic Ocean, two hundred miles from Siberia, six hundred miles from Anchorage. In chicken-wire traps the family caught whitefish in the late fall, and stored them in gunnysacks outside for the winter. Later on, they netted sheefish under the ice and stacked them up frozen, like cordwood. In summer they moved upriver—up the Noatak—and lived in tents, and hunted ducks and muskrats. In early fall, toward the end of August, they gathered berries and took them by the barrel back home.",

He grew weak in the deep cold of the night, and when the moon went below the mountains he began to wander off the stream course, hitting boulders. He had been around many corners, but no civilization was there. Now he was sinking into a dream-hazy sleepwalking numbedout oblivion; but fear, fortunately, struck through and turned him, upriver. He had not retraced his way very far when he stopped and tried to build a fire. He scraped together some twigs, but his cut and bare hands were shaking so—at roughly fifty below zero—that he failed repeatedly to ignite a match. He abandoned the effort, and moved on through the snow. He kept hitting boulders. He had difficulty following his own tracks. He knew now that he would die if he did not get back to the cabin, and the detached observer within him decided he was finished. Left foot, right foot—there was no point in quitting, even so. About noon, he reached the cabin. With his entire body shaking, he worked at a fire until he had one going. Then he rolled up in his parachute and slept almost continuously for three full days.",
