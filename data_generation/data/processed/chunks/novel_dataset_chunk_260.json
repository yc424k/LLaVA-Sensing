Here’s my best guess: around 1992, the record companies in New York and London gathered together all the millions of cassettes and CDs that they couldn’t sell, even marked down to 99 cents at truck stops, and shipped them off to Peru, where they were air-dropped all across the country. How else to explain the fact that Edgar possessed a copy of the album that Pat Benatar released two albums after the album that had “Love Is a Battlefield” on it? How else to explain the extraordinary “Worst of the Eighties” mix that he played on repeat for the six-hour drive to Quillabamba? “Playing with the Queen of Hearts” was followed by “99 Luftballoons,” which segued into “Sister Christian” and “We Don’t Have to Take Our Clothes Off.” Peru doesn’t give out knighthoods, but if they ever start, Kenny Loggins should probably get his tux pressed.",

Indeed, bunting to my mind never looked so well as when floating and fainting among cocoanut palms and all the shining greenery of Hilo, in the sunshine of a radiant morning. It was bright and warm, but the cool bulk of Mauna Kea, literally covered with snow, looked down as winter upon summer. Natives galloped in from all quarters, brightly dressed, wreathed, and garlanded, delighted in their hearts at the attention paid to their sovereign by a great foreign power, though they had been very averse to this journey, from a strange but prevalent idea that once on board a U.S. ship the king would be kidnapped and conveyed to America.",

This was where she had worked when she came back from Kiev and where her offices were located throughout many of the years she was climbing the regime’s hierarchy. She and Pipo stopped at two stores that had an array of fabric in their windows, but they took only a quick glance at the prices before they continued on their way. A few blocks later, they came to the elegant storefront windows of Quitrín and stepped into the air-conditioned showroom. They were immediately greeted by a saleswoman who embraced Cary, kissed her cheek, and said she couldn’t get over how well she looked. Cary returned the compliment and then got right down to business: Yes, our shop lost power. No, we didn’t get water inside. Do you have any material you could spare?",

My hope had been to spend the night on Patrick’s summit, where there had once stood a Celtic hill-fort and, later, a drystone oratory. But it happened that I had inadvertently chosen a holy day, the Feast of the Ascension, for my climb, and the path up the mountain was busy with hundreds of pilgrims - ordinary men, women and children from the surrounding towns and counties, who had come to test the strength of their Catholic faith against the mountain, for reasons I could not fathom. I started up the mountain among them, listening to them talk. Many of the men had chosen to walk barefoot and bare-chested, and most of these had blood seeping from the wounds the mountain’s rocks had left on their feet.",

Ian taught me how to ‘surf’ a boat when running downwind in a decent swell. ‘Just two slow little flicks of the tiller,’ he said, ‘this way, to steer off the wind a touch – and then this way, to fill the sail again, so the boat boosts on and catches the wave that’s passing under you.

    "target_paragraph": "The dominant motif in all of the megalithic monuments of San Agustín is transformation. The theme recurs throughout the Americas, from ancient civilizations that predated San Agustín, the Chavín and Olmec in particular, to the myriad of living Amazonian cultures of today. The protagonist is always the shaman, a gifted individual who invokes techniques of ecstasy to soar away to distant metaphysical realms to work deeds of supernatural rescue. Under the influence of sacred plants, the shaman can turn into a bird, a jaguar, a harpy eagle. His feline power, according to the Páez, gave birth to thunder. For the Tairona, gold had nothing to do with currency or wealth. It was the living physical manifestation of the divine, the gift of the first shape-shifter, the primordial shaman. In his hands, gold became imbued with all the numinous power and energy of the sun, the source of eternal life. The Tukano say that even should a shaman be devoured by serpents, he will always emerge whole, transformed, elevated to a higher state of insight and awareness, capable of healing the sick, giving comfort and reassurance to the dying, guiding the dead and granting them eternal life.",

He knew all the Peak’s aspects: its bleak upper reaches, its gritstone edges and its wooded cloughs. He knew what time of year each species of migrant bird arrived. Redwings and fieldfares in autumn. Golden plover, sandpipers and dunlin in spring. Occasional snow buntings after a midwinter northerly gale. He knew the locations of particular trees: star-leaved field maples, big lone beeches, and the black-barked sweet chestnuts, which flamed a sulphurous yellow in autumn. He knew the locations of the snares and stink-pits set out by gamekeepers on the private swathes of moor, to trap anything which might prey on the grouse. He knew on which south-tilted rocks the adders sunned themselves on hot days. He knew in which larch-tree a pair of goshawks kept their nest, and at the bottom of which heathery down-slope hen harriers had once successfully hatched.",

Rejang consists of little more than a slow procession, but the participants conduct themselves with extreme grace and delicacy. It is a dignified and elegant affair. Women of all ages participate. All wear traditional temple dress, but with elaborate semicircular headdresses of gold, decorated with flowers. Some villages perform rejang in the daytime, some at night. Night rejang is common in the major odalans in Sukawati. Day rejangs are given in the Bali Aga villages such as Tenganan, Bungaya, and Asak.",

But now: on the first occasion Mrs Wannop got a chair without arms in the outer ring, whilst a general officer commanding lately in chief somewhere in the East whose military success had not been considered, but whose despatches were considered very literary, occupied, rather blazingly, the throne. But Mrs Wannop had chatted very contentedly all the afternoon with Tietjens, and it had been comforting to Valentine to see Tietjens’ large, uncouth, but quite collected figure, and to observe the affection that these two had for each other.",

He drove us there a bit dourly; this was more entanglement than he’d bargained on. The hospital occupied a narrow ridge with a road running along it and open sky all around. Tania and I went in while Sergei and Volodya parked in a lot and waited. Families and patients, mostly Buryats who looked to be in bad shape, stood at the waiting room entrance and sat in little groups on the bare furniture inside. Some had dried blood and bruises on their faces and staggered around. The waiting room with its low-watt bulb was dim as a cave. On the wall, a phone from fifty years ago seemed to be the only way to reach the hospital’s interior. Tania picked it up, talked for a few minutes, then disappeared through a door and up some stairs. After a short while she and Sasha came down.",

She was unacquainted with the world of the fashionable New York hotel – a world over-heated, over-upholstered, and over-fitted with mechanical appliances for the gratification of fantastic requirements, while the comforts of a civilized life were as unattainable as in a desert. Through this atmosphere of torrid splendour moved wan beings as richly upholstered as the furniture, beings without definite pursuits or permanent relations, who drifted on a languid tide of curiosity from restaurant to concert-hall, from palm-garden to music-room, from ‘art exhibit’ to dress-maker’s opening. High-stepping horses or elaborately equipped motors waited to carry these ladies into vague metropolitan distances, whence they returned, still more wan from the weight of their sables, to be sucked back into the stifling inertia of the hotel routine. Somewhere behind them, in the background of their lives, there was doubtless a real past, peopled by real human activities: they themselves were probably the product of strong ambitions, persistent energies, diversified contacts with the wholesome roughness of life; yet they had no more real existence than the poet’s shades in limbo.",

It had been established in 1537, in the wake of Pedro de Heredia’s victory over Mampó, chief of the Simbay, a Carib-speaking people who controlled the land where the modern city sits today. Like many of the settlements that came into being at that time—a wave of exploration that saw the founding of Barrancabermeja and Cali in 1536, Popayán in 1537, Tunja in 1539, and Santa Fe de Antioquia in 1541—Mompox in its early years struggled to survive. For those accustomed to the pleasures of Spain—the olive groves and the wheat fields of Andalucía, the orchards of Lérida, the gentle sea breezes flowing over the land at Valencia—the jungle location of the new settlement, said to be the hottest place in all the Indies, was not auspicious. The humidity and heat were difficult to bear. The immediate surroundings, both wetlands and woodland, were ominous and threatening. Decomposition, key to the health of tropical forests, was believed at the time to be the very source of pestilence, creating miasmas that rose out of vegetative rot to infect the unworthy and punish the sinful.",

The street in front of the market was chaotic with traffic. Over the sound of blaring vehicle horns, conductors shouted out their destinations as passengers squeezed on to the overcrowded buses. A traffic policeman dressed in smart blue trousers and wearing a dented white helmet blew his whistle and waved his hands, frantically trying to control the bicycles, mopeds and buses that thundered past him. On top of a pick-up truck I saw a group of monks sitting in a messy pile of brick-coloured robes and shaved heads. They waved at me, yelling out joyous hellos and grinning widely through betel-stained lips. A steady stream of women walked out of the market carrying baskets laden with produce. One woman had a sack of vegetables in each hand and a bundle of runner beans balanced rakishly on her head.",

As the train rumbled through mist-cloaked fields, black bin bags were opened to reveal an array of wigs, capes, face paints and hats, which gradually transformed a trainload of ordinary passengers into something resembling a mobile circus. In the seat next to me, a scruffy skateboarder donned a long red robe, black wig and bejewelled crown to become a medieval king. Across the aisle, a pair of grey-haired sisters metamorphosed into a giggling Batman and Robin. Ever eager to assimilate, I had brought a costume of my own – a fluffy orange tiger suit, complete with pointy ears and a tail, which my mother had sent unsolicited from Britain a few weeks previously. ‘I saw this and thought you might like it,’ the note in her parcel said, leaving me unsure whether to be flattered or offended. Studying my reflection in the grimy train window, I used a thick black marker to colour my nose and add whiskers to my cheeks.",

The descriptions in the Coast Pilot suggested it was the most accessible place to land a ship. On the way down there, Bartlett looked up through pelting snow and saw a pile of rocks perched high on a bluff. He remembered that it was called Hooper’s Cairn, built when Captain Hooper and naturalist John Muir had landed in 1881 to search for Captain De Long. Though Bartlett was curious to see what messages they might have left there, it was steep and cliffy and looked like too much effort, and in any case, winds now hurtled down an inland gorge there, slamming them “in terrific squalls that almost lifted us off our feet and whirled the snow down from the mountainside in huge drifts.” The snow blowing down the canyon carried fine sand and shards of shale that sliced their faces, and they ducked and winced as they went.",

Saint Michael’s Cathedral was started immediately after this building was completed and dedicated. Probably the same crew. Finns.” (Harvey was also a great admirer of Finns.) The chief manager of the Russian-American Company, a commercial arm of the government that oversaw its affairs in Alaska, was a Helsinki native who imported a team of Finnish master carpenters in the 1840s. The Bishop’s House was owned until 1969 by the Russian Orthodox Church, headquartered in Moscow, which must have been a little strange during the Cuban Missile Crisis.",

All those who were involved were in their assigned places on the morning of the planned departure, but at the last moment Ramel called it off. Security on the waterfront had been heightened when a ship entered the port with supplies for the U.S. Interests Section, the only official American presence in Havana after diplomatic relations were severed and the embassy closed in 1961. Ramel felt that launching the expedition then was too risky, and he preferred to wait a week. He then picked a new date: Wednesday, July 13.",

Presumably he just drew a line on a map and left the details to subordinates. The Topolinskaya Highway was abandoned in 1954, after Stalin died, and the camps of the prisoners who built it were closed. For much of its route, the road—or what remains of it—follows the valleys of the Olchan and the Topo rivers and winds back and forth among them. Most of its bridges have fallen down, so for many years the road has been drivable only in months when the rivers and the creeks that run into them can be crossed on the ice.",

A flock of startled Egyptian geese flew honking from a reed-bed and I floated to watch their pattern of loveliness against the sky. Further out I glimpsed Gorgora in its cove, and beyond stretched rough, forested cliffs – but the west shore remained invisible. Turning back I saw two men driving a donkey in the distance; luckily they were not coming in our direction, so there were no witnesses to a rather aged Venus rising from the lake.",

A fortnight ago she had been perfectly well. What could fourteen days have done to bring her from that state to this? To realize what they meant by saying that she had a chance of life was beyond him, knowing as he did that they were engaged. He turned, still enveloped in the same dreary mist, and walked towards the door. Suddenly he saw it all. He saw the room and the garden, and the trees moving in the air, they could go on without her; she could die. For the first time since she fell ill he remembered exactly what she looked like and the way in which they cared for each other. The intense happiness of feeling her close to him mingled with a more intense anxiety than he had felt yet. He could not let her die; he could not live without her. But after a momentary struggle, the curtain fell again, and he saw nothing and felt nothing clearly. It was all going on—going on still, in the same way as before. Save for a physical pain when his heart beat, and the fact that his fingers were icy cold, he did not realize that he was anxious about anything. Within his mind he seemed to feel nothing about Rachel or about anyone or anything in the world. He went on giving orders, arranging with Mrs Chailey, writing out lists, and every now and then he went upstairs and put something quietly on the table outside Rachel’s door. That night Dr Lesage seemed to be less sulky than usual. He stayed voluntarily for a few moments, and, addressing St John and Terence equally, as if he did not remember which of them was engaged to the young lady, said, ‘I consider that her condition tonight is very grave.’",
