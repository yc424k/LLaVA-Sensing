The hospital porter refused admission to her mother and boy-husband, the latter a severe case of pre-natal nervous prostration. She and a Gypsy woman had to share a single bed with filthy linen. Finding this intolerable, Liliana spent the night in a corner by the radiator (it was midwinter and far below freezing), crying with pain and fear, believing both herself and her baby to be doomed. It was ‘lights out’ at 11 p.m., when the eight women sharing four beds (all in labour) were scolded for being so noisy and told to settle down to sleep. Then the door was locked; the ward had a lavatory en suite. All night the Gypsy shouted obscene abuse of men in general and her husband in particular, which for Liliana added yet another dimension of horror to the experience. Before the staff reappeared at 7 a.m. three babies had arrived.",

He turned to ask if he could join Passepartout, who was now paddling in the water. As the setting sunlight reached his honey-coloured eyes, they glowed with delight and he handed back the camera, hopped down the rocks and ran to the edge of the waves, where he stood with one hand on his hip, his legs bowed with rickets, chatting to Passepartout.",

It took everything I had not to touch him—he had his father’s dreamy curls, and keeping my fingers out of them was an act of extreme willpower, reminding me of great first dates, where you’re trying to play it cool. At the end of the night, they hugged me good-bye. I was in love.",

Here the little lanes and passageways are packed with restaurants and crowds of people wandering around in the happy state of deciding where to eat, nosing around the ice barrows of lobsters, mussels and crayfish that stand outside each establishment. Every doorway issues a warm draught of grilled aromas and every window reveals crowds of people enjoying themselves at almost any hour of the day or night. It is remorselessly picturesque and appealing, and it has been like this since the Middle Ages, and yet even this lovable, clubby little neighbourhood came within an ace of being bulldozed in the 1960s. Wherever you go in Europe, you find yourself wondering what sort of brain-wasting disease it was that affected developers and architects in the 1960s and 70s, but nowhere is this sensation stronger than in Brussels.",

He runs them mainly in November and December. He does not use a snow machine, as many trappers in Alaska do. He says, “The two worst things that ever happened to this country are the airplane and the snow machine.” His traplines traverse steep terrain, rocky gullies—places where he could not use a machine anyway. To get through, he requires sleds and dogs. Generally, he has to camp out at least one night to complete a circuit. If the temperature is colder than thirty below, he stays in his cabin and waits for the snap to pass. As soon as the air warms up, he hits the trail. He has built lean-tos in a few places, but often enough he sleeps where he gets tired—under an orange canvas tarp. It is ten feet by ten, and weighs two and a half pounds, and is all the shelter he needs at, say, twenty below zero. Picking out a tree, he ties one corner of the tarp to the trunk, as high as he can reach. He stakes down the far corner, then stakes down the two sides. Sometimes, he will loft the center by tying a cord to a branch above. He builds a lasting fire between the tree and himself, gets into his sleeping bag, and drifts away. Most nights are calm. Snow is light in the upper Yukon. The tarp’s configuration is not so much for protection as to reflect the heat of the fire. He could make a closed tent with the tarp, if necessary. His ground cloth, or bed pad, laid out on the snow beneath him, is the hide of a caribou.",

It’s called “Il Gelato di San Crispino.” I’m not sure, but I think this might translate as “the ice cream of the crispy saint.” I tried a combination of the honey and the hazelnut. I came back later that same day for the grapefruit and the melon. Then, after dinner that same night, I walked all the way back over there one last time, just to sample a cup of the cinnamon-ginger.",

She greeted me with astonished disapproval; the hotel restaurant had been closed for three years, Gura Humorului had no food to spare in winter, why had I not come in summer when many tourists pass through? (Those ‘many’ tourists – mostly ex-Communist country coach tours – pass through only because two of Moldavia’s most famous painted churches are nearby.) On the first floor my large, clean, frugally furnished room was suffocatingly overheated and the big window proved immovable – not only by me but by Alex, my one fellow guest, a sturdy young construction engineer from Constanta. He it was who directed me to the toalet, down a wide corridor with ominous cracks zig-zagging all along the walls. He cautioned me to stand far from the lavatory when pulling the chain; sometimes the tank provided a cold shower. And then he warned me against the locals. ‘These Moldavian people are wild and rough, all smugglers and robbers – take care!’",

I liked it immediately. The rain had stopped and left the town with a clean, fresh feel, vaguely reminiscent of sheets lifted warm from a tumble dryer, and it had an eerily timeless air of convalescence about it. I half expected to see limbless soldiers in brown uniforms being pushed through the park in wheelchairs.",

For the two main surface substances of the Western Isles – black peat and pale gneiss – are differently hostile to path-making. The peat swallows paths, and the gneiss refuses them. The gneiss, tough enough to have withstood millions of years of geological tumult, is almost impossible to mark by footfall. The peat, springy and spongy, gulps down the paths that run across it unless they are kept in regular use. So it is that many of the thousands of footpaths that seam the Western Isles don’t exist as continuous lines in the land, but instead as trails of intervisible cairns or standing stones.",

Apparently, while running ahead to confirm the trail in the half light, Clam had broken through young ice, and by the time Chafe got to him, only his head and flailing arms were above water. Chafe dropped the sled handles and dashed to the edge of the crack and managed to pull Clam onto safe ice. But now they were already headed back; Clam needed dry clothes and a fire, and fast. Fireman Maurer volunteered to guide his frozen fellow seaman back to Shipwreck Camp, and they set off at a run, with McKinlay trotting just behind them to make sure they made it.",

I can hang out, read my book, and have macaroni and cheese, served with the usual chips, until my cholesterol level blocks all arteries. I am allowed to pitch my tent “anywhere.” Unlike the Jura Hotel, this site has NO protection. I set up next to the boundary fence with the logic that if the wind uproots the tent, we both will blow into the barb wired fence, preferable to being blown into Port Charlotte like tumbleweed. The view from my tent is over the Atlantic towards Northern Ireland, infinitely closer than either the Isles of Lewis or Man. The wind creates a loud flapping sound that makes a sound sleep impossible, if you aren’t exhausted and full of fat. I sleep the sleep of the dead.",

He would eat his supper at a restaurant, and then, because his mind was feverish and he knew he could not sleep, he would walk to Brooklyn Bridge and cross It to Manhattan, and ferret out the secret heart of darkness in all the city's ways, and then at dawn come back across the Bridge once more, and so to bed in Brooklyn.",

My tall, thin, elderly host – who for some reason wears only his turban and a shamma – has friendly though cunning eyes and a stately manner. Like everyone else he was deceived by my Gondar haircut, and I hadn’t been sitting long in the compound when he led his granddaughter towards me and offered her love at two dollars for an hour or five dollars for the night. She was a very beautiful girl, who looked most willing to earn an honest dollar, and I pretended to consider the offer carefully. Then I settled for an hour, explaining solemnly that having walked from Bahar Dar I mightn’t be up to an all-night session. By now the whole family had gathered round, and everyone saw this point and nodded understandingly as the girl sat close beside me, intending to give good value by not limiting her co-operation to one hour after dark. A moment later Grandad’s little error had been discovered.",

To pass a half hour, I went to the residents’ lounge to see if I couldn’t scare up a pot of coffee. The room was casually strewn with aging colonels and their wives, sitting amid carelessly folded Daily Telegraphs. The colonels were all shortish, round men with tweedy jackets, well-slicked silvery hair, an outwardly gruff manner that concealed within a heart of flint, and, when they walked, a rakish limp. Their wives, lavishly rouged and powdered, looked as if they had just come from a coffin fitting. I felt seriously out of my element, and was surprised to find one of them—a white-haired lady who appeared to have applied her lipstick during an earth tremor—addressing me in a friendly, conversational manner. It always takes me a moment to remember in these circumstances that I am now a reasonably respectable-looking middle-aged man and not a gangly young rube straight off the banana boat.",

Her father, Esther’s brother, wanted her to accompany Aunty to Vancouver and promote the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement from a safe distance. She, however, was committed to promoting ‘one-state’ among her contemporaries on both sides of the Green Line. Esther supported her – ‘If all the pioneer thinkers migrate, how can the reform happen? That’s my dream, too – a re-formation of this state to make space for everyone, all equal before the law.’",

Once Cassie and I paddled to work in an inflated one-man fishing raft we’d hidden in a manty load—two of us and our daypacks and rock tools jammed in between the rubber gunnels. We moored the raft under a cliff band, scrabbled up scree to the job site, and relished the coolest commute in the world. By 5:30, though, the up-valley winds kicked in, and like a freeway at rush hour, the evening trip took more than two hours, our rock-work-weary arms hardly able to paddle against the gusts. I watched ospreys and golden eagles coasting on the drafts above, the same wind that stopped us short boosting their flight to acrobatic levels. After that, the raft stayed at camp. Instead, we’d hike the twenty minutes home from work and take turns drifting out in the lake, Cassie in a bikini with the straps pushed down to counteract her farmer’s tan, and me in a sports bra and the worn-out Carhartts I’d chopped the legs off of with a pulaski, having forgotten shorts.",

There were no claw marks, which ruled out hyenas or cheetahs (and no sensible cheetah hunts at night anyway, since sixty-mile-an-hour sprints are really much safer when you can see the trees you might run into).

They at once returned here with the tiny corpse and stood weeping in the middle of the road beneath my window; when I went to them the mother was still holding the infant to her bare breast in the frantic hope that after all it wasn’t really dead. I had to emphasise that it was and gently force her to cover the little face from the swarming flies – whereupon the father threw himself full length on the muddy road and began to sob his heart out. I then took them up to my room and gave them neat whiskey, which merely made them choke and seemed to do no good; yet perhaps it did help them over the shock. This baby was the youngest of a family of five, but they couldn’t have been more grieved if it were their only one. However, it’s likely that their grief will soon fade; most of these primitive Tibetans feel such things intensely for a brief period and then recover overnight.",

He was the youngest of the three husbands of an apparently not very kindly wife, who treated him as a house-boy rather than as a husband, so when the exodus to India began he chose the child most likely to be his own and quietly departed from the village of Gombol. (Don’t ask me where Gombol is; Tibetans measure distances in their own way and Thondup simply said that it was ‘one month’s walk from Lhasa over the Mountain of the Wind-God’ – which is not a very precise indication of the spot.) Having been at school in Mussoorie, Thondup – now aged twelve – speaks adequate English; he is a delightful boy, but as usual I have horrible misgivings about the impact of Europe on a Tiblet.",

Elizabeth could see the crown of her stepfather’s hat among the rest beneath, and was not aware that Lucetta watched the same object with yet in-tenser interest. He moved about amid the throng, at this point lively as an ant-hill; elsewhere more reposeful, and broken up by stalls of fruit and vegetables. The farmers as a rule preferred the open carrefour for their transactions, despite its inconvenient jostlings and the danger from crossing vehicles, to the gloomy sheltered market-room provided for them. Here they, surged on this one day of the week, forming a little world of leggings, switches, and sample-bags; men of extensive stomachs, sloping like mountain sides; men whose heads in walking swayed as the trees in November gales; who in conversing varied their attitudes much, lowering themselves by spreading their knees, and thrusting their hands into the pockets of remote inner jackets. Their faces radiated tropical warmth; for though when at home their countenances varied with the seasons, their market-faces all the year round were glowing little fires.",

They saw the buoyancy of her tread, like the skim of a bird which has not quite alighted.",

But she felt reborn in the desert, in the hot, dry air. She said she’d never go home. I think I know how she feels. I am baptized, wiped clean. Jim takes a running jump, and strikes out in a stiff front crawl, angled into the current so that he cuts across to the ladder on the opposite wall. He grabs a rung, and hauls himself to safety. Heaving himself half out of the water, he throws his head back and crows like Peter Pan, a wild ululation. Then he laughs: he hasn’t had a shower since July. No matter. The rich are drinking our bathwater now. This is how you can feel like you have everything when you have nothing at all.",

I’ve watched with fascination as she diligently layers makeup on her face every morning, but she works hard, and even those of us who can comfortably go for a week without a shower are only just getting through the long days with the dream of cold water at the end of it. This news hits everyone hard. Doña Lucia, who has to walk for two hours now each day rather than get a lift, by the second day is feeding us just dry rice with bottom-shelf dusty cans of tuna. It makes us all ill. On top of this we’re drinking as little water as possible. Some days it tops forty degrees and we’re doing construction from sunup to sundown. Nobody complains, because in the end Agustino hasn’t been able to buy gasoline. We have two tanks left, enough to run the water generator for perhaps a week. We fill all spare containers with Wayra’s lagoon water and leave them covered by the fumador. I am terrified now, more than angry and tired. Bone-scared, as the smoke grows thicker and the cries of the animals louder.",

When she passed their run with her high-piled pannier, the ducks gathered quacking, aware of her burden, eager, dull-eyed for lack of water, the tormenting lack supposed to forward their cruel fattening.\nThe last ray of the setting sun lay red upon the inside wall of the potting-shed, a living presence.\nPassing in masses through the chaff-cutter, the crushed nettles gave forth their odour, delicately potent, prevailing over the familiar odour of shut-in sun-baked straw and dust. This nettle scent was in league with the open, with the ray now fading from the rough grain of the ancient wood. Watching until it was no longer there, she came out from the enclosed shadowy warmth into the clear shadowless light of evening, satisfied.",

Black hawkers sell oranges, and such European vegetables as cauliflowers and carrots, and buckets of sun-dried dark-grey caterpillars called mopane worms – a nutritious delicacy which I forbore to sample. There is no restaurant or pub; beer is available only from the endearingly named Drankwinkels (off-licences) or in the hotel bars. Each hotel runs a Drankwinkel and has two bars – one an annexe entered from the street, designed to exclude black customers from the hotel proper.",
