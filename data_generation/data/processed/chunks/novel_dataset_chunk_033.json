Proud above the sea at the northern end of the island is the church of the Trappist Monastery, whose community came here from Communist China. Its thirty silent Chinese monks (together, in 1987, with one Englishman) run their estate as a dairy farm, and for years provided the Hilton Hotel with all its milk. A most homely smell of hay and cow-dung greets the visitor to their ugly buildings, together with the text PAX INTRANTIBUS, SALUS EXUENTIBUS – ‘Peace to those who enter, health to those who leave’.",

At some moment since the Soviet Union ended, city officials must have decided simply to leave their Lenin Square alone. A huge columned opera house like a domed mosque anchors the square at one end. White lights bathe the dome at night, and at this time of year the dawn comes up behind it. From the opera house stretches a long and wide promenade, and at its terminus Lenin stands on his high marble pedestal, facing forward, one arm upraised, commanding the encircling space. Nearby on his right and at a lower altitude, three soldier-workers back him up, casually holding rifles; on his left, two Soviet citizens, a man and a woman, lift their arms in heroic poses. This Lenin statue is of the genre in which the tails of his topcoat are blown sideways by the winds of history. Less grandly, meltwater had run down his front and then refrozen in small icicles at the bottom of his vest for an unfortunate pubic effect. Snow had accumulated on the statues’ shoulders and mustaches and in the crooks of elbows. The figures appeared to be stone but were actually rough, dark-gray steel, which gonged hollowly when rapped upon.",

So far that summer, Bering Air pilots had ferried seven thousand pounds of it to Provideniya. In other passenger seats were: Karen, fifty-six, a high school counselor; Bill, forty-eight, her husband, a telephone lineman; Briggie, a former high school English and journalism teacher, in her early sixties; and Micky, Briggie’s husband and Karen’s brother, also in his sixties. When I asked Micky what he did, he said, “I’m semiretired. I manage my family’s holdings.” All were from California and enjoyed photography. They hoped to take pictures in Chukotka, and for that they had brought a lot of gear.",

The poem commemorates a vague, perhaps imaginary, kinsman of the poet, a young cornet and standard-bearer in a regiment of horse in 1663. Billeted for a night in a Hungarian frontier castle beyond the Raab, he is woken by frenzied neighing and trumpets sounding boot-and-saddle; there is a roar of burning. The enemy have surrounded and set light to the castle. Tearing himself from the arms of the young châtelaine, he is only just in time to seize the smouldering Colour and rush down the stone steps; the flag bursts into a great flame as he charges into the turbaned ranks and he is lost to sight at last under a sixteen-fold flash of scimitars.",

The seafront there was a rough embankment pierced by dank pedestrian tunnels and topped by a battered coast road known as the Great Highway. Except on rare warm days, the beach was mostly deserted. Winos sprawled in the few sun traps; the homeless sometimes camped there briefly, before the wind and cold drove them away. At high tide, Korean fishermen in rubber boots wrestled with surf-casting rigs. The surf, as you moved south, got generally bigger, more intimidating, with the outer bars farther from shore. Seen from the water, especially when the surf was big, the streets running inland became lineup markers—they told you where you were. In the Sunset, they were named in alphabetical order, from north to south: Irving, Judah, Kirkham, Lawton, Moraga, Noriega, Ortega, Pacheco, Quintara, Rivera, Santiago, Taraval, Ulloa, Vicente, Wawona, and then the oddball, Sloat. You didn’t say you surfed Ocean Beach—you surfed Judah or Taraval or Sloat. South of Sloat Boulevard was the city zoo, beyond which sandy bluffs began to rise and the urban oceanfront—Ocean Beach—ended.",

As the mood grew on him the blood of the earth seemed to flow in his veins, his own to burn in red maple branch and golden shreds of traveller’s joy. It was all part of that mysteriously interwoven texture of the universe, in the thought of which a man could lie down as in his bed. . . .",

Aufschnaiter got hold of a couple of birch trunks which we stripped of their bark and dried before the fire in our room. I started making sticks and straps and with the aid of a carpenter we succeeded in producing two pairs of decent-looking skis. We were delighted with their workmanlike appearance and looked forward to trying them with great excitement. Then, like lightning from a clear sky, came an order from the Pönpo forbidding us to leave Kyirong except for walks in the immediate neighbourhood. We protested energetically, but were told that Germany was a powerful state and that if anything happened to us in the mountains, complaints would be made in Lhasa and the authorities in Kyirong held responsible. The Pönpo remained unshaken by our protestations and did his best to convince us that in the mountains we should be in great danger of attacks by bears, leopards and wild dogs. We knew that their anxiety about our safety was all humbug, but conjectured that they had adopted their attitude in deference to the requests of the superstitious population, who possibly believed that our visits to the mountains might make the gods angry. For the moment we could do nothing but submit.",

Ebbs and flows mere millimeters in depth are just enough to reconfigure, on a regular basis, an entire world of water. Annual floods lasting for months replenish the marshes, bringing fertility to the soils. Seasonal rains cleanse the forests. Fish migrate in the river, sensing what remains of a current, only to spawn in the quiet waters of the ciénagas. Throughout the year, iguanas and lizards seek out the sun in the naked branches of blackwood and macondo trees, while below them, manatees find shelter in the shadows of dense thickets of achira and platanillo, cattails and cane. Stranded in the shallows, sun-bleached roots and trunks torn from the riverbanks protrude from the water like the submerged ribs of mythical beings, as if clues to a mysterious aquatic realm far beneath the surface where men mate with caimans, and spirits disguised as women conceal captive children in dazzling webs of golden hair.",

I plug the holes with small pieces of plastic and lumps of glue from the patching kit, and the floor is momentarily dry. But beads of water find their way around the plugs; the glue doesn’t adhere to damp rubber. After three attempts and two hours of work, using tape, Band-Aids, and a lighter, I finally get a patch to stick, more or less. With the continuous thrashing and incessant wetness, I can’t be assured it will hold but the relative dryness lifts my spirits. Now that I can slowly dry out, life within these rubber walls improves considerably. I have risen, if briefly, from my death bed.",

Yesterday evening I took a change of clothes out of the damp saddle-bags, and put them into what I hoped was a dry place, hut they were soaked, wetter even than those in which I had. been sleeping, and my boots and Deborah's were so stiff, that we gladly availed ourselves of Kaluna's most willing services. The mode of washing was peculiar: he held a calabash with about half-a-pint of water in it, while we bathed our faces and hands, and all the natives looked on and tittered. This was. apparently his idea of politeness, for no persuasion would induce him to put the bowl down on the mat, and Deborah evidently thought it was proper respect. We had a repetition of the same viands as the night before for breakfast, and, as before, the women lay with their chins on their pillows and stared at us.",

From a line between two posts in front of this door three square cloths hung damp and limp, as though recently washed, and a woman’s undergarment of faded pink silk.

The door slams shut behind them, and they are alone with cobwebs and yellowed snapshots, scraps of old bread and framed photographs of themselves when young. The beauty (and pathos) of Burma today derives from the fact that it is stranded amidst decaying remnants of its former glory, and the poignancy of Cuba that in the midst of leafy university quadrangles, you will find bird-spotted tanks. You wind back the clock several decades when you visit a Lonely Place; and when you touch down, you half expect a cabin attendant to announce, “We have now landed in Lonely Place’s Down-at-Heels Airport, where the local time is 1943 and the temperature is … frozen.”",

One kindly woman, concerned about my bandaged foot, always beckoned me to have a glass of herbal tea. During one such respite, two emaciated German males stopped for an afternoon coffee and insisted on eating their own bread – apparently distrusting my friend’s offered selection of grilled banana strips, intestine kebabs and huge fish heads baked in mud. (These, fresh from the river, are delicious; when the mud is removed the scales come with it and the bony bits are so big one has no trouble discarding them.) The older man had a stringy grey pony-tail, his companion was thirtyish with a crew-cut; both were ragged and dirty, suffered from open sores on their faces and looked quite spaced-out. Then, while sitting only ten yards away from me by the edge of the embankment, they began blatantly to fondle each other’s genitals. When my friend turned towards them she almost dropped the coffee glasses. The Lao tolerance of homosexuality had been overstretched; in Laos it is considered ill-bred for even heterosexual couples to so much as hold hands in public, a fact too often forgotten by backpackers.",

I wanted to walk along the Karakoram Highway for many reasons. Mostly because it shadowed the ancient Silk Road, and for centuries people had travelled it on foot, with mules and yaks. I was no explorer or adventurer, but I wanted to add my footsteps to those who had gone before me; and to see the same astonishing mountain ranges. Walking meant I’d have time to properly see the landscape I was moving through; to get a better scale of its mighty immensity. I also wanted a break from the local bus. I was sure I could make Rahimabad well before nightfall the next day if I left early that morning. I had already been to the bazaar to pick up what few provisions I could find there: dried apricots, nuts and a bag of little macaroons so hard they bounced when I let one fall by accident. And I had a bottle of iodine in my rucksack, which I used for purifying water.",

I made my way up the moonless trail, moving slowly in the dark. It took several miles to work the stiffness that had accumulated while I slept out of my body, and the chilly downpour made it take even longer. I flirted with the border of Connecticut and New York, weaving through pastures and forests until I crossed the road near Bull’s Bridge. I expected the rain to relent as the day warmed, but the temperature remained constant. Climbing Ten Mile Hill I sweated into my rain jacket and poncho, only to grow cold and clammy as I made my way down the other side. Finally, I crossed Hoyt Road, entering New York.",

Surely I had much more fun on the reef than they did at the bar, and certainly more fun than I would have had not drinking at Nipper’s.

Jeni and I now have status in Delhi and we don’t want to lose it by dancing badly, so we decide to learn some Bollywood moves. Along with Rebecca, a Melbourne traveler staying with diplomat friends who live nearby, we head off to the neighborhood teacher. We watch a class of ten-year-olds mix some hard-core dance styles—wriggling their hips and making some sensual eye movements. Then it’s our turn. The teacher, Reshna, is in her mid-twenties, with gorgeous big eyes that betray she is dubious about our desire to dance. Still, she shrugs, leads us in a bow to Shiva and shows us some moves. Within half an hour we are wet with sweat and tears of laughter and our backs are aching. The dancing is like liturgical gone luscious, involving acting out every word sung. We point to our eyes and flick our hips as we sing “look at our pretty eyes.” We shake our heads and wag our fingers as we say “don’t you tease me.” We open and close our imaginary dupattas, walk with water jugs and learn to head-jerk, hip-roll and shoulder-shimmy. Rebecca is fantastic, especially at the shoulder moves, Jeni likes the jumps, while my favorite action involves slapping my hands together and twisting them. (Reshna says this means “I will say bad words at you.”)",

In this case the motive—Yankee determination to collect a debt—was perhaps a more compelling one than wanderlust or exploration. In 1804, a young sea captain named John D’Wolf sailed the 206-ton three-masted brig Juno loaded with trade goods and provisions from Bristol, Rhode Island, around Cape Horn and then north to the Russian settlements in Alaska. In New Archangel (present-day Sitka), he sold not only all his supplies but also the ship itself to Alexander Baranov, manager of the Russian American Company. Not having the $50,000 purchase price, Baranov gave D’Wolf a note payable at the company’s offices at St. Petersburg. D’Wolf wintered in New Archangel. The next year, in a small ship Baranov provided, he sailed to Kamchatka. There he spent another winter. The next year he sailed to Okhotsk. While crossing the Sea of Okhotsk, he had the experience of running up on the back of a drowsing whale. The ship sat there for a while until the whale submerged.",

High sierra scrub gave way to dry, subtropical vegetation, dominated by Seussian cacti shaped like gigantic asparagus stalks.
