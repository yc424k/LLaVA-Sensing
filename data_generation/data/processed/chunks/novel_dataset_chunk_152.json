    "target_paragraph": "Like a nun withdrawing, or a child exploring a tower, she went, upstairs, paused at the window, came to the bathroom. There was the green linoleum and a tap dripping. There was an emptiness about the heart of life; an attic room. Women must put off their rich apparel. At midday they must disrobe. She pierced the pincushion and laid her feathered yellow hat on the bed. The sheets were clean, tight stretched in a broad white band from side to side. Narrower and narrower would her bed be. The candle was half burnt down and she had read deep in Baron Marbot’s Memoirs.* She had read late at night of the retreat from Moscow. For the House* sat so long that Richard insisted, after her illness, that she must sleep undisturbed. And really she preferred to read of the retreat from Moscow. He knew it. So the room was an attic; the bed narrow; and lying there reading, for she slept badly, she could not dispel a virginity preserved through childbirth which clung to her like a sheet. Lovely in girlhood, suddenly there came a moment—for example on the river beneath the woods at Clieveden*—when, through some contraction of this cold spirit, she had failed him. And then at Constantinople,* and again and again. She could see what she lacked. It was not beauty; it was not mind. It was something central which permeated; something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and woman, or of women together. For that she could dimly perceive. She resented it, had a scruple picked up Heaven knows where, or, as she felt, sent by Nature (who is invariably wise); yet she could not resist sometimes yielding to the charm of a woman, not a girl, of a woman confessing, as to her they often did, some scrape, some folly. And whether it was pity, or their beauty, or that she was older, or some accident—like a faint scent, or a violin next door (so strange is the power of sounds at certain moments), she did undoubtedly then feel what men felt. Only for a moment; but it was enough. It was a sudden revelation, a tinge like a blush which one tried to check and then, as it spread, one yielded to its expansion, and rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the world come closer, swollen with some astonishing significance, some pressure of rapture, which split its thin skin and gushed and poured with an extraordinary alleviation over the cracks and sores. Then, for that moment, she had seen an illumination; a match burning in a crocus; an inner meaning almost expressed. But the close withdrew; the hard softened. It was over—the moment. Against such moments (with women too) there contrasted (as she laid her hat down) the bed and Baron Marbot and the candle half-burnt. Lying awake, the floor creaked; the lit house was suddenly darkened, and if she raised her head she could just hear the click of the handle released as gently as possible by Richard, who slipped upstairs in his socks and then, as often as not, dropped his hot-water bottle and swore! How she laughed!",

My rucksack was grabbed from me and heaved on to Michaelis’ great shoulder. Andreas Kallergis took my book and bottle of wine.

The guidebook mentioned a Top End Frontier Hotel, and a tourist leaflet I acquired at the airport listed a Darwin City Frontier Hotel, and yet another listed an All Seasons Premier Darwin Central Hotel. All of these we spied, distantly, as we drove around for the next forty minutes, squabbling quietly in the manner of a fractious married couple. We stopped about half a dozen pedestrians, but none had heard of an All Seasons Frontier Hotel, except one man who thought it was at Kakadu, two hundred kilometers to the east. With the aid of a small, inadequate map I directed Allan down a series of streets, which proved always to end at a pedestrianized zone or a cul-desac of loading bays, to his increasing exasperation.",

Sometimes I glimpse a round babushka, tight black wool dress hugging her hunched back, black kerchief over her hair.

That distinction belongs to a spot called Dunnet Head, five or six miles away down a nearby single-lane road, so I went there now.

Women liked him, laughed at him, pulled fondly the thick golden curls of his hair. He was sentimentally tender to children – girls of fourteen years. He had a grand romantic feeling for Delia Selborne, the oldest daughter of Mrs Selborne. He bought her presents, was tender and irritable by turns. Once, at Gant’s, on the porch under an August moon and the smell of ripening grapes, he caressed her while Helen sang in the parlour. He caressed her gently, leaned his head over her, and said he would like to lay it on her b-b-b-b- breast. Eugene watched them bitterly, with an inch of poison round his heart. He wanted the girl for himself: she was stupid, but she had the wise body and faint hovering smile of her mother. He wanted Mrs Selborne more, he fantasied passionately about her yet, but her image lived again in Delia. As a result, he was proud, cold, scornful and foolish before them. They disliked him.",

Gone a second time, and I have lost him now for ever … and he will not love me the littlest bit ever any more – only hate me … O yes, I have lost him now – again because of – you!’ In writhing, with her head on the chair, she turned her face towards the door, and Mrs Brooks could see the pain upon it; and that her lips were bleeding from the clench of her teeth upon them, and that the long lashes of her closed eyes stuck in wet tags to her cheeks. She continued: ‘And he is dying – he looks as if he is dying! … And my sin will kill him and not kill me! … O, you have torn my life all to pieces … made me a victim, a caged bird! … My own true husband will never, never – O God – I can’t bear this! – I cannot!’",

The younger generations spoke Hebrew but out of respect for the elders Shaul insisted on practising his Arabic. Its imperfections served a useful purpose: occasional smiles and giggles broke the tension. We sat on blanket rolls in a neat, clean living-room where large photographs of Arafat and Mahmoud Darwish flanked something unexpected. This copy of the 1947 UN Partition map included Beersheba, Acre and Nahariya in the proposed Arab state, with Jaffa as an Arab enclave and Jerusalem as an international zone. As I stood studying it Shaul clicked his fingers and said sharply – ‘Sit down! We all wonder “What if ….” But let’s focus on the future.’",

As the sky began to change color, three Tibetans picked up a body, wrapped it from head to toe in bandages, and gave it to the flames.

In the low light of the late October evening, it was hard to see clearly, but Bartlett fully understood the sounds and he followed them, craning his head at the shearing and grinding noises fore and aft. Bartlett pulled his fur hat down over his ears and turned his face from the biting, blizzard-driven wind, snow slashing at his cheeks. Using a lantern, he could just make out long, snaking cracks in the ice all around the ship, with a large seam about fifty yards away along the port side, and another rift running just off the bow. He called for Ned Golightly, the seaman who’d been on watch, to get all hands on deck and ready.",

I pitched in as soon as I felt better and, in the evenings when the sun’s rays moved farther west to bake other lands in intolerable heat, we walked down the long jetty toward a shady bar, crossing a bridge where, underneath in the water, men bathed their stately steeds. The Maltese were avid horse and sulky racers and it wasn’t a rare sight to see the teams trotting along the streets.",

These crude concrete monuments, not tended by anyone, seemed forlorn against their background of mangroves. Several breaks in this mangrove barrier gave access to the sandless limestone shore, where broken diving-boards and collapsed picnic huts – provided for snorkellers – recalled Hurricane Michelle. In 2001 an eighteen-foot wave devastated this coast, sweeping away hundreds of thatched huts, never rebuilt. The whole region had been evacuated the day before and these cenagueros (swamp people) now endure over-crowded conditions in Playa Giron and continue to burn mangrove charcoal. Before Michelle, this strip of coast was striving for a slice of the tourism cake. Outside its one small restaurant, closed at 8.00 a.m., I watched three turkey vultures, ungainly when grounded, squabbling over the scattered contents of garbage bins. A white-haired mulatta, hanging laundry on the restaurant balcony, invited me to rest and wait for a lift; but I wasn’t yet overheated.",

The cafe in the museum’s basement is filled with tables groaning under delectable gooey salads, ceramic platters of jewel-like beets and carrots, glass bowls of salty herring and smoked fishes with their attendant loaves of rye and pumpernickel bread, and of course the full array of goulashes, soups, potatoes (both latkes and mashed), and desserts. Even this appetizing spread can’t stifle the needling voice of dismay that’s been whining its mantra of “Shame on you,” ever since I left the hotel.

Numerous attractive beaches nestle at the bottom of the rocky cliffs, many only reachable by boat or dangerous footpaths. Deserted except for a few young people with a guitar, the Spiaggia del Tono (tone beach) that probably took its name from the deafening sounds of the sea, was a steep walk down from my hotel, past empty parking lots and a vast spa complex that occupied an extended seafront area, but was only open a few months a year. I lay on my towel listening to the crashing of the waves that obliterated the strumming just a stone’s throw away. The lounge chairs and umbrellas of the summer concessionaires would still be several months away. The Grotticelle beach situated on the other side of the point was quieter from nature’s standpoint, but had a bit more human activity early in the season.",

Asterius of Amasia scolded his congregation: ‘You change your wives like your clothes, and build new bride-chambers as casually as stalls at a fair.’ St John Chrysostom blamed the city’s famously lascivious theatre: ‘When you seat yourself in a theatre and feast your eyes on the naked limbs of women, you are pleased for a time, but then, what a violent fever you have generated! Once your head is filled with such sights and the songs that go with them, you think about them even in your dreams. You would not choose to see a naked woman in the marketplace, yet you eagerly attend the theatre. What difference does it make if the stripper is a whore? It would be better to smear our faces with mud than to behold such spectacles.’",

The previous one, the original Trakt, used to run through the woods just to the north. She had never heard of any pillar such as Kennan had described. Following her directions, we went down a brushy lane until it ended at a collection of trash piles, and then Sergei and I continued on foot into deep forest with weeds and underbrush over our heads sometimes. Rain had fallen the night before and our clothes were soon soaked through, while grass seeds covered us all over. The woman had said that exiles who died along the road were buried beside the old Trakt, and you could still see the mounds. We did find mounds on either side of a declivity among the trees, and its barely visible path could once have been a roadway. But the mosquitoes were coming at us so madly that we had to wave our hands before us like windshield wipers on the fastest setting, and I soon decided that Kennan’s pillar, if it did perhaps exist somewhere in these thickets, would not be found by me.",

It had originally been a Buddhist nunnery, but around the end of the Edo period it was dismantled and moved to its current site in the grounds of the Tenmangu Shrine. The gate, from another temple further into the mountains, was moved here at about the same time. The house then took on a second life as the shrine-keeper’s home, and also doubled as the village school. But after the 1930s there was no more shrine-keeper, so the house was rented out to local residents. In recent years, nobody had wanted to live in such an old and dirty house, so it lay vacant. Though at a loss to imagine why a foreigner would want to live in such a place, the priest decided then and there that I could rent it.",

After a friendly greeting we went on, but this time we followed the road by which we had come to the robber camp. There was now no question of going forward—we had to retrace our steps. Unarmed as we were, to continue would have meant certain death. After a forced march we arrived in the evening at the home of the friendly family with whom we had stayed two nights before. They were not surprised to hear of our experiences and told us that the Khampas’ encampment was called Gyak Bongra, a name which inspired fear throughout the countryside. After this adventure it was a blessing to be able to spend a peaceful night with friendly people.",

There was one young man who was always alone; he looked different to the others, and they ignored him. He had shaved half of his head, and the hair that was left was long, blond and floppy, reminiscent of the post-punks of Camden Town. His Oxfam overcoat stood out next to the brightly coloured German outdoor gear, and he looked pinched and unhealthy, whereas the others exuded vigour. On the second night I shared a bottle of pisco with him. He was a British climber, and he had just spent five weeks getting to the top of Torre Central in Paine. That granite tower, over 7500 feet high and with a 3600-foot face, has only been conquered by thirteen teams since the first man stood on the summit in 1963. Paul had slept in a tent he had made at home in Wales which hung from one point on the rock, suspended over half a mile of empty space. When he got to the top he and his partner only stayed there a minute because they were afraid they would be blown away. They used half a mile of rope and had allowed themselves to take up one book each. Paul had chosen a physics text book. He had been sponsored by the top climbing equipment firms, but was planning on selling all his gear in Bariloche, an Argentinian resort, to raise cash for a ticket home. He was diffident, even difficult, and he chose his words carefully, the antithesis of the strident backpackers; although he wrote pieces for the climbing press he said he found it painful because for him climbing was an intensely personal experience. His vision was to marshal all his mind, all his body and all his spirit to climb higher. Over the next two days I coaxed stories out of him, the pupils of his eyes as small as the hearts of grey cornflowers in the sunshine of the top deck.",

(Britain and Ireland, sharing a lurch into excessive drinking as a hobby, have much to learn from Cuba. Castroism has made drunkenness socially unacceptable and alcohol quite an elusive commodity – easily done, when a government is not in thrall to corporate interests.) I was about to take a horse-bus towards the centre when, outside the Astro bus terminus, a delivery man appeared carrying two crates of Hatuey. Following him into a bare little yard, behind a high blank wall, I saw five rickety round tables shaded by torn umbrellas. There was no counter, no shelving: one fetched Hatuey (only) from a small window in the bus station’s rear wall. The young barman hesitated to serve a tourist: I should have been elsewhere, drinking Buccanero or Kristal. But he was a kind – and honest – young man who broke the law for this exhausted abuela and declined my profferred convertible peso, insisting on the correct Hatuey price: NP18.",

Although it was only the second of August a damp autumn draught pervaded the station. Shivering, we went into the sort of sheep-pen in which our luggage was searched for dutiable articles, Edelgard most inconsiderately leaving me to bear the entire burden of opening and shutting our things, while she huddled into a corner and assumed (very conveniently) the air of a sufferer. I had to speak to her quite sharply once when I could not fit the key of her portmanteau into its lock and remind her that I am not a lady’s maid, but even this did not rouse her, and she continued to huddle apathetically. It is absurd for a wife to collapse at the very moment when she ought to be most helpful; the whole theory of the helpmeet is shattered by such behaviour. And what can I possibly know about Customs? She looked on quite unmoved while I struggled to replace the disturbed contents of our bags, and my glances, in turn appealing and indignant, did not make her even raise her head. There were too many strangers between us for me to be able to do more than glance, so reserving what I had to say for a more private moment I got the bags shut as well as I could, directed the most stupid porter (who was also apparently deaf, for each time I said anything to him he answered perfectly irrelevantly with the first letter of the alphabet) I have ever met to conduct me and the luggage to the refreshment room, and far too greatly displeased with Edelgard to take any further notice of her, walked on after the man leaving her to follow or not as she chose.",

Here and there, infrequently, a clearing moved into view—a space, open for about twenty yards, in which a path could be seen leading to the water, and in the distance a little jumble of clay-walled houses. Sometimes there were women and children playing in the water. They, too, carried on long conversations with my boatmen. Often everyone shouted with laughter, so that I longed to know the joke. We stopped for a rest at one of these places. People stood around and stared as I ate the box lunch I'd brought from the Stanleyville hotel. In such circumstances, it was hard to chew in a natural manner. Eventually, I fought back by staring at them, especially the women, asking myself if any of them were like Abanzima. I didn't think they could be. I could see no beauty in any of these females, hair twisted into rows of tiny topknots like coiled wire, some of the bodies bare above the waist. So many pairs of naked breasts abashed me, especially as few of them were up to Greek or Balinese standards.",

Eating gruel pour la galerie is a pitiable state to be reduced to—surely no lower depths of humiliation are conceivable. And then, just as I was drearily remembering how little I loved gruel, there was a sudden sound of wheels rolling swiftly round the corner of the house, a great rattling and trampling in the still night over the stones, and tearing open the window and leaning out, there, sitting in a station fly, and apparelled to my glad vision in celestial light, I beheld the Man of Wrath, come home unexpectedly to save me.",

    "target_paragraph": "Towards the end of The Ukimwi Road I wrote: ‘Having sniffed the air south of the Zambezi, I felt Zimbabwe to be not a continuation of Black Africa but – both historically and emotionally – the beginning of South Africa.’ This is hardly surprising. Most of the original white settlers, the Rhodes-funded Pioneers, came from South Africa in 1890 and soon apartheid (known as ‘parallel development’) was flourishing in Southern Rhodesia. The Reserves were the equivalent of South Africa’s ‘homelands’, infertile places of banishment for ‘surplus people’. Southern Rhodesia was established not as a new colony ruled from London but as a commercial enterprise run by the British South Africa Company. When the Pioneers failed to find another gold-bearing Rand they turned to farming, with small-scale mining as a secondary interest. In 1897 an official British government report noted that slavery – delicately described as ‘compulsory labour’ – was widespread, as was the use of the sjambok to make that labour more productive. However, Rhodes’ diamond-and-gold-based omnipotence tempted London to ignore his company’s ill-treatment of the ‘natives’. A century later the residue of that brutal tradition remains obvious enough to shock newcomers.",
