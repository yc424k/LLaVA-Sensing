This white-haired ancient had served the thirteenth Dalai Lama in the same capacity and had remained in the service. This was a great tribute to his trustworthiness and loyalty, for in Tibet when there is a change of masters, there is a change of servants. The Dalai Lama proposed that I should visit his family who lived in the Norbulingka during the summer. He told me to wait in their house till he should send for me.

In the bazaars the barbers are shaving the businessmen and the derzi are bent over their sewing machines. There are garish film hoardings at the corners and beneath them there are men selling samosas and men selling fruit. There are quacks and cobblers and women in black calico cowls. There are children, everywhere and all about, flying kites and playing cricket, scuttling after the bullock carts and chasing the pi-dogs. Most evenings we would wander through these bazaars, or perhaps visit the Shalimar gardens. I would sit and write my logbook while Mozaffar would tell us the names of the trees: the eucalyptus, the banyans, the deodar and the mulberries. Lou would sketch.",

The only really bad thing was the terror I felt of being lost, astray, naked, shivering in a world that seemed imminently brutal... . Half an hour after I got back, I was at Heh-ven's, the cronies listening to my blow-by-blow report, expressing, according to their characters, admiration, skepticism, or envy.

This evening, Mr Mandela flew back from his Transkei home to address the nation (black, white, Coloured, Indian – the nation, not just his own ANC following) and all SABC TV and radio channels were made available to him though the SABC remains under government control. Exactly twelve hours after the murder of his close friend, he took over not only the airwaves but the leadership of his country. This is not, after all, just one more tension-building crisis. It marks the de facto end of white rule: now President de Klerk is irrelevant and only Nelson Mandela has the moral authority to avert chaos.",

But Flush, for all his softness and silkiness, had eyes that blazed; had passions that leapt not merely in bright flame but sunk and smouldered. He resolved to meet his enemy face to face and alone. No third person should interrupt this final conflict. It should be fought out by the principals themselves. On the afternoon of Tuesday, the 21st of July, therefore, he slipped downstairs and waited in the hall. He had not long to wait. Soon he heard the tramp of the familiar footstep in the street; he heard the familiar rap on the door. Mr Browning was admitted. Vaguely aware of the impending attack and determined to meet it in the most conciliatory of spirits, Mr Browning had come provided with a parcel of cakes. There was Flush waiting in the hall. Mr Browning made, evidently, some well-meant attempt to caress him; perhaps he even went so far as to offer him a cake. The gesture was enough. Flush sprang upon his enemy with unparalleled violence. His teeth once more met in Mr Browning’s trousers. But unfortunately in the excitement of the moment he forgot what was most essential – silence. He barked; he flung himself on Mr Browning, barking loudly. The sound was sufficient to alarm the household. Wilson rushed downstairs. Wilson beat him soundly. Wilson overpowered him completely. Wilson led him in ignominy away. Ignominy it was – to have attacked Mr Browning, to have been beaten by Wilson. Mr Browning had not lifted a finger. Taking his cakes with him, Mr Browning proceeded unhurt, unmoved, in perfect composure, upstairs, alone to the bedroom. Flush was led away.",

He was sitting on the firestep, his unslung rifle propped beside him, himself half-propped, half-reclining against the trench-wall, his boots and putties not caked with the drying mud of trenches but dusted with the recent powdery dust of roads; even his attitude showed not so much indolence, but fatigue, physical exhaustion. Except that it was not spent exhaustion, but the contrary: with something tense behind it, so that the exhaustion did not seem to possess him, but rather he seemed to wear it as he did the dust, sitting there for five or six minutes now, all of which he had spent talking, and with nothing of exhaustion in his voice either. Back in the old spanking time called peace, he had been not only a successful architect, but a good one, even if (in private life) an aesthete and even a little precious; at this hour of those old dead days, he would have been sitting in a Soho restaurant or studio (or, his luck good, even in a Mayfair drawing room or even—at least once or twice or perhaps three times—boudoir), doing a little more than his share of the talking about art or politics or life or both or all three. He had been among the first London volunteers, a private at Loos; without even a lance corporal’s stripe on his sleeve, he had extricated his platoon and got it back alive across the Canal; he commanded the platoon for five days at Passchendaele and was confirmed in it, posted from the battlefield to officers’ school and had carried his single pip for five months into 1916 on the night when he came off duty and entered the dugout where his company commander was shaving out of a Maconochie tin.",

Then our evening was marred by Rachel’s falling over a mini-cliff while peeing Niagara-wise in the dusk. Luckily it was only a ten-foot drop; in these parts it could have been 2,000 feet.

Besides, those particular vows were, anyhow, unmentionable. She knew they were, because the minute one approached the subject, in thought or speech, one felt hot. She did, anyway. So confusing, too, renouncing temptations one had never had and didn't really know about. The nearest she ever got to a fleshly temptation was her hot-water bottle. She supposed it must be a fleshly temptation, because of the extreme pleasure she felt whenever she gave way to it. Sometimes, in moments which Miles, she shamefacedly was sure, would call, if he knew about them, wanton--after a better meal than usual, or when she wasn't quite so tired--her thoughts would run away with her, and she would imagine that a husband might perhaps be like a glorified hot-water bottle; a hot-water bottle enlarged to life-size; deliciously pervading and warming one's cold, lonely bed. And sometimes, when she really ached with longing for what she was never going to have, she would fish the smooth india-rubber thing up from her feet, and hold it with both arms close to her breast, and pretend it was a baby--her very own, darling, sweet, cuddly, gurgly little baby. After such thoughts, however, and after such actions, she was, for days, wretched with repentance.",

Shocknessy Ohio Turnpike in the rolling rural emptiness between Cleveland and Toledo, and highway mindlessness once more seeped in. To relieve the tedium I switched on the radio. In fact, I had been switching it on and off all day, listening for a while but then giving up in despair. Unless you have lived through it, you cannot conceive of the sense of hopelessness that comes with hearing Hotel California by the Eagles for the fourteenth time in three hours. You can feel your brain cells disappearing with little popping sounds. But it’s the disc jockeys that make it intolerable. Can there anywhere be a breed of people more irritating and imbecilic than disc jockeys? In South America there is a tribe of Indians called the Janamanos, who are so backward they cannot even count to three. Their counting system goes: ‘One, two . . . oh, gosh, a whole bunch.’ Obviously disc jockeys have a better dress sense and possess a little more in the way of social skills, but I think we are looking at a similar level of mental acuity.",

Tufts of flowery broom scented the air. The soil, so recently drenched by the miraculous shower of rain, was once more dry and dusty; its fragile flowers wilted in the sirocco. And still the young man marched ahead. Always upwards! The landscape grew more savage. They bent round a corner and gound themselves skirting a precipice. The bishop glanced down in trepidation. There lay the sea, with not a boat in sight. As he continued to look the horizon oscillated; the ground sank under his feet and blue waters seemed to heave and rise up towards him. He shut his eyes in a fit of dizziness and grasped a rock. Its burning touch revived him.",

It was a pleasant feeling and the idea was to allow the sensation to enter through your feet, until you eventually became the shaking. This soon grew a bit dull and I was glad when the second stage began, which involved dancing any way your body wished to. As the third stage commenced, which involved ‘witnessing whatever was happening’ – inside and out – I sensed something behind me. Turning around, I witnessed a blindfolded girl kicking and thumping at the air, wrenching at her blonde hair. She went through a routine of punching to the right, then kicking to the left, before grabbing fistfuls of her hair and yanking her neck from side to side. Ed had moved away from her and was lingering nervously by a pillar. For the last 15 minutes we lay down in silence and I dozed off amid a symphony of farts. As we left the auditorium and wandered back across to the main compound, I felt quite calm, but no more so than when I had first arrived. Feeling peckish, we stopped at a self-service café for a croissant and a cup of coffee. From the varieties of marmalade, fig jam and tahini, I picked out a jar of Nutella and spooned a dollop onto my plate, before licking the spoon clean and looking around for a place to leave it. A server walked past as I waved the spoon, snatched it from my hand and shoved it straight back into the jar, forbidden germs and all. Ed almost had a seizure.",

The icy wind howled most of the night, but bundled up in my tent, my heart was full of pride and joy. I was elated by our achievement as a team, and our growth and resilience from this incredible adventure. I knew my friends and I had forged an unbreakable bond of sisterhood through this journey.

Once I reach the aviary, I set out into the surrounding jungle following the sweat-drenched clumps of volunteers and begin to swing my machete wildly. It’s the first time I’ve ever wielded a machete, and the excitement lasts a few quick minutes before it hits me what a bad idea this is. A worse idea than sending me out to walk a puma? It’s impossible to keep track of all the other hungover volunteers, also madly wielding blades—probably too blunt to mistakenly remove someone’s appendage, but I cannot be certain. Spines of bamboo darken my vision, trying to take out my eyes. Packs of mosquitoes steal my blood quicker than I can swipe them away. Innocuous, thin beige trees are infested to the core with ants. If you touch them, which I invariably do, it feels like you’re being burnt by a thousand cigarettes. When I accidently hit one with my machete, fire ants swarm over me in vicious anger and I scream, thinking someone has thrown boiling tar across my scalp. It is Harry—why it has to be Harry, I don’t know—who helps me get them off and tries at the same time not to laugh too hard.",

You cant even sit in the courthouse yard for them. First thing you know, bing. Right on your hat. But it would take a millionaire to afford to shoot them at five cents a shot. If they’d just put a little poison out there in the square, they’d get rid of them in a day, because if a merchant cant keep his stock from running around the square, he’d better try to deal in something besides chickens, something that dont eat, like plows or onions.
