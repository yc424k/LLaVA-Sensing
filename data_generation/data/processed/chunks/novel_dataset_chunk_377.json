The older generation, who grew up in traditional gloom, wanted only to escape from all those shadows, so they greeted the advent of the fluorescent light with joy. The younger generation knows little else. In the West, people typically reserve fluorescent lights for kitchens, workspaces and offices, while the use of incandescent lamps, ceiling lights and spotlights for living and dining rooms is so standard as to be taken for granted. So visitors to Japan are unprepared for the complete and utter victory of fluorescent lighting, whose flat bluish glare has penetrated homes, museums, hotels, everywhere. Recently I spoke to a group of students of interior design and asked them how many had thought about illumination and done something to decrease the fluorescent lighting in their homes. Of forty students, there was only one.",

I do not know how they have done it, but they have jumped on every opportunity imaginable to acquire major tracts of land. In 1992, the Assynt Crofters’ Trust took title to North Assynt Estate (21,300 acres). The Culag Woodlands thirty-six hectares went into long term lease with the Culag Community Woodland (CCWT) Trust in 1995. CCWT then acquired the 2,900 acre Little Assynt Estate in 2000. The community talked the John Muir Trust into purchasing Quinag Estate, 8,400 acres, in 2005 including Quinag Mountain (809m). This was because they were already very busy buying the Glencanisp and Drumrunie Estates (44,594 acres), a £2.9m purchase concluded that same year. In 2011, the Assynt Community Association bought Culag Park, a public open space that abuts the Mission.",

One bed was mine; the other five were occupied by women who possessed a minimum of two infants apiece – all being fed and changed at the time of my appearance. Both window and door were tightly sealed and the stink was appalling, so I got hold of an Indian, also staying here, and used him as interpreter to tell the proprietor that (a) The Shah condemned the segregation of women, (b) The Government was trying to encourage tourism and (c) I was prepared to respect religious conventions within reason but was not prepared to lock myself up for hours in a room like that when I could be sitting in a courtyard like this. The proprietor said, ‘Very well, if you don’t mind being stared at’, to which I irritably replied that I’d been getting stared at by every man I met for thirty-two days and that if they had nothing better to do I didn’t really mind.",

For this was the summer cool spell and there was a vividness in the air, a presage of the golden days of frost and yellowing persimmons in the wornout fields, and of sweet small grapes in the matted vines along the sandy branches, and the scent of cooking sorghum upon the smoky air.

Roast corn-cobs came and trout from the mountains; cherries, then strawberries, apricots and peaches, and, finally, wonderful melons and raspberries. The scarlet blaze of paprika – there were two kinds on the table, one of them fierce as gunpowder – was cooled by cucumber cut thin as muslin and by soda splashed into glasses of wine already afloat with ice; this had been fetched from an igloo-like undercroft among the trees where prudent hands had stacked it six months before, when – it was impossible to imagine it! – snow covered all. Waggons creaked under loads of apricots, yet the trees were still laden; they scattered the dust, wasps tunnelled them and wheels and foot-falls flattened them to a yellow pulp; tall wooden vats bubbled among the dusty sunflowers, filling the yards with the sweet and heady smell of their fermentation; and soon, even at midday, the newly distilled spirit began to bowl the peasants over like a sniper, flinging the harvesters prostrate and prone in every fragment of shadow. They snored among sheaves and haycocks and a mantle of flies covered them while the flocks crammed together under every spread of branches, and not a leaf moved.",

According to the Shaykh, the first step of Sufism was not related to Friday prayers or empty rituals, but with the mastery of the maxim: ‘Whatever you do not wish to be done to yourself, do not wish it to happen to others; wish for yourself what you wish for others also.’",

I crossed Kongens Nytorv, one of the city’s principal squares, sleepy and green, passed beneath the soft lights of the Hotel D’Angleterre, full of yet more happy diners, and headed up Strøget, Copenhagen’s main shopping street. Strøget is the world’s longest pedestrian street. Actually it’s five streets that run together for a little over a mile between Kongens Nytorv and the city’s other main square, Raadhuspladsen, at the Tivoli end. Every travel article you read about Copenhagen talks rapturously about Strøget, but I always feel vaguely disappointed by it. Every time I see it, it seems to have grown a tiny bit seedier. There are still many swish and diverting stores down at the Kongens Nytorv end ? Georg Jensen for silver, Brødrene Andersen for clothes, Holmegaard for china and glass ? but as you pass the half-way point Strøget swiftly deteriorates into tatty gift shops and McDonald’s, Burger Kings and other brightly lit temples of grease. The whole thing could do with a lot more in the way of benches and flagstones (it’s all patched asphalt now) and even ? dare I say it? ? the odd tub of geraniums. It’s a shame that in a country as wealthy and design-conscious as Denmark they can’t make the whole street ? the words tumble involuntarily from my lips ? more picturesque.",

Two women waved and smiled at the Trio, Ernesto knew everybody and some banter was exchanged. Not long after, in a more open area of high rocks and bushy thickets, our path abruptly ended at the mouth of a deep dark underground cavern filled by a lake, one corner just visible from above. Huge boulders, damp and slippy, formed a natural stairway and that water, guaranteed ‘frio’ by Ernesto, did look tempting. Yet I again became a separatist to guard our rucksack; the two youths crouching in nearby bushes, not showing the usual Cuban friendly curiosity, made me uneasy.",

    "target_paragraph": "JASPER'S favourite walk led him to a spot distant perhaps a mile and a half from home. From a tract of common he turned into a short lane which crossed the Great Western railway, and thence by a stile into certain meadows forming a compact little valley. One recommendation of this retreat was that it lay sheltered from all winds; to Jasper a wind was objectionable. Along the bottom ran a clear, shallow stream, overhung with elder and hawthorn bushes; and close by the wooden bridge which spanned it was a great ash tree, making shadow for cows and sheep when the sun lay hot upon the open field. It was rare for anyone to come along this path, save farm labourers morning and evening.\nBut to-day – the afternoon that followed his visit to John Yule's house – he saw from a distance that his lounging place on the wooden bridge was occupied. Someone else had discovered the pleasure there was in watching the sun-flecked sparkle of the water as it flowed over the clean sand and stones. A girl in a yellow straw hat; yes, and precisely the person he had hoped, at the first glance, that it might be. He made no haste as he drew nearer on the descending path. At length his footstep was heard; Marian Yule turned her head and clearly recognized him.\nShe assumed an upright position, letting one of her hands rest upon the rail. After the exchange of ordinary greetings, Jasper leaned back against the same support and showed himself disposed for talk.\n‘When I was here late in the spring,’ he said, ‘this ash was only just budding, though everything else seemed in full leaf.’\n‘An ash, is it?’ murmured Marian. ‘I didn't know. I think an oak is the only tree I can distinguish. Yet,’ she added quickly, ‘I knew that the ash was late; some lines of Tennyson come to my memory.’\n‘Which are those?’\n‘Delaying, as the tender ash delays\nTo clothe herself, when all the woods are green,",

To alter the arrangement meant uncleating the preventers, retrimming the sails and rerigging the pole. Then, just when I thought that we were in for a night of calm downwind sailing, the wind would veer around 180 degrees to the west, requiring the spinnaker pole to be taken down altogether and preparations made for beating. Just then, the wind would invariably increase to the point where I had to take in reefs. That maneuver accomplished, it would wane. Eventually, the engine and Autohelm would take over the sailing responsibilities, whereupon the wind would return from the east in feeble puffs and the pole would have to be reemployed.",

She set the date before she went to bed and held to it stubbornly, refusing even to rise and attend the christening. That day fell on Sunday. It was late in June and jasmine drifted into the house in steady waves. Narcissa and the nurse, in an even more gaudy turban, had brought the baby, bathed and garnished and scented in his ceremonial robes, in to her, and later she heard them drive away in the carriage, and then the house was still again. The curtains stirred peacefully at the windows, and all the peaceful scents of summer came up on the sunny breeze, and sounds—birds, somewhere a Sabbath bell, and Elnora’s voice, chastened a little by her recent bereavement but still rich and mellow as she went about getting dinner. She sang sadly and endlessly and without words as she moved about the kitchen, but she broke off short when she looked around and saw Miss Jenny looking a little frail but dressed and erect as ever, in the door.",

    "target_paragraph": "The four great obelisk compositions are at Saint Peter’s, in Piazza del Popolo, with Castor and Pollux on the Quirinal, and in Piazza Navona, but this is the most gracious and subtle in another scale. It is what makes the piazza (the Rotonda) a clubroom, and more a daytime one, and for men, not for the whole human show like other piazzas, and not political either—the public affairs club-room is a few blocks away in Piazza Colonna, around the newspaper bulletins. The sense of touch is especially strong here, the space being tiny in relation to the dark immensity of the Pantheon columns and their associations.* There is a jungle craziness in the proportions, crushing on short acquaintance, of which the modest obelisk with a cross on top and the water, the whole raised by a few steps, are the secret balancing-point. The basin is of utmost grace, with the usual sadistic details, little monster faces cheek to cheek and upended dolphins—formal elegances of the language, which is outside of pity, and the water keeps its peculiar holiness. There is something of the sacred grove about this square, which affects its more or less hobo occupants, and it was surely from the sense of this that Piranesi gave so strange a perspective to his best etching of it, putting the Pantheon off at an impossible distance with the little fountain grandly spreading in the foreground.",

These resting places are everywhere along the trading routes, some of them so ancient that the great trees have long since died, leaving two round holes in a stonework oval platform. Like the tea houses and the broad stepping-stones that are built into the hills, the rest walls impart a blessedness to this landscape, as if we had wandered into a lost country of the golden age.",

The tradition goes all the way back to Wang Xizhi in the fourth century, who would gather his friends at the Orchid Terrace, where they floated wine cups down the river while writing poems. Wine is the perfect companion to calligraphy. I once owned a folding screen by the Edo literati Kameda Bosai, written with an unbelievably wild brush. His usual ‘earthworm’ kanji had become eels, swimming madly across the paper. Looking over the twelve panels of the screen, you could see the characters squirming more agitatedly as Bosai moved from right to left, until on the last panel his kanji looked more like Arabic than Chinese. At the end, he had signed, ‘Written by old man Bosai, totally drunk’.",
