Never. Has any man ever attained to inner harmony by pondering the experiences of others? Not since the world began! He must pass through the fire.'\"",

He seemed like an old ne'er-do-well in priests' black, and he talked loudly, almost to himself, as drunken people do. At once he must show the Fiori how to cut up the tree, he must have the axe from Paolo. He shouted to Maria for a glass of wine.

The priest drained the tumblerful of wine at one drink, his thin throat with its Adam's apple working. And he did not pay the penny.",

Centuries spent in the far north had left their chill in the old church’s bones, I imagined. Either that, or the dark of the winters, the long silence after the last prayer died, had leached into them like tannin. Frontier religion is sometimes the most desperate kind; and I am not the first to point out that harshness of doctrine and coldness of climate often keep each other company.",

She most earnestly wished to do her duty by them, and in return it seemed merely fair to demand that they should do their duty by her. Her mother’s reign had been lax. She had found, on looking into things on her marriage, many abuses. These she had removed one by one, and after much trouble had put the whole household on a decent economic footing.",

He was most hospitably inclined now that the business of the day was over; we sat together in the mak’ad, the audience room, a dark and dirty sort of out-house, with an iron stove in the centre of it, and discussed the Japanese War and desert ghazus and other topics of the day, while Selmān, the sheikh’s son, a charming boy of sixteen, made us coffee. Muhammad is brother-in-law to Shibly and to Yahya Beg el Atrāsh, who had been my first host five years before when I had escaped to his village of ’Areh from the Turkish Mudīr at Bosrā, and Selman is the only son of his father’s old age and the only descendant of the famous ’Areh house of the Turshān, for Shibly died and Yahya lives childless. The boy walked back with me to my camp, stepping lightly through the mud, a gay and eager figure touched with the air of distinction that befits one who comes of a noble stock. He had had no schooling, though there was a big Druze maktab at Kreyeh, fifteen miles away, kept by a Christian of some learning.",

I read more Hoggart and his cool Yorkshire sense washed through me like an opiate. At dinner I sat with a middle-aged American couple, just back from a sponsored goodwill trip to China, who explained to me patiently and emphatically why the Japanese should abandon their writing system, just as (they assured me) the Chinese were abandoning theirs. The couple understood not a word of Japanese, but this did not prevent them from enjoying their brushes with exotic languages.",

    "target_paragraph": "Surfing Guide to Southern California didn’t trade in nostalgia, however. It was too optimistic and hardheaded for that. The book was a meticulous, thoroughly practical breakdown of nearly three hundred surf spots between Point Conception and the Mexican border. It was thickly illustrated with surf shots, aerial views of the coast, and maps, and was dense with specific information about swell directions, tidal effects, underwater hazards, and parking regulations. But its greatest pleasures were in its clear, dry prose, its sage judgments about the quality of different breaks, its little puns and inside jokes, and its discreet but deeply felt enthusiasms. Obscure local heroes like Dempsey Holder, who had been riding alone, for decades, a spooky deepwater big-wave spot called Tijuana Sloughs, hard by the Mexican border, quietly got their due from the guide’s authors, Bill Cleary and David Stern. And Cleary and Stern kept a sense of wry perspective in the face of the contemporary mess. Their caption for a shot of a large swarm of kooks struggling to ride the same six-inch ripple: “Surfing, an individual sport, in which lonely man pits his hard-won skill against the wild forces of the mighty ocean . . . Malibu, west swell.”",

It’s nothing like the main shop near headquarters, with a work bench and drill press; extra gloves and earplugs and six kinds of tape; a shed full of tents, coolers, tarps; ten Stihl power brushers hanging from a plywood ceiling rack like a fleet of orange-and-white Storm Troopers. Because this auxiliary shop is thirty miles from the main trails headquarters, everything here gets used up, repaired on site, or taken down to headquarters if it needs fixed. This shop supports the North Fork trail crew, four or five people instead of the entire west-side crew, and it has that kind of intimacy, the way a room feels different than a house. Gas stains on the floor, wet sawyer’s chaps clipped on nails to dry, five pulaskis hanging by their heads in the rack where they belong. It smells like wood chips and bar oil, someone’s drying T-shirt, and the thick perfume of mules.",

He didn’t want any remuneration for the food we had eaten in his home, for the chickens that had been slaughtered especially for us, for the fresh vegetables we had received each day, for the game he and his family had hunted, and for the enormous quantities of caña we had drunk. He also refused payment for the dozens of papayas we had eaten. We were his guests, he insisted, and he wouldn’t take money for his hospitality or for his wife’s work. After a quick huddle we decided not to take anything from him for the things he had bought from us. And we added 800 pesos to the amount he had quoted. Don Jorge was satisfied.",

Their threshing is completely biblical – throwing the grain up in the air for the breeze to blow away the chaff. The landscape, as throughout Swat, was very green and we passed through many pine woods where the aroma of resin mingled in the hot air with the scents of a multitude of flowering wild shrubs and herbs. Weeping willows lined some stretches of the road, granting a brief escape from the sun, ‘Irish’ bramble hedges and ditches induced homesickness, and on the slopes of the grey, round-topped mountains little green bushes like juniper grew thickly. Crossing the last pass before coming down again to the Plain of Peshawar I saw enormous slabs of grey rock that reminded me very much of Inishmaan although they weren’t quite as big as those on the island. I also saw five of the lizards for which this locality is famous; when resting under a tree I noticed the first one and for a brief, crazy moment imagined it to be a baby dragon. They’re between three and four feet long and are very fat and much respected by the locals who believe that they kill snakes, which seems to me a doubtful occupation for a lizard.",

Scattered among the trees are rambling houses, often occupied by celebrities and built in a style that might be called Ostentatious English Vernacular, with busy roof-lines crowded with gables and fussy chimney pots, spacious and multiple verandas, odd-sized windows, at least one emphatic chimney breast, and acres of trailing roses over a trim little porch.

    "target_paragraph": "The most celebrated of the early Uniformitarians, usually credited with paternity of what is now called the Old Geology, was the Scotsman James Hutton (1726–97). Hutton possessed an instinctive ability to reverse physical processes, to read landscapes backwards, as it were. Like all of the founding geologists, Hutton was a prodigious walker, and for decades he strode back and forth across the Scottish landscape, attempting by a blend of induction and imagination to intuit the processes which had brought it to its present state. Fingering the white quartz which seamed the grey granite boulders in a Scottish glen, Hutton understood the confrontation that had once occurred between the two types of rock; saw how under fantastic pressure the molten quartz had forced its way into the weaknesses in the mother granite. To be with Hutton was to inhabit a world with a past so deep as to be terrifying. One of his colleagues and admirers, John Playfair, famously described visiting a geological site on the Berwick coast with him. As Hutton explained the implications of the rock configuration, wrote Playfair, ‘the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time’.",

After one quick look they intimate that it is altogether wrong for me to sleep on the floor, to do my own cooking on a tiny temperamental stove and to wash myself and my clothes in the river. They point out severely that I should have at least one servant and a bigger room with a more tractable stair, a mud floor and a cool grass thatch. So far my Nepali vocabulary consists of one word, meaning ‘good’, and gesturing widely I repeat this adjective – at first cheerfully, then firmly and at last, as their indignation grows, almost aggressively, in self-defence. But my enthusiasm fails to quell their disgust, and when they finally withdraw I can hear their condemnations being repeated to passers-by in the street below.",

When he had first come home from Harvard, Roscoe had approached him with the proposition that he should wear eye-glasses and imitation whiskers glued to his cheeks, and it had seemed for a moment that the farce of his early years was to be repeated. But whiskers had itched and made him ashamed. He wept and Roscoe had reluctantly relented.",

I find tombstones of three carvers, two with different surnames, supporting this observation. As I head back to my tent, I am once again mystified by the beach.

Part of it is called Harlech Road, part of it Lugard Road, but it is really hardly more than a bridle-track, and though here and there along it villas lie half hidden in shrubberies, cars are parked discreetly in lay-bys and the little red Suzuki Royal Mail van sometimes trundles by, for the most part it is to this day a secluded country walk of the sub-tropical imperial variety, a languorous ramble on a Sunday afternoon, or better still a marvellous stimulant before breakfast.",

The one sign of human occupation was a mop which leant against one wall, but it might have been left there a generation ago by someone hired to tidy up after the furniture-removers had departed.",

There, in the island’s little harbour were turning slowly the lean sides of a destroyer, and even as he looked, there was another burst of flame and smoke, and a whistling five-inch shell burst forty yards from where the natives had stopped. With a yell of mingled fear and baffled rage, they turned and fled off toward their canoes. Already, a boat, manned by the lusty arms of a blue-jacketed crew, had put off from the destroyer’s side, and was coming in toward shore.",

Three minnows and three quarts of water aren’t exactly a recipe for the most delicious soup in the world. Watery, bland, and disgusting would be a more accurate description, but I drank it down to the last drop, even munching the crunchy bones. I was proud of myself for not having used up any of the rice or beans. I would keep them for an emergency.

He asked us where we were from (“Ireland,” I said), and suggested a few sights around town. As we chatted, the power failed, and the air conditioner whined and sputtered its last breath. Our room, which, as a selling point, overlooked the Corniche and the Nile, also faced due west, and the sun bore down with all its might. The forecast that day called for temperatures above 115 degrees, the hottest weather yet on our trip. The young man apologized for the loss of electricity and bid us farewell. A bead of sweat trickled from my forehead, down my nose, and splashed on the tile floor between my feet. As in Luxor, if we were to die of heat exhaustion we decided it would be outside, on the streets, rather than in a stuffy hotel room.",

The interior was warm and cozy and inviting, its appointments of linens, tablecloths, and fine tea settings the handiwork of the baroness, who was away visiting relatives. Baron Kleist said, with pride, that the materials for the house had been brought over from Vladivostok only five years earlier, so the house was sturdy and clean and new. Almost immediately, the baron’s chef appeared with a hearty and opulent breakfast, and as Bartlett chewed languorously on the delicious fare, his mind cast to Wrangel Island and he felt a twinge of guilt, worried whether they had enough food. “Two months had gone by since I had parted from the men on Icy Spit,” he recorded. “If all went well, I should be back for them in two months more, and I hoped they were holding out all right and would be in good shape when I reached them again.”",

Reaching Moss Force, he found it in full cry, ‘a great Torrent from the Top of the Mountain to the Bottom’, and, watching those ‘great Masses of Water’ gout after one another into the chicane, they seemed suddenly to Coleridge to resemble ‘a vast crowd of huge white Bears, rushing, one over the other, against the wind—their long white hair shattering abroad in the wind’. Lodore Falls appeared to him like ‘the Precipitation of the fallen Angels from Heaven’. Some days later, still exhilarated, he sat in Greta Hall in Keswick, and wrote a letter to Sara Hutchinson describing his adventures. ‘What a sight it is to look down on such a Cataract!’ he exclaimed, ‘—the wheels, that circumvolve in it—the leaping up & plunging forward of that infinity of Pearls & Glass Bulbs--the continual change of the Matter, the perpetual Sameness of the Form.’",
