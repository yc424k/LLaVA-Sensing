They made—how can one say this without sounding blasphemous and effete?—a nice picture, black against the Aracoeli's brown, a moving smallness rising, silhouetted against an uncluttered sky; a dramatic reinforcement of one's belief that Heaven has an exact physical location and that, with preparation, it can be achieved. Although I was not Catholic at the time, I was not appalled by the old lady's exertions (it may, of course, be true that baptism—I was baptized as an infant into the Roman Catholic Church—is like a vaccination that eventually “takes”); but I was at that time with people who saw futility in every penitential act, for if God were good, they said, He would not want old ladies to climb stairs on their knees to Him. But I found it splendid to think of a God whose needs are intuited by old ladies in black, His needs, in this act of penance, being inseparable from theirs. . . . No one asks a mountain if it wants to be climbed. . . . From the top of the steps there is a view of St. Peter's, and of the Synagogue, too—very little exertion, really, for so much gain.",

Maugham’s great gift, contrary to appearances, was never to be blasé or detached. A character in one of his stories goes to a museum, “but it was outside, in the streets, that was most thrilling”. Singapore itself and Raffles were the real museums for Maugham, with constantly changing exhibitions, which move a young man to laugh “aloud with joy”. Ultimately it was the romance of abroad that fascinated Maugham, and liberated him: the long line of rickshas, the sampans, the “Chinese shops on Victoria Road” and everything that was sensuous and starlit and heavy with torch ginger blossoms.",

    "target_paragraph": "And now slowly the pain of the want, and the bitter anger (to be called back, just as she thought she would never feel sorrow for Mrs Ramsay again. Had she missed her among the coffee cups at breakfast? not in the least) lessened; and of their anguish left, as antidote, a relief that was balm in itself, and also, but more mysteriously, a sense of someone there, of Mrs Ramsay, relieved for a moment of the weight that the world had put on her, staying lightly by her side and then (for this was Mrs Ramsay in all her beauty) raising to her forehead a wreath of white flowers* with which she went. Lily squeezed her tubes again. She attacked that problem of the hedge. It was strange how clearly she saw her, stepping with her usual quickness across the fields among whose folds, purplish and soft, among whose flowers, hyacinths or lilies, she vanished. It was some trick of the painter’s eye. For days after she had heard of her death she had seen her thus, putting her wreath to her forehead and going unquestionably with her companion, a shadow, across the fields. The sight, the phrase, had its power to console. Wherever she happened to be, painting, here, in the country or in London, the vision would come to her, and her eyes, half closing, sought something to base her vision on. She looked down the railway carriage, the omnibus; took a line from shoulder or cheek; looked at the windows opposite; at Piccadilly,* lamp-strung in the evening. All had been part of the fields of death. But always something—it might be a face, a voice, a paper boy crying Standard, News*—thrust through, snubbed her, waked her, required and got in the end an effort of attention, so that the vision must be perpetually remade. Now again, moved as she was by some instinctive need of distance and blue, she looked at the bay beneath her, making hillocks of the blue bars of the waves, and stony fields of the purpler spaces. Again she was roused as usual by something incongruous. There was a brown spot in the middle of the bay. It was a boat. Yes, she realized that after a second. But whose boat? Mr Ramsay’s boat, she replied. Mr Ramsay; the man who had marched past her, with his hand raised, aloof, at the head of a procession, in his beautiful boots, asking her for sympathy, which she had refused. The boat was now half-way across the bay.",

At the ryokan, there was a choice of slippers and the owner’s wife greeted me with a kneeling bow and with a cup of green tea that I sipped as I perched on the upstairs window ledge, listening to the chirruping of the river. The owner’s wife cut flowers in the garden and brought them up to me – two large white lilies and a blood-red camellia – arranged in such a casual way that no effort seemed involved at all. But I had watched her in the garden from my seat at the window, measuring the stalks, trimming them with her eye. There are ryokans and ryokans, but I found few like this one, where everything in sight had been chosen with care – from the handmade paper fan on my table to the scroll in the alcove with its two wild persimmons.",

She was big in foot and limb and body, everything about the woman was strong, large and vigorous except her hands.

Sabri took a thoughtful turn or two among the shadows and stubbed out his cigarette on the box. ‘Honestly, my dear,’ he said, ‘it will be a matter of luck. I do hear of things, but it is a matter of luck. And it is very difficult to find one person to deal with. You are at once in a bloody family, my dear.’ I did not then know what he meant.

Night, a lantern in the shikara, silence, the house approached down a willow-hung water alley, and Aziz behaving with an ancient courtesy. Details were obscured; it might have been the beginning of a Venetian entertainment. We ate sitting on the floor of an upper room that had been cleared of all furniture and people, whose presence we could yet detect in close whispers and the sounds of movement; and Aziz knelt before us, talking, no longer a hotel servant but our host, grave, independent, a man of substance, a man of views and, when the women and the babies flooded in, a responsible family man. The walls were thick, comfortingly grimed, full of arched recesses; windows were small. The room promised idleness and the warmth of charcoal braziers in winter, when the lake would freeze so hard a jeep could be driven over it: we would follow the weather in Srinagar.",

If the heavens were fair, wartime misfortunes would be mutually exclusive; since Baby was sick, she could not be harmed in an air raid.

Cam looked down into the foam, into the sea with all its treasure in it, and its speed hypnotized her, and the tie between her and James sagged a little. It slackened a little. She began to think, How fast it goes. Where are we going? and the movement hypnotized her, while James, with his eye fixed on the sail and on the horizon, steered grimly. But he began to think as he steered that he might escape; he might be quit of it all. They might land somewhere; and be free then. Both of them, looking at each other for a moment, had a sense of escape and exaltation, what with the speed and the change. But the breeze bred in Mr Ramsay too the same excitement, and, as old Macalister turned to fling his line overboard, he cried aloud, ‘We perished,’ and then again, ‘each alone’.* And then with his usual spasm of repentance or shyness, pulled himself up, and waved his hand towards the shore.",

All produced sounds that were faint or muddy, or required impossibly perfect timing on the part of the projectionist. Getting a projector and sound system to run in perfect tandem was basically impossible. Moving pictures were filmed with hand-cranked cameras, which introduced a slight variability in speed that no sound system could adjust to. Projectionists also commonly repaired damaged film by cutting out a few frames and resplicing what remained, which clearly would throw out any recording. Even perfect film sometimes skipped or momentarily stuttered in the projector. All these things confounded synchronization.",

There were two walls, one layered in behind the other, each twenty-two feet thick, the whole thing encircled by a deep moat. Xenophon tells us that Cyrus the Great, leader of the Persian army, arrived and laid siege to the city. The Babylonians, knowing they had supplies enough for twenty years, paid him no heed. One night, while all inside were celebrating a great feast, Cyrus ordered his troops to redirect the Euphrates river, which flowed through the city, into their trenches, and thus marched in under the walls on the dry bed of the river. While the Babylonians were celebrating, their enemies were rising up within their own great city.",

Virginia Woolf, I remember, lived in the country during the war. She rushed back to her neighborhood in London after a bombing and found her house in ruins. She expected to be devastated but instead felt a strange elation. Doubtless, I would not. When the earth quaked, I was shaken for days over my whiplashed chimney, broken vases, and wineglasses.

    "target_paragraph": "When this little volume (my maiden effort) was published five years ago, it unwittingly originated an angry controversy by raising the question “Should women ride astride?”\nIt is astonishing what a great fire a mere spark may kindle, and accordingly the war, on what proved to be a very vexed subject, waged fast and furious. The picture papers inserted cleverly-illustrated articles pro and con; the peace of families was temporarily wrecked—for people were of course divided in their opinions—and bitter things were said by both sides concerning a very simple and harmless matter. For a time it seemed as though the “Ayes” would win; but eventually appearances carried the day, and women still use side-saddles when on horseback, though the knickerbockers and short skirts (only far shorter) I advocated for rough country riding are now constantly worn by the many female equestrians who within the last couple of years have mounted bicycles.\nIt is nearly four years since, from an hotel window in Copenhagen, I saw, to my great surprise, for the first time a woman astride a bicycle! How strange it seemed! Paris quickly followed suit, and now there is a perfect army of women bicyclists in that fair capital; after a decent show of hesitation England dropped her prejudices, and at the present minute, almost without a murmur, allows her daughters, clad in unnecessarily masculine costume, to scour the country in quest of fresh air astride a bicycle.\nIf women may ride an iron steed thus attired, surely they might be permitted to bestride a horse in like manner clothed in like fashion.\nMy own experience as to comfort will be found in the following pages, and I can only add that greater knowledge has strengthened that opinion. When discussing the subject with Sir John Williams—one of the greatest authorities on the diseases of women—he said, “I do not see that any harm could arise from women riding like men. Far from it. I cannot, indeed, conceive why the side-saddle was ever invented at all.” What more could be urged in favour of cross riding?",

The ancients coined the phrase ‘Cypriot ox’ because of their sleepiness. I find they have fine old-fashioned manners, unhurried and graceful. Samuel Brown in 1879 wrote of them: ‘The Christian inhabitants, though Greek by language and religion, possess little of the intelligence, enterprise and restlessness of the Greek character, nor physiologically are they of Greek type. They, as well as their Mohammedan neighbours, are naturally indolent and unambitious, self-willed and obstinate, but peaceable, domestic, fairly honest and very easily governed … Life and property are probably not more secure in any part of Her Majesty’s dominions. How far the prevailing stupidity and apathy result from the system under which the inhabitants have lived for many generations is an interesting subject of inquiry. The education of the priests and laity is of the lowest standard. As the children appear bright and docile a system of sound elementary secular education would produce the happiest results.’",

Both were yet unconquered, which one can say of most of the Himalayan peaks. Our fingers were stiff with cold but we got out our sketchbook and in a few strokes drew the outlines of these mountains. Aufschnaiter took the bearings of the most important peaks with a shaky compass and wrote down the figures, which one day might be of use. We went down through this dreamlike winter landscape to the shore of the lake where we found a ruined caravanserai, and had once more to spend the night in the snow.",
