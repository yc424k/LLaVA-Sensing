We think of a volcano as a cone. This is a different thing. The abyss, which really is at a height of nearly 4000 feet on the flank of Mauna Loa, has the appearance of a great pit on a rolling plain. But such a pit! It is nine miles in circumference, and its lowest area, which not long ago fell about 300 feet, just as ice on a pond falls when the water below it is withdrawn, covers six square miles. The depth of the crater varies from 800 to 1100 feet in different years, according as the molten sea below is at flood or ebb. Signs of volcanic activity are present more or less throughout its whole depth, and for some distance round its margin, in the form of steam cracks, jets of sulphurous vapour, blowing cones, accumulating deposits of acicular crystals of sulphur, &c., and the pit itself is constantly rent and shaken by earthquakes. Grand eruptions occur at internals with circumstances of indescribable terror and dignity, but Kilauea does not limit its activity to these outbursts, but has exhibited its marvellous phenomena through all known time in a lake or lakes in the southern part of the crater, three miles from this side.",

She wore no makeup, and her hair, skin, and nails were always immaculate.\n\n“I think we should keep moving,” said Trish.\n\nJoanna agreed, as did I.",

Down on the beach we found a confectioner's shop directly overlooking the sea, with sun-blinds and open windows, and no one in it.

My gasping breaths made me feel like a fish out of water. But looking at Syd, I could only imagine the pain his cancer-stricken body was going through. Why was he pushing himself so hard?

Himalayan orchids – the only one of the variegated wild flowers that I can recognise – are still flowering, but otherwise there is the familiar sense of nature relaxing and growth ceasing. There are more of the small snakes, of which I had seen only one before, and birds are also more numerous. Superb eagles are following the flocks down from the heights, and this afternoon two of them were visible below me as I walked along the high path to the pool. They went sailing easily along the course of the river, all grace and effortless power. The goat, sheep, kid and lamb traffic was dense on this hitherto deserted path, and once I had to wait, before crossing an insecure moraine, to allow hundreds of the creatures to pass first. When I reached the pool and plunged in the water was so icy that for a few moments I couldn’t breathe: yet on emerging after about ten minutes I found the air-temperature adequately warm and even today my hands didn’t turn blue, as they so often do at home after swimming in water far less cold than this.",

Young girls, careless of their loveliness, bathed in running streams, wore scarlet hibiscus in their hair and silken sarongs around their supple bodies; the soft-eyed local men seemed likewise gods of good health, dazzling smiles offsetting the flowers they tucked behind their ears. In Bali, even old women were slender creatures who moved with a dancer’s easy grace. There was no friction in this land of song and dance, and nothing unlovely: children, taken to be angels of purity descended from the heavens, were never scolded or spanked, crime was unknown and even cremations were opulent festivals of joy. Nature had been charmed by Art. Everything was at peace.",

For me, on a personal search for balance, I had hoped to learn much from the Balinese about holding steady in this chaotic world. But the more I read and see about this culture, the more I realize how far off the grid of balance I’ve fallen, at least from the Balinese perspective. My habit of wandering through this world oblivious to my physical orientation, in addition to my decision to have stepped outside the containing network of marriage and family, makes me—for Balinese purposes—something like a ghost. I enjoy living this way, but it’s a nightmare of a life by the standards of any self-respecting Balinese. If you don’t know where you are or whose clan you belong to, then how can you possibly find balance?",

After trying to persuade me to come down with him, we shook hands and he disappeared round the corner. As soon as he had gone I began to regret my decision. It was after four o’clock and there now seemed little chance of reaching the peak and getting back to the ferry by nightfall. Anyway, as Sir Aurel Stein’s investigations had shown, there were no visible remains on the hilltop other than a couple of large stone slabs (which the great archaeologist had somewhat imaginatively identified as the altars raised by Alexander to Athena, the Goddess of Victory). There was a disconcerting silence on the mountainside: a stillness with no wind, no birds and no distant roar of the river. For a while I picked my way along the trail, but it soon became impossible to distinguish real paths from those imagined. Parted undergrowth powdered with dust from passing feet would lead forward, then suddenly give out. Retracing my steps, I would again confuse paths and end up out of sight of the river, facing blank rock walls. Once, not looking where I was going, I found myself tottering on the edge of a precipice. I attempted to trek vertically down the mountainside in the hope of regaining the main path, but only succeeded in cutting my legs on thorns. Beginning to panic I quickened my pace, and managed to twist an ankle.",

We became secretive. But once we made an open assault on the city. My grandmother wished to have a kattha said, and she wished to have it said under a pipal tree. There was only one pipal tree in the island; it was in the Botanical Gardens. Permission was applied for. To my amazement it was given; and one Sunday morning we all sat under the pipal tree, botanically labelled, and the pundit read. The crackling sacrificial fire was scented with pitch-pine, brown sugar and ghee; bells were rung, gongs struck, conch-shells blown. We attracted the silent interest of a small mixed crowd of morning strollers and the proselytizing attentions of a Seventh Day Adventist. It was a scene of pure pastoral: aryan ritual, of another continent and age, a few hundred yards from the governor’s house. But this is a later appreciation. For those of us at school at the time the public ceremony had been a strain. We were becoming self-conscious, self-assessing: our secret world was shrinking fast. Still, very occasionally, some devout Hindu of the few in Port of Spain might wish to feed some brahmins. We were at hand. We went; we were fed; we received gifts of cloth and money. We never questioned our luck. Luck indeed it seemed, for immediately afterwards, walking back home in trousers and shirt, we became ordinary boys again.",

We were still in sunshine when it hit the road some hundred yards ahead, ripping branches off the wayside trees as though they were twigs. Moments later the windscreen was obliterated and it seemed the high truck might keel over, despite its heavy load. Before stopping, we rescued a little girl going home alone from school and sobbing in terror. Within ten minutes the hurricane became a mere gale, driving sleet almost horizontally. When Bogdan got out to clear the windscreen a figure appeared, far away, wavering in the mighty gusts and wailing like a banshee. It was the little girl’s mother, certain that she had lost her ewe-lamb. A mile further on we dropped them off at their isolated roadside shack.",

I suggested we ride the subway from Opera House Station, a short walk from the hotel, to Ramses Station, about two miles away. Teresa worried about riding the subway in Cairo.

Sailors speak of the uncanniness of seeing a well-known country from the sea; the way that such a perspective can make the most homely coastline seem strange. Something similar happens to a landscape in darkness. Coleridge once compared walking at night in his part of the Lake District to a newly blind man feeling the face of a child: the same loving attention, the same deduction by form and shape, the same familiar unfamiliarity. At night, new orders of connection assert themselves: sonic, olfactory, tactile. The sensorium is transformed. Associations swarm out of the darkness. You become even more aware of landscape as a medley of effects, a mingling of geology, memory, movement, life. The landforms remain, but they exist as presences: inferred, less substantial, more powerful. You inhabit a new topology. Out at night, you understand that wildness is not only a permanent property of land - it is also a quality which can settle on a place with a snowfall, or with the close of day.",

We were by then tired, wet, and miserable, and without much thought, we pressed on. Only later did I recall the significance of that modest confluence, hidden away in the thickets of the forest. It marked the literal divide where two of the great mountain ranges of Colombia are born. As long as we had the rushing waters of the Magdalena to our left, we were on the flank of what would become the Cordillera Oriental, which runs north, separating Andean Colombia from the vast grasslands of the eastern Llanos and the Amazon, and ultimately forming the border between Colombia and Venezuela. But as soon as we crossed over the Magdalena, which we did at the Santa Marta bridge, we were walking along the base of the Cordillera Central, the range that runs up the center of the nation, separating the Cauca from the Magdalena, rivers that don’t come together until they reach the wetlands and ciénagas that lie beyond Serranía de San Lucas, where the last remnants of the Cordillera Central fall away to the Caribbean coastal plain. The entire rest of the day, as we stumbled out of the mountains toward San Antonio and the place where we planned to spend the night, we all felt a strange surge of energy. The mountain walls were so close, and as the sun broke through the clouds and the ancient stone path fell away like mercury through the forest, we could literally reach down and touch the geographical origins of a great nation.",

He stood for a time with the group that sat nightly in front of the drug store on the corner; stood quietly among them, listening but saying nothing, as was his way. Then he moved on, without being missed, and walked slowly up the street and stopped at the bank door. One or two passers spoke to him while he was finding his key and opening the door; he responded in his flat country idiom and entered and closed the door behind him. A single bulb burned above the vault. He raised the shade on the window beside it and entered the grilled cage and turned on the light above his desk. Here passers could see him, could have watched him for several minutes as he bent over his desk, writing slowly. It was his final letter, in which he poured out his lust and his hatred and his jealousy, and the language was the obscenity which his jealousy and desire had hoarded away in his temporarily half-crazed mind and which the past night and day had liberated. When it was finished he blotted it carefully and folded it and put it in his pocket, and snapped his light off. He entered the directors’ room and in the darkness he unlocked the door which gave onto the vacant lot, closed it and left it unlocked.",

Ladies and Gentlemen”—he straightened himself, and the table-cloth slid toward him—“ever since you honoured me with an invitation to address you from the temperance platform I’ve been assiduously studying that literature; and I’ve gathered from your own evidence—what I’d strongly suspected before—that all your converted drunkards had a hell of a good time before you got at ’em, and that . . . and that a good many of ’em have gone on having it since . . .”",

He seemed to take particular pleasure in near-misses with juggernauts heading in the opposite direction, after which he would turn around and grin at us. Often this would lead to yet another even closer miss which would in turn cause ever greater outbursts of high spirits. Pakistanis believe illegal drinking to be rather chic, and will go out of their way to show quite how drunk they are. We closed our eyes, but were still haunted by premonitions of imminent disaster. Then it happend. We turned a sharp corner and suddenly in front of us, far below, we saw the Indus curving around the foot of a great mountain. The contractor looked around to point it out. There was a sickening jolt. I saw a cow take off, fly across the road and achieve a remarkable all-fours landing on the verge. Without so much as a look at us it continued to munch the grass, apparently unmoved by its brief flight. But the Toyota was a write-off. The front radiator had completely caved in on one side, and water from it was forming a large puddle on the road.",

No sooner had Flush abolished ‘must’ and raced free through the emerald grass of the Cascine gardens where the pheasants fluttered red and gold, than he felt a check. Once more he was thrown back on his haunches. At first it was nothing – a hint merely – only that Mrs Browning in the spring of 1849 became busy with her needle. And yet there was something in the sight that gave Flush pause. She was not used to sew. He noted that Wilson moved a bed and that she opened a drawer to put white clothes inside it. Raising his head from the tiled floor, he looked, he listened attentively. Was something once more about to happen? He looked anxiously for signs of trunks and packing. Was there to be another flight, another escape? But an escape to what, from what? There is nothing to be afraid of here, he assured Mrs Browning. They need neither of them worry themselves in Florence about Mr Taylor and dogs’ heads wrapped up in brown paper parcels. Yet he was puzzled. The signs of change, as he read them, did not signify escape. They signified, much more mysteriously, expectance. Something, he felt, as he watched Mrs Browning so composedly, yet silently and steadfastly, stitching in her low chair, was coming that was inevitable; yet to be dreaded. As the weeks went on, Mrs Browning scarcely left the house. She seemed, as she sat there, to anticipate some tremendous event. Was she about to encounter somebody, like the ruffian Taylor, and let him rain blows on her alone and unaided? Flush quivered with apprehension at the thought. Certainly she had no intention of running away. No boxes were packed. There was no sign that anybody was about to leave the house – rather there were signs that somebody was coming. In his jealous anxiety Flush scrutinised each new-comer. There were many now – Miss Blagden, Mr Landor, Hattie Hosmer, Mr Lytton – ever so many ladies and gentlemen now came to Casa Guidi. Day after day Mrs Browning sat there in her armchair quietly stitching.",

However I happened to feel about these things – and they were home, after all – I know that Stahr must have felt much more. These were the things I had first opened my eyes on, like the sheep on the back lot of the old Laemmle studio; but this was where Stahr had come to earth after that extraordinary illuminating flight where he saw which way we were going, and how we looked doing it, and how much of it mattered. You could say that this was where an accidental wind blew him, but I don’t think so. I would rather think that in a ‘long shot’ he saw a new way of measuring our jerky hopes and graceful rogueries and awkward sorrows, and that he came here from choice to be with us to the end.

    "target_paragraph": "Hession told us, many days later, stories of his solo run. Not long after he left us, he became preoccupied with his thoughts and overshot a channel in a riffle. Near the far ends of pools, where loose-stone deposits had built up as dams, the river would characteristically become fast and shallow and would tumble to one side over a brink of gravel—racing white toward a lower pool. The knack of navigation was to read the riffle, sense the heaviest flow there, and get into it before the broad general current could take the boat a little farther and run it aground; for while much water went down the riffle even more simply disappeared into the earth, passing into the porous basements of high, dry bars of gravel. Often enough, there was just a narrow slot, angling left or right, through which the kayak could proceed, and now Hession had missed such a place, so he would have to backferry—moving, stern first, across the stream, to realign his course and shoot the rip. He was close to a bank. Realizing his mistake, he reached backward with his paddle. He happened to look up as well. On the bank above him were a sow grizzly and a huge two-year-old cub. Across a distance of no more than fifteen feet Hession and the mother grizzly looked each other in the eye. Staring steadily at her, he slowly moved the paddle, retreating at an angle to the current. He felt helpless, because he could think of nothing to do if the bear attacked. He thought of turning the boat over in order to disappear beneath it, but there was nowhere to hide in less than a foot of water. Therefore, all decisions belonged to the bear. Hession kept on gazing fixedly into her eyes, making no gesture of fear or flight. The bears themselves retreated. But after a few steps they turned, and both stood up on their hind legs, squinting. Hession thought they were going to come for him, after this second look. But they dropped down, turned, and went. He told this story without modulation, without a hint of narrative excitation; and in the same flat manner he went on to say that he had later seen a pair of sandhill cranes and, some time after that, a golden eagle. It was all wildlife to him. When you are the Sierra Club’s man in Alaska, the least of your problems is bears.",

Each of its windows was brilliantly lit, nearly midnight though it was, and in each a little Hong Kong cameo, distinct from all its neighbours, was joylessly displayed. Here four girls sat tense at their sewing-machines, silent and unsmiling, here a solitary shirt-sleeved man was hunched over his files, beneath the light of a naked bulb. Along the way eight or nine families seemed to be packed into one room, and I could see only flashes of infant limbs, waves of drapery, buckets, black loose hair, bedclothes. Every room was ablaze, every room was jam-packed, and across the intervening dark I could hear radios, clicking machines, shouts and children’s screams.",

Justine had said that Bessy seemed nervous and unhappy: it was clear, therefore, that she also had suffered from the wounds they had dealt each other, though she kept her unmoved front to the last. Poor child! Perhaps that insensible exterior was the only way she knew of expressing courage! It seemed to Amherst that all means of manifesting the finer impulses must slowly wither in the Lynbrook air. As he approached his destination, his thoughts of her were all pitiful: nothing remained of the personal resentment which had debased their parting. He had telephoned from town to announce the hour of his return, and when he emerged from the station he half-expected to find her seated in the brougham whose lamps signalled him through the early dusk. It would be like her to undergo such a reaction of feeling, and to express it, not in words, but by taking up their relation as if there had been no break in it. He had once condemned this facility of renewal as a sign of lightness, a result of that continual evasion of serious issues which made the life of Bessy's world a thin crust of custom above a void of thought. But he now saw that, if she was the product of her environment, that constituted but another claim on his charity, and made the more precious any impulses of natural feeling that had survived the unifying pressure of her life. As he approached the brougham, he murmured mentally: \"What if I were to try once more?\"",

Women were thigh-deep in the water, washing and wringing out their rags and their tattered finery, and then festooning them over the undergrowth and branches, while troops of boys, like the ones on the Slovak shore at Easter, scoured the banks for the lairs of their just-edible quarry – voles, weasels, water-rats and so on. They left the serious work to their little sisters, who trotted tirelessly alongside their only prospect of the day, calling out ‘Bácsi! Bácsi!’ – for the masculine prey of small Gypsies are all honorary uncles; and their shrill uncle-uncle cries continued for about a furlong. When the reproachful diminuendo had died away I was alone again with nothing but swallows curvetting through the shadows or the occasional blue-green flash of a kingfisher to ruffle the stillness of leaves and water.",

    "target_paragraph": "We drove back to the rocky place where we had seen the leopard the previous day. She was there again but seemed a little agitated, walking backwards and forwards on the plateau of rocks, raising her head and mewing. An answering mew came from our right. On the other side of the track, a cub appeared some distance away, timidly peeping through a bush. The mother called to it again, and the cub advanced, and then jumped back. It was clearly nervous of the half a dozen parked vehicles blocking its route to its mother. The drivers backed away to allow it more space. There are strict regulations regarding treatment of the wild animals who have right of way at all times, and it is forbidden to harass them in any way. The cub crept forward, ducked back, came a few steps closer. All the while the two animals were calling to each other. Suddenly, the cub made a dash past the vehicles to its mother, and the two of them vanished in a blink, as if they were never there. I couldn’t help smiling to myself as I watched a photographer in another vehicle – not one of our group. He had a massive lens on his camera, and in his hurry to turn and catch the cub running, he cracked another passenger on the head.\nA couple of miles and five minutes later we met a cheetah who unlike the shy leopard was completely comfortable in our presence. She was watching a couple of tiny dik dik antelope about twenty yards away, and began to walk stealthily towards them; but they had already seen or scented her and took off into the distance, and she seemed to shrug before lying down, as if she wasn’t that interested any way.\n‘They were too far away,’ David said. ‘Cheetah can run very fast, but only for a short distance. If she doesn’t catch them quickly, her oxygen will run out. She knew that.’",

Though the book did not tell me anything about pulling teeth, it was all right, for on one page I found drawings of all the teeth, including their prongs and how they were set in the jaw. Then came the pursuit of the forceps. I had seven pairs, but was in doubt as to which pair I should use. I did not want any mistake. As I turned the hardware over with rattle and clang, the poor victim began to lose his grip and to turn a greenish yellow around the gills. He complained about the sun, but that was necessary for the photograph, and he had to stand it. I fitted the forceps around the tooth, and the patient shivered and began to wilt.",

Botshebelo is South Africa’s second largest township (after Soweto) with a guesstimated population of 250,000. In 1979, 38,000 Thaba’Nchu Sothos were forced to settle on a godforsaken expanse of semi-desert at the foot of low bare hills. Soon after, they were joined by more and more labour tenants – evicted from their homes as mechanization rendered them ‘surplus’ – and by countless thousands from ‘deproclaimed townships’. (The language of apartheid had a flavour all its own.)",
