For one thing, satellites were now beaming images of America across the globe faster than a speeding bullet; the explosion of video had sent history spinning like the wheels of an overturned bicycle. For another, as the world grew smaller and ever smaller, so too did its props: not only had distances in time and space been shrunk, but the latest weapons of cultural warfare—videos, cassettes and computer disks—were far more portable than the big screens and heavy instruments of a decade before. They could be smuggled through border checkpoints, under barbed-wire fences and into distant homes as easily, almost, as a whim. In the cultural campaign, the equivalent of germ warfare had replaced that of heavy-tank assaults.",

    "target_paragraph": "It was a year after Vincent's death. With lapse of time that event had lost much of its oppressive magnificence, and it affected Audrey more in looking back than it had done in reality. Time, too, had thrown her relations with Wyndham into relief; and as she realised more and more their true nature, the conscience that had been so long quiescent began to stir in her. Its voice seemed to be seconding Wyndham's and Katherine's verdict. She became uneasy about herself. Once more, this time in serious sincerity, she felt the need of a stronger personality upholding and pervading her own. Absolute dependence on somebody else's character had become a habit of her nature: she could no more live now without some burning stimulus to thought and feeling than the drunkard can satisfy his thirst with plain water. Naturally she thought of Mr. Flaxman Reed, as Katherine had thought of him the midnight before Vincent's death, or as she had thought of him herself in the day of her temptation. This time she had ended by going to him, as many a woman had gone before, with her empty life in her hands, begging that it might be filled. For all cases of the kind Mr. Flaxman Reed had one remedy—work in the parish of St. Teresa's; as a rule it either killed or cured them. But he had spared Audrey hitherto, as he would have spared some sick child a medicine too strong and bitter for it. Finally, much to his surprise, she asked him for the work of her own accord, and he gave it to her.",

    "target_paragraph": "As the sky to the east slowly illuminates from black to grey, I begin preparing for the end of our journey, packing and organizing. I call the St Augustine City Marina and am elated to be assigned a mooring ball in Salt Run, near the dock, near parking, close to home, and next to the sailboats of friends. This is exactly where I had hoped to get a mooring. I really am the luckiest man in the world.\nSunrise is brilliant, magnificent, bringing light, color, and warmth. I take off my hood and the hat beneath it, shedding layers that I’ve worn for two days. Clouds on the eastern horizon diffuse and reflect all the colors of sunrise, and the warmth slowly reaches my neck and my blood, circulating throughout my tired but elated self. The realization of being home is coming over me. It’s hard to believe, but here we are. I recognize everything: the color of the water, the smell of the air, the buoys, the beaches, the buildings, the bridges. This is where I live, and where Sobrius will live. For the last two and a half weeks, this has been my destination, and now I am here.\nI drop the jib and bag it. The main is also dropped but left uncovered and ready to hoist in case of an emergency. I pull the stern anchor out of its locker and mount it on the stern pulpit, replacing the yellow life-preserver. I hang the fenders from the lifelines just in case I bump into another sailboat while mooring. Still a novice, and exhausted too, I must be extra careful.\nI open the raw-water seacock that supplies the engine with cooling water, put the key in the ignition, turn it on and press the starter button. The Yanmar diesel rumbles to life, its one cylinder banging up and down, reluctantly forcing rackety motion until it warms up and runs a bit more smoothly. We turn into the landbreeze and begin motoring into the inlet, towards home. I must focus on the buoys, I remind myself. I know a shallow sandbar lies to the north, stretching very far out to sea. Another sandbar and then a rock seawall lie to the south. The tide is rising and the current pulls us in.\nA large white trawler rushes out to sea, later a sailboat creeps by and the captain and I wave to each other.\nAs we pass the rock seawall to port, I see the red and green channel markers leading into Salt Run. Between us lies inlet marker #1, and it is not clear whether I should pass this marker to its left or to its right. Why isn’t there a red and green buoy marking this intersection like the models in the textbook? I decide to be extra safe and I hail the City Marina on the VHF.\n“Keep the green markers on your left” they tell me. They don’t understand my question.\n“The marker in question is an inlet marker outside the entrance to Salt Run” I try to explain, but they still don’t understand my question. The entrance to Salt Run is not, in my opinion, adequately marked. There should be a red and green buoy marking its intersection with the inlet, but there is none, and even though they try, the marina personnel are no help. It’s up to me to figure this out, but my mind is tired.\nSlowly I approach inlet marker #1. I study the water current – the ripples – reading the water as best I can. Intuition tells me to go between marker #1 and the rock seawall, keeping the inlet channel marker to starboard. I remember there is a shallow sandbar west of the marker, on the other side. It emerges at low tide. I saw a jet-ski stuck there once. My chartplotter agrees and we slowly pass between the rocks and the marker. My depth gauge, which has somehow come back to life, reads 25 feet as we pass. All is well.\nThe water inside Salt Run is calm, a sense of peace fills me. We are almost to Sobrius’ new home. The Conch House Marina, where my band I-Vibes plays my favorite gig - Reggae Sunday – passes to starboard. Pilings are still standing at odd angles, damaged last year (2016) by Hurricane Matthew. To port is the tranquil state park with its seagrass, mangroves, and sand dunes. I’ve surfed on the beach just across those sand dunes many times. I spot my friend John’s sailboat Moonpie ahead, on which I’ve sailed many times.\nMooring ball 20 sits waiting for us. I steer Sobrius behind Moonpie and approach the ball from downwind, like John taught me during a singlehand lesson aboard his boat last year. I put Sobrius in neutral and quickly move to the bow, pick up the boathook along the way, and fetch the pennant on mooring ball. I tie us off, and return to the cockpit an accomplished singlehand-sailor. My dream has been realized!",

The road conditions are horrendous, with hairpin bends and signs telling learner drivers to take the alternative route. The road is so narrow caravans are banned. The other cycling option is to go straight. This route heads to the Torridons, through several kilometres of rural splendour. The straight road rises slowly to 130 metres with a long gradual run down into Shieldaig. Guess which way I am going?",

As I carried them back along the institutional corridor which smelt of rotting melons and looked like it belonged in a gulag I heard a phrase from a Beethoven piano sonata. It had escaped from a room off the corridor; the door was ajar, and someone inside was playing a record. Despite the poor quality of the sound the intense languor of Claudio Arrau was unmistakeable. It was the first time I had heard him in his own country (they had declared a national day of mourning when he died, a few months before my arrival), and I rested my head on the peeling wall of the corridor, embracing my wet clothes and listening to this stranger playing a Beethoven sonata on a record player in a crummy Temuco hotel room.",

(“When I went in for my physical before starting, the doctor asked me, ‘You know you’ve got TB, tuberculosis?’ Now when I go to the doctor in Peru they ask me, ‘You know you’ve got holes in your liver?’”) Like John, he had never married or had children, which left plenty of time to root around in libraries and archives. He actually lived in three cabins outside of Fairbanks, one of them devoted to “nothing but papers and maps and books.” He lived only a short drive from a University of Alaska campus and spent a lot of time taking adult education courses. Whenever he built up a “grubstake,” Paolo said, he’d head off to the Peruvian Andes to have a long look around.",

Besides, already the breeze has stiffened. Wisps of sand skiff along the ground. Like prying fingers they find poorly sealed car doors and sneak into carelessly closed car windows. It seems barely moments before a wild wind arrives and the depression in which we are camped turns into a sink in which all the sands of the Gobi appear to be collecting.

We could even see where his horse had stood while he pumped shells into his Mauser with feverish hands, and blazed away, first to the rear, where the pursuers came running with Indian yells, and then at the hundreds and hundreds of bloodthirsty horsemen pouring down from the north, with the Demon Pancho Villa at their head. He must have fought a long time, perhaps until they ringed him round with living flame—for we found hundreds of empty cartridges. And then, when the last shot was spent, he made a dash eastward, hit at every step; hid for a moment under the little railroad bridge, and ran out upon the open desert, where he fell. There were twenty bullet holes in him. They had stripped him of all save his underclothes. He lay sprawled in an attitude of desperate action, muscles tense, one fist clenched and spread across the dust as if he were dealing a blow; the fiercest exultant grin on his face. Strong, savage, until one looked closer and saw the subtle touch of weakness that death stamps on life—the delicate expression of idiocy over it all. They had shot him through the head three times—how exasperated they must have been!",

But then the wind rose, then rose again, until it was blowing with an end-of-the-world fury that seemed to have even the trees in a panic, and with it came snow, great flying masses of it. By midday we found ourselves plodding into a stinging, cold, hard-blowing storm. Soon after, we came to a narrow ledge of path along a wall of rock called Big Butt Mountain.",

All day long, creeping slowly into a strong southwest wind, they snaked through tightening leads, any one of which might clutch the ship in its grasp. Swenson and McConnell and the crew watched in reverent awe as they eased by great pressure ridges, jagged and threatening, thrust up all around them. Some of the ridges rose high above the ship’s sixty-foot masts, the ice crumbling and precarious. The floes beneath the ridges smashed together, creating a grinding, churning rumble that was both deafening and chilling.",

He felt and saw the purity of first light, he heard the sweet and sudden lutings of first birds, and suddenly he was filled with the earth and morning in new towns, among new men. He walked among the farmers’ wagons, and he dealt with them on the spot for the prodigal plenty of their wares—the country melons bedded in sweet hay, the cool, sweet pounds of butter wrapped in clean, wet cloths, with dew and starlight still upon them, the enormous battered cans foaming with fresh milk, the new-laid eggs which he bought by the gross and hundred dozen, the tender, limey pullets by the score, the delicate bunches of green scallions, the heavy red ripeness of huge tomatoes, the sweet-leaved lettuces, crisp as celery, the fresh-podded peas and the succulent young beans, as well as the potatoes spotted with the loamy earth, the winy apples, the peaches, and the cherries, the juicy corn stacked up in shocks of luring green, and the heavy, blackened rinds of the home-cured hams and bacons.",

Then hammering started below the galley and all became clear: that submerged rock had done some damage, now being repaired. But why now, when we had moored at 4.20?

She didn’t bring down the mood of the group. She was energetic and upbeat almost every day.”",

She nicked out the pattern into little holes outlined by the stitches. Mary watched her, fascinated by the delicate movements of the thin fingers and the slanted, drooping postures of the head.\n\"Do you like doing it?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nShe thought: \"What a fool she must think me. As if she'd do it if she didn't like it.\"\nThe arching eyes and twitching mouth smiled at your foolishness.\nMrs. Waugh's voice went on. It came smoothly, hardly moving her small, round mouth. That was her natural voice. Then suddenly it rose, like a voice that calls to you to get up in the morning.\n\"Well, Mary—so you've left school. Come home to be a help to your mother.\"\nA high, false cheerfulness, covering disapproval and reproach.\nTheir gentleness was cold to her and secretly inimical. They had asked her because of Mamma. They didn't really want her.\nHalf-past six. It was all over. They were going home across the Green.\n\"Mary, I wish you could learn to talk without affectation. Telling Mrs. Waugh you 'looked like yourself'! If you could only manage to forget yourself.\"\nYour self? Your self? Why should you forget it? You had to remember. They would kill it if you let them.\nWhat had it done? What was it that they should hate it so? It had been happy and excited about them, wondering what they would be like. And quiet, looking on and listening, in the strange, green-lighted, green-dark room, crushed by the gentle, hostile voices.\nWould it always have to stoop and cringe before people, hushing its own voice, hiding its own gesture?\nIt crouched now, stung and beaten, hiding in her body that walked beside her mother with proud feet, and small lifted head.",

In the mid-afternoon we reached a big glacial lake several acres in area, and we pitched camp on its shores, driving our tent pegs into the blue ice which surrounded it, and weighting down the flysheet with slabs of moraine rock. A fleet of jagged little icebergs navigated slowly about the surface of the lake, mimicking the peaks around them.",

Now tonight, my body rises tier upon tier like some cool temple whose floor is strewn with carpets and murmurs rise and the altars stand smoking; but up above, here in my serene head, come only fine gusts of melody, waves of incense, while the lost dove wails, and the banners tremble above tombs, and the dark airs of midnight shake trees outside the open windows. When I look down from this transcendency, how beautiful are even the crumbled relics of bread! What shapely spirals the peelings of pears make—how thin, and mottled like some sea-bird’s egg. Even the forks laid straight side by side appear lucid, logical, exact; and the horns of the rolls which we have left are glazed, yellow-plated, hard. I could worship my hand even, with its fan of bones laced by blue mysterious veins and its astonishing look of aptness, suppleness and ability to curl softly or suddenly crush—its infinite sensibility.",

He has a long, ectomorphic head whose most expressive feature is its brow, which furrows this way and that in thought, emphasizing his canny, mobile, and china-blue eyes. The neatly trimmed hair around his balding crown adds a professorial dignity—appropriately, because he is the head of the robotics lab at the St. Petersburg State Polytechnical University. He used to work in the Soviet space program before it was reduced in size; guiding is something he does for extra cash. After knowing him for a while I wondered if the discontent and suppressed anger that sometimes showed on his face were the result of taking on an additional job, one unequal to his talents. We did seem to get along better once I understood how prestigious the Polytechnical University and his real job were.",

Neither admonition nor constitution was very clear, and as I joined a bearded group of shepherds round the placard all lip-reading with ferocious con­centration, I could not help sharing the sigh of sheer bewilder­ment that went up. ‘What does it mean?’ said Dmitri in heavy bewilderment. ‘Does it mean we can’t speak of Enosis any more without going to prison? Sing the Anthem?’ I could not enlighten him; yet that is what it appeared to mean, though the terms were wide and vague. Moreover the constitution appeared to be the draft of a draft, intended to allure rather than confuse: yet containing as far as I could see no concrete formulae susceptible of acceptance or rejection. The whole thing had a puzzling sort of air.",

The word that clings to every hiker’s thoughts in north Georgia is Deliverance, the 1970 novel by James Dickey that was made into a Hollywood movie. It concerns, as you may recall, four middle-aged men from Atlanta who go on a weekend canoeing trip down the fictional Cahulawasee River (but based on the real, nearby Chattooga) and find themselves severely out of their element. “Every family I’ve ever met up here has at least one relative in the penitentiary,” a character in the book remarks forebodingly as they drive up. “Some of them are in for making liquor or running it, but most of them are in for murder. They don’t think a whole lot about killing people up here.” And so of course it proves, as our urban foursome find themselves variously buggered, murdered, and hunted by a brace of demented backwoodsmen.",

    "target_paragraph": "CHAPTER XLIX\nBrooklyn, 2008\nEVERY MORNING Larry draws my bath. I lie in bed sipping coffee or reading the paper until it is ready. I hop on one leg on the upstairs walker into the bathroom. The room is steamy hot, the mirrors cloud up. Larry tests the temperature with his elbow—the way I did for our daughter when she was small. He places the shampoo, conditioner, soap, and washcloth along the side of the tub. “Okay,” he’ll say. “I think we’re ready.” I make my way to the side of the tub, drop my robe, as Larry pulls out two plastic trash bags and begins the arduous process of wrapping my leg. He ties the bags tightly around my thigh, securing it with duct tape.\nHe waits as I swivel from the side of the tub onto the white plastic chair that sits inside. I rest my leg on the side of the tub, then ease my way into the water as Larry pulls away the chair. I soak, careful to keep my leg raised. My days used to begin with a walk in the park or a morning swim. I’d write until midafternoon, and then meet a friend for coffee or a drink at a nearby café. On the way home I’d shop for dinner. I’d put on some music as I stood at the counter, chopping vegetables, peeling shrimp. Now this seems far away.\nEach day is excruciatingly the same. I wash, then call Larry to help me out of the tub. On the edge I dry myself. While I’m dressing, Larry goes downstairs. He prepares my breakfast and my lunch. Then he rinses the commode we keep by the bed (because I can’t get to the bathroom in the night). It had never occurred to me that this would be part of our marital contract—the sickness-and-health part that we’d agreed to. But he never complains. He never shirks. His last task of the morning is to carry the commode down to the supply closet in my office, where he’s made a space.\nThere’s a bathroom on the ground level, but the hallway is too narrow. I can’t get my walker through. So I keep the blinds in my office drawn and when I need to, hop over to the commode. At the end of the day he empties it.\nThe pain surprises me. I didn’t anticipate it. It’s different from any other pain I’ve known. I’ve had nerve pain, I’ve had muscle pain. But this one comes from deep inside my bones. It is especially bad at night for some reason. I take whatever painkillers I am allowed, but it is never enough. Every night I find myself shivering. The only thing I can do is pull the caramel-colored blanket over my head. I disappear under the covers, sometimes for hours at a time. I don’t know why, but this seems to help. Larry, my optimistic husband, says that it must be the pain of the bone healing. Like growing pains. But this feels like the opposite. Every night it feels as if I am shattering all over again.\nA week after my accident, Larry returns to work. The flowers stop coming and the visits grow sporadic. The novelty of my broken leg begins to wear off. The days are an endless routine—each beginning and ending in the same way. But that first Sunday is the worst because Larry, a journalist, always works on Sundays. As well as often on holidays such as Thanksgiving or Christmas. I never liked it, but it’s his job. Still he felt badly, leaving me that first Sunday. I could see it in his eyes. That day I never make it down to my office. I just sit on our sofa, watching families heading off to brunch. I cry. I try to hide this from my husband. For most of the day I don’t answer the phone. People think I am resting.",

Because I was alone, however, even the mundane seemed charged with meaning. The ice looked colder and more mysterious, the sky a cleaner shade of blue. The unnamed peaks towering over the glacier were bigger and comelier and infinitely more menacing than they would have been were I in the company of another person. And my emotions were similarly amplified: The highs were higher; the periods of despair were deeper and darker.

There were the occasional pictures of beaches with parasols and palm trees, but the majority of the content was of hotels. I looked at endless pictures of lobbies and reception desks, empty hotel bedrooms with doors open to balconies, restaurants with long buffet tables covered in white tablecloths, ballrooms and corridors and foyers full of armchairs where nobody sat.

Then, just as it was getting hot enough to make me fret slightly about having no hat, the road began to climb through mountains that were great barren piles of grey, slaty rock, but, because of the good surface, we covered just over eighty miles today despite much walking. I used my chlorinated pills for the first time in some doubtful-looking water obtained during the afternoon from a nomad camp, where the people were very courteous and kind. They invited me to have a meal with them and served some sort of porridge mixed with cheese and camel’s milk; I suppose I’ll get used to it but at the moment I wouldn’t actually say that camel’s milk is my favourite beverage. Huge herds of camels were being grazed around the encampment; goats or sheep wouldn’t survive this terrain. I asked if I might take photographs but though they didn’t refuse they were obviously against the idea so it would have been an abuse of hospitality to insist.",
