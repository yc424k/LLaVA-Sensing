I mean honestly, $24.50 just to walk around a restored village for a couple of hours. I gave silent thanks that I had ditched the wife and kids at Manchester Airport.

Each board is a fathom long and a palm wide, and both the front and the back curve up from the ground.

Both boards, one on each foot, are yoked together by long thongs, like the reins of a horse, which the man holds in his left hand. In his right, he carries a stick, the height of a man, which has at the bottom a ball of cloth filled with a large quantity of wool, the size of a human head, but weighing very little. The man leans on this stick as he walks over the snow, pushing with it until it is behind his shoulder, like a boatman poling a boat. In this way, he moves over the snow at speed and if it were not for this ingenious contrivance, it would be absolutely impossible to walk, for the snow lies on the earth like sand and never hardens. Thus, any animal that walks across it sinks in and dies, except for dogs or other very small creatures, such as hares and foxes, because they run fast and lightly. The coats of the foxes and hares in this country turn white like cotton, and in the region around Bulghār during the winter so does the coat of the wolf.",

For although the Patpong Road and the Grace Hotel were not exactly offering Love American Style, they were tricked up, even more than every other hopeful business, in all the hard and made-up finery of America. The bar girls were clad in Lee jeans and K-Mart tops; the songs on the jukebox were American, and so were the shows on the video. This was not, like the Philippines, a former American colony. Yet on any given day, the flashdancers of Bangkok could saunter from the Travolta Boutique to the Patty Duke Barbershop, then move from the Manhattan Hi-Tech Store to the Club Manhattan to the Manhattan Hotel (or the Florida, the Atlanta, the Reno, the Niagara, the Impala or the Miami). And on any given night, I could travel from the Don Juan Cocktail Lounge to the Honey Hotel, and thence, by way of the Lolita Nightclub and Disco Duck, to the Je T’Aime Guest House. One typical bar in Chiangmai advertised that this was “where expats do it,” before sniggering, “Come once and you’ll come many times.” Another joint down the street featured a crooner who sang “The Streets of London,” but changed the words so that a lament for the plight of the poor, the lonely and the homeless became a lurid, blow-by-blow account of a Thai girl bringing a foreigner to orgasm.",

Those fears proved how little whites understood the significance for blacks of 27 April 1994. Why should they, on today of all days, run destructively out of control? Now the new flag of liberated South Africa – their flag! – is to be seen flying high, outstretched in the wind, above every police station, army post and public building. Moreover, all SAPS officers have a tiny patch of sticky tape at the end of their name-badges obliterating the old flag. To people who have suffered so much at their hands (and their batons, guns and dogs) this is the most potent symbol of all.",

The thought, implying his bondage to her, irritated him acutely. It occurred to him that he would leave the letter lying open for her to see, and he would take the opportunity of telling her that he had sent his play to Cassandra for her to criticize. Possibly, but not by any means certainly, this would annoy her—and as he reached the doubtful comfort of this conclusion, there was a knock on the door and Katharine came in. They kissed each other coldly and she made no apology for being late. Nevertheless, her mere presence moved him strangely; but he was determined that this should not weaken his resolution to make some kind of stand against her; to get at the truth about her. He let her make her own disposition of clothes and busied himself with the plates.",

    "target_paragraph": "One fine morning in latter spring, about four months after the day of the transformation scene in Audrey's drawing-room, Ted Haviland was lying on his back sunning himself on the leads. There are many lovelier places even in London than the leads of No. 12 Devon Street, Pimlico, but none more favourable to high and solitary thinking. Here the roar of traffic is subdued to a murmur hardly greater than the stir of country woods on a warm spring morning—a murmur less obtrusive, because more monotonous. It is the place of all others for one absorbed in metaphysical speculation, or cultivating the gift of detachment. The very chimney-pots have a remote abstracted air; the slopes of the slates rise up around you, shutting you in on three sides, and throwing you so far back on yourself; while before you lies the vast, misty network of roofs, stretching eastward towards the heart of the city, and above you is the open sky. It is even pleasant here on a day like this, a day with all the ardour of summer in it, and all the languor of spring, with the sun warming the slates at your back, and a soft breeze from the river fanning your face. You must go up on to the leads on such a day to feel the beauty and infinity of blue sky, the only beautiful and boundless thing here, where there is no green earth to rival heaven.",

In 1990 the site was leased from the government for fifty years by Burapha Development Consultants Ltd, a German/Austrian/Swedish/Finnish consortium which planned to grow bluegums but soon switched to ecotourism.",

He had risen in the dark and ridden off to harangue some charcoal burners working in the monastery woods on the slopes of the Khasian mountains; a journey involving six hours in the saddle each way. We were alone with Bessarion. Outside the extreme severity of Mount Athos there seems to be no distinction of sex in the hospitality offered by Orthodox monasteries, and Joan was as welcome a guest here as any of the male visitors. Bessarion’s large eyes kindled behind his glasses as he told the stories of the local saints of Thessaly—the miracles of St Dionysius of Karditza and the death of the patron of his native place, St Gideon of Tyrnavos, martyred just over a century ago by Veli Pasha, son to Ali, the famous tyrant of Yanina. His own life story was interesting enough. After our retreat from Greece in 1941, he had hidden two British soldiers for a number of months in the foothills of Mount Olympus, later increasing their number with a wing-commander who had baled out of his burning aircraft on to the Thessalian plain. When this became too dangerous, he escaped with them by submarine from Trikeri, south of Mount Pelion, to the Middle East, where he served with the Greek Army from El Alamein to the final Greek triumph at Rimini. But he had always longed to be a monk, and, on his release, he had spent a number of months in various Athonite cloisters and hermitages. Then he stayed for a while in the monastery of Dousko on Mount Khodziakas, but, feeling unable to settle there, removed to the Meteora.",

Privy Councillor Wurmt, Chancelier d’Ambassade, was rather short-sighted. This meritorious official laying the papers on the table, disclosed a face of pasty complexion and of melancholy ugliness surrounded by a lot of fine, long dark grey hairs, barred heavily by thick and bushy eyebrows. He put on a black-framed pince-nez upon a blunt and shapeless nose, and seemed struck by Mr Verloc’s appearance. Under the enormous eyebrows his weak eyes blinked pathetically through the glasses.",

I wiped my brow on my sleeve and cursed the traffic. It was then about five o’clock and time for Asr, the afternoon prayer. We had heard the call to prayer before, but nothing prepared us for what followed. A deafening roar erupted through the air with the force of a thousand jet engines. I squeezed my eyes shut and I struggled to breathe. I may have lost a filling. Teresa jumped from her seat, shrieked, and cried. The roar echoed across the valley for several terrible minutes, and we were stuck in that car – with the windows rolled down – unable to get away. We didn’t know it then, but El Tahrir passes within a hundred yards of Cairo Tower, which, at 614 feet, is the tallest building in Egypt. And being the tallest building in Egypt, Cairo Tower is also a popular tourist attraction. The tower has two restaurants, an observation deck, and the largest, most powerful loudspeakers known to man. That last part may or may not be a minor exaggeration. In any case, five times a day, a muezzin recites a call to prayer from the loudspeakers on the tower, and the call can be heard – clearly – three miles away. That’s what we heard – and felt – from our unlucky vantage point next to the tower.",

This one lasted over five hours and became combative, mostly pertaining to the Northern Party. Once again, it was Stefansson’s vagueness about their movements and plans that caused deep concern. Some of these, again, were printed in newspaper interviews Stefansson had given—which was certainly news to the scientists. To the scientists, he’d suggested that they’d travel on the Karluk until new land was found; if none was discovered, they’d establish a land base on Prince Patrick Island, from which forays would be made into the unknown. But in the newspaper interview, Stefansson had revealed, according to William McKinlay, that the Karluk would “probably be frozen in; and in this case, she would certainly be crushed and sink.”",
