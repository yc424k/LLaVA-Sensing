It wasn’t the sexual tension that had frustrated me but the emotional game-playing around the Trauma That Could Not Be Mentioned. Colin had not given so much as a hint about what was plaguing him, and I had begun to imagine worst-case scenarios. Had he committed a crime? Was he on the run? Hiding from the police? But he was the police! Had he skipped out on someone? Was he gay? Had he robbed a bank? Killed someone in the line of duty? Bounced bad checks? Was he a pedophile? A con artist? Had he jilted someone? Was he a Ted Bundy type—nice and civil on the outside, a cold-hearted murderer on the inside?",

The sour memories of the special period made even the most desperate turn up their noses at pedaling. They had waited two days after Irma passed for things to calm down, but they couldn’t wait any longer. They called their friend Oswaldo, who drove a state taxi. His mother, Juanita, had been Cary’s secretary at Novalum, and they’d remained close ever since. The cab ride to the workshop cost them the equivalent of four dollars—more than a third of Cary’s monthly pension. It was a fortune, but they had to get there.",

Since my specialty was art, all I could think of was art collecting. So I wrote him a letter proposing that if I acted as his agent at the Kyoto auctions, he could develop a collection of Japanese art very affordably. Trammell liked the idea, and soon I was buying an enormous volume of screens and scrolls for him. To pay for them, he wired me sums of money far greater than I had ever dealt with before. I soon reached the limits of my old informal mode of operations: taxes had to paid, screen-repair expenses ballooned, employees had to be hired and the accounting became complicated. I had no choice but to establish a company, so in the fall of 1984 Chiiori Ltd was born. I took the name from my house in Shikoku, but Chiiori Ltd’s focus was far removed from the romance of Iya: it was all about taxes, accounting and the filing of official documents.",

It wasn’t very high, and at the top we had a picnic, above the treeline in the centre of a 360-degree horizon of mountains. There were over thirty lakes and lagoons in the park, and the slopes around them were coloured with fuchsias, the clear dark pink of stained glass. The day after that we travelled down to the eastern shore of Lake Llanquihue, the third largest lake in South America (286 square miles), and had another picnic in a field with sheepskins drying over the fence. Llanquihue was more like a sea than a lake. It was overlooked by the perfect cone of Osorno volcano, which Darwin watched erupting. Osorno is 8730 feet high and it is to volcanos what Krug is to champagne; it is the Taj Mahal of the natural world.",

They get drunk a lot and drop water balloons out of hotel windows. Their idea of advanced wit is to stick a cupped hand under their armpit and make farting noises. You can always tell a Shriner because he’s wearing a red fez and his socks don’t match. Ostensibly, Shriners get together to raise money for charities. This is what they tell their wives. However, here’s an interesting fact that may help you to put this claim into perspective. In 1984, according to Harper’s Magazine, the amount of money raised by the Shriners was $17.5 million; of this sum, the amount they donated to charities was $182,000. In short, what Shriners do is get together and be assholes. So you can perhaps conceive of my disquiet at the prospect of eating dinner amid a group of fifty bald-headed men who are throwing pats of butter around the room and setting fire to one another’s menus.",

Mamen took full advantage and got out on skis, overjoyed to have them underfoot again. Skiing came as naturally as walking or running to him, and he glided along the wind-polished surface, conscious of fresh cracks all around the ship and sastrugi—raised ridges of windblown snow. He eased into a rhythm, kick-glide, kick-glide, then moved into his double-pole technique, reaching out ahead with both poles, planting them, and, bending at the torso, thrusting himself forward again and again. He thrilled to the sound of the skis sliding across the ice, the improving light of the forenoon, and the freedom of being alone with his thoughts. It was like skiing across a frozen fjord back home in Christiania. Rupturing ice in the distance shook him from his daydreams. He realized that tonight was a full moon and recalled from Captain De Long’s Jeannette logs that violent ice disturbances coincided with the full moon, so he turned back and skied for the ship as fast as he could.",

You can’t see much from the street – the owners didn’t want common people staring at them as they sat on the lawn counting their money, so they put up dense hedges and high walls – but I discovered quite by chance that the city had built an asphalt footpath all along the cliff edge, from which I could see the backs of the grander mansions, as well as enjoy giddying views of the ocean breaking onto the rocks far below. I had the path almost to myself and walked along it in a state of quiet amazement, with my mouth open. I had never seen such a succession of vast houses, such an excess of architecture. Every house looked like a cross between a wedding-cake and a state capitol building. I knew that the grandest of all the houses was The Breakers, built by the Vanderbilts, and I kept thinking, ‘Well, this must be it’ and ‘Now surely this must be it,’ but then the next house along would be even more awesome. When at last I reached The Breakers, it was absolutely enormous, a mountain with windows. You can’t look at it without thinking that nobody, with the possible exception of oneself, deserves to be that rich.",

A hundred dolphins provided an escort much of the way. As the ship docked near the cannery in the evening, its graphophone played at full volume, attracting the attention of idle gold miners lurking near the pier. More than three thousand men from down south had departed up the Copper River the prior year “on the wildest, vaguest rumor of gold,” Burroughs wrote. “Alaska is full of such adventurers ransacking the land.” Scores had died from scurvy, and survivors were trickling back into Orca penniless, waiting by the waterfront and hoping that a pitying steamboat captain would front them passage back south. Orca had no need for a dry dock, due to its extreme tidal range. The propeller repair crew waited for low tide, waded out into the shoals, constructed a scaffold around the steamship’s broken blade, and slipped a new one into place before high tide returned.",

Teresa and I are bibliophiles, confirmed and consummated, born to browse shelves at bookstores around the world, and there, at last, was the first bookstore we found since we landed in Cairo a few days earlier. We hoped to find a copy of Lonely Planet Egypt, our preferred travel guide. At the start of our trip, we checked shops in Lisbon and at London Heathrow, but no luck. We thought we might find something at the Cairo airport or at a hotel or museum gift shop in Giza or Cairo, but no luck. Eventually, the mundane task of buying a guidebook took on a life of its own. We made a running joke of finding the book, but had, by then, surrendered all hope. Then we found that bookstore. I opened the door for Teresa, and a rush of cool, conditioned air welcomed us to the shop.",

The forecast was for warm dry weather extending unbroken for a week to come. There were sixteen or seventeen hours of sunlight each day. The scent of dog-rose sweetened the air. A crow flopped from an ash tree, its wings silver with sun. I felt filled with a boyish excitement. In my pack was a copy of Edward Thomas’s The Icknield Way, his prose account of his journey along the Way.",

Herat lies midway between the two halves of Timur’s empire, Persia and Oxiana; and of the two roads that join them, it commands the easier, the one that I shall take; for the other, via Merv, is desert and waterless. Geographically, therefore, it was more suited to be capital than Samarcand; and on Timur’s death, in 1405, Shah Rukh made it so. Politically, culturally, and commercially it became the metropolis of middle Asia. Embassies came to it from Cairo, Constantinople, and Pekin; Bretschneider in Mediaeval Researches from Eastern Asiatic Sources gives the Chinese descriptions of it. After the twenty years’ confusion that followed Shah Rukh’s death in 1447, it was taken by Hussein Baikara, a descendant of Timur’s son Omar Sheikh. And he gave it peace for another forty years. This was the summer of the Renascence, when Mirkhond and Khondemir were writing their histories, Jami was singing, Bihzad painting, and Ali Shir Nevai was the champion of literary Turki. It was the Herat of this epoch, when the Uzbegs were on the march and Samarcand had already fallen, that Babur saw as a young man. “The whole habitable world,” he recalls afterwards, “had not such a town as Herat had become under Sultan Hussein Mirza. . . . Khorasan, and Herat above all, was filled with learned and matchless men. Whatever work a man took up, he aimed and aspired to bring it to perfection.”",

The same throngs of pear-shaped people in Reeboks wandered between food smells, clutching grotesque comestibles and bucket-sized soft drinks. It was still the same tacky, horrible place. Yet I would hardly have recognized it from just nine years before. Nearly every building I remembered had been torn down and replaced with something new—principally, mini-malls and shopping courts, which stretched back from the main street and offered a whole new galaxy of shopping and eating opportunities.",

Mamen’s knee was fair, but it would be tasked in the days ahead, that he knew. Bartlett knew it, too, and he ordered Mamen to stay in camp for a few days as the first parties ascended the pressure ridges. He asked Mamen and Williamson to attend to Malloch’s and Maurer’s feet, and they cut away the dead flesh and bandaged their feet with strips of torn cloth. Everyone else seemed to be fine.

She was completely taken aback by finding her arm suddenly dropped; then she saw his face most strangely contorted; was he laughing, it flashed across her? In another moment she saw that he was in tears. In her bewilderment at this apparition she stood aghast for a second. With a desperate sense that this horror must, at all costs, be stopped, she then put her arms about him, drew his head for a moment upon her shoulder, and led him on, murmuring words of consolation, until he heaved a great sigh. They held fast to each other; her tears, too, ran down her cheeks; and were both quite silent. Noticing the difficulty with which he walked, and feeling the same extreme lassitude in her own limbs, she proposed that they should rest for a moment where the bracken was brown and shrivelled beneath an oak-tree. He assented. Once more he gave a great sigh, and wiped his eyes with a childlike unconsciousness, and began to speak without a trace of his previous anger. The idea came to her that they were like the children in the fairy tale who were lost in a wood, and with this in her mind she noticed the scattering of dead leaves all round them which had been blown by the wind into heaps, a foot or two deep, here and there.",

The youngest just entered university, and his eldest two daughters had children. He was a proud grandfather and he carried photos of the young families in his wallet. I asked why he was at the pyramids that day, and he held up a canvas saddlebag filled with knick-knacks. He was a teacher, he said, but, during the summer, he sold souvenirs to tourists, to raise money for his grandchildren. He wondered where I was from, and he asked about the schools and the universities around Boston. He had heard of Harvard University, but knew only that it was in America, which, for most of us, is all one really needs to know about it. I asked him about Giza, and the schools and universities there. I told him that we tried to tour Cairo University, but the campus was closed.",

Because we must probe to the bottom of our collective wound. As men, as Americans, we can no longer cringe away and lie. Are we not all warmed by the same sun, frozen by the same cold, shone on by the same lights of time and terror here in America? Yes, and if we do not look and see it, we shall be all damned together.",

The thin grasses, more or less coating the hill, were touched by the wind in breezes of differing powers, and almost differing natures – one rubbing the blades heavily, another raking them piercingly, another brushing them like a soft broom. The instinctive act of human-kind here was to stand, and listen, and learn how the trees on the right and the trees on the left wailed or chanted to each other in the regular antiphonies of a cathedral choir; how hedges and other shapes to leeward then caught the note, lowering it to the tenderest sob; and how the hurrying gust then plunged into the south to be heard no more.",

Those with feet toughened by time, he pointed out, could walk across hot desert stones, crush thorns along forest trails. Besides, he claimed, only fools fish wearing shoes. Only when barefoot, in touch with nature, feeling the way the fish move, knowing their names, bocachico, patalón, peje, cucha, dorado, could one properly throw the atarraya.",

For thirty years he had kept them and let them run to jungle, while on neighbouring farms, mile after mile of hedgerow had been destroyed. Using a series of old maps, he had researched the changing hedgerow extent in his parish. In 1970, just after he moved to Walnut Tree Farm, he estimated there to be four miles of hedge within half a mile of his house, excluding his land, and a total of thirty-seven miles of hedge in the parish itself. Now only one and a half miles were left in his vicinity, and no more than eight miles in the entire parish.",

Because there wasn’t a passenger seat, Henry Ford, like all other passengers, had to sit on the armrest, more or less doubled up. Back on the ground, Henry boasted that he had “handled the stick” for a while, and looked awfully pleased with himself. Asked by newsmen about progress on the secret new car, Edsel said that things were going so well that it was ready to go into production. It isn’t clear if he was being optimistic or deluded, but in either case he was quite wrong. Production was still some months off.",

The land had to belong to the state, or, in any case, to be available to the state for nothing. In addition, the committee and its consultants established standards of their own. Since weather and cold worsen with altitude, they would look for a site below two thousand feet. It should have, among other things, good soil, ample water, topography both practical and aesthetically appealing, relatively modest annual snowfall. It should not inconvenience resident wildlife—should not invade bear-denning grounds, salmon-spawning areas—and it should not be in zones of earthquakes or volcanism.",

We stood for some time and watched them receiving similar treatment; then a rather spiritless game was played, in which a body of men armed with staves attacked a body of women, also armed with staves, who were defending a mysterious bundle hanging from a cross-beam. I intended to ask Babaji Rao whether this had anything to do with the legend of Holikar, and whether gulal represented fire; but my curiosity was a little damped. When we returned to the encampment His Highness was still there examining silks and brocades, and thinking he would be amused to see me, I went in to him before changing and said I too was a piece of brocade and would he care to purchase me.",
