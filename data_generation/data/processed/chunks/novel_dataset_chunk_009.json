All eight of us crawled behind a bush and tried to sneak glances into the shallow pool below. Dozens of salmon were swimming slowly in circles, making light splashing noises as they leaped and spasmed. “This is nothing,” Harry said. “Sometimes it’s like popcorn popping down there.”",

Her, though remembering illness, recalled the suffocation of steam heat, the fragrance of hothouse lilac. White lilac wafted ineffable remembrance. Like the super note on the violin string, the thing in Her reverberated slightly. She shifted her frozen feet, moved back, slid backward till her heels felt the frozen grass edge of the little river. Then she clambered self-consciously alert back toward the scrubby pathway. Oak saplings tore at skirt and rough coat. Her hands pushed into the wide blue pockets, clenched tight in her fur-lined old gloves. Her head bent back, saw trees etched here in the inner wood, more casually. One branch cut above a mass of tangled branches and made a straight heavy smudge across the dazzling whiteness. Heavy trunks showed furrows and now she heard a squeak almost under her feet; some squirrel in a tree bole or some burrowing rabbit. “Coons, squirrels, once a red fox. But he must have got away from people hunting by Broadstairs.”",

In the city’s main bar – open-air, separated from the pavement by a trellis supporting a creeper laden with fragrant white blossoms – I was tentatively approached by two respectably dressed woman beggars; they reminded me of Siberia’s destitute pensioners in 2002 and 2004, victims of the Soviet Union’s collapse.

The air over London seemed a rough sea of sound through which circles travelled. But the clocks were irregular, as if the saints themselves were divided. There were pauses, silences… Then the clocks struck again.",

At the very moment that they were doing so, Germany underwent the notorious outburst known as Kristallnacht, when citizens across the nation attacked Jewish shops and property. (Kristallnacht, or “night of glass,” refers to the broken glass left behind.) Kristallnacht has an almost festive sound, as if it were a night of lighthearted pranks and merriment. In fact, it was state-countenanced terror. In his book Hitlerland, Andrew Nagorski recounts one incident in which a young boy was flung from an upstairs window into the street below. As the injured boy tried to crawl away, members of the crowd took turns kicking him. He was saved by a passing American. Kristallnacht horrified the world.",

Indeed, the temper of the meeting was now unfavourable to separate conversation; it had become rather debauched and hilarious, and people who scarcely knew each other were making use of Christian names with apparent cordiality, and had reached that kind of gay tolerance and general friendliness which human beings in England only attain after sitting together for three hours or so, and the first cold blast in the air of the street freezes them into isolation once more. Cloaks were being flung round the shoulders, hats swiftly pinned to the head; and Denham had the mortification of seeing Katharine helped to prepare herself by the ridiculous Rodney. It was not the convention of the meeting to say good-bye, or necessarily even to nod to the person with whom one was talking; but, nevertheless, Denham was disappointed by the completeness with which Katharine parted from him, without any attempt to finish her sentence. She left with Rodney.",

Somehow, though?perhaps it was the adrenaline of being nearly done?I felt almost like the last twenty-three hundred miles had never happened. I didn’t feel the same desperate relentlessness to hike fifty miles a day that I did in Oregon, yet I could not help but push past my planned campsites. It didn’t seem to matter how chronically fatigued I was or how long it took to cover the miles?my mind simply would not let my body stop until I literally could not walk another step. The result was that I was covering ten or more miles than I had planned every day. I had been a machine before, and now I was something far more primal, the lioness, closing in on the end of my journey. Canada was close and nothing seemed to matter but getting there.",

I was surprised, opening a door, to find people thus occupied; I hesitated, taking a cup of tea, whether one said milk or sugar. And the light of the stars falling, as it falls now, on my hand after travelling for millions upon millions of years—I could get a cold shock from that for a moment—not more, my imagination is too feeble. But some doubt remained. A shadow flitted through my mind like moths’ wings among chairs and tables in a room in the evening. When, for example, I went to Lincolnshire that summer to see Susan and she advanced towards me across the garden with the lazy movement of a half-filled sail, with the swaying movement of a woman with child, I thought, “It goes on; but why?” We sat in the garden; the farm carts came up dripping with hay; there was the usual country gabble of rooks and doves; fruit was netted and covered over; the gardener dug. Bees boomed down the purple tunnels of flowers; bees embedded themselves on the golden shields of sunflowers. Little twigs were blown across the grass. How rhythmical, and half conscious and like something wrapped in mist it was; but to me hateful, like a net folding one’s limbs in its meshes, cramping. She who had refused Percival lent herself to this, to this covering over.",

All along the sidewalks people sat at wobbly tables selling packets of cigarettes and cheap novelties. All the cars parked along the street were dirty and battered. All the stores looked gloomy and dusty and their windows were full of items whose packaging had faded, sometimes almost to invisibility, in the brilliant sunshine.

Whether we decide to stay or whether they will let us stay is another matter. We can, however, stay to refuel and re-provision and for as long as it takes to make necessary repairs. Assuming we get there and the fees are crazy, we can stay a day or so and then move on. At least we will have had an opportunity to stop and refuel because the next leg, the run to the Marquesas, is 25-30 days, and I think we are going to be burning a lot of fuel just getting to Galapagos.”",

The outdoor tables at Bar Sport face the Piazza Signorelli. A few farmers sell produce on the steps of the nineteenth-century teatro every morning. As we drink espresso, we watch them holding up rusty hand scales to weigh the tomatoes. The rest of the piazza is lined with perfectly intact medieval or Renaissance palazzi. Easily, someone might step out any second and break into La Traviata. Every day we visit each keystoned medieval gate in the Etruscan walls, explore the Fiat-wide stone streets lined with Renaissance and older houses and the even narrower vicoli, mysterious pedestrian passageways, often steeply stepped. The bricked-up fourteenth-century “doors of the dead” are still visible. These ghosts of doors beside the main entrance were designed, some say, to take out the plague victims—bad luck for them to exit by the main entrance. I notice in the regular doors, people often leave their keys in the lock.",

There is piping memorabilia here and it has enough room that one would think that it might be a non-café hours piping school. But the puzzle remains to this day. What it is, is a damn fine café.

We hardly have used those bathrooms and had not let water run long enough for the hot water to arrive, so we had not noticed that neither bathroom had cold water at all.

Existence was a luxury, and reckless riding a mere outcome of the animal spirits of horses and riders, and the thud of the shoeless feet as the horses galloped over the soft grass was sweeter than music. I could hardly hold my horse at all, and down hills as steep as the east side of Arthur's Seat, over knife-like ridges too narrow for two to ride abreast, and along side-tracks only a foot wide, we rode at full gallop, till we pulled up at the top of a descent of 2,000 feet with a broad, rapid river at its feet, emerging from between colossal walls of rock to girdle a natural lawn of the bright manienie grass. There had been a \"drive\" of horses, and numbers of these; with their picturesque saddles, were picketed there, while their yet more picturesque, scarlet-shirted riders lounged in the sun.",

Now I see the fortress castle, an old thing, out forward to sea: and a little lighthouse and the way in. And beyond, the town-front with great palm trees and other curious dark trees, and behind these the large square buildings of the south rising imposingly, as if severe, big palaces upon the promenade.

On warm days my bump of benevolence melts away entirely, and grows bigger in proportion as the thermometer descends.

I just hobble with Sammie out of the aviary, my body seized up and miserable after the endless buses. I close the door behind me. I think I can see what might be the first star, pale in a flat sky. I stare up at it, blinking back tears, listening to the high-pitched whine of mosquitoes and the drone of amphibians in the murky wet grasses. The canopy is black, ragged lines of shadow. Only the last hints of red still cling on. The savage coal-dark needles that coat the trees and the ground bleed together. The air is suddenly as heavy as I feel.",

    "target_paragraph": "Though the Eighteenth Amendment made Prohibition a legal reality by outlawing intoxicating drinks, it didn’t define how it would work or even indicate what was or was not an intoxicant. That required an additional piece of legislation, known as the Volstead Act, to deal with the details. The act was named for Andrew J. Volstead, a Minnesotan like Lindbergh, whose principal distinguishing feature was a spectacular mustache that hung from his upper lip like a bearskin rug. Though a nondrinker himself, Volstead was no zealot and would never have sought a national ban on alcohol. His name became attached to the legislation simply because he was chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and therefore required to draft it. Although Volstead’s name rang through the decade, he himself was thrown out by the electorate at the next election, and he returned to his hometown of Granite Falls, Minnesota, where he quietly practiced law and listed his principal hobby as reading the Congressional Record. Wayne Wheeler always claimed that he himself really designed and wrote the legislation, an assertion heatedly disputed by Volstead, though why either would want credit for the act is a reasonable question because it proved to be a strikingly ill-constructed bill.",

    "target_paragraph": "Katharine was still out when she arrived at Cheyne Walk. After greeting her uncle and aunt and receiving, as usual, a present of two sovereigns for ‘cab fares and dissipation’ from Uncle Trevor, whose favourite niece she was, she changed her dress and wandered into Katharine’s room to await her. What a great looking-glass Katharine had, she thought, and how mature all the arrangements upon the dressing-table were compared to what she was used to at home. Glancing round, she thought that the bills stuck upon a skewer and stood for ornament upon the mantelpiece were astonishingly like Katharine. There wasn’t a photograph of William anywhere to be seen. The room, with its combination of luxury and bareness, its silk dressing-gowns and crimson slippers, its shabby carpet and bare walls, had a powerful air of Katharine herself; she stood in the middle of the room and enjoyed the sensation; and then, with a desire to finger what her cousin was in the habit of fingering, Cassandra began to take down the books which stood in a row upon the shelf above the bed. In most houses this shelf is the ledge upon which the last relics of religious belief lodge themselves as if, late at night, in the heart of privacy, people, sceptical by day, find solace in sipping one draught of the old charm for such sorrows or perplexities as may steal from their hiding-places in the dark. But there was no hymn-book here. By their battered covers and enigmatical contents, Cassandra judged them to be old school-books belonging to Uncle Trevor, and piously, though eccentrically, preserved by his daughter. There was no end, she thought, to the unexpectedness of Katharine. She had once had a passion for geometry herself, and, curled upon Katharine’s quilt, she became absorbed in trying to remember how far she had forgotten what she once knew. Katharine, coming in a little later, found her deep in this characteristic pursuit.",

    "target_paragraph": "Written and directed by twenty-seven-year-old Farhan Akhtar, Dil Chahta Hai is about the year between college and marriage—the one brief moment most middle-class Indians have to be free. Three male friends spend the time hanging out, going to Goa and falling in love—one with an older divorced alcoholic, one with lots of girls, and Aamir’s character with Preity’s character, who is already betrothed. Of course the older woman dies, the flirt falls in love with an arranged match, Preity’s character gets permission to marry Aamir’s character and no one even kisses. But otherwise it’s radical. The movie uses real sound (not badly dubbed, overly dramatic studio sound), they dance to a trance beat in leather and silver pants and take the postmodern piss out of Indian film culture with a song featuring a woman’s sari being blown tight against her body while she dances on a hill. (The blowing sari is ubiquitous in Indian cinema—it clings in a sensual way signifying passion and abandon, but its status as the traditional dress also signifies goodness and tradition. The character’s honor is preserved even though you can see the outline of her bosoms and hips.) Dil Chahta Hai is cheeky and irreverent but not too rude. The best jokes are against Westerners—an Australian drunken tramp and a Swiss slutty thief provide slapstick while subtly showing that India is the best country and foreigners are loose and immoral. For the first time I find myself laughing with a Hindi flick and not at it. Until the action moves to Sydney. Then I nearly cry with longing as Preity and Aamir dance around the trees in Hyde Park, flirt on the Luna Park roller coaster, run to catch a train at Homebush and cry in my favorite place in the world, Waverley Cemetery.",

The balconies were decorated with floral stuccowork, and above the doors were antique stained-glass windows, now almost black with decades of accumulated dust. Dingy one-room shops were tucked into nooks and crannies on the ground floor of each building. There was a dressmaker’s where seamstresses were bent over foot-operated sewing machines, a snack shop lodged beneath a stairwell, and a tiny photocopy booth with a couple of ageing machines that were often incapacitated by the frequent power cuts. The musical cry of vendors echoed up and down the street. ‘Pyaung bu!’ yelled one woman over and over again, stretching out the vowels like an opera singer: ‘Sweetcorn!’ She carried a round rattan basket on top of her head, and when an old man lounging in a doorway clapped his hands to attract her attention she walked over and set the basket down in front of him. She removed the lid of the basket and a great cloud of steam escaped, fogging up the old man’s glasses. After he had chosen two cobs of boiled corn and paid for them, she squatted down to ease the basket back on to her head and strolled on. ‘Pyaung bu! Pyaung buu-uu-uu!’ Other vendors included a woman selling yoghurt sweetened with jaggery, a man carrying a fan of brooms on his back, and another with plastic buckets hung on a bamboo pole.",
