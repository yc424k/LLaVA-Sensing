Mention of my predominantly German heritage met with approval by those who thought I resembled the German tourists they observed in the summers, without the backpack and walking stick, that is.",

There we had no alternative but to rejoin the road; on the surrounding slopes not even the campesinos have been able to devise a redura. By this stage I was, as Rachel observed, getting into one of my grazing tizzies. Then at last we saw a grassy site beyond a gorge so deep that its river is invisible though audible. Here Juana has a choice of grass, shrubs and herbs, but we are on a ludicrously sloping ledge with barely enough room for the tent. It’s a cloudless evening, after much midday rain, and suffocatingly hot. We’ve run out of water (my fault) and there are swarms of insatiable winged predators – at least four different species. We’ve also seen, for the first time in Peru, a few giant bats.",

Upon arrival, we made our usual mistake of looking at the map and thinking that we could figure out how to drive to our chosen destination along the cramped, twisted roads instead of just parking in the first convenient spot and walking. Thus, after a good deal of frustrating maneuvers that always ended up in the same place, we parked and took a stroll through the rather deserted streets. As all over Calabria, the buildings appeared in various states of repair. Nondescript edifices stood beside the occasional elegant patrician residence. Small shops sold local products and items made in China. A number of churches still preserved Rossano’s Byzantine heritage, most notably the attractive, compact Church of San Marco that dates from the tenth century and is similar to the Cattolica di Stilo, laid out in the form of a Greek cross and topped by five cylindrical cupolas.",

Directly in her line of vision a blackberry branch laid its frail white flowers and blue-green leaves against the sky. Just beyond, a tuft of sweet-fern uncurled between the beaded shoots of the grass, and a small yellow butterfly vibrated over them like a fleck of sunshine. This was all she saw; but she felt, above her and about her, the strong growth of the beeches clothing the ridge, the rounding of pale green cones on countless spruce-branches, the push of myriads of sweet-fern fronds in the cracks of the stony slope below the wood, and the crowding shoots of meadowsweet and yellow flags in the pasture beyond. All this bubbling of sap and slipping of sheaths and bursting of calyxes was carried to her on mingled currents of fragrance. Every leaf and bud and blade seemed to contribute its exhalation to the pervading sweetness in which the pungency of pine-sap prevailed over the spice of thyme and the subtle perfume of fern, and all were merged in a moist earth-smell that was like the breath of some huge sun-warmed animal.",

He had, in truth, gone on to Sherton after the interview, in the hope of calming himself by business; but this Grace did not know. In an indefinite dread that something serious would arise out of Melbury’s visit by reason of the inequalities of temper and nervous irritation to which he was subject, something possibly that would bring her much more misery than accompanied her present negative state of mind, she left the house about three o’clock, and took a loitering walk in the woodland track by which she imagined he would come home. This track under the bare trees and over the cracking sticks, screened and roofed in from the outer world of wind by a network of boughs, led her slowly on till in time she had left the larger trees behind her and swept round into the coppice where Winterborne and his men were clearing the undergrowth.",

When at last he reappeared a fire had been lit under the engine to thaw it, our gear had been taken aboard and we were in our seat – but then the jeep refused to move, though the engine started willingly enough. Mohammad jumped out, looking unperturbed, and a number of hammered screws and knotted pieces of wire were ‘done hast’, to replace what the makers would undoubtedly describe as vital parts. These ‘re-pears’ had the desired effect and at 2.10 we moved off, along a track I well remember following on my bicycle Roz.

Theoretically, fresh water vapor should rise and collect on the plastic tent that I’ve taped over the front and ends as well as the box lid, and then drip down the sides and collect in the box bottom around the outside of the cans. The experiment is a depressing failure. I don’t have enough tape to seal the tent to the box thoroughly, and the tape does not stick well to the slippery box. Therefore, excessive ventilation on the inside of the tent prevents moisture from collecting.",

Late at night most drivers had closed the curtains to their sleeper compartments. The curtains close with a zipper or by pressing together strips of Velcro or by connecting long, thin magnetic strips, which are the best. Magnetic strips let in the least light or prying eyes, and they are the easiest and least noisy to seal and unseal. Some trucks have curtains that can cover the windshield and side windows, too. This way a driver could use the driving area like a private living room, albeit a very small one.",

But there was a tone in her voice, or a shade in her opinions, or a swing of her gloves which served to irritate Mary Datchet, whose manner became increasingly direct, abrupt, and even antagonistic. She became conscious of a wish to make Katharine realize the importance of this work, which she discussed so coolly, as though she, too, had sacrificed what Mary herself had sacrificed. The swinging of the gloves ceased, and Katharine, after ten minutes, began to make movements preliminary to departure. At the sight of this, Mary was aware—she was abnormally aware of things tonight—of another very strong desire; Katharine was not to be allowed to go, to disappear into the free, happy world of irresponsible individuals. She must be made to realize—to feel.",

At this hour, this still early hour, I think I am the field, I am the barn, I am the trees; mine are the flocks of birds, and this young hare who leaps, at the last moment when I step almost on him. Mine is the heron that stretches its vast wings lazily; and the cow that creaks as it pushes one foot before another munching; and the wild, swooping swallow; and the faint red in the sky, and the green when the red fades; the silence and the bell; the call of the man fetching cart-horses from the fields—all are mine.",

A woman sits by herself on another bench, sketching the colors in front of her, and a flock of Boy Scouts is sent to gather all the trash (nonexistent, as far as I’m concerned), their yellow shirts fluttering across the clean green spaces.",

I spy Skye and the Small Islands in the distance. They, especially the Isle of Rum, are also part of the volcanic heritage of this area. Think Hawaii with the chain of islands as the earth’s crust moved over a tectonic hot spot. Same here though eons older.

I had visions of hosepipes rupturing, hot oil spraying everywhere, me rolling to a steamy, hissing halt out here on this desolate road. The wandering sun was just settling on to the horizon, splashing the sky with faint pinks. Uneasily I drove on, and steeled myself for the prospect of a night spent beneath the stars, with dog-like animals sniffing at my feet and snakes finding warmth up a trouser leg. Ahead of me on the road an advancing storm of dust became after a moment a pickup truck, which passed in a hell-bent fashion, spraying the car with rocky projectiles, which thumped against the sides and bounced off the windows with a cracking sound, and then left me adrift in a cloud of dust. I trundled on, peering helplessly through the murk. It cleared just in time to show me that I was twenty feet from a T-Junction with a stop sign. I was going fifty miles an hour, which on gravel leaves you with a stopping distance of about three miles. I jumped on the brakes with all my feet and made a noise like Tarzan missing a vine as the car went into a skid. It slid sideways past the stop sign and out onto a paved highway, where it came to a halt, rocking gently from side to side. At that instant an enormous semi-trailer truck – all silver horns and flashing lights – blared mightily at me as it swept past, setting the car rocking again. Had I slid out on to the highway three seconds earlier it would have crushed the car into something about the size of a stock cube. I pulled on to the shoulder and got out to examine the damage. It looked as if the car had been dive-bombed with bags of flour. Bits of raw metal showed through where the paint had been pinged away. I thanked God that my mother was so much smaller than me. I sighed, suddenly feeling lost and far from home, and noticed ahead a road sign pointing the way to Quincy. I had come to a halt facing in the right direction, so at least something had come of it.",

Several times, over the next few days, I had to retrace my steps: when an apparently purposeful path ended on a cliff-edge and I realised its only users were wood-cutters; or when the way was blocked by a creeper-entangled fallen tree, an obstacle I might have tackled ten years ago but not now with aged bones to be considered. As I had precalculated, water was no problem; a delicious stream ran through every ravine. The humidity was testing but the sun rarely touched me. Amidst these dense, damp forests I was moving through a green twilight, emerging at intervals on to open terraced slopes where two or three families cultivated coffee, their crop flourishing in the nearby shade. My CDR apprehension was not justified; the astounded campesiños were of course curious but never interventionist. I got no whiff of the suspicion and hostility encountered by the exhausted Granma survivors who struggled into the Sierra Maestra in December 1956. Soon they were reunited with other survivors and recruited four locals, bringing the platoon up to twenty by the end of the month.",

By that time the abstraction of Muromachi had long since given way to the colorful ‘floating world’ of Kabuki and block prints. All that empty white space was seen as unsatisfactory, so the mounter brushed gold paint over the wide-open expanses in order to liven up the screens. At the same time, he erased the name of the original artist and wrote in the signature of Kano Tan’yu, a famous painter much in demand with Edo merchants. But there was no way that the screens could be by Tan’yu. Disguised by their layer of gold paint, they sat as a ‘mystery piece’ in a corner of my house for several years.",

The lights were soft, shaded, quietly and warmly subdued: the higher parts of the room were pools of mysterious gloom from which the Gloucester fishing nets depended, but within the radius of the little lamps, one could see groups of people tastefully arranged in all the attitudes of rapt attentiveness. Some of the young women slouched dreamily upon sofas, the faces and bodies leaning toward the reader with a yearning movement, other groups could be vaguely discerned leaning upon the grand piano, or elegantly slumped against the walls with tea-cups in their hands. Mr Cram, the old composer, occupied a chosen seat on a fat sofa; he drew voluptuously on a moist cigarette which he held daintily between his dirty fingers, his hawk-like face turned meditatively away into the subtle mysteries of the fishing nets. From time to time he would thrust one dirty hand through the long sparse locks of his grey hair, and then draw deeply, thoughtfully on his cigarette.",

Further, he made the mistake of emphasizing the difficulty of getting a room there, although there really was no difficulty: he told him the place was a quiet family hotel, that the management wanted regular tenants of quiet habits who intended to live there permanently, that the preference was given to middle-aged married couples, and that there were no vacancies, anyway – that a long list of applicants were waiting to get in. All this merely whetted Robert’s eagerness: he now said that he fulfilled all the requirements save marriage, and that this deficiency would soon be remedied: he said he had completely reformed his old habits of life, and that a quieter, steadier, more sober and industrious man did not exist: he said he was determined to live there, and he demanded that Eugene take him to the manager and plead for him without delay.",

    "target_paragraph": "That German divine who lately traced, with some little exacerbation, Catholic institutions to their pagan origins, forgot to discover, or perhaps to mention, that his own pseudo-rationalistic creed is far more deadly, since it infects those who lead the march of culture. If Italians are ever to have that reformation of which they talk so much, it is to be hoped that they will go a step further than the Germans, who pulled up at the first ‘Wirtshaus’. Even now, Neapolitans shrug their shoulders at Saint Januarius, whose periodical liquefaction is a fine pretext for fireworks and military music, and while the world is astonished at the nuptials between the lord of a great ‘Kulturstaat’ and the Antique Fraud, Catholicism in Naples, ever serene and infantile, is gracefully expiring; its venerable frame suffused, dolphin-like, with all the myriad hues of the rainbow-tinted paganism whence it sprang. All this must be a matter of climate. New names will supplant old names, but so long as the climate of Campania does not change, its religious beliefs–ceremonies, rather–will always cluster round radiant elemental powers of sun and ocean.",
