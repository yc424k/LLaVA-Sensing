It was widely believed that the earth was less than 6,000 years old, and that it had not aged visibly in that time. No landscape had a past worth contemplation, for the world’s surface had always looked the same. Mountains, like everything else upon the earth, had been brought into being during that first frenzied week of creativity described in Genesis. They had been established on the third day, in fact, at the same time as the polar zones were frozen and the tropics were warmed, and their appearance had not altered much since, save for the cosmetic effects of lichen growth and a little light weathering. Even the Flood had left them untouched.",

Some will be conceived tonight around the fountain-ruin with horrible shriekings as from the victims of emperors or emperors meeting their own ends, which the people who live above the colonnades will scarcely hear; if they do hear they will turn over and sleep again like children. A more fearful continuity has sprung up where theirs left off; a hundred and fifty charms are working for that neighborhood alone. The cats are not idle at all now, and not playing. Among the vines in the highest window of the jungle palace an eye burns that no human ever saw; between screams a furry figure is caught a second in the streetlight’s gleam, in mid-spring, with claws bared to the root sharper than any doctor’s tool, plunging to silence and the dark. No troop of Swiss could guard these mysteries.",

Neither the SAP nor the distressed Mr Mandela dare muzzle him, not with all those Young Lions longing for an excuse to spring. But the ANC leadership recently persuaded him to mumble a half-hearted retraction, something about killing Boers being his ‘personal view, not policy, not to be taken seriously’. It is, however, taken very seriously. Many South Africans, black as well as white, feel it proves their country is, in practice, leaderless – speeding towards anarchy. And the SABC is co-operating in the use of this chant as a form of psychological terrorism. Whites can’t dismiss it as demagoguery; farmers are being killed, quite regularly, and a considerable number have moved to dorps or cities. In fact few such murders have any political flavour; most are the results of armed robberies. Yet the failure to restrain Mokaba means that a minority of militant young blacks have the sort of power they could not have in a stable society, hence the whiff of anarchy in the air. For me, it’s easy to appreciate the dilemma of Madiba and his Comrades when confronted by Mokaba and his Comrades. But, to many whites, the Mokaba chant expresses the ANC’s true feelings which the leadership is cleverly concealing while manoeuvring itself into government.",

As the sun sank, all the domes, spires, turrets, and pinnacles of London rose in inky blackness against the furious red sunset clouds. Here was the fretted cross at Charing; there the dome of St Paul’s;* there the massy* square of the Tower buildings; there like a grove of trees stripped of all leaves save a knob at the end were the heads on the pikes at Temple Bar.* Now the Abbey windows were lit up and burnt like a heavenly, many-coloured shield (in Orlando’s fancy); now all the west seemed a golden window with troops of angels (in Orlando’s fancy again) passing up and down the heavenly stairs perpetually. All the time they seemed to be skating on fathomless depths of air, so blue the ice had become; and so glassy smooth was it that they sped quicker and quicker to the city with the white gulls circling about them, and cutting in the air with their wings the very same sweeps that they cut on the ice with their skates.",

    "target_paragraph": "Stephen ought to have gone to England that summer; at Morton there had been a change of agent, and once again certain questions had arisen which required her careful personal attention. But time had not softened Anna’s attitude to Mary, and time had not lessened Stephen’s exasperation—the more so as Mary no longer hid the bitterness that she felt at this treatment. So Stephen tackled the business by writing a number of long and wearisome letters, unwilling to set foot again in the house where Mary Llewellyn would not be welcome. But as always the thought of England wounded, bringing with it the old familiar longing—homesick she would feel as she sat at her desk writing those wearisome business letters. For even as Jamie must crave for the grey, wind-swept street and the wind-swept uplands of Beedles, so Stephen must crave for the curving hills, for the long green hedges and pastures of Morton. Jamie openly wept when such moods were upon her, but the easement of tears was denied to Stephen.\nIn August Jamie and Barbara joined them in a villa that Stephen had taken at Houlgate. Mary hoped that the bathing would do Barbara good; she was not at all well. Jamie worried about her. And indeed the girl had grown very frail, so frail that the housework now tried her sorely; when alone she must sit down and hold her side for the pain that was never mentioned to Jamie. Then too, all was not well between them these days; poverty, even hunger at times, the sense of being unwanted outcasts, the knowledge that the people to whom they belonged—good and honest people—both abhorred and despised them, such things as these had proved very bad housemates for sensitive souls like Barbara and Jamie.\nLarge, helpless, untidy and intensely forlorn, Jamie would struggle to finish her opera; but quite often these days she would tear up her work, knowing that what she had written was unworthy. When this happened she would sigh and peer round the studio, vaguely conscious that something was not as it had been, vaguely distressed by the dirt of the place to which she herself had helped to contribute—Jamie, who had never before noticed dirt, would feel aggrieved by its noxious presence. Getting up she would wipe the keys of the piano with Barbara’s one clean towel dipped in water.\n‘Can’t play,’ she would grumble, ‘these keys are all sticky.’ ‘Oh, Jamie—my towel—go and fetch the duster!’\nThe quarrel that ensued would start Barbara’s cough, which in turn would start Jamie’s nerves vibrating. Then compassion, together with unreasoning anger and a sudden uprush of sex-frustration, would make her feel well nigh beside herself—since owing to Barbara’s failing health, these two could be lovers now in name only. And this forced abstinence told on Jamie’s work as well as her nerves, destroying her music, for those who maintain that the North is cold, might just as well tell us that hell is freezing. Yet she did her best, the poor uncouth creature, to subjugate the love of the flesh to the pure and more selfless love of the spirit—the flesh did not have it all its own way with Jamie.\nThat summer she made a great effort to talk, to unburden herself when alone with Stephen; and Stephen tried hard to console and advise, while knowing that she could help very little. All her offers of money to ease the strain were refused pointblank, sometimes almost with rudeness—she felt very anxious indeed about Jamie.\nMary in her turn was deeply concerned; her affection for Barbara had never wavered, and she sat for long hours in the garden with the girl who seemed too weak to bathe, and whom walking exhausted.\n‘Let us help,’ she pleaded, stroking Barbara’s thin hand, ‘after all, we’re much better off than you are. Aren’t you two like ourselves? Then why mayn’t we help?’\nBarbara slowly shook her head: ‘I’m all right—please don’t talk about money to Jamie.’\nBut Mary could see that she was far from all tight; the warm weather was proving of little avail, even care and good food and sunshine and rest seemed unable to ease that incessant coughing.\n‘You ought to see a specialist at once,’ she told Barbara rather sharply one morning.\nBut Barbara shook her head yet again: ‘Don’t, Mary—don’t please…you’ll be frightening Jamie.’",

    "target_paragraph": "We were still out of sight of the Shyok, amidst level orchards of apple and apricot trees standing in a foot of snow. The track was now unmistakable but it remained treacherous until we left the broad valley floor. Although it was noon the sun had not yet appeared and snow could be seen falling over the Khardung La, while an icy wind blew against us. It reached gale-force, and stung our faces with fine sand, as we began to climb on a rough, steep path that soon levelled out to take us through an arid expanse of dark, tumbled, shattered rocks, some bigger than a barn. Under a bleak grey sky this landscape showed the Himalayas at their most grim. When we met a small herd of goats and three laden ponies the two youths accompanying them almost fell into the bottle-green Shyok, so astonished were they to see us. Then we turned the flank of this mountain and were suddenly out of the wind, directly below the Khardung La. Half a mile of level, firm sand came next – our most comfortable walk for weeks – and here we met a black woolly pony, hardly bigger than a Shetland, carrying a long-legged mullah wearing a black turban. Without halting the mullah shouted a warning of rockfalls ahead, where our path climbed to wind around a steep shaly mountain overhanging the Shyok. We found the surface strewn with small boulders – the larger ones end up in the river – but Hallam as usual picked his way cleverly between them and Rachel as usual gazed serenely from the saddle at a swirling Shyok 300 feet below. Meanwhile the sky was clearing rapidly and by the time we had again descended to river level the sun was shining. Another mile, across a semi-desert of grey sand, grey thyme and grey rocks, took us on to the base of an immense brown mountain. Then we came to a small, shadowed village enclosed on three sides by colossal rocky ramparts. When I asked for the path to Kuru the astounded inhabitants pointed silently to a 12,000 foot summit. At first I thought this must be their little joke. But, as Rachel remarked, ‘To get out of here you have to go over some mountain and that’s the lowest.’",

I introduced myself to him by a small present of United States currency.\nHe said, \"Señor, you may travel freely over the Republic henceforth without payment. Juan Algomero is at your orders.\" An officer smartly uniformed, with a sword at his side, was at the rear of the car. He was bound for the front, he said, to lay down his life for his country. His only baggage consisted of four wooden bird-cages full of meadowlarks.\nFarther to the rear two men sat across the aisle from each other, each with a white sack containing something that moved and clucked. As soon as the train started these bags were opened to disgorge two large roosters, who wandered up and down the aisles eating crumbs and cigarette butts. The two owners immediately raised their voices.\n\"Cock-fight, señores! Five pesos on this valiant and handsome rooster.\nFive pesos, señores!\" The males at once deserted their seats and rushed clamoring toward the center of the car. Not one of them appeared to lack the necessary five dollars. In ten minutes the two promoters were kneeling in the middle of the aisle, throwing their birds. And, as we rattled along, swaying from side to side, swooping down into the gullies and laboring up the other bank, a whirling mass of feathers and flashing steel rolled up and down the aisle. That over, a one-legged youth stood up and played \"Whistling Rufus\" on a tin flute. Someone had a leather bottle of tequila, of which we all took a swig. From the rear of the car came shouts of \"Vamonos a bailar! Come on and dance!\" And in a moment five couples, all men, of course, were madly two-stepping. A blind old peasant was assisted to climb upon his seat, where he quaveringly recited a long ballad about the heroic exploits of the great\nGeneral Maclovio Herrera. Everybody was silently attentive and showered pennies into the old man’s sombrero. Occasionally there floated back to us the singing of the soldiers on the box-cars in front and the sound of their shots as they caught sight of a coyote galloping through the mesquite. Then everybody in our car would make a rush for the windows, pulling at their revolvers, and shoot fast and furiously.",

When I drew near, I pulled in, reversing self-consciously to park among the undergrowth at the edge of the trees, and walked quickly and directly into the woods. Within a few moments I came up against a military-style enclosure: a fence of wire mesh of perhaps eight feet in height, further buffered by a concertina of razor wire around the base. It was difficult even to get close enough to press my face to the fence. A laminated letter, nailed to the trunk of a nearby tree, stated that l’accès a l’intérieur de la zone was interdit.

Armando wrapped up just before 5:30 P.M., giving the floor to the mayor, who assured the group that she had plans to restore the Casa de las Cadenas and other important sites. Armando managed to conceal his skepticism. He joined Mari at the rear of La Parroquia just minutes before the new bishop of Havana, Juan de la Caridad García Rodríguez, ended the holy day mass. From the pulpit, a priest then asked the people, “Should we take her out or keep her in?” The rain had lightened considerably, but the skies were still threatening, and the streets were soaked. A procession around the interior seemed prudent, but the overwhelming response was “Go out!” The 338-year-old statue, dressed in fine clothes and a wig of human hair, metal rays of grace emanating from her back, was rolled along on a large cart and lowered down the church’s main stairs. Mari and Armando had rushed out to be in the park when the statue emerged.",

It was unanimously agreed in New York that “young people should be given the time to get to know each other;” and though the greater number of the couples constituting New York society had played together as children, and been born of parents as long and as familiarly acquainted, yet some mysterious law of decorum required that the newly affianced should always be regarded as being also newly acquainted. In the Southern States things were differently conducted: headlong engagements, even runaway marriages, were not uncommon in the annals of Virginia and Maryland; but such rashness was less consonant with the sluggish blood of New York, where the pace of life was still set with a Dutch deliberateness.",

The one feat alone – that of dying – by which a mean condition could be resolved into a grand one, Fanny had achieved. And to that had destiny subjoined this rencounter to-night, which had, in Bathsheba’s wild imagining, turned her companion’s failure to success, her humiliation to triumph, her lucklessness to ascendancy; it had thrown over herself a garish light of mockery, and set upon all things about her an ironical smile.

Then smoothly brushing the walls, they passed on musingly as if asking the red and yellow roses on the wallpaper whether they would fade, and questioning (gently, for there was time at their disposal) the torn letters in the wastepaper basket, the flowers, the books, all of which were now open to them and asking, Were they allies? Were they enemies? How long would they endure?",

For what could only have been eight seconds, but felt like an hour, my mind quietened. As soon as I realised, I gave myself a mental pat on the back and then sulked for breaking the stillness.

There can be no report on today’s scenery because I was past observing it as I slogged along with my very lungs being blistered by the hot air. I only know that there were few trees and little greenery, a lack which always accentuates the heat. On every side stretched bare stubble fields and arid wastes of rock and stony soil – if you never hear from me again you’ll know that I was thinking of you all as I lay expiring by the wayside! The very pleasant family I’m with tonight are friends of my Abbottabad host, as were the people I stopped with for the afternoon from 1 to 5.30.

He was extraordinarily intelligent and agreeable, and her heart beat faster when he was with her. He had a tall fair easy presence and a mind in which the lights of irony played pleasantly through the shades of feeling. She liked to hear his voice almost as much as to listen to what he was saying, and to listen to what he was saying almost as much as to feel that he was looking at her; but he wanted to kiss her, and she wanted to talk to him about books and pictures, and have him insinuate the eternal theme of their love into every subject they discussed.",

This new and captivating world seemed brilliant and rather wicked; I enjoyed being the youngest present, especially during the dissipated nocturnal ramblings in which every evening finished: (‘Where’s that rather noisy boy got to? We may as well take him too’). I had reached a stage when one changes very fast: a single year contains a hundred avatars; and while these were flashing kaleidoscopically by, the idea of my unsuitability for peace-time soldiering had begun to impinge. More serious still, the acceptance of two poems and the publication of one of them – admittedly, only on foxhunting – had fired me with the idea of authorship.",

The crudity of the construction followed from the scarcity of wood, not lack of skill. The cracks between the unhewn logs were chinked with adobe; a few fragments still remain. The walls have a morbid greenish hue that matches the coloration of the nearby hills; this is dust from the Morrison formation, a loose friable shale containing copper oxides, agate, chert, and traces of vanadium and uranium. There is a doorway but no door, a single window and no glass. The floor consists of warped, odd-size planks. In one corner is a manger for horses, an addition made long after the death of Mr. Turnbow. Cobwebs complete with black widow spiders adorn the darker corners under the ceiling. In the center of the room is a massive post of juniper shoring up the ancient, sagging roof, which is a thatchwork affair of poles, mud and rock, very leaky. As shelter, the cabin cannot be recommended, except for its shade on a hot day.",

She had been cleaning knives in her little scullery, and when she had let him in she went back again, and turned on the cold-water tap to its fullest volume, and then turned it off again. ‘Now,’ she thought to herself, as she screwed it tight, ‘I’m not going to let these silly ideas come into my head … Don’t you think Mr Asquith* deserves to be hanged?’ she called back into the sitting-room, and when she joined him, drying her hands, she began to tell him about the latest evasion on the part of the Government with respect to the Women’s Suffrage Bill. Ralph did not want to talk about politics, but he could not help respecting Mary for taking such an interest in public questions. He looked at her as she leant forward, poking the fire, and expressing herself very clearly in phrases which bore distantly the taint of the platform, and he thought, ‘How absurd Mary would think me if she knew that I almost made up my mind to walk all the way to Chelsea in order to look at Katharine’s windows. She wouldn’t understand it, but I like her very much as she is.’",

The air in the carriage was warm and still and before long I fell into a doze myself, but was startled awake after a few minutes by a baleful wailing. A gypsy woman, overweight and in a headscarf, was passing along the carriage with a filthy baby, loudly orating the tale of her troubled life and asking for money, but no one gave her any. She pushed the baby in my face ? he was covered in chocolaty drool and so startlingly ugly that it was all I could do to keep from going ‘Aiieee!’ and throwing my hands in front of my face ? and I gave her a thousand lire as fast as I could drag it out of my pocket before Junior loosed a string of gooey brown dribble onto me.

I noticed that the wind from the day before had begun the seasonal stripping of leaves, which made it easier to see the source of the noise I’d become so accustomed to: a lanky black bear perched on limbs that seemed inadequate to support its weight. The bear swayed gently with the crown of the tree, completely unaffected by the movement. It yanked the remaining leaves off of the branches and stuffed them in its mouth, along with whatever else Ursus eat while roosting in treetops.",

From the fringe of palms along the coast to the damp hills north of Waimea, a distance of ten miles, there is not a tree or stream, though the scorched earth is deeply scored by the rush of fierce temporary torrents, Hitherto, I have only travelled over the green coast which faces the trade winds, where clouds gather and shed their rains, and this desert, which occupies a great part of leeward Hawaii, displeases me. It lies burning in the fierce splendours of a zone, which, until now, I had forgotten was the torrid zone, unwatered and unfruitful, red and desolate under the sun. The island is here only twenty-two miles wide, and strong winds sweep across it, whirling up its surface in great brown clouds, so that the uplands in part appear a smoking plain, backed by naked volcanic cones. No water, no grass, no ferns. Some thornless thistles, a little brush of sapless-looking indigo, and some species of compositæ struggle for a doleful existence. There is nothing tropical about it but the intense heat. The red soil becomes suffused with a green tinge ten miles from the beach, and at the summit of the ascent the desert blends with this beautiful Waimea plain, one of the most marked features of Hawaii. The air became damp and cool; miles of fine, smooth, green grass stretched out before us; high hills, broken, pinnacled, wooded, and cleft with deep ravines, rose on our left; we heard the dash and music of falling water: to the north it was like the Munster Thai, to the south altogether volcanic. The tropics had vanished. There were frame houses sheltered from the winds by artificial screens of mulberry trees, and from the incursions of cattle by rough walls of lava stones five feet high; a mission and court house, a native church, much too large for the shrunken population, and other indications of an inhabited region. Except for the woods which clothe the hills, the characteristic of the scenery is baldness.",

It is only honest to admit that the affair didn't amount to much; indeed, nobody among my relatives remembers it, except my sister Rose, today a psychiatric social worker, who claims she does. She says I ran away because I was disturbed, and she adds that we were all disturbed at the time, and that the move to Chicago was bad for us. She speaks, of course, as a social worker, but when she talks like that I'm visited by the ghost of an old resentment. \"There they go again,\" I say to myself, \"crowding in on the act.\" But the annoyance really is only a ghost. It is nothing like the frustration and rage I felt back in 1920 at the slightest hint that any one of the rest of the family was as miserable as I was. Mother once tried to tell me that she was unhappy, too, but I only walked off, shaking my head. The misery was mine and mine alone. I was fifteen, and entitled to undisputed possession. Had I not been forced to leave St. Louis against my will? Wasn't I always being pushed around? No one but me had my sensitivity; no one but me knew how to suffer; the others were clods. It was clear that I had to run away.",

The sitting-room window on the ground floor, where she usually throned, was tenanted by the inadequate figure of her daughter, Mrs. Welland, who signed a haggard welcome as she caught sight of Archer; and at the door he was met by May. The hall wore the unnatural appearance peculiar to well-kept houses suddenly invaded by illness: wraps and furs lay in heaps on the chairs, a doctor's bag and overcoat were on the table, and beside them letters and cards had already piled up unheeded.",

Their haloes were dripping with icicles; snow had filled the clefts of their mitres and furred the curls of their pastoral staves. I could hear the sigh of the river just below. When I leant over the balustrade, it rose to a roar. Under the bare chestnut branches, the current was rushing by, flurrying the reflections which the lights on the other bank dropped into the flood. Beyond King Richard’s castle the forested uplands of the north bank suddenly broke off. A precipice dropped sheer and at its foot, meadows and orchards followed the river upstream in a three-mile-long question-mark. Halfway, dissolving in the blue of the dusk, an island hovered over its own flawed image.",
