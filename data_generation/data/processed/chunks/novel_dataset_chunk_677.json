Six-four, slim, wide-shouldered, with an unkempt brown beard and hair that fell halfway down his back, he was boisterous and imposing, with a big laugh that fell somewhere between a honk and a roar. For someone so tall, he was remarkably unselfconscious. He carried himself like a ballet dancer. Before he paddled out, he ritually performed a series of yoga stretches at the water’s edge. With people he liked, he was endlessly garrulous. There was always something going on with the waves, the wind, the sandbars, the lineup markers at Santiago that required detailed, spirited comment. Everybody knew when Mark was in the water. “Don’t you know the law of the surf movie?” he yelled to me, one morning, in mediocre waves.",

One had a kitchen two people could not pass in, but there was a slice of a view of the Arno. Another kitchen had no hot water and no knives, but the house was built into medieval ramparts overlooking vineyards. One had several sets of china for forty, countless glasses and silverware, but the refrigerator iced over every day and by four the door swung open, revealing a new igloo. When the weather was damp, I got a tingling shock if I touched anything in the kitchen. On the property, Cimabue, legend says, discovered the young Giotto drawing a sheep in the dirt. One house had beds with back-crunching dips in the middles. Bats flew down the chimney and buzzed us, while worms in the beams sent down a steady sifting of sawdust onto the pillows. The fireplace was so big we could sit in it while grilling our veal chops and peppers.",

Omsk presented the usual row on row of crumbling high-rise apartment buildings, tall roadside weeds, smoky traffic, and blowing dust. For a moment we passed an oasis scene—a crowded beach beside the Irtysh River, kids running into the water and splashing—before the city’s grittiness resumed. Solzhenitsyn wrote that he spent time in an ancient prison in Omsk that had once held Dostoyevsky, and that the prison’s ten-foot-thick stone walls and vaulted ceilings resembled a dungeon in a movie. I had wanted to explore Omsk looking for this prison but forgot that idea entirely in our collective eagerness to get out of Omsk. We stopped just to buy groceries, then sped on.",

I can see them still, the two boys, their grave demeanour belied by mobile lips and mischievous fair curls of Northern ancestry; the other, leaning forward intent upon the music, and caressing his moustache with bent fingers upon which glittered a jewel set in massive gold—some scarab or intaglio, the spoil of old Magna Graecia. His conversation, during the intervals, moved among the accepted formulas of cosmopolitanism with easy flow, quickened at times by the individual emphasis of a man who can forsake conventional tracks and think for himself. Among other things, he had contrived an original project for reviving the lemon industry of his country, which, though it involved a few tariff modifications—“a mere detail”—struck me as amazingly effective and ingenious. The local deputy, it seems, shared my view, for he had undertaken to bring it before the notice of Parliament.\nWhat was it?\nI have forgotten!\nSo we discussed the world, while the music played under the starlit southern night.\nIt must have been midnight ere a final frenzied galop on the part of the indefatigable band announced the close of the entertainment. I walked a few paces beside the lame “proprietor” who, supported on the arms of his nephews, made his way to the spot where the cabs were waiting—his rheumatism, he explained, obliging him to drive. How he had enjoyed walking as a youth, and what pleasure it would now have given him to protract, during a promenade to my hotel, our delightful conversation! But infirmities teach us to curtail our pleasures, and many things that seem natural to man’s bodily configuration are found to be unattainable. He seldom left his rooms; the stairs—the diabolical stairs! Would I at least accept his card and rest assured how gladly he would receive me and do all in his power to make my stay agreeable?\nThat card has gone the way of numberless others which the traveller in Southern Europe gathers about him. I have also forgotten the old man’s name. But the _palazzo_ in which he lived bore a certain historical title which happened to be very familiar to me. I remember wondering how it came to reach Messina.\nIn the olden days, of course, the days of splendour.\nWill they ever return?\nIt struck me that the sufferings of the survivors would be alleviated if all the sheds in which they are living could be painted white or pearl-grey in order to protect them, as far as possible, from the burning rays of the sun. I mentioned the idea to an overseer.",

The moon had set. It was densely dark, and it was raining on one side of the road, though quite fine on the other. By the lamplight which streamed from our early breakfast table, I only saw wet mules and horses, laden with gear for a mountain ascent, a trim little Japanese, who darted about helping, my native, who was picturesquely dressed in a Mexican poncho. Mr. Alexander, who wore something which made him unrecognisable; and myself, a tatterdemalion figure, wearing a much-worn green topcoat of his over my riding suit, and a tartan shawl arranged so as to fall nearly to my feet. Then we went forth into the darkness. The road soon degenerated into a wood road, then into a bridle track, then into a mere trail ascending all the way; and at dawn, when the rain was over, we found ourselves more than half-way up the mountain, amidst rocks, scoriæ, tussocks, ohelos, a few common compositæ, and a few coarse ferns and woody plants, which became coarser and scantier the higher we went up, but never wholly ceased; for, at the very summit, 10,200 feet high, there are some tufts of grass, and stunted specimens of a common asplenium in clefts. Many people suffer from mountain sickness on this ascent, but I suffered from nothing but the excruciating cold, which be-numbed my limbs and penetrated to my bones; and though I dismounted several times and tried to walk, uphill exercise was impossible in the rarefied air. The atmosphere was but one degree below the freezing-point, but at that height, a brisk breeze on soaked clothes was scarcely bearable.",

After the last shovel loads and before driving back to the shop, we took a break. I was always eager to avoid tourists, but it’s hard to hide in tundra. We slunk into a depression twenty feet off the trail and I turned my back on it. Jerry is decidedly friendlier than me; he faced outward, leaning on his pack. Moments after we sat down and popped open Tupperwares for cold leftovers, I heard a voice. I chewed and rolled my eyes at Jerry. They always found us.",

But here she was, having survived the crushing of the Karluk, the freezing months on the ice at Shipwreck Camp, the journey through the pressure ridges, the six long months on Wrangel Island.

Since they were used to moving in herds, as soon as one of us yelled ‘Chu! Chu!’, all the horses would start trotting and soon break into a gallop, flying across the steppe. The herders would howl with laughter as some of us clung on for dear life.",

If I were in a better mood, I might have thought it were quite pleasant. A fine way to travel, yes, yes indeed. Fifteen minutes later, the bus rolled to a stop on a busy corner tucked neatly between the sea and a busy, public square.",

And all during the banking day (it was summer now, and school was out) Snopes never knew when he would look over his shoulder and find the boy lounging without the plate glass window of the bank, watching him with profound and static patience. Presently he would take himself away, and for a short time Snopes would be able to forget him until, wrapped in his mad unsleeping dream, he mounted the boarding house veranda at supper time and found the boy sitting there and waiting patiently his return; innocent and bland, steadfast and unassertive as a minor but chronic disease. “Got another business letter to write tonight, Mr Snopes?”",

They went berserk. Kwe! Kwe kwe kwe kwe kwe! Kwe! The whole troop had now moved away a few trees, but still watched the predator I held in my hand. I tossed it from side to side, and the pitch of their calls went up an octave. I was amazed at their gullibility, but I took great pleasure in it and derived even more at their reaction when I threw the toy in the air. The whole troop called Kwe! in unison; one even fell off his branch. Then they fled, yelling a chorus of Kwekwekwekwe! as they went, and I imagined they were saying, “Holy crap! Did you see that? A flying leopard!”",

Through the evening air came the sound of a big church bell, rung by one of the Capucin monks who lived on an island in the nearby lake of Bolsena. Only a few weeks earlier, while crossing the Alps into Italy, Evelyn had been repelled by the ‘strange, horrid and fearful’ appearance of the mountains. In his diary entries for those days he had railed against the Alpine peaks, rehearsing the conventional seventeenth-century objections to mountains: that their steepness prevents the free range of the eye; that they are ‘desarts’ – barren of life and of no use to anyone.",

Why, thought Mr Ramsay, should she look at the sea when I am here? She hoped it would be calm enough for them to land at the Lighthouse, she said. The Lighthouse! The Lighthouse!

Instantly, with the force of some primeval gust (for really he could not restrain himself any longer), there issued from him such a groan that any other woman in the whole world would have done something, said something—all except myself, thought Lily, girding at herself bitterly, who am not a woman, but a peevish, ill-tempered, dried-up old maid presumably.",

    "target_paragraph": "CHAPTER IV\nThe sun lay heavy on Iseo; and the railway journey thence to Brescia left in our brains a golden dazzle of heat. It was refreshing, on reaching Brescia, to enter the streets of the old town, where the roofs almost meet and there is always a blessed strip of shade to walk in. The cities in Italy are much cooler than the country. It is in August that one understands the wisdom of the old builders, who made the streets so narrow, and built dim draughty arcades around the open squares. In Brescia the effects of light and shade thus produced were almost Oriental in their sharp-edged intensity; the rough stucco surfaces gilded with vivid sunlight bringing out the depths of contrasting shade, and the women with black veils over their heads slipping along under the mysterious balconies and porticoes like flitting fragments of the shadow.\nChiesa dei Miracoli—Brescia\nBrescia is at all times a delightful place to linger in. Its chief possessions—the bronze Victory, and that room in the Martinengo palace where Moretto, in his happiest mood, depicted the ladies of the line under arches of trellis-work backed by views of the family villas—make it noteworthy even among Italian cities; and it has, besides, its beautiful town-hall, its picture-gallery, and the curious court-yards painted in perspective that are so characteristic of the place. But in summer there is a strong temptation to sit and think of these things rather than to go and see them. In the court-yard of the hotel, where a fountain tinkles refreshingly, and the unbleached awnings flap in the breeze of the electric fans, it is pleasant to feel that the Victory and the pictures are close at hand, like old friends waiting on one’s inclination; but if one ventures forth, let it be rather to the churches than to the galleries. Only at this season can one appreciate the atmosphere of the churches: that chill which cuts the sunshine like a knife as one steps across the dusky threshold. When we entered the cathedral its vast aisles were empty, but far off, in the dimness of the pillared choir, we heard a drone of intoning canons that freshened the air like the sound of a water-fall in a forest. Thence we wandered on to San Francesco, empty too, where, in the sun-spangled dimness, the great Romanino throned behind the high altar. The sacristan drew back the curtain before the picture, and as it was revealed to us in all its sun-bathed glory he exclaimed with sudden wonder, as though he had never seen it before: “È stupendo! È stupendo!” Perhaps he vaguely felt, as we did, that Romanino, to be appreciated, must be seen in just that light, a projection of the suave and radiant atmosphere in which his own creations move. Certainly no Romanino of the great public galleries arrests the imagination like the Madonna of San Francesco; and in its presence one thinks with a pang of all the beautiful objects uprooted from their native soil to adorn the herbarium of the art-collector....",

    "target_paragraph": "My left hand grips the wooden tiller which my left arm has been pulling and pushing for hours now. We are around the Cape and I am trying to get us closer to shore. The wind is coming out of the northwest, and the waves should be smaller closer to shore, as the fetch will be less. But the mainland is 30 miles away and it will take hours to get close enough to make a difference.\nI steer by feel, pushing and pulling on the tiller as we rise and fall through the seas. I try to determine if the seas are decreasing and we make progress west, but there is no change. The conditions are simply black, rough, cold, and windy. The muscles in my torso constantly flex and relax, flex and relax, reacting to the constant motion of the ship. My head bobs, my eyes narrow, my thoughts fade.\nMy left arm works like a robot, and occasionally my right arm lends support, two hands on the tiller. I stare into the blackness ahead, illuminated green by the starboard bow-light. But then the green disappears; the light has gone out. Only the red light on the port bow remains. Darkness gains ground. The familiar green glow reflecting off the water to the right of the bow is now gone, like a friend who moves away, like a dog you must bury. The light had given me a small bit of confidence and reassurance that all was well. Now it is gone, and with it a bit of my peace-of-mind. The masthead tricolor light is out too and has been since Miami. I think the storm must have damaged it. The failing lights remind me that at any time any part of the boat could fail without warning.\nWe carry on with a red light on the port bow and a white light on the stern. Any vessel approaching from starboard would see nothing. But there is nothing that I can do about it now. There is nothing to do but steer.\nMy face and hands feel that the air is getting colder, but the rest of me is warm and dry inside my foul-weather gear. My eyes see less and less as the night gets darker and darker. Fear tries to gain ground, and I try to rise to the challenge. I’ve never been in a position like this, in a small sailboat by myself in the ocean with the wind blowing counter to the Gulf Stream. I am being tested. I must have faith in both myself and Sobrius. I must have faith in Sobrius’ ability to remain afloat, that the mast will stay put, that the tiller will continue to steer, that the hull will continue to resist the impact of the waves, that we will not collide with some unseen object in the water and sink. I must have faith in my ability to control the boat, to stay aboard, and to navigate us home. If all else fails, I can paddle my surfboard to shore, whatever the distance. I could even swim it if I had to. My ocean-swimming mantra is “How far can I swim? As far as I need to.”\nConscious thought must overcome fear. I can do this and Sobrius will continue to sail. She has been across the Atlantic three times (or so I was told by the seller) and this is nothing to her. She’s been floating since 1972, and will continue to float. It’s just that I am unaccustomed to conditions like these, and there is only myself aboard to sail, navigate, change sails, make decisions.\nConscious thought gets more difficult with the fatigue that comes from sailing for two days straight. I must think slowly, and I must analyze my decisions carefully. Disaster comes from mistakes, and mistakes come from fatigue. The fatigued person can avoid mistakes by thinking more slowly, more carefully, and with more analysis. I only need to sit here in the cockpit and steer, and I need to be clipped in both to the big stainless-steel padeye on the cockpit floor and one of the two bolted to the cabin bulkhead. Nothing bad can come from sitting and steering, doubly clipped in.\nSobrius continues to charge through the waves on a close reach, moving up, down, left, right, but always forward. She feels like an animal underneath me, like a horse running across a field of undulating terrain. Sailing in the dark like this feels like running through a forest at night, bumping into branches and stepping on unknown things, some hard, some squishy, but running without pause like a dog chasing a rabbit. There is no stopping, no short-cut home, no off-switch, and no easy-button. There is only wind, water, sailboat and me. We can stop when we get home, but not before, and home is still over a day away.\nIn the black night and the relentless seas, my little boat charges on, unafraid, doing what she was made to do, while I steer her, less confident than she. It is she who takes me for a ride tonight.\nBut my eyes are getting heavier.",

Delia, getting into the second carriage with Milly and Edward, noticed that the houses opposite had their blinds drawn in sympathy, but a servant peeped. The others, she noticed, did not seem to see her; they were thinking of their mother. When they got into the main road the pace quickened, for the drive to the cemetery was a long one. Through the slit of the blind, Delia noticed dogs playing; a beggar singing; men raising their hats as the hearse passed them. But by the time their own carriage passed, the hats were on again. Men walked briskly and unconcernedly along the pavement. The shops were already gay with spring clothing; women paused and looked in at the windows. But they would have to wear nothing but black all the summer, Delia thought, looking at Edward’s coal-black trousers.",

Mr. Talliaferro envied that chair with a surge of fire like an adolescent’s in his dry bones; and while he stood regarding the sprawled awkwardness of Jenny’s sweet thighs and legs and one little soiled hand dangling across her hip, that surge of imminence and fire and desolation seemed to lightly distend all his organs, leaving a thin salty taste on his tongue.
