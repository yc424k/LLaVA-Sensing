That January, a rotating depression in the North Sea coincided with a northerly wind and a high spring tide. The wind drove the depression south, from the expanses of the North Sea towards the Channel, where the land narrowed the sea down, which caused the tide to surge even higher.",

When the sun comes out, the air clears as if it has been pressure-washed and the whole place glistens like it was just made. Rotting rubber boots and pruned fingers are small penance in exchange for those first rays after weeks of gray. You forget the vocabulary of wet, turned suddenly to a language you learned while traveling for a brief time in a foreign place: where was that again, how did you say hello?",

Again Flush went with her. For the first time he heard his nails click upon the hard paving-stones of London. For the first time the whole battery of a London street on a hot summer’s day assaulted his nostrils. He smelt the swooning smells that lie in the gutters; the bitter smells that corrode iron railings; the fuming, heady smells that rise from basements – smells more complex, corrupt, violently contrasted and compounded than any he had smelt in the fields near Reading; smells that lay far beyond the range of the human nose; so that while the chair went on, he stopped, amazed; defining, savouring, until a jerk at his collar dragged him on. And also, as he trotted up Wimpole Street behind Miss Barrett’s chair he was dazed by the passage of human bodies. Petticoats swished at his head; trousers brushed his flanks; sometimes a wheel whizzed an inch from his nose; the wind of destruction roared in his ears and fanned the feathers of his paws as a van passed. Then he plunged in terror. Mercifully the chain tugged at his collar; Miss Barrett held him tight, or he would have rushed to destruction.",

While he delivered his pitch, I recalled the swanky gift shop from the night before. I remembered how I felt there, dressed like a hobo and surrounded by goods I could never afford. Then I thought about our trip in general, and how much we spent on hotels with buffet breakfasts and crisp white sheets and welcome cups of karkadé. And I thought about our tours and museum tickets and private taxis. And I thought about the hantour drivers in Luxor, and the tissue sellers in Cairo, and the dogs in Abu Simbel, and the cats in Alexandria. And I thought about the gentleman merchant standing there with me on the plateau by the pyramids, his saddlebag filled with baubles that I could afford but would never want.

I hesitated at the platform’s edge, then jumped out into the drift—it came up over my waist and made my eyes fly open where it slipped under my clothes and found bare skin—and pushed through it into the clearing, where it was slightly (but only slightly) shallower. Even in sheltered areas, under an umbrella of conifers, the snow was nearly knee deep and tedious to churn through. But everywhere it was stunning. Every tree wore a thick cloak of white, every stump and boulder a jaunty snowy cap, and there was that perfect, immense stillness that you get nowhere else but in a big woods after a heavy snowfall. Here and there clumps of snow fell from the branches, but otherwise there was no sound or movement. I followed the side trail up and under heavily bowed limbs to where it rejoined the AT. The AT was a plumped blanket of snow, round and bluish, in a long, dim tunnel of overbent rhododendrons. It looked deep and hard going. I walked a few yards as a test. It was deep and hard going.",

The wild animals fled from the burning forest, and the elephants and rhinoceroses and other animals were crushed by the falling trees and fell into the sea. All the fish and other marine creatures were crushed by the weight of the mountain and died as the sea bubbled and boiled from the churning and from the poison that issued from Basuki's mouth. Saps and resins oozed from the burning trees of the forests and ran into the sea, as did the plants and flowers that had grown on the sides of the mountain. The birds that once lived on the mountain slopes were killed and fell into the sea. Great gusts of wind shook the air as the mountain was spun.",

Five years after the movie was shot, a U.S. Air Force plane really did crash in Tibet. One of the only foreigners the book imagines as stealing into Shangri-La is, as it happens, an Austrian soldier who keeps the lonely holy man company. Even the details in the film that seem most purely (impurely) Hollywood—flocks of children, surrounded by deer, singing Brahms’s “Lullaby”—aren’t entirely absurd when you remember that pipers in Tibet in the old days played “It’s a Long Way to Tipperary,” and four Tibetan boys, early in the last century, were sent to be educated at Rugby, in England.",

    "target_paragraph": "We passed that way once in March. The Italian spring, which is not so different from the spring in other countries, was inclement that year and icy. In Florence the sun shone fitfully between huge clouds. Snow still lay in patches on Monte Morello. The breeze was nipping. “Are the passes free of snow?” we asked at the garage where we stopped to fill our petrol tank. Animated by that typically Italian desire to give an answer that will please the questioner, the garage man assured us that the road was perfectly clear. And he said it with such conviction that we imagined, as northerners would naturally imagine, that he knew. Nothing is more charming than southern courtesy, southern sympathy and the southern desire to please. The heart is touched by the kindly interest which the Italians take in your affairs; you love them for their courteous inquisitiveness; they make you at home immediately, treat you at once as a human being and do their best to please you. It is delightful. But sometimes they are really too sympathetic by half. For in order not to contradict you or give you a moment’s pain by disputing the accuracy of your ideas, they will tell you what you want to hear rather than what it would be of real use to you to hear. At the same time their own self-esteem will not permit them to confess a blank ignorance; so that they will rather tell you something incorrect than tell you nothing at all. Thus, when the garage man told us that there was no snow on the road from Florence to Bologna, he said so first, because he saw that we wanted to go to Bologna and that we should have been disappointed if it had been impossible and, second, because it was pleasanter for him to say “No snow” with conviction than confess (which was the truth) that he hadn’t the faintest notion whether there was snow or not.",

On the fateful day, he inquired about taking the oath to Nicholas, then sought refuge in the Austrian embassy. Yakubovich, the implacable assassin, wandered around the square cheering for Konstantin, then said he had a headache and left. Then he came back, dithered some more, and left again. None of the other rebel officers had the rank of Trubetskoy, so no one knew who should take command. A firebrand named Kakhovsky shot and killed the redoubtable governor-general of St. Petersburg, M. A. Miloradovich, when he tried to talk the troops into laying down their arms. Kakhovsky killed another high-ranking officer after that. The standoff in Senate Square lasted for hours, and as the day was waning, one of Nicholas’s generals told him he must clear the square with gunfire or else abdicate. Reluctantly, Nicholas gave the order, and canister shot tore the Decembrists’ troops apart. Soldiers who tried to escape across the frozen Neva were drowned when cannonballs shattered the ice below them. Bodies littered the square. “Voilà un joli commencement du regne!” said Nicholas.",

By the time that I had gotten to the bow the cockpit had disappeared. Wendy was using an accurate digital compass so I knew that she would stay on course. My greatest concern was the force of the wind and current striking hard of starboard. The engine was at full throttle and we were only making two and a half knots. Even at that speed we seemed to be taking much too long to reach the buoy. With visibility at less than five feet, missing the buoy was a real possibility. If we missed the buoy and continued without the 90° course change we would hit the low fixed bridge before we had time to react.",

They couldn’t see the gleam of the lamps; they could hardly hear the step of the horse; the horse had fallen at once to a walk. They agreed that neither of them could be responsible for losing the way; in the circumstances that was impossible. Fortunately the horse would take them somewhere; it had belonged to a local higgler: a man that used the roads buying poultry for re-sale … They agreed that they had no responsibilities; and after that went on for unmeasured hours in silence; the mist growing, but very, very gradually, more luminous … Once or twice, at a rise in the road, they saw again the stars and the moon, but mistily. On the fourth occasion they had emerged into the silver lake; like mermen rising to the surface of a tropical sea …",

She sat musing, pondering (she was in grey that day, Lily thought). Her eyes were bent. She would never lift them. Yes, thought Lily, looking intently, I must have seen her look like that, but not in grey; nor so still, nor so young, nor so peaceful. The figure came readily enough. She was astonishingly beautiful, William said. But beauty was not everything. Beauty had this penalty—it came too readily, came too completely. It stilled life—froze it. One forgot the little agitations; the flush, the pallor, some queer distortion, some light or shadow, which made the face unrecognizable for a moment and yet added a quality one saw for ever after. It was simpler to smooth that all out under the cover of beauty. But what was the look she had, Lily wondered, when she clapped her deer-stalker’s hat on her head, or ran across the grass, or scolded Kennedy, the gardener? Who could tell her? Who could help her?",

We were profane, smothering our laughter at the surely sexual fervor and the contorted postures. Later we’d sit in the car, Jeff smoking, and watch them file out of the peeling church, looking as normal as anyone. In Naples, the phial of San Gennaro’s congealed blood liquifies once a year. There’s also a crucifix that used to grow one long hair of Jesus that would have to be barbered once a year. That one seems particularly close to Southern sensibilities.",

As we travelled, I sat in silence on my sleigh next to one of the Nenets men, with whom I could only communicate using gestures and reflected on this unique life experience. As of today, just a handful of people had ever experienced travelling in this way with Nenets. We were in fact the largest group they had ever hosted and certainly the first all-female team to journey with them during a migration. The privilege was enormous and I felt grateful to witness this ancient migratory tradition.",

I tagged along to the meeting with Srini Satya, a smart guy in his late twenties who worked full-time and volunteered the rest of his waking hours to QAM. He was one of those gung-ho volunteers who made himself heard at meetings, winning people over by virtue of an easy confidence that came from being slightly too handsome for his own good.",

In the left-hand corner of the room was a lavatory; Luke pushed down the flush-lever. “It works!” he said, delighted. And then, looking round, “Christ!” he said. And we stared at a huge, inward bulge on the outward-slanting plates of the bow. “Big style!” said Luke. “Sean told me that Charlie Simpson, the second skipper, had had a ding. He hit something.

The susceptible maiden who, when she hears “Ach, du lieber Augustin,” feels no emotions beyond a general sense of high spirits and cheerfulness, is fairly made to palpitate by the luscious strains of the modern waltz. Her soul is carried swooning along, over waves of syrup; she seems to breathe an atmosphere heavy with ambergris and musk. From the jolly little thing it was at its birth, the waltz has grown into the voluptuous, heart-stirring affair with which we are now familiar.",
