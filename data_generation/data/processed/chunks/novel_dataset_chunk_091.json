Its main street is lined with handsome buildings in a modestly exuberant Victorian style. Seeking refreshment, Trevor and I ventured into one of the many imposing hotels—and I should just note that in an Australian context “hotel” can signify many things: a hotel, a pub, a hotel and pub—that stand on nearly every corner. This one was called Mario’s Palace Hotel, and it was very grand from without—it covered half a block and had a large wraparound balcony employing a lot of intricate ironwork—though inside it had an underlit and musty air. The bar seemed to be open—a TV was playing silently in the corner, the signs were illuminated—but there was no one in attendance and no sounds of anyone nearby. Leading off the bar were several large rooms—a ballroom, a dining room, perhaps another ballroom—all looking as if they had been decorated at considerable expense in 1953 and not used since.",

At 10.15 we parked outside an imitation of a US fast-foodery on the edge of an anonymous town. Here most passengers supped and I sauntered to and fro with an earnest young Australian journalist, tanned and long-limbed and puzzled by Cuba. How come so many habaneros were so jolly and welcoming when they were so deprived? On the bus he’d been scribbling a list – most couldn’t afford essentials like cosmetics, detergents, deodorants, nappies, vitamin supplements, shampoo, hair dryers, toasters, electric kettles, cell phones, computers. He loved Cubans, was upset by all those missing essentials, was keen to promote the tourist industry. At the end of a very hot day I had no energy to spare for argument – beyond asking why, given Caribbean sunshine, Cubans should need hair-dryers? (Come to think of it, why should anybody, apart from the manufacturers? For millennia we’ve been drying our hair without technological assistance.)",

But before long, almost against my wishes, I became champ of the sly off-color remark, a habit so ingrained that I had to stop myself from snorting when a classmate asked for a “hard critique” or snickering at anyone named Dick. Sometimes I’m proud to be shockingly, unexpectedly bawdy. But it’s a dubious honor, the repository for the dirtiest jokes, which, retold at the wrong dinner party, get me cold-shouldered faster than a sloppy drunk. “I can’t believe she said that,” someone will whisper, and I long for the days when this kind of humor was beneath me.

Yet as she lay there, amidst the sort of squalid poverty our affluent society can scarcely imagine, she had an air of indestructible dignity.

Many very interesting sites are on the west side of Lewis, the Callanish Stone Circles being the most well-known. Sadly, the bus schedule will not let me go to these other sites. I take the first bus out of town and get dropped off near the entrance to the Stones. It is overrun with tourists and coach buses. The Visitor Centre is jam packed. I flee out the back door and clamber up towards the site. I hear a dog that barks, and barks, and barks. As I get closer to the top I see the unleashed dog running around the site, as are so many people that I can hardly see the stones. The brochure says that the stones are sinking and out of line because of the heavy tourist traffic. It says, in the same breath, that aren’t we lucky that Historic Scotland has kept the site open (not like other sites they smugly say) for people to wander around.",

There are few traditional Zulu huts; most dwellings are the meanest of shacks. And, significantly, the local children beg. Those children, hopefully running towards the passing white, harrowed me. They are not ‘professionals’, like so many children in Black Africa where mindless expats distribute ‘candies’ as they tour rural areas. Here the feeling is quite different. Small boys and girls looked ashamed while desperately whispering, ‘Give money, one rand, I hunger!’ Beyond dispute they hunger; all the visual evidence is there. And I did give money, contrary to my usual practice. But donations from emotionally upset whites are not the answer to their problem. Perhaps South Africa does need a genuine revolution. Perhaps you can’t make a justice omelette without breaking corporate eggs.",

Gilded chandeliers shed a mellow light on immaculate damask table-linen. The tables stood far apart on a floor of inky blue and carmine marble. The mahogany dining-chairs, rather pompously carved, were upholstered in dark green velvet. Slowly I moved to the centre of the room, passing fluted porphyry pillars. Burgundy and silver tapestry wall-hangings shimmered beneath golden rosettes sprouting from the cornice. Silver candelabras gleamed on square marble corner pillars and on either side of intricately bevelled window embrasures. One expected several archdukes to appear at any moment.",

Nostromo woke up from a fourteen hours’ sleep, and arose full length from his lair in the long grass. He stood knee deep amongst the whispering undulations of the green blades with the lost air of a man just born into the world. Handsome, robust, and supple, he threw back his head, flung his arms open, and stretched himself with a slow twist of the waist and a leisurely growling yawn of white teeth, as natural and free from evil in the moment of waking as a magnificent and unconscious wild beast. Then, in the suddenly steadied glance fixed upon nothing from under a thoughtful frown, appeared the man.",

    "target_paragraph": "“Yes, Sir Ethelred. You know no doubt that most criminals at some time or other feel an irresistible need of confessing—of making a clean breast of it to somebody—to anybody. And they do it often to the police. In that Verloc whom Heat wished so much to screen I’ve found a man in that particular psychological state. The man, figuratively speaking, flung himself on my breast. It was enough on my part to whisper to him who I was and to add ‘I know that you are at the bottom of this affair.’ It must have seemed miraculous to him that we should know already, but he took it all in the stride. The wonderfulness of it never checked him for a moment. There remained for me only to put to him the two questions: Who put you up to it? and Who was the man who did it? He answered the first with remarkable emphasis. As to the second question, I gather that the fellow with the bomb was his brother-in-law—quite a lad—a weak-minded creature. . . . It is rather a curious affair—too long perhaps to state fully just now.”",

Someone grabbed my arm tightly, but I couldn't see who. I reached out for Kirsty's hand and we were led towards hushed voices in the gloom. We rounded a corner and entered a room, lit by a small fire, around which five men were crouched. All barefoot, they wore an incongruous mix of patterned boubou smocks, beach shorts and long sleeved patterned shirts. None of them looked up, as unseen hands pushed us down to the cool of the dirt floor. They remained focused on the task at hand of assembling the tools of their trade – a metal bowl containing a mixture of syrupy liquid and ground plant matter; cowrie shells and coloured beads; figures carved from wood and fashioned from clay; cigarettes and alcohol. A stifled clucking in the shadows signalled the end of a chicken and the introduction of its bleeding heart to the bowl.",

That’s so cute!” It meant spending lunch hours giving a high-level writer ideas for his script that he jotted down word for word, getting more hopeful and proud with each “Great idea!” he gave me, and then being told over the check, “Someday you’re going to make a great producer’s wife.” It meant pitching jokes in a writers’ room and hearing, “Aw, isn’t she pretty?” before being told to pitch it again while doing jumping jacks or, perhaps, sitting on the showrunner’s lap.

She told him how, and he used this in lieu of a knife, he removed one of his shoelaces and cut it in two with the sharp tin. Then she wanted warm water—“If I just had a little hot water,” she said in a weak serene voice without particular hope, only when he thought of matches it was again a good deal like when she had asked him if he had a knife, until she fumbled in the pocket of the shrunken tunic (it had a darker double vee on one cuff and a darker blotch on one shoulder where service stripes and a divisional emblem had been ripped off but this meant nothing to him) and produced a matchbox contrived by telescoping two shotgun shells. So he drew her back a little from the water and went to hunt wood dry enough to burn, thinking this time It’s just another snake only, he said, he should have thought ten thousand other snakes: and now he knew it was not the same deer because he saw three at one time, does or bucks he did not know which since they were all antlerless in May and besides he had never seen one of any kind anywhere before except on a Christmas card; and then the rabbit, drowned, dead anyway, already torn open, the bird, the hawk, standing upon it—the erected crest, the hard vicious patrician nose, the intolerant omnivorous yellow eye—and he kicking at it, kicking it lurching and broadwinged into the actual air.",

And after checking into a modest guesthouse where Vivaldi was pumping out of an enormous ghetto blaster, I had gone out in search of a meal. I ran across a pizzeria, a sushi bar, a steak house, a Swiss restaurant and a slew of stylish Mexican cafés. Eventually, however, I wound up at T.J.’s, a hyper-chic fern bar, where long-legged young blondes in tropical T-shirts were sitting on wicker chairs and sipping tall cocktails.

The road is excruciating but personally I’ve got used to the feeling of being dislocated in every joint at one bump and relocated at the next. However, it’s different for poor Roz and today’s calamity was my fault; I let her go too fast down the pass. This was because of the back brake again giving trouble so that the alternative to cycling too fast was walking, and when you’ve walked up to 10,380 feet you don’t feel much like walking down. At this stage it was 5.15 p.m. and we were some twenty miles from Bamian, near the junction of the Mazar–Bamian road where there is a tiny village called Bulola. I asked about a bus and one was pointed out as going to Bamian ‘in a few minutes’, so Roz was loaded up and I sat in. My other buses were luxurious compared with this one. The floor was covered in sheep and goat droppings and the steering-wheel was held together with sticking-plaster – a device not calculated to soothe one’s nerves on a journey in this terrain. We finally set off at 6.20 p.m., by which time I was frozen stiff – it had been raining hard and there was no glass in the windows, as usual – after sitting patiently watching huge piles of hides being roped together and tied to the roof till the whole rickety contraption looked gruesomely top-heavy. And just before our departure nine men had climbed up and settled down on top of the hides, wrapping themselves in their huge rugs.",

The attacks that targeted it represented not so much the beginning of a new war as a cruelly and ingeniously updated new wrinkle in an old, old war, one going back almost to the beginning of Islam. The recently ended Cold War, in whose ruins Sergei and Volodya and I had been wandering, would have been difficult to explain to ancient ghosts who knew nothing about twentieth-century physics. But the September 11 attacks would have made perfect sense to, say, Saladin: the flying machines, the proud towers, the slaughtered innocents, the suicidal believers, are a simple story that exists out of time. To Yermak and the other Christian conquerors of Siberia’s Muslim khan, September 11 would have been easily understandable, and perhaps a further inducement to victory, had they heard its story while gathered around their smoky Tobol River campfires.",

At any rate, it would cut things pretty fine. I walked along, my thoughts stewing. The road seemed quieter than I had expected, and I thought that it might be because night had fallen, or perhaps the lull was owing to the hotel's position, well away from the commercial streets and above a strip of beach. I saw an informal promenade by the sea, where a few people, some of them Arabs in long robes, were walking, and I made my way down the path and joined them. There was a moon. The beach, the houses in the distance, and the clothes of the walkers all gleamed pure white. Here and there on the water, a shallow arc of foam appeared and disappeared, to appear again a few feet away. Absently I noticed a man walking toward me briskly among the saunterers, his heels beating a rapid rhythm. As he passed me, his little brown eyes glanced at me and lit up with a recognition that puzzled me. He swung around and came back to me. \"Didn't I see you this afternoon at the railway station?\" he asked. He talked with a quick, clipped accent.",
