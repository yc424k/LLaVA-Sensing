    "target_paragraph": "‘Yes,’ Marthe said. Then he was gone. He slacked the horse; its iron feet clashed and sparked on the cobbles; the hot reek sucked after it, pungent for a fading instant, then even the galloping had faded into the sound of the city. ‘Come,’ Marthe said. They went on. At first she seemed to be leading them away from the sound. But presently she seemed to be leading them straight back to it. She turned into an alley, then into another not smaller but emptier, deserted, with an air about it of back premises. But she seemed to know where she was going or at least what she was looking for. She was almost carrying the girl now until the sister moved up unbidden and exchanged the empty basket to the other arm and took half the girl’s weight and then they went quite rapidly, on to the end of the alley and turned the wall and there was what Marthe had gone as directly to as if she had not only known it was there but had been to it before—an empty stone stall, a byre or stable niched into the city’s night-fading flank. There was even a thin litter of dry straw on the stone floor and once inside although the sound was still audible it was as though they had established armistice with the tumult and the fury, not that it should evacuate the city in their favor but at least it should approach no nearer. Marthe didn’t speak, she just stood supporting the girl while the sister set down the empty basket and knelt and with quick deft darting motions like a little girl readying a doll’s house she spread the straw evenly and then removed her shawl and spread it over the straw and still kneeling helped Marthe lower the girl onto the shawl and took the other shawl which Marthe removed from her shoulders and spread it over the girl. Then they lowered themselves onto the straw on either side of the girl and as Marthe drew the girl to her for warmth the sister reached and got the basket and not even triumphant, with another of those clumsy darting childlike motions which at the same time were deft or least efficient or anyway successful, she took from the basket which everyone had seen empty itself when the woman at the fire threw it at her, a piece of broken bread a little larger than two fists. Again Marthe said nothing. She just took the bread from the sister and started to break it.",

She had accepted this submergence as philosophically as all her other trials, and now, in extreme old age, was rewarded by presenting to her mirror an almost unwrinkled expanse of firm pink and white flesh, in the centre of which the traces of a small face survived as if awaiting excavation. A flight of smooth double chins led down to the dizzy depths of a still-snowy bosom veiled in snowy muslins that were held in place by a miniature portrait of the late Mr. Mingott; and around and below, wave after wave of black silk surged away over the edges of a capacious armchair, with two tiny white hands poised like gulls on the surface of the billows.",

Here there are other parts of the body or a body the same size lying around, a foot, a section of forearm; there has been a trunk murder between giants only there are two right hands, the forefingers pointing up, to what?—to something in the lucidity of that sky like a child’s blue eye, theology or the glory of Rome or the memory of the marble murder, never to be recaptured though the fingers point till the next ice age. There is also a not quite typical scavenger’s exhibit around the walls, the soil of Rome being stocked to a great depth with words, bits of architecture and sculptured limbs, tombstones and all the other compost of civilized time, for which there continues to be a brisk black market.",

There is no snow in Delhi—the winters are too dry—but white winds from the snow peaks still sweep down the slopes, freezing the plains of the Punjab and shattering the brittle buds, before raking through the streets of the capital and brushing the narrow Delhi alleyways clear of people. The Delhi-wallahs withdraw into themselves. They lift up their knees to their chins and pull their heavy Kashmiri blankets tightly around. Over their heads they wind thick woollen mufflers. If you look into the dark of the roadside restaurant-shacks you see only the whites of their eyes peering out into the cold.",

    "target_paragraph": "Folding them into my needy fist, he urged me into the waiting car. Inside, another single woman, an African American nurse from Newark, would also be traveling with me. Her name was Qudsia. The driver raced to get us to the King Khalid International on time.\nSoon, we entered the airport grounds. For once I was thankful for the crazy, fast driving in Riyadh as our small car hurtled into the chaos. The terminal was submerged in a biblical scene; no movie set could have been more authentic. Millions were locked in the same force field. We were being magnetically drawn to Mecca. I could feel the gravitational pull of God.\nThe terminal was besieged by pilgrims who were unloading luggage, carrying children, wheeling the disabled, counting money, prostrate in prayer, swirling rosaries; all the while announcing aloud their intentions to make Hajj in the special prayers of the pilgrim. These Labbaik prayers, distinctive to Hajj, echoed in unison, a single powerful voice of the giant pilgrim vortex. I was reminded of my favorite childhood movie, Close Encounters. The unity of voices felt almost supernatural. Even Spielberg couldn't imagine this scene.\nThrowing money at the driver who would accept none, seeing his duty to help two unescorted pilgrims by transporting us for free, we spilled into the oceanic current of believers. We met with a sea of whiteness, all male pilgrims draped in the Hajj clothing of white unseamed cloth. Many women too had adopted the ubiquitous white veils preferred by many pilgrimaging Muslims. In the melee, we merged instantly and our voices joined the low-grade hum of a colossal swarm. I looked around from within the pandemonium. Pilgrims were carrying giant baskets and enormous bags (some large enough to hold a man). Everyone was carrying some form of bedding.\nAfter a rapid check in, it was time to start believing Hajj was really going to happen. Stunned as my pilgrimage began to materialize into reality, I headed to the plane.\nInhaling the familiar smell of octane and hot asphalt with which all journeys begin, I mounted the staircase. The warm whispering Shamaal wind of Riyadh billowed around me, urging me on, my sole murmuring witness. With a final backward glance at Riyadh, I boarded the plane that would take me to the Ka'aba, the House of God. I wondered what I would learn of the millions of Muslims who would soon engulf me, and even more so, of the Muslim within me.\nMy transformation had begun.",

At any rate he doesn’t respond to friendliness; his broad face reflects nothing, and his steady, expressionless eyes discourage me. He is a little alarming too. Although he produces nothing more than an occasional low mutter when I attempt to convey my wishes to him, I often feel that he really understands English quite well; and since he walks with bare feet I can’t hear him move about, and am frequently startled to find him beside me or close behind my chair.",

A stone altar remains, so disassociated from Christian function that human sacrifice could have taken place on it. The place fell into ruin when an abbot sold the lead in the roof for some war. Now it’s a home for several cats. One has a litter of multicultural kittens; several fathers must have contributed to the ginger, black, and striped pile curled around the large white mother.",

When he parked in front of the hotel – in his boss’ shiny, black Toyota – we were still in the lobby of the hotel bank exchanging another roll of euro for pound. The teller that morning was in no hurry and spent more time than usual inspecting my passport. (I must admit that most people find me highly suspicious.) So, while we waited for the teller, Mr. Fish waited for us. He sat on the car's rear bumper and wiped his brow until a police officer shouted for him to move along. The two waved their arms about and shouted back and forth. Mr. Fish begged and pleaded and pointed toward the hotel until the officer relented with a final angry backstroke in the air. The teller cleared his throat to get my attention, and he slowly counted out our stack of cash. Then he asked me to count it back to him. Poor Mr. Fish! I thought.",

The concierge drew a line across the map, from the hotel to the museum, and he handed the map to me. Teresa asked if there were a restaurant at the museum, but the concierge wouldn’t commit to an answer. “Yes, no. Sometimes there is,” he said with a smile. Just in case, he opened a binder and flipped through pages filled with menus for a thousand restaurants in a thousand varieties. There were too many choices and, in the end, the concierge suggested we look in the shopping center next door. “There are several restaurants, please enjoy,” he said.",

He walked into the sprawled chaos of the settlement, the rifleman of news for sleeping men. His fast hands blocked the crackling sheet, he swung his lean arm like a whip. He saw the pale stars drown, and ragged light break open on the hills. Alone, the only man alive, he began the day for men, as he walked by the shuttered windows and heard the long denned snore of the tropics. He walked amid this close thick sleep, hearing again the ghostly ring of his own feet, and the vast orchestral music of darkness. As the grey tide of morning surged westward he awoke.",

Eventually a trio of youths, astonished by my arrival on their baseball field, led me to Carlos’s house (breeze block, 1970s), then hung around to observe my reception. A tall, muscular, light-skinned mulatto was sitting at the living-room table dealing with documents. He read Maribel’s chit with comically raised eyebrows, then removed his spectacles to study me silently before summoning Rafael, his grown-up English-speaking son who shook my hand before translating. ‘My father says you are not a tourist, not living like that. Why in Cuba did you not drive car? Every city have cars for tourist hire.’ Carlos did want to see my passport and visa. Then his wife Carmen, black and plump, came bustling in, asked to see Maribel’s chit, told her husband to relax, invited me to sit and have a cup of coffee. Whereupon the three youths, who had been listening from the doorway, returned to their baseball practice.",

Close behind her, sheltering indeed in the shadow of her more stately sisters, comes our Lady of Modesty, frailest and fairest of the three; whose face is only shown as the young moon shows when it is thin and sickle shaped and half hidden among clouds. Each advances towards the centre of the room where Orlando still lies sleeping; and with gestures at once appealing and commanding, Our Lady of Purity speaks first:",

The coming of the day silenced Captain Mitchell as if by the reflection that now in all the future days he would be deprived of the invaluable services of his Capataz. He leaned against the wall with his arms folded on his breast, and the doctor walked up and down the whole length of the place with his peculiar hobbling gait, as if slinking about on damaged feet. At the end furthest from the grating he would be lost altogether in the darkness. Only the slight limping shuffle could be heard. There was an air of moody detachment in that painful prowl kept up without a pause. When the door of the prison was suddenly flung open and his name shouted out he showed no surprise. He swerved sharply in his walk, and passed out at once, as though much depended upon his speed; but Captain Mitchell remained for some time with his shoulders against the wall, quite undecided in the bitterness of his spirit whether it wouldn’t be better to refuse to stir a limb in the way of protest.

When I first traveled in Colombia as a young student, I came to know a kind and generous old man, Noel Prince, father of daughters and a Liberal to the core. Some might even have described him as a Communist, which he never was. He simply believed in the Colombian people, convinced until his last breath that the country was destined for greatness, and that its greatness would come once all Colombians were free to transcend the limits of their birth and realize their hopes and dreams. Social and economic justice was the very air he breathed. Señor Prince was a great patriot, but his definition of patriotism was Christian charity, the love and assistance one granted without thought to those in greater need. His hero in his youth had been the Liberal Party leader and presidential hopeful Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, the one politician, he claimed, who actually cared about those living in misery. It was said that the poor cried out through Gaitán’s mouth. His words could silence the wind, and his oratory shook the very foundations of the established order. For this he was killed in 1948, cut down by three bullets, fired at close range as he stood in front of the Agustín Nieto Building in Bogotá, just across the street from the Black Cat Café.",

What impulse, what apprehension, had sent him suddenly to Paris? And why had he thought it needful to conceal his going from her? When Sophy Viner had left, it had been with the understanding that he was to await her summons; and it seemed improbable that he would break his pledge, and seek her without leave, unless his lover's intuition had warned him of some fresh danger. Anna recalled how quickly he had read the alarm in her face when he had rushed back to her sitting-room with the news that Miss Viner had promised to see him again in Paris. To be so promptly roused, his suspicions must have been but half-asleep; and since then, no doubt, if she and Darrow had dissembled, so had he. To her proud directness it was degrading to think that they had been living together like enemies who spy upon each other's movements: she felt a desperate longing for the days which had seemed so dull and narrow, but in which she had walked with her head high and her eyes unguarded.",

I am sure my father—the admirer of Walter Scott—would not have told the story of the Curlews nearly so dramatically; there would have been less dialogue and more description.",

I walked in to the dive-shop the next morning accompanied by the other crew-member from the boat, a retired lawyer from the Midwest named Linc. There was no more room to join the SCUBA-divers, but we were told we could join the snorkelers on the same boat, and we did.\nThe diving was again fantastic. We got in the water just off a tall pointy mountain, one of the famous Pitons, where the water-depth dropped off steeply. I was able to freedive in fairly deep water while still close to the group of snorkelers that I needed to stay with. Again I recorded the experience with my video camera (“Freediving St Lucia” https://youtu.be/I6OVJHZMOwI )",

I thought that it must be an acoustic effect of the wind - quick air singing in the boat’s tight wires - and I looked around at my companions, unsure if I were the only one hearing it. As it became louder, I realised that it was not a single note, but a braid of dozens of notes, each of a slightly different pitch. And then I understood. Seals! Seals were making the sound, the hundreds of seals that were hauled out on every rock and kelp-hung skerry in the bay, and on its curved shoreline. They were giving off noise without seeming to, as bees do, or water. They were of many different colours: grey, black, white, fawn, fox-red and leather-brown. As we passed close by three smaller females, I saw that their fur was elegantly marked in swirls and contours.",

But that departure is the elephant’s choice—not an act of being intimidated. The entire team, therefore, stayed at least twenty meters away from the herd.
