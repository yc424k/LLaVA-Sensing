    "target_paragraph": "While the VOC thrived, Dutch traders and explorers laid claim to lands covering an enormous area of the globe. In 1619 the Company captured Jakarta, renaming it Batavia. The base they built there would form the keystone of Dutch control over Indonesia for more than 300 years. Efforts to infiltrate China were less successful, but the VOC established a lucrative trading post in present-day Taiwan, and built a lucrative opium trade in India. In Japan the Dutch set up a trading post on the island of Dejima, which would remain Japan’s only window on the western world for roughly 200 years. Further south, in 1606, a Dutchman called Willem Janszoon became the first European ever to set foot on Australian soil. Encountering the first Aborigine ever to encounter a white man, he promptly shot him dead. Dutchmen who followed Janszoon to Australia were largely unimpressed by his discovery, complaining that the barren landscape was ‘inhabited by savages’ and surrounded by fish that were ‘unnatural monsters’. Nevertheless, they were swift to claim as much land they could, and within a few years the whole country was known to the world as ‘New Holland’.",

Margate, Eastbourne and Brighton had bronzed them and tanned them. The sparrows and starlings, making their discordant chatter round the eaves of St Martin’s,2 whitened the heads of the sleek statues holding rods or rolls of paper in Parliament Square.3 Blowing behind the boat train, the wind ruffled the channel, tossed the grapes in Provence, and made the lazy fisher boy, who was lying on his back in his boat in the Mediterranean, roll over and snatch a rope.",

After driving us back to the city, Sergei carried out that errand while Volodya and I killed time downtown. I walked around for a bit, then sat in the van. Soon I saw a lissome blonde in tight pants with a beeper at the waist walking lissomely by to use the pay phone in a little plaza across the way. A few minutes later she returned to the phone with a dark-haired woman as attractive as she and made another call. The two had a girlish, conspiratorial air; whatever they were up to, they were having fun. Looking around, I noticed that beautiful women were in fact walking everywhere, as if I had wandered onto the set of a science-fiction movie about a city inhabited only by beautiful women. The number of beauties in Krasnoyarsk would put even Velikii Ustyug in the shade.",

Their own compatriots—save those previously known or properly accredited—they treated with an even more pronounced disdain; so that, unless they ran across a Chivers, a Dagonet or a Mingott, their months abroad were spent in an unbroken tete-a-tete. But the utmost precautions are sometimes unavailing; and one night at Botzen one of the two English ladies in the room across the passage (whose names, dress and social situation were already intimately known to Janey) had knocked on the door and asked if Mrs. Archer had a bottle of liniment. The other lady—the intruder's sister, Mrs. Carfry—had been seized with a sudden attack of bronchitis; and Mrs. Archer, who never travelled without a complete family pharmacy, was fortunately able to produce the required remedy.",

Therefore he thought of nightingales in Newark, and muttered of his ruins; he knew six words of Greek and spoke of Clytemnestra. He muttered bitterly, was elegant and lost, and yet he did not die: he watched the windows, wore his rubbers when it rained, wept when his wife betrayed him, and went abroad to live—a royalist from Kansas City, a classicist from Nebraska, a fool from nowhere and from nothing.",

At first sight it seemed quite impossible, if only because of the law of gravity. But in extremis most things are possible and we briskly set about clearing a tent-sized space of stones sharp enough to puncture the floor and thorny bits of dead cacti. Eventually I got the tent up (and rainproof, I hope) while Rachel was collecting a meagre supply of poor quality fuel. Many blunt stones remain beneath it, embedded in the hard soil, but these won’t worry us because the floor is carpeted with 1) Juana’s poncho, 2) Juana’s two sacks, 3) Juana’s waterproof cape, 4) our space-blankets, 5) Rachel’s waterproof poncho, 6) Rachel’s woollen poncho, 7) Rachel’s saddle-blanket. We live in luxury. Because of the fuel-shortage – not even enough boiling water to melt soup-cubes – I recklessly opened our precious tin of milk: a shocking extravagance, at 65 soles, but it does make Nescafé that much less soul-destroying.",

And the magical and shining air – the strange, subtle and enchanted weather, was above them, and the buried men were strewn through the earth on which they trod, and a bracelet of great tides was flashing round them, and the enfabled rock on which they swarmed swung eastward in the marches of the sun into eternity, and was masted like a ship with its terrific towers, and was flung with a lion’s port between its tides into the very maw of the infinite, all-taking ocean. And exultancy and joy rose with a cry of triumph in his throat, because he found it wonderful.",

The wind was a sustained 30 and gusting to 40 knots, but Lone Eagle was riding well, and it seemed that his plan was working. By 0600, the conditions weren’t improving, and he was thinking about heaving to and riding it out. He didn’t like the idea of heaving-to. Back winding the main would put a lot of strain on the rudder and the tiller. It wasn’t worth risking it, so he watched their compass heading and the chart plotter. It would soon be time to tack over.",

A delighted crowd of little boys followed me from house to house, tumbling over one another in their eagerness to point out a written stone built into a wall or laid in the flooring about the hearth. In one house a woman caught me by the arm and implored me to heal her husband. The man was lying in a dark corner of the windowless room, with his face wrapped in filthy bandages, and when these had been removed a horrible wound was revealed, the track of a bullet that had passed through the cheek and shattered the jaw. I could do nothing but give him an antiseptic, and adjure the woman to wash the wound and keep the wrappings clean, and above all not to let him drink the medicine, though I felt it would make small odds which way he used it, Death had him so surely by the heel. This was the first of the long roll of sufferers that must pass before the eyes and catch despairingly at the sympathies of every traveller in wild places. Men and women afflicted with ulcers and terrible sores, with fevers and rheumatisms, children crippled from their birth, the blind and the old, there are none who do not hope that the unmeasured wisdom of the West may find them a remedy. You stand aghast at the depths of human misery and at your own helplessness.",

Dimensions tend to be removed. There is no substitute for being on the ground, for experiencing a landscape close at hand, for feeling the earth underfoot. And this was frustratingly apparent now, for the helicopter had spilled us suddenly into a three-dimensional wilderness world—for a ration of tangibility, to last fifteen minutes. Its lights blinking, its engine guttural, it sent out signals of impatience. Waiting to take us away, it took away something of what it had brought us to see.",

No question now about the honour of the United States, his personal honour was at stake, he was ready to drink them down if he died in the process. General Wong became purple and his eyes watered and he had trouble focusing so that when he tottered upright he directed his toast to the wall rather than to U.C. Mr Ma was so drunk that he was unable to translate U.C.’s most beautiful toast to the Generalissimo’s glorious and heroic armies. Half the company lay under the table, most of the remainder rested their heads upon it. U.C. towered above us, swaying but triumphant. General Wong, in whose power lay reprieve, apologized for the disgrace of having no more rice wine to offer his honoured guests.",

And down his mind went flat as a marsh, and three great emotions bowled over him; understanding; a vast philanthropy; and finally, as if the result of the others, an irrepressible, exquisite delight; as if inside his brain, by another hand, strings were pulled, shutters moved, and he, having nothing to do with it, yet stood at the opening of endless avenues down which if he chose he might wander.

    "target_paragraph": "Their dinner consisted of a local fish fried in oil—the fish had a very strange figure, and the oil, Stephen thought, tasted slightly rancid; there was also a small though muscular chicken. But Concha had provided large baskets of fruit; loquats still warm from the tree that bred them, the full flavoured little indigenous bananas, oranges sweet as though dripping honey, custard apples and guavas had Concha provided, together with a bottle of the soft yellow wine so dearly beloved of the island Spaniards.\nOutside in the garden there was luminous darkness. The night had a quality of glory about it, the blue glory peculiar to Africa and seen seldom or never in our more placid climate. A warm breeze stirred the eucalyptus trees and their crude, harsh smell was persistently mingled with the thick scents of heliotrope and datura, with the sweet but melancholy scent of jasmine, with the faint, unmistakable odour of cypress. Stephen lit a cigarette: Shall we go out, Mary?’\nThey stood for a minute looking up at the stars, so much larger and brighter than stars seen in England. From a pond on the farther side of the villa, came the queer, hoarse chirping of innumerable frogs singing their prehistoric love songs. A star fell, shooting swiftly earthward through the darkness.\nThen the sweetness that was Mary seemed to stir and mingle with the very urgent sweetness of that garden; with the dim, blue glory of the African night, and with all the stars in their endless courses, so that Stephen could have wept aloud as she stood there, because of the words that must not be spoken. For now that this girl was returning to health, her youth was becoming even more apparent, and something in the quality of Mary’s youth, something terrible and ruthless as an unsheathed sword, would leap out at such moments and stand between them.\nMary slipped a small, cool hand into Stephen’s, and they walked on towards the edge of the headland. For a long time they gazed out over the sea, while their thoughts were always of one another. But Mary’s thoughts were not very coherent, and because she was filled with a vague discontent, she sighed and moved even nearer to Stephen, who suddenly put an arm round her shoulder.\nStephen said: ‘Are you tired, you little child?’ And her husky voice was infinitely gentle, so that Mary’s eyes filled with sudden tears.\nShe answered: ‘I’ve waited a long, long time, all my life—and now that I’ve found you at last, I can’t get near you. Why is it? Tell me.’\n‘Aren’t you near? It seems to me you’re quite near!’ And Stephen must smile in spite of herself.\n‘Yes, but you feel such a long way away.’\n‘That’s because you’re not only tired out but foolish!’\nYet they lingered; for when they returned to the villa they would part, and they dreaded these moments of parting. Sometimes they would suddenly remember the night before it had fallen, and when this happened each would be conscious of a very great sadness which their hearts would divine, the one from the other.\nBut presently Stephen took Mary’s arm: ‘I believe that big star’s moved over more than six inches I It’s late—we must have been out here for ages.’ And she led the girl slowly back to the villa.",

She begged me not to change my mind about staying with them in Suceava. Petru was not her real friend – she was not that sort of bad person – her husband was afraid of Petru, which was why he had not helped me … I soothed her as best I could and invited her to the hotel that evening for another chat. She said she’d come, but she didn’t.",

Though almost at once he began to hurry a little, remembering not the sidcott but the burning; it had been more than twelve hours now since he left it in the tin and there might not be anything left of it. But he was in time: just the tin itself too hot to touch so that he kicked it over and tumbled the sidcott out, which would have to cool a little too. Which it did: not evening incrementing now but actual night itself, almost summer night this time at home in May; and in the latrine the tree once more was no longer green: only the stink of the sidcott which had lasted, he had wasted that concern, dropping it into the sink where it unfolded as of its own accord into visibility, into one last repudiation—the slow thick invincible smell of the burning itself visible now in creeping overlaps, almost gone now—only a beggar’s crumb but perhaps there had been an instant in the beginning when only a crumb of fire lay on the face of darkness and the falling waters and he moved again, one of the cubicles had a wooden latch inside the door if you were there first and he was and latched the invisible door and drew the invisible pistol from his tunic pocket and thumbed the safety off.",

But the fact remained that they were always joined by the border, and would forever bear the brunt in the see-saw game of greater interests. Herodotus, a man of the South but also a man of the known world, wrote: ‘Human happiness never remains long in the same place.’ By extension, the same must go for unhappiness, and we must find hope in this.

He was also local, while most of the other workers had moved from Java, Jogjakarta or Sumatra to find better jobs in Bali. Some of Ketut’s friends knew he worked at a nudist hotel for gay men, but his parents didn’t. Guests were usually naked, he said, but staff remained uniformed the whole time. I asked Ketut whether the male guests ever hit on him, and he giggled and squirmed, knowing it was unprofessional to answer.",

The days on the trail were long and tiring, with no shelter from the cold and wind for up to eight hours each day. Despite the gruelling conditions, the esprit de corps was strong. The team looked after one another with kindness and compassion, and that made all the difference. We encouraged each other, made each other laugh, a lot. The faster ones learnt to slow down, to wait for those who were catching up. The team was tight and gradually became a high-functioning unit. The extreme conditions emphasized the importance of looking after each other?there was no room for mistakes or complacency, the risk of frostbite was all too real. We disciplined ourselves to stay close together despite the different biking paces, because if someone got lost, hurt and left behind, they could freeze to death or die of hypothermia within hours. Indeed, in the Arctic, survival time is measured in hours.",

This was it. John Wesley borrowed my hunting coat to put on top of his because we had already proved that mine was the toughest, and he borrowed Ashley’s sweater to wrap around his head and neck, and we counted off twenty-five steps for him and Aleck Sander put one shell in his gun and somebody, maybe me, counted One Two Three slow and when whoever it was said One John Wesley broke and ran and when whoever it was said Three Aleck Sander shot John Wesley in the back and John Wesley gave me and Ashley back the sweater and my hunting coat and (it was late by then) we went home.

When I returned to America, Tsuru-san gave me another water-dripper, this one made of bronze. Tsuru-san had been the daughter of a well-to-do family before the war, but she had lost everything during the air raids.
