Close to the spring stands a mill with a pair of stone lions carved on the slab above the door, the heraldic supporters of some prince of Aleppo. They had been dug out of the mound together with a fine basalt door, like those which are found among the fourth and fifth century ruins in the neighbouring hills; the miller dusted it with his sleeve and observed that it was an antica. A party of dyers, who were engaged in spreading their striped cotton cloths upon the sward, did me the honours of their drying-ground?merry fellows they were, the typical sturdy Christians of Aleppo, who hold their own with their Moslem brothers and reckon little of distinctions of creed.",

Much of the credit belongs to a member of that expedition named Brent Bishop (the son of the late Barry Bishop, the eminent National Geographic photographer who summitted Everest in 1963), who initiated a highly successful incentive policy, funded by Nike, Inc., whereby Sherpas are paid a cash bonus for each oxygen bottle they bring down from the Col. Among the companies guiding Everest, Rob Hall’s Adventure Consultants, Scott Fischer’s Mountain Madness, and Todd Burleson’s Alpine Ascents International have enthusiastically embraced Bishop’s program, resulting in the removal of more than eight hundred oxygen canisters from the upper mountain from 1994 through 1996.",

War veterans began to ask themselves if they were after all a little bit disappointed. People renewed contracts which had been awaiting renewal for a week. In Hankow there was mourning, for the Chinese had decided that Japan, with the other Fascists too busy in Europe to help her Chinese campaign, might have stopped advancing. Everybody there felt strong sympathy with Czechoslovakia, in whose fate they saw a similarity to their own. The rich Shanghai Chinese soberly congratulated their foreign acquaintances, then went home to curse quietly in the bosom of the family. All over Shanghai wives and mothers put away their trunks and suitcases, wiped their eyes, powdered their noses, and went out to play bridge. Over in Hongkew, an American sailor slapped a Japanese.",

We followed lots of goat tracks untill we came to quite a main looking one that we hoped went somewhere. We came to a rock with wet slippery moss on it and Juana slipped and went down on her knees. I was quite scared while she was floundering up because there was a drop that could be dangerous on one side, but we managed perfectly. We came to a little flat spot that was quite grasy and there was a really lovely view. I would say that you could see for about a hundred miles as the crow flies. Way over on the horizon you could see the pointy cone shaped mountain that we passed quite closely on the way from Cajabamba to Huamachuco. I walked for a while because it was getting chilly. We started to go down steeply and there were lots of little jumps for poor Juana. We can see a big pueblo a bit bigger than Pampas that must be Conchucos. It is about four miles away. There is a lovely smell of thyme in the air. There are lots of thyme bushes dotted all over the hillside. We went down a steep nasty piece of earthquake damage. At the bottom I mounted but had to dismount soon again for another rift. There were the lovely ball shaped flowering cactuses and another nasty type rather like spear cactuses except that they weren’t so long and a lot slimmer, of a redish greenish colour. I kept getting stung as I bashed about, it was most unpleasant I can assure you. I think Juana hated it too.",

He had a job at a local primary school, had begun to edit a small magazine, and could afford for the first time to rent a house large enough for his family to move into. He even had a lightning love affair with a teacher on the staff of the primary school who later married a dairy farmer. But in August a fire destroyed both the school and the office of Takuboku’s magazine, and he left the city to go further north in search of work. Looking back on it, he was compelled to view his time in Hakodate through the filter of sorrow that attended him everywhere.",

What did it matter where she went, she thought, so long as it was country? She longed for the country, had longed for it all her life, with a violence nobody would have imagined could exist in the quiet figure bending over a typewriter and industriously tapping. Her mother had longed too, but had had to do the best she could with window-boxes instead. Father wouldn’t budge from Gower Street. He was like Doctor Johnson in his affection for pavements. The time of roses, or of the harvest moon, was nothing to father. He had no wish to smell hot grass on a summer day, or the young leaves of silver birches in April. He could apprehend these things without moving from his comfortable revolving chair, and he did apprehend them, embodying them in exquisite description presently to be copied out by Jen, who wondered sometimes, as she copied, whether it were better to know without having felt, like father, or feel without having known, like herself.",

Sovereign against a rogues’ gallery of external and internal ills, these had made the place famous in Roman times; legates, centurions and military tribunes had wallowed and sipped here while Hercules and half a dozen minor gods presided over them, and the Victorian statue of the lion-pelted and muscle-bound bruiser, which dominated the centre of the town, showed that the ancient glory had returned. The ailing burghers of Eastern Europe, in crinolines and stovepipe hats, sabretaches and czapkas, or mutton-chop sleeves and boaters had been haunting the resurrected site for over a century.",

An unusual amount of profanity—unusual even for surfers—is being used to discuss the waves, the weather, the world. People pace, fists plunged in pockets, laughing too loudly, dry-mouthed. Then Edwin, who has been silently watching the ocean from behind mirrored sunglasses, erupts. “I have an idea,” he announces. “Let’s form a support group. I’m not going out there because I’m scared to go out there. Why don’t we all just say that? ‘I’m not going out there because I’m scared to go out there.’ Come on, Domond, you say it.”",

Rime ice had formed in feathery windrows on shattered grey rocks, which were also marked with lichens the colour of lime and tangerine. Between the rocks, snow lay in stripes and furrows, dry and granular as sand. Working quickly, with numbing hands, and a growing sense of worry - was this too cold a place, too hard a place, to spend the night? - I moved rocks to clear a lozenge-shaped space of rough flatness, and arranged them into a low curving wall, a foot or so high.",

But he had it, cartridges too—not solid bullets but loaded with tiny shot such as naturalists use: incapable of killing the hog at all and even of hurting it much at this distance. In fact, Charles’s uncle said Meadowfill didn’t even really want to drive the hog away: he simply wanted to shoot it every day as other old people play croquet or bingo.",

It stands on a natural lawn, with abrupt slopes, sprinkled with orange trees burdened with fruit, ohias, and hibiscus. From the back verandah the forest-covered mountains rise, and in front a deep ravine widens to the grassy slopes below and the lonely Pacific,—as I write, a golden sea, on which the island of Niihau, eighteen miles distant, floats like an amethyst.",

The strange thing about being with a person in the desert is that you either end up the bitterest of enemies or the closest of friends. It had been touch and go in the beginning. Now, without the pressure of my feeling he had robbed me of something, or rather, with my acceptance of things turning out the way they did, plus the fact that Rick was a changed person, the friendship was firmly cemented. It had a rock-hard basis called shared experience, or the tolerance developed from seeing someone at their best and at their worst, and stripped of all social value – the bare bones of another human being. He had learnt a great deal from the trip; sometimes I think he got far more out of it than I did. We had shared something miraculous which had fundamentally changed us both. We knew each other very well I think. Besides, he had now moved out from behind his camera and become part of the trip.",

There was only a loosely formed little crowd in the square, carrying umbrellas, waiting to make a dash for the upper corner where the parade of the guards would pass, and another one back to the center to cheer the Pope when as the really last gesture of Holy Year he appeared, a small figure in white high above them, at one of the Vatican windows. With the mystique of numbers still not altogether superseded, some might be thinking more of the year 2000 than of 1975, possibly with something of the terror that the world of the Middle Ages felt at the ending of the first Christian millennium, and with somewhat better reasons.",

I sat on a chair, turned to stone. The sitting room was furnished with fidgety little varnished tables and Grand Rapids grey plush armchairs and sofas, tricked out in crocheted doilies for head-rests. The doilies were black from greasy dirt, but some were hidden by the lustrous hair of three young Chinese thugs. The thugs lolled on chairs and sofas and did not trouble to rise or speak as we entered. They stared at us through lizard eyes. They wore sharp striped suiting and pointed shoes. They had evidently been using our quarters: beneath the cheap pink satin bedspread, the sheets and pillow cases bore the dark stains of their hair oil. In the bathroom, another fine imported porcelain toilet overflowed on the tile floor.",

Through a stretch of the trees I glimpsed the lakeshore, flat between a break in the cliffs, and so I left the road and walked half a kilometer over soft fallen pine needles and emerged into a sandy clearing that turned out to be a campsite. Two fishermen sat smoking on the nearby beach, and an old caretaker had come out of his wooden hut and stood staring at me as I trudged towards him. I nodded.",

And we did get away, leaving him to think what he liked, and to smoke, or sleep, or wander as he chose, and I could not but believe he must feel relieved to be rid of me; but the afternoon clouded over, and a sharp wind sprang up, and we were very cold in the forest, and the babies began to sneeze and ask where the parson was, and at last, after driving many miles, I said it was too late to go to the parson's and we would turn back. It struck me as hard that we should be forced to wander in cold forests and leave our comfortable home because of a lieutenant, and I went back with my heart hardened against him.",

He was terrified of the Sultan, but for his own safety decided the best policy was to cling to the Tughluk’s fingertips ‘and every time he said any encouraging word to me I kissed his hand, until I had kissed it seven times.’",

The Hotel Meridien Cairo, as it was first known, opened in 1971. The hotel catered to an international and business-class clientele, many of whom traveled on expense accounts. Those clients undoubtedly enjoyed the hotel’s central location, deluxe rooms, and full-service bar. The Meridien changed hands in 2003, and the new owners had big plans for the property. They rebranded the hotel, added a forty-one-story tower, and, in a moment of piety, ordered the staff to dump the hotel’s entire stock of alcohol down the drain. The Hyatt Corporation, which managed the hotel at the time, bit its corporate tongue, but many thirsty clients stayed elsewhere after that. Widespread labor strikes followed the 25 January Revolution, and just a few weeks later, Hyatt cancelled its management contract and walked away. The revolution and the labor strikes and the loss of management devastated the business, and the absentee landlords prepared to shutter the hotel till the new government intervened. On behalf of the employees, the Ministry of Tourism appealed to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, and the Council demanded that the hotel remain open. The move saved hundreds of jobs, all of which were badly needed. Now called the Grand Nile Tower Hotel, the mercurial property often sees more employees than customers, but not for want of trying.",

He was glad he had remembered to bring her his usual gift. He held the flower wrapped in tissue paper in front of him. But why was the room so full of smoke? A gust blew in. Both windows in the back room were open, and the smoke was blowing in from the garden. Were they burning weeds, he wondered? He walked to the window and looked out. Yes, there they were – Eugénie and the two little girls. There was a bonfire. As he looked, Magdalena, the little girl who was his favourite, tossed a whole armful of dead leaves. She jerked them as high as she could, and the fire blazed up. A great fan of red flame flung out.",
