According to a recorded commentary, most people didn’t expect the storm to come to much. A weaker cyclone had passed through a few weeks earlier without doing significant damage, and the leading edge of Tracy brushed over the town without leaving any hint of particular ferocity to come. Most people turned in as if it were a normal night. It wasn’t until Darwin was hit by the back end of the storm system, about 2:30 A.M., that people realized they were really in for it. As the winds whipped up to 160 miles an hour Darwin’s frail tropical houses began to shed pieces and then to disintegrate. Most of the housing was postwar fiberboard homes of a type called the D series, which were cheap and quick to build but could not stand up to a real hurricane. Before the night was out Tracy had blown away nine thousand homes and killed more than sixty people.",

It moved as gracefully as a cat, though it had the overall shape of a squirrel. But it was substantially bigger than a squirrel, with a longer, bushier tail. Its fur gleamed a sort of bluish-brown, darker and more lustrous in the wild than on a hanger at Saks Fifth Avenue. As we came up on it, the sable sprang onto the snow berm and ran along parallel to the car. It looked like running gold.",

The lakefront and the hills around the town had prevented the characteristic Soviet-era gigantism from spreading too far. There was the usual wide central avenue, the public square, and the drab bureaucratic buildings, but all within a small-town radius and scale. In the telephone building, the room of phone booths of hand-carved wood had a pleasantly overheated stuffiness after the cold, and a woolly, intimate, school-coatroom smell. In the post office, an ingenious system had been devised where people waited sitting down, sliding along benches one after the next in sequence as they moved up to the front. When I went in to mail some postcards, almost everyone waiting was an old or middle-aged woman.",

Their hair is always very long and black, worn in braids that are typically woven together at the ends, with decorations hanging from the bottom that indicate whether they are married or single.

A propaganda video released on YouTube showed young jihadists boasting of their exploits in fluent Dutch, while a photo circulated on social media showing Dutch-language graffiti praising ISIS on a wall in Syria. Closer to home, a Muslim member of The Hague’s city council sparked a furore when he posted on Facebook, in Dutch, ‘Long live ISIS, and God willing on to Baghdad to clean up that scum’. A staffer at the Justice Ministry’s own Cyber Security Centre was fired after tweeting that ISIS was a Zionist plot to ‘blacken Islam’s name’.",

Having back-up vehicles allowed all of us to take risks that would be suicidal for a single van. We crossed deep rivers and flooded plains, explored tracks which seemed almost undriveable and felt untouched by humans. We shared a typically French picnic lunch of cheese and wine under a towering baobob tree, until we were forced to hastily retreat to our vehicles when a large bull elephant suddenly arrived to gatecrash the party. We watched an enormous elephant herd splashing in a river, at a distance Kirsty and I would never have dared to consider, until Stephanie, the zoologist, detected a subtle change in the matriarch's mood, which sent us all scurrying away to safety. We saw lions hunting in the distance, and snoozing by our front wheels. We picked a slow course between a hundred-strong buffalo herd, and were befriended by a pack of curious hyena cubs, who approached the strange human visitors while sniffing the air, bobbing their heads and squeaking like pet shop puppies.",

Shoeless teenagers sold helium balloons to passing pedestrians, as men crossed the road holding hands – a sign of platonic friendship and respect. At Goregaon train station, I gave money to an old lady who’d had the fingers on both hands sliced clean off. Her paddle-like palms were stained with muck.

As I walked up and down the steep hills and wooden staircases of Juneau’s downtown, I couldn’t help but notice a surprising number of good restaurants for a city of thirty-three thousand people. The abundance of fine dining options makes more sense when you consider the quantity of lobbyists in town. It was no coincidence that the ten-digit deficit in Alaska’s state budget included five hundred million dollars in largely ineffectual tax credits for oil exploration. Sometimes the appeal on behalf of clients was more direct than a nice dinner. Just a couple of floors up from my room at the downtown Baranof Hotel, lobbyists for an oil services company had been recorded dispensing cash to lawmakers like an ATM. One state representative with his hand out was caught boasting that he “had to cheat, steal, beg, borrow, and lie” to help defeat a bill opposed by the oil industry. Another pleaded guilty to withdrawing a prospective piece of oil tax legislation for the grand sum of four thousand dollars. An environmental activist who joined me for a couple of cocktails bemoaned the difficulty of fighting Big Oil in Alaska. “What kills me isn’t just that these people prostituted themselves; it’s that they did it for so little money,” he said.",

But the evening after I was in the heart of Stuttgart by lamp-lighting time, sole customer in a café opposite the cubistic mass of the Hotel Graf Zeppelin. Snow and sleet and biting winds had emptied the streets of all but a few scuttling figures, and two cheerless boys doggedly rattling a collection box. Now they had vanished as well and the proprietor and I were the only people in sight in the whole capital of Württemberg. I was writing out the day’s doings and vaguely wondering where to find lodging when two cheerful and obviously well-brought up girls came in, and began buying groceries at the counter. They were amusingly dressed in eskimo hoods, furry boots and gauntlets like grizzly bears which they clapped together to dispel the cold. I wished I knew them … The sleet, turning to hail, rattled on the window like grapeshot. One of the girls, who wore horn-rimmed spectacles, catching sight of my German-English dictionary, daringly said ‘How do you do, do, Mister Brown?’ (This was the only line of an idiotic and now mercifully forgotten song, repeated ad infinitum like Lloyd George Knew My Father; it had swept across the world two years before.) Then she laughed in confusion at her boldness, under a mild reproof from her companion. I jumped up and implored them to have a coffee, or anything … They suddenly became more reserved: ‘Nein, nein, besten Dank, aber wir müssen weg!’ I looked crestfallen; and after an exchange of ‘Warum nicht?’s, they consented to stay five minutes, but refused coffee.",

A single warship was assigned to handle the peculiar D-Day. For two nights we waited on deck, crammed with troops, in heat, dirt, thirst, everyone asking aloud and bitterly what we were waiting for. Then the great day dawned and we swarmed down nets into landing craft. The welcoming committee of Japanese officers could be seen on the black sand beach and in order not to lose face we were supposed to make a ceremonial approach, all landing craft in line abreast. There followed a scene of glorious confusion; landing craft scurried like maddened water beetles, if two got in line, the others strayed. The troops became increasingly browned-off as well as seasick. We were pitched about inside these uncomfy steel jobs while the impassive Japanese watched, no doubt wondering how our side won the war.",

The chimney, so far as I could see, opened out gradually downwards to a great width, and appeared to be about forty feet deep; and at its base there was an abyss of lashing, tumbling, restless fire, emitting an ominous, surging sound, and breaking upwards with a fury which threatened to blow the cone and the crust on which it stands, into the air.",

My father was the only son in a family of seven, so most of the least desirable chores fell to him, and in that isolated place, there were plenty of undesirable chores. To make some pocket money, young Johnny's only source of income was some illicit low level poaching - snaring of rabbits, which he would sell to the butchers in Scarborough after a ten mile walk to the town.

Did I have a friend in Beijing? he asked. Not really, I gasped—just a secondhand invitation to stay with a correspondent for Agence France-Presse, whom I had never met. His fiancée in Hong Kong had told me to stay with him, but he knew nothing about it. The Mongolian looked surprised, but guided me nonetheless to one of the city’s only public telephones and dialed the number I gave him. The phone crackled, he shot something out and then he was shot at in return. He put down the receiver with an air of anxious melancholy. It would not be easy, he said, to find my friend.",

There’s the sprig on the table-cloth; there’s my painting; I must move the tree to the middle; that matters—nothing else.
