The street is narrow—traffic is terrible—and the buildings squeeze it like pincers. An eighteenth-century writer called the Corso “one long tomb,” and Stendhal thought it smelled of rotten cabbages. Dickens gives us a wonderful little picture of its buildings, now gray with calcified traffic fumes: “There are verandahs and balconies, of all shapes and sizes, to almost every house—not on one story alone, but often to one room or another on every story—put there in general with so little order or regularity that, if year after year, and season after season, it had rained balconies, hailed balconies, snowed balconies, blown balconies, they could scarcely have come into existence in a more disorderly manner.”",

Bears and wolves cross ditch lines, gyrfalcons and rough-legged hawks nest along the cliffs. From a bus on the park road, I have seen a father wolf regurgitating bits of carcass into the mouths of its five pups while the mother lounged in the brush; a bear running upstream in the Toklat River, current pouring over its shoulders; two grizzly cubs in a pullout batting at a traffic pylon; a heavy-antlered moose head breaking the surface of a kettle pond; three jaegers in jet-fighter formation; a wolf pair dividing and conquering a caribou herd, finally picking off the smallest, weakest calf that couldn’t run quite fast enough; a fox with a rodent’s head in its mouth. Others have seen a bear take down a moose in a river swollen with runoff, a wolf and a bear jockeying over a caribou carcass, a mama bear and three cubs sliding down snowfields, a boreal owl clip a snowshoe hare. On the bus, kids turn from their video games and iPods and watch. It’s like a nature show, whispers a man from Ohio. Cynics gape. Stoics smile. Loudmouths go quiet, except for one loudmouth announcing how amazing it is.",

Upstairs father, left out and terribly hurt, dependent on her now more than ever, to whom she was bound by every tie of decency and pity, down here James, in this distressing condition—what could one do, faced by such dreadful dilemmas, except shut one’s eyes and stick to the person who needed one most? James was nothing to her, really—how could he be? He merely, mixed up beyond disentanglement with her brief sojourn in bliss, represented all the things she loved. She had done with those things now, and she mustn’t go soft and sorry over him just because he wanted to marry her, and couldn’t. It was vital that she shouldn’t go soft and sorry, and make things worse for everybody—no, nor go soft and sorry over herself, either. For was it a reason, because a woman once had known delight, that for the rest of her life she should lament? Let her be grateful for those short weeks of glory, and come back from them to work as one comes back from a holiday. Her path was plain and straight. She could never desert father. She would die first. And that being so—",

More likely it was the outskirts of a hurricane but storm it was, a wind too big for our patched sail and high foam-capped waves breaking over us. I hadn’t known that cats could get seasick; my cat shivered and mewed pitifully and threw up thin yellow streams, then heaved its sides with nothing left to vomit.

At the wet edges of the ford it thickened.\nWhen you shut your eyes you could still see Bertha's scarlet frock on the white bridge path and smell the wet earth at the edges of the ford.\nYou were leaning over the white painted railing of the bridge when she began. The water flowed from under the little tunnel across the road into the field beyond. Deep brown under the tunnel, tawny in the shallow ford, golden patches where the pebbles showed through, and the water itself, a sheet of thin crystal, running over the colours, sliding through them, running and sliding on and on.\nThere was nothing in the world so beautiful as water, unless it was light. But water was another sort of light.\nBertha pushed her soft sallow face into yours. Her big black eyes bulged out under her square fringe. Her wide red mouth curled and glistened. There were yellowish stains about the roots of her black hair. Her mouth and eyes teased you, mocked you, wouldn't let you alone.\nBertha began: \"I know something you don't know.\"\nYou listened. You couldn't help listening. You simply had to know. It was no use to say you didn't believe a word of it. Inside you, secretly, you knew it was true. You were frightened. You trembled and went hot and cold by turns, and somehow that was how you knew it was true; almost as if you had known all the time.\n\"Oh, shut up! I don't want to hear about it.\"\n\"Oh, don't you? You did a minute ago.\"\n\"Of course I did, when I didn't know. Who wouldn't? I don't want to know any more.\"\n\"I like that. After I've told you everything. What's the good of putting your fingers in your ears now?\"\nThere was that day; and there was the next day when she was sick of\nBertha. On the third day Bertha went back to Woodford Bridge.",

They’d communicated with fires called friktories. It marked the time before the Via Egnatia ran to the south, the time when ‘barbarian’ Macedonia headed by Alexander the Great had passed along here on its way east to engulf the known world, all the way to the banks of the Indus. Inside the threshold of the gate, a pair of carved human footsteps could still be traced in the stone – they had been placed here as magical guardians against enemy breach. Clearly, their magic had run out when Macedonia was overrun by the Romans. Later, local Thracians and incoming Herulians sacked these forts, and that’s the state they have been in since the third century AD.",

    "target_paragraph": "As I moved from district to district on the Metro, seeking a non-tourist hotel, people stared at me; despite my inadequate garments, I was visibly sweating with pain. There were few places to sit; most restaurants and cafés had been closed since the revolution, even in the main railway station, and the atmosphere in the hyper-luxurious Intercontinental Hotel felt unendurably sleazy. This was one of America’s Ceausescu-boosting investments during the early 1970s. To make way for it, the architectural heart of old Bucharest had to be torn out; little remains now of a capital once known as ‘the Paris of the East’. As I passed through the swing doors, an ostentatiously-uniformed porter hastened to eject me; socially deprived Rumanians are not permitted to sully this temple of affluence. The man’s expression was comical when I told him to get lost; clearly he was unused to coping with socially deprived foreigners and didn’t know the rules. He hesitated, glanced nervously towards Reception, then allowed me to proceed into the foyer where I sat for a few nauseated moments before ejecting myself.",

At the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him in from the street. He dragged it aside, and entered a long, low room which looked as if it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrill flaring gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that faced them, were ranged round the walls. Greasy reflectors of ribbed tin backed them, making quivering discs of light. The floor was covered with ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and stained with dark rings of spilt liquor. Some Malays were crouching by a little charcoal stove playing with bone counters, and showing their white teeth as they chattered. In one corner with his head buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the tawdrily-painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two haggard women mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his coat with an expression of disgust. ‘He thinks he’s got red ants on him,’ laughed one of them, as Dorian passed by. The man looked at her in terror, and began to whimper.",

In the boy’s vision of that world, the Joyners were a race as lawless as the earth, as criminal as nature. They hurled their prodigal seed into the raw earth of a mountain woman’s body, bringing to life a swarming progeny which lived or died, was extinguished in its infancy or fought its way triumphantly to maturity against the savage enemies of poverty, ignorance, and squalor which menaced it at every step. They bloomed or perished as things live or die in nature—but the triumphant Joyners, superior to all loss or waste, lived forever as a river lives. Other tribes of men came up out of the earth, flourished for a space, and then, engulfed and falling, went back into the earth from which they came. Only the Joyners—these horror-hungry, time-devouring Joyners—lived, and would not die.",

The appearance of the ordinary Persian, as dressed by Marjoribanks’s sumptuary laws, is a slur on human dignity; impossible, one thinks, for this swarm of seedy mongrels to be really the race that have endeared themselves to countless travellers with their manners, gardens, horsemanship, and love of literature. How the Afghans may endear themselves remains to be seen. Their clothes and their walk are credential enough to begin with. A few, the officials, wear European suits, surmounted by a dashing lambskin hat. The townsmen too sport an occasional waistcoat in the Victorian style, or the high-collared frock-coat of the Indian Mussulman. But these importations, when accompanied by a turban as big as a heap of bedclothes, a cloak of parti-coloured blanket, and loose white peg-top trousers reaching down to gold-embroidered shoes of gondola shape, have an exotic gaiety, like an Indian shawl at the Opera. This is the southern fashion, favoured by the Afghans proper. The Tajiks, or Persian element, prefer the quilted gown of Turkestan. Turcomans wear high black boots, long red coats, and busbies of silky black goats’ curls. The most singular costume is that of the neighbouring highlanders, who sail through the streets in surtouts of stiff white serge, dangling false sleeves, almost wings, that stretch to the back of the knee and are pierced in patterns like a stencil. Now and then a calico bee-hive with a window at the top flits across the scene. This is a woman.",

The more traditional of the Peak’s grandees, nevertheless, were still carried up and down in sedan-chairs; some went up by chair, down by bicycle, and Mr R. C. Hurley, whose house stood rather lower than the upper tram terminal, liked to complete his journey home on his ‘motor-less motorcar’, a four-wheeled carriage which enabled him to free-wheel all the way to his front door.",

I thought how agreeable it would be to plunge my head under water, if only for a moment. The next instant I did so. Before I realized what I was doing I was drinking deeply from the warmer shallows. Having done so I felt exactly as though I had participated in some loathsome crime, like cannibalism, a crime against humanity that turns all men’s hands against one. Actually, it was only a crime against my own person but the feeling of defection from moral standards was the same.",

Animals stood about the road in the frost-heavy air, with heads sunk passively, waiting for the men to finish their drinks in the beastly bar—we walked slowly up the hill. In a field on the right a flock of merino sheep moved mistily, uneasily, climbing at the gaps in the broken road bank, and sounding their small fine bells with a frosty ripple of sound. A figure which in the dusk I had really thought was something inanimate broke into movement in the field. It was an old shepherd, very old, in very ragged dirty black-and-white, who had been standing like a stone there in the open field-end for heaven knows how long, utterly motionless, leaning on his stick. Now he broke into a dream-motion and hobbled after the wistful feminine, inquisitive sheep. The red was fading from the far-off west. At the corner, climbing slowly and wearily, we almost ran into a grey and lonely bull, who came stepping down-hill in his measured fashion like some god. He swerved his head and went round us.",

He did, and the walk took them down a dimly lit hallway to a room where two more guards with guns were stationed outside. He was ushered into the room. It had to be the interrogation room as there were a pair of handcuffs bolted to the table, a dimly glowing light bulb hanging above, and two more guards with rifles positioned at opposite ends of the table.
