    "target_paragraph": "The formidable communication problem presented by the highland terrain is sometimes given as an excuse for this governmental flight from reality. Yet, unlike many other undeveloped countries, Northern Ethiopia is fortunate in having a uniquely healthy climate and a generally self-sufficient population. In The Christian Romance of Alexander the Great we read that one day Alexander and his soldiers came to the City of Saints ‘where the water is sweeter than the grapes of which wine is made and the stones are of sard, chalcedony, jacinth and sapphire, where there is neither freezing cold nor parching heat, neither summer nor winter, neither oppression nor tears. Instead of snow, manna falleth from heaven. All their wells and rock cisterns are filled with honey, and every beast among them is filled with milk.’ Granted this is a Romance, not an agricultural survey, but it does convey truly the feeling of the highlands, where an energetic and responsible government could bring prosperity to most regions.",

The experience was successful while revealing at the same time. She was able to stand unrecognized inches away from someone she preferred to avoid.

I had been there a couple times before, when I had travelled on business with Nike to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, but I had never spent time travelling around the country. While there, I had learnt that Vietnam is the Asian country most affected by climate change and disasters. Due to their gender-defined roles in society and increasing feminization of agriculture as men moved to the cities for better jobs, Vietnamese women were the ones more likely to carry the heaviest burdens and suffer the most from environmental degradation. I reached out to my UN Women Singapore contacts, who put me in touch with their Vietnam office and to my delight, I discovered that they had a robust agricultural programme that focused on making Vietnamese women more resilient to climate change by helping them grow crops better suited for the soil in their region?exactly what I wanted to support via HER Planet Earth. Coincidentally, I also had a unique challenge in mind there, a mind-blowing place that had been on my expedition wish-list for a while?Son Doong Cave.",

He supposed that she thought him to blame for not telling her at once--perhaps regarded him as brutal, unfeeling. But he could not imagine why. All that belonged to another plane, to another life, almost . . . his mind refused to relate it to what he and she had in common. But how explain this to her, if she could not feel for herself the difference between that shadow and this burning reality?",

It is difficult enough sailing on dark nights through reef-spiked channels and across erratic currents where there are no lights to guide (from northwest to southeast the Solomons extend across a thousand miles of sea, and on all the thousands of miles of coasts there is not one lighthouse); but the difficulty is seriously enhanced by the fact that the land itself is not correctly charted. Su'u is an example. On the Admiralty chart of Malaita the coast at this point runs a straight, unbroken line. Yet across this straight, unbroken line the Minota sailed in twenty fathoms of water. Where the land was alleged to be, was a deep indentation. Into this we sailed, the mangroves closing about us, till we dropped anchor in a mirrored pond. Captain Jansen did not like the anchorage. It was the first time he had been there, and Su'u had a bad reputation. There was no wind with which to get away in case of attack, while the crew could be bushwhacked to a man if they attempted to tow out in the whale-boat. It was a pretty trap, if trouble blew up.",

He had spent his life in mountains by night and by day. He had bivouacked on north faces, in rock niches, in snow holes, and walked and climbed in all weathers and all hours. Starlight and storm, for Rebuffat, were indispensable energies, for they returned to those who moved through them a sense of the world’s own forces and processes. ‘In this modern age, very little remains that is real,’ he wrote in 1956.Night has been banished, so have the cold, the wind, and the stars. They have all been neutralized: the rhythm of life itself is obscured. Everything goes so fast, and makes so much noise, and men hurry by without heeding the grass by the roadside, its colour, its smell . . . But what a strange encounter then is that between man and the high places of his planet! Up there he is surrounded by silence. If there is a slope of snow steep as a glass window, he climbs it, leaving behind him a strange trail.",

This seems unnecessary, but I am coerced to climb aboard. When we get upstairs, the stretcher-bearers have trouble getting around the corners in the narrow hallways and I convince them to let me walk. I have developed such effective sea legs that the solid ground feels unstable. The men help me across a portico and into a room, sit me down on a bed, and drop my bag at the foot of it. An old man rises up from the bed opposite me, an intravenous plugged into his arm. We smile at each other.",

It was a smack, harsh and pitiless, and it fell upon their ears in a dead, flat blow, without that reverberation which lends the tones of a drum to more distant thunder. By the lustre reflected from every part of the earth and the wide domical scoop above it, he saw that the tree was sliced down the whole length of its tall straight stem, a huge riband of bark being apparently flung off. The other portion remained erect, and revealed the bared surface as a strip of white down the front. The lightning had struck the tree. A sulphurous smell filled the air: then all was silent, and black as a cave in Hinnom.",

Here were pyramids of oranges – small, green, dry – and good quality bananas, woody dwarf tomatoes, piles of pale brown dried beans, almost identical piles of coffee, ropes of onions and garlic, trays of huge papayas, some cut and sculpted with flies buzzing around their juicy crimson-gold flesh – but no greenery of any sort. The cheerful traders (as many men as women, unlike Africa) welcomed the foreigners, admired the Trio, poked friendly fun at Rachel’s Spanish, apologised for having no pineapples, carefully chose for us the least dry oranges and the ripened-to-perfection papayas and advised us to avoid the tomatoes.

But now they belonged to him again: October next week, not much to see in this flat Delta country which he had misdoubted the first time he laid eyes on it from the train window that day thirty-eight years ago: just cotton stalks and cypress needles.

At the end of the corridor Bascom Pentland turned right along another corridor and at length paused before a door which bore this inscription across the familiar glazed glass of American business offices: ‘The John T. Brill Realty Co. – Houses For Rent or Sale.’ Below this bold legend in much smaller letters was printed: ‘Bascom Pentland – Att’y at Law – Conveyancer and Title Expert.’",

Life is too hard for farmers now, what with severe drought losses last year, maize prices down this year, interest rates up, the EC dumping beef, government subsidies drastically reduced, the rand devalued. Tractor sales are down from 15,000 a year in the mid-’70s to less than 2,000 in ’92, and many farmers are unable even to afford spare parts because of new import tariffs … Mr de Vos spoke in despairing tones that were almost convincing; he and those he represents believe they are verging on destitution. Yet most farmers own a Mercedes (you see them parked by the dozen outside dorp kerks on the Sabbath), plus a Golf or Corolla for the wife and kids to run around in, plus a bakkie for farm work. But of course whites live in this style and blacks live in that style, and the need to lower white standards by way of raising black standards cannot be faced. Yet on this readjustment will depend the new South Africa’s long-term stability.",

Should I attempt to discuss those realities? Could any breakthrough be achieved?

Thirteen treeless summits, each about the height of the high Adirondacks, surrounded the three confluent streams there, and down from this nippled coronet ran sweeping tundra fells deceptive to view. They appeared to be as smooth as fairways, but with their sedge tussocks and fissured soils they were in fact as rough as boulderfields. Flying near stallout speed, Stanley followed one creek and another, studying the ground. Finally, he saw a place he thought he could get out of if he were to set the plane down. The walk would be long if he couldn’t—not to mention what to do about the plane. Rising, circling, returning, he gingerly put his wheels on the ground and jumped back at once into the air. Felt pretty good. He circled again. He rolled his wheels on the tundra twice more. It was thumping rough, but it seemed negotiable. He set the Aeronca down.",

After twenty minutes Ghulam Hussain reappeared carrying a shiny new tin tray on which were two cups of ginger tea (a most warming and refreshing concoction) and two boiled eggs on a saucer with two teaspoons. Rachel found the tea too spicy so she ate both eggs and I drank both teas while a stream of village sufferers came to the door to beg for medicines. It was hard to explain that although I happened to have something which might help one child I could do nothing for all the rest.",
