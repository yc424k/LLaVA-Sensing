Then, too, there were Audrey's cheeks, such a hot, burning red, and her excessive joy, now that her mother came to think of it, when her relations unexpectedly came in. She had flung herself into her mother's arms almost as if she were running for safety. Not quite normal, such behaviour. Of course, if the child were going to have a baby--everything could always be accounted for by a baby; but short of that she was decidedly, to-day, unusual. And here was Jim being most unusual too. And he, anyhow, couldn't be going to have a baby.",

Action erupts in its casual baffling way, always expected but never anticipated. More of his home life slips from him. He is frustrated by waiting. He feels friendless. The mud sucks at his boots. On the morning of 14 March he is looking out towards no-man’s-land when he sees a piece of burnt paper skipping towards him, whisking in the air. No, not paper. A bat, probably shaken from one of the last standing sheds in Ronville. He notices an old grey-green track that crosses no-man’s-land, its path still visible even among the devastation. It must once have been a country way to Arras. How hard it is to erase a path. Deep green water has collected in one of the bigger shell-holes, and the skeletons of whole trees can be seen lying there. He writes home to Merfyn, asking him to oil up a bicycle so that the two of them can go out riding together when he returns in the summer.",

Wife and I pooled our pidgin German; she was a doctor, from Sibiu, enduring three years ‘exile’ in Moldavia. Her husband and son had come for the weekend: she hardly ever saw them, her mother looked after the boy. But perhaps soon the Front would set people free to choose their own jobs … Her bed-sitter was too cold for a child so they were going to stay with a friend in Gura Humorului who would of course drive me to the hotel, some two miles from the pitch-dark gara on the town’s edge. This chance encounter saved me from wandering for hours through streets unlit and deserted at 7.30 p.m.",

She’s a kitten who’s just discovered feathers.",

To the east – and quite close, beyond a grassy ravine – stretches a ridge of gently curved mountains. To the north are sharp, dark, sheer peaks. To the south are more distant but no less ferocious summits, many snow-flecked.",

Following his gaze, we saw that hidden in the trees was another tiger, named Machli. Machli was known as the Queen of the Jungle. She was 15 years old and had provided five litters for the reserve, making her the pride of Ranthambore. She was still, watching him with a front paw hovering off the ground, her tail curving like a cobra. When he was less than a few metres away, they bounded towards each other and at the last second leapt up, paws outstretched, and clashed mid-air, sinking claws and teeth into each other’s necks.",

However, in these extreme conditions, despite the many layers I wore, my extremities still felt dangerously numb. The biggest risk, as we spent close to ten hours without shelter on migration days out in the cold, was frostbite and hypothermia. I was well aware that if our body’s core temperature dropped by just one or two degrees, hypothermia could set in. Hypothermia was a medical emergency, which happens when the body loses heat faster than it can produce heat to counterbalance the cooling. As the body’s temperature drops, the heart, brain and internal organs cannot function, and so the body begins to shut down. Thus, I kept a watchful eye on my teammates, throughout the travel days, for any early warning signs.",

Though the simmering energy of nationalism was not to erupt until the following decade, Htin Aung described the British and the Burmese as bitter enemies separated by ‘a wall of racial prejudice, harder than granite’. Communications between them, he said, were riddled with ‘mutual suspicion, despair and disgust’. The 1920s were indeed a politically tense time. There were nationwide school and university strikes, which began when Rangoon’s first university was opened, and students demanded a national education system free from British control. Village political associations were set up to boycott British goods and refuse payment of government taxes. One British historian noted that a favourite hobby of young Burmese was ‘police-baiting’.",

On being helped into the Russian tanker this morning I felt as disconcerted as though I’d been transferred without warning from a local eating-house to Dublin’s Shelbourne Hotel. Sinking back in the well-upholstered seat (with arm-rest) I stretched out my legs and put down the window (with glass) and watched the clean-shaven driver in his neat Western clothes hanging my wind-cheater from a hook. Definitely, I thought, this is the next best thing to the comfort of an ambulance. Then as soon as we started I realised that Comrade Ivan, lacking that native Afghan philosophy which alone makes such journeys tolerable, was in a hurry, which jarred me in every direction; mentally it was incongruous and physically it was hell. Holding my semi-knit ribs together with one hand and hanging on to the door with the other, I found myself being bounced off that excessively well-sprung seat every five minutes; I longed then for a vehicle with no springs and six passengers in a space meant for three, each keeping the other firmly wedged. We passed a total of eight happily broken-down Afghan trucks surrounded by little groups of ragged, barefooted, undismayed men; looking enviously at them I pondered the symbolism of luxury trucks being so uncomfortable on Afghan roads. Our smug engine had no breakdown though we did suffer four punctures, which even the best bred tanker could not avoid on such a surface, but each time the wheels were changed with disgusting speed, giving me no opportunity to see what lay beyond the nearest hill. Russians use a newfangled thing called a ‘jack’; Afghans, on the other hand, dig a hole in the road beneath the relevant wheel …",

Given the climate of New England, it was unlikely to have been late November. In any case, for the next 242 years Thanksgiving as an event was hardly noted. The first official celebration wasn’t held until 1863—and then in August, of all months. The next year President Abraham Lincoln moved it arbitrarily to the fourth Thursday in November—no one seems to recall now why a Thursday, or why so late in the year—and there it has stayed ever since.",

This estate was established in 1863 by Joseph Baynes, on 24,000 of the region’s most fertile acres; Mr Baynes, we gather, travelled cabin class. Next came miles of canefields and dairy pastures and then, near Pietermaritzburg, I passed thousands of shacks crowded on a wide mountainside which may or may not be fertile – there is no space left for cultivation. Speeding down the final slope – Natal’s capital lies in a hollow surrounded by high wooded hills – I noted a penumbra of pollution. Yet cities do have their compensations, like the Africana second-hand bookshop, my first halt. There I lost all self-control and a large parcel of rare vols is now on its way to Ireland.",

If we could climb over one of these roofs we should have crossed the two lines of barbed wire at a single bound. In May 1943 we had completed all our preparations. Money, provisions, compass, watches, shoes and a small mountaineer’s tent were all ready.",

The canyon was not wide, it was a ditch, a gutter, it soared, swooping, the pristine snow scarred and blemished by and dwarfing the shaft entrance, the refuse dump, the few buildings; beyond the canyon rims the actual unassailable peaks rose, cloud-ravelled in some incredible wind, on the dirty sky.",

But then Syd and Steve had warned me about Giardia on the first day; that amoebalike parasite that causes terrible diarrhea and dehydration. That was the last thing I needed up here, away from any doctor or medical assistance and without insurance. Shit. I scrunched up in the shade of the boulder waiting for Syd, my mouth as dry as sanded wood.",

It was a scorched river bed filled with white-hot sand, rimmed with dense mesquite and cactus. Every kilometer the hidden river showed itself for a little space, only to disappear at a crackling white rim of alkali.\nFirst came the horse pool, the troopers and their wretched ponies gathered around it; one or two squatting on the rim, scooping water up against the animals’ sides with calabashes.... Above them kneeled the women at their eternal laundry on the stones. Beyond that the ancient path from the hacienda cut across, where the never-ending line of black-shawled women moved with water-jars on their heads. Still farther up were women bathers, wrapped round and round with yards of pale blue or white cotton, and naked brown babies splashing in the shallows. And, last of all, naked brown men, with sombreros on and bright-colored serapes draped over their shoulders, smoked their hojas, squatting on the rocks. We flushed a coyote up there, and scrambled steeply up to the desert, pulling at our revolvers. There he went! We spurred into the chaparral on the dead run, shooting and yelling. But of course he got away. And later, much later, we found the mythical pool—a cool, deep basin worn in the solid rock, with green weeds growing on the bottom.",

The aliens went to their cabin, picking their way across the lower deck and up the iron stairs into the stern; she was seasick, but it only made her quieter; it didn’t alter her beautiful sensuous receptivity. The agent sang The Old Homeland again—‘Far across the sea, I wonder will they pray for me’—and everyone felt English and exiled and wistful, everyone except Younger, who climbed carefully up the stairs, clinging to the banister: ‘I’m going home by rail.’ He was more English than any of them; the north country was in his heart; he was firmly local and unsentimental and bawdy and honest. He drank because he needed a holiday, because he had heavy work before him on the Coast, because he loved his wife and had desperate anxieties. He had more cause to drink than anyone. The boom years were in his heavy flesh and his three chins; one couldn’t at first sight tell how the depression lay like lead in his stomach. If one were to paint his portrait in the old style of tiny landscapes and Tuscan towns, one would have given him as background an abandoned blast-furnace or the girders of a great bridge left a perch for birds.",

He tramped back and forth, glancing into the ruddy windows, into the waiting room where the cheerful groups in their furs and overcoats gesticulated with festive though soundless animation, and into the colored waiting room, whose occupants sat patiently and murmurously about the stove in the dingy light. As he turned here a voice spoke diffidently from the shadow beside the door. “Chris’mus gif’, boss.” He took a coin from his pocket without stopping. Again from the square a firecracker exploded heavily, and above the trees a rocket arced, hung for a moment, then opened like a fist, spreading its golden and fading fingers upon the tranquil indigo sky without a sound.",

I enjoyed being fussed over, injured but nonchalant. Once, I recall, I even got a perverse pleasure from being accidentally burned by another mother’s cigarette while riding in a boat. The attention, the remorse—the pain was worth it to me. Where did that guiltmongering little killjoy come from? He’s with me still, no doubt, but as I entered my teens I suddenly moved on, psychically, from my family. Tripping back down the trail at Waimea in swimsuits, I knew we looked like six kindred souls, blood-tied, a brood, but I felt like the odd one out. A cold gust of pubescent separation seemed to have caught me prematurely. Of course, when I dove face first into a coral head—this happened the following summer, at Waikiki—it was still my mother to whom I was carried, and she who took me to get sewn up.",

    "target_paragraph": "Yet, observed Orwell elsewhere, no matter how racist the British were, they were still able to enjoy relations with Burmese women. While the Burmese could not walk through the door of the European-only clubs, Burmese women were warmly welcomed into British bedrooms. In the early days of the British colony, many British civil servants enjoyed Burmese ‘keeps’, or girlfriends they kept in their houses. The practice was so common that illegitimate children of British subjects were provided for under the education code, with government grants given to any ‘European child under 18 years of age whose father is dead or has left the country or cannot be found’. By the time Orwell arrived in Burma, however, the British government was actively discouraging such liaisons, and distributed circulars warning civil servants against the ‘practice of co-habiting with native girls, or accepting them as presents’. The names of two horses raced at the Rangoon Turf Club around that time give some idea of how the circulars were received: ‘Government Circular’ versus ‘Physiological Necessity’.",

Each morning before daybreak, I drag my down parka into my sleeping bag to warm it, then sit up in meditation posture and perform a sutra chanting service for perhaps forty-five minutes, including the sutra dedicated to Kannon or Avalokita, and the Heart Sutra (the “heart” of the mighty Prajna Paramita Sutra that lies at the base of Mahayana Buddhism). This morning service is lent dignity by a clay ts’a ts’a Buddha taken from the piles of these small icons that litter the stupas at Ring-mo—that it may be “B’on” seems of small importance. I place the figure outside the tent on an altar of flat stone, where it will receive the first of the eastern light, down the White river, and I sit bundled up just inside the flap, for at this hour the temperature is never more than −12° Centigrade. Sometimes I am joined for morning service by a hardy little bird that dwells in the brush piles on the roof of the pink stone house behind the tent. With flicking tail, it hunts among the dung chips near the Buddha; the bill is slim in a pale-gray head, and it has a rufous breast and a white belly. This is the robin accentor (Prunella).",

Brossard, Rond-point de l'Avenue de St.-Cloud; or, as it is called now, Avenue du Bois de Boulogne—or, as it was called during the Second Empire, Avenue du Prince Impérial, or else de l'Impératrice; I'm not sure.\nThere is not much stability in such French names, I fancy; but their sound is charming, and always gives me the nostalgia of Paris—Royal Paris, Imperial Paris, Republican Paris! . . . whatever they may call it ten or twelve years hence. Paris is always Paris, and always will be, in spite of the immortal Haussmann, both for those who love it and for those who don't.\nAll the four windows were open. Two of them, freely and frankly, on to the now deserted play-ground, admitting the fragrance of lime and syringa and lilac, and other odors of a mixed quality.\nTwo other windows, defended by an elaborate network of iron wire and a formidable array of spiked iron rails beyond, opened on to the Rond-point, or meeting of the cross-roads—one of which led northeast to Paris through the Arc de Triomphe; the other three through woods and fields and country lanes to such quarters of the globe as still remain. The world is wide.\nIn the middle of this open space a stone fountain sent up a jet of water three feet high, which fell back with a feeble splash into the basin beneath. There was comfort in the sound on such a hot day, and one listened for it half unconsciously; and tried not to hear, instead, Weber's \"Invitation à la Valse,\" which came rippling in intermittent waves from the open window of the distant parloir, where Chardonnet was practising the piano.\n\"Tum-te-dum-tum-tum . . .\nTum-te-dum-di, diddle-iddle um!\"",

I was anxious to get to land and very edgy. What if the island we were approaching wasn’t St. Thomas? Ever so slowly the sun rose and, after having chewed my fingernails to the quick, I became more certain. Finally, the indistinguishable lump of land on the horizon separated into the fringing islets that were identifiable on the chart. The new agony of it all was that we were approaching nirvana at only three miles per hour! I could have walked faster than Varuna was sailing and I felt like jumping off the boat and running over the water to land.",
