In 1851 he climbed it successfully, and with considerably less discomfort than his hero, Auldjo. Smith’s ascent, as we know, became the subject of his best-selling show, which opened in London in March 1853. News of the mountain also spread to America, and among those who read the account of Smith’s ascent, and his theatrical descriptions of the incomparable view from the summit, was Henry Bean, who, on 5 September 1870, accompanied by his American friend Mr Randall, a Scots Reverend named George MacCorkendale, three porters and five guides, started his ascent of Mont Blanc.",

No, sir!’ He shook his head grimly. ‘Now, I didn’t practise medicine for forty years without finding out something about colds! Now, I don’t care anything about your Inhalos or Breathos or Spray-Your-Throatos, or whatever they may call ’em – any of those newfangled remedies. The only way to get rid of a cold is to have a thorough cleaning-out, and the only way to get a thorough cleaning-out is to dose yourself with castor oil, the way I told you to. – Now you can do as you please,’ he said sourly, with a constricted pressure of his thin convex mouth, ‘it’s no business of mine what you do – if you want to run the risk of coming down with pneumonia it’s your own affair – but if you want to get over that cold you’ll take my advice.’",

Men wore cotton or linen, suits tailored for the tropics. Women dressed as they would for a transatlantic crossing, with sufficient outfits to allow them to change several times a day, along with extravagant hats adorned with flowers, silk gloves, fans, and umbrellas for the sun. Each man carried aboard a small leather case containing grooming essentials: hair tonic, cologne, and scented powders. Women brought their own feather pillows and linen sheets, along with several pairs of white shoes, all oversized, for a lady’s feet were certain to swell in tierra caliente. The steamboat captains, as García Márquez wrote, were larger than life, firm and steady, impeccably dressed, with the strength of roots and a pronounced weakness for wildlife. They towered over the vessel, just as the giant ceibas rose above the riverbanks, the one forest tree, sacred to all the ancestors, that never fell to the woodsman’s ax.",

On the outskirts of every agony sits some observant fellow who points; who whispers as he whispered to me that summer morning in the house where the corn comes up to the window, “The willow grows on the turf by the river.

I order a Crispy Pork and Kale, a classic basic, but it arrives as Soggy Pork Fat and Raw Garlic Salad with Uncooked Kale Stems Like Wood. It’s only later I see on her counter of ingredients a large peeled aubergine covered in a carpet of ants. This is obviously after I’ve eaten as much as I can. Mama is surly at the stone mortar and pestle, pounding garlic like it’s her ex-husband’s face. Finally they remember that I ordered a beer, and it arrives, on ice, which I’ve never tried. The tin was in the window, and is seeringly hot. Beer on ice kind of works, in a diluted, sudsy way. I’d have drunk anything at that point.",

Blue and white are the celestial colors of the B’on sky god, who is seen as an embodiment of space and light, and creatures of the upper air become B’on symbols—the griffon, the mythical garuda, and the dragon. For Buddhist Tibetans, prayer flags and wind-bells confide spiritual longings to the winds, and the red kites that dance on holidays over the old brown city of Kathmandu are of Tibetan origin as well. There is also a custom called “air burial,” in which the body of the deceased is set out on a wild crag such as this one, to be rended and devoured by the wild beasts; when only the bones are left, these are broken and ground down to powder, then mixed into lumps of dough, to be set out again for passing birds. Thus all is returned into the elements, death into life.",

With a design inspired by Chinese woodcuts, images first brought to Europe by the Portuguese, they ordered the construction of massive dugouts, carved from ceiba trunks twelve to twenty-six yards in length. To these, they added additional wooden side boards to increase capacity, and awnings woven from palm fronds to provide shelter from the elements. Capable of carrying as much as thirty tons of cargo, both passengers and freight, these champanes—the name was a Spanish iteration of the Chinese word sampan—were the main form of transport on the Magdalena for 250 years. Each required a crew of ten to eighteen, men of enormous strength who, working together with poles and paddles, could fight the current, pushing aside the river to make their way upstream, dragging the weight of elephants in their wake.",

At the customs desk in the airport, mobs collided, calumnies were exchanged, forms were flung this way and that, hapless passengers were obliged to declare their pencils and their shoelaces. I stumbled out of the customs hall and a Tourist Burma official loomed before me to make an opening bid on my whiskey and cigarettes. By his side, a little girl started bargaining for my duty-free bag—not whiskey, not cigarettes, just the bag. After haggling in several currencies with an amused old man, I stepped into a 1952 English Tomahawk already occupied by two dazed British punks, and we lurched spasmodically toward the capital. Herbie Goes Bananas was playing at one cinema, and The Terror of Mechagodzilla at another. Inside the Strand, a blackboard apologized for the absence of all hot water this week. An ancient porter gave me a key ring, and it fell apart in my hands. I inserted the key into the lock, and the whole contraption got stuck.",

A barmaid carrying a tray of drinks offered me a Flügel, a small glass bottle of poison decorated with neon colours and googly cartoon eyes, which I drank quickly and regretted immediately. Then came a boswandeling (‘forest walking’) shot, a milky fruit liqueur served in a thin plastic thimble, which I proceeded to spill down the front of my tiger suit.

She felt as if she had somehow failed him and herself by allowing his mother’s behavior to upset her. She should be above it; she should shrug it off as the ranting of a village woman; she should not keep thinking of all the retorts she could have made instead of just standing mutely in that kitchen. But she was upset, and made even more so by Odenigbo’s expression, as if he could not believe she was not quite as high-minded as he had thought. He was making her feel small and absurdly petulant and, worse yet, she suspected he was right. She always suspected he was right. For a brief irrational moment, she wished she could walk away from him. Then she wished, more rationally, that she could love him without needing him. Need gave him power without his trying; need was the choicelessness she often felt around him.",

    "target_paragraph": "After siesta, we walk to the fourteenth-century fortezza, now a fantastic enoteca. In the old lower part, which used to store crossbows and arrows, cannons and gunpowder, all the wines of the area are available for tasting. It’s brilliantly sunny outside. In the fortezza, the light is dim, the stone walls musky and cool. Vivaldi is playing while we try a couple of good whites from Banfi and Castelgiocondo vineyards. Appropriately, the music changes to Brahms as we taste the dark Brunellos from several vineyards: Il Poggiolo, Case Basse, and the granddaddy of all Brunello, Biondi. Brilliant, totally evolved wines that make me want to rush to a kitchen and prepare the kind of hearty food they deserve. I can’t wait to cook for these wines—rabbit roasted with balsamic vinegar and rosemary, chicken with forty cloves of garlic, pears simmered in wine and served with mascarpone. The man serving us insists that we try some dessert wines. We fall for one called simply “B” and another Moscadello from Tenuta Il Poggione. The enologist must have been a former perfume maker. No dessert would be needed with these, except perhaps a white peach, just ripe. On second thought, a lemon soufflé might be just the touch of heaven. Or my old Southern favorite, crème brûlée. We buy a few bottles of the luxurious Brunellos. Just the memory of the price at home makes us indulgent. At Bramasole, we have good wine storage in two spaces under the stone stairs. We can shove cases in, lock the door, and start taking them out in a few years. Since long-term planning is not a strong suit of either of us, we buy a couple of cases of less costly Rosso di Montalcino, drinkable now, in fact, smooth and full bodied. I doubt if the dessert wines will be around by the end of summer.",

Its course must be a well-kept secret, hidden somewhere in the crevices between the city’s squat little skyscrapers of smoked glass and steel.\nIn this high room, with the expensive air conditioner breathing hardly louder than a sleeping child, I felt I was as far from my river as I’d ever been. My morning orange juice stood islanded in a silver tureen of crushed ice. I propped Parkman up against it and went back to my favorite bit, where La Salle, Tonto and Father Hennepin see the Mississippi for the first time.\nThe travelers resumed their journey … and soon reached the dark and inexorable river, so long the object of their search, rolling, like a destiny, through its realms of solitude and shade.",

Long ago he left a mouldering Big House in Co. Cork and he has done well for himself in Natal. He excoriated the media. They report local black-on-black violence as happening in Richmond. It’s not happening in Richmond, it’s happening in Richmond’s townships. But the media can’t spell those names so they say ‘Richmond’. Consequently, property prices have halved and the two hotels have closed. Then there’s the drought. When they can’t cultivate, farmers find it’s best to go on long holidays to cheap Mauritius instead of staying in expensive South Africa. Many have sold their livestock and are giving all their water to the orange orchards. But the ’93 crop is dwarfed – unsellable. This victim of drought has just returned from a three-month holiday on Mauritius.",

I had just crossed the last of these when Marchese slipped and fell into the water—luckily on top of the trunks, or he would otherwise have been carried away by the torrent. Wet to the skin and completely exhausted he could not be induced to go on. I urged him to move at least into cover, but he just spread out his wet things to dry and started to light a fire.

Fried fish, rice, rum, bread, coffee, wet sugar for the coffee, fowl, and what not. A sizable tarpaulin had been stretched on tall poles from one house wall. Chairs and boxes were spaced around the edge of the covered area and boards were laid between these to make plenty of seats. A small deal table was in the center and a four-spouted naked light hung directly over the table. There was a chair for the leader when the time should arrive for him to “track out” the hymn for the rest to sing. The beginning of everything was there, but nothing had shaped up yet. I went inside to pay my respects to the widow.",
