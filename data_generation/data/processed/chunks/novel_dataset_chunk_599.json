He became first mayor of Northampton; then a member of the Massachusetts legislature, the General Court; then lieutenant governor; and finally, in 1918, governor. In all positions, he distinguished himself by his diligence, his thrift, and his parsimony of speech, attributes that endeared him to New Englanders. His personal frugality was legendary. In 1906, he moved with Grace into a modest rented duplex on Massasoit Street in Northampton and remained in modest rented premises for the rest of his life.",

As soon as he left my room, that “bit of shelter,” he would take his place in the ranks, and begin the journey towards the bottomless pit. I at least had no illusions; but it was I, too, who a moment ago had been so sure of the power of words, and now was afraid to speak, in the same way one dares not move for fear of losing a slippery hold. It is when we try to grapple with another man’s intimate need that we perceive how incomprehensible, wavering, and misty are the beings that share with us the sight of the stars and the warmth of the sun. It is as if loneliness were a hard and absolute condition of existence; the envelope of flesh and blood on which our eyes are fixed melts before the outstretched hand, and there remains only the capricious, unconsolable, and elusive spirit that no eye can follow, no hand can grasp. It was the fear of losing him that kept me silent, for it was borne upon me suddenly and with unaccountable force that should I let him slip away into the darkness I would never forgive myself.",

Mandalay New Town wasn’t too different from Mandalay itself: wide streets, lots of motorcycles and exposed holes in cement drains covered by wooden slats, with poorer people bathing in the public ablution stations on street corners. The summers were scorching; the rainy seasons muggy and plagued with mosquitoes.",

August, in his relief, was a changed creature. He was voluble and loud as I never could have believed. Jumping off his box to turn the horses round and help me out of the cart, he explained to me and to all and any who chose to listen how he had driven on and on through Putbus, straight round the circus to the continuation of the road on the north side, where sign-posts revealed to him that he was heading for Bergen, more and more surprised at receiving no orders, more and more struck by the extreme silence behind him. 'The gracious one,' he amplified for the benefit of the deeply-interested tourists, 'exchanges occasional observations with Fräulein'—the tourists gazed at Gertrud—'and the cessation of these became by degrees noticeable. Yet it is not permissible that a well-trained coachman should turn to look, or interfere with a Herrschaft that chooses to be silent——'",

I was particularly taken with an inflatable companion called the Aphrodite, which sold for 129 marks. The photograph on the front was of a delectably attractive brunette in a transparent negligee. Either this was cruelly misleading or they have made more progress with vinyl in recent years than I had realized.",

Either way, he never made an attempt to become human (although in a strange moment of voyeurism he was caught peeking at a female staff member as she showered), and the troop didn’t seem to ostracize him.

    "target_paragraph": "It is amazingly easy in Australia to forget, or at least to reduce to a dim awareness, that there is a world out there. Australians work hard in their news coverage to overcome the handicap of distance, but even so sometimes around the margins of the news you get a curious sense of disconnectedness—little things that remind you that this is a far, far country. I had noticed, for instance, that Australian newspapers commonly run obituaries, particularly of foreign figures, weeks and even sometimes months after they die. That’s fair enough in a sense, I suppose—these people are going to be dead forever, after all—but it does lend the pages a curiously leisured air. Then the previous day on my flight from Melbourne to Sydney, while browsing through a copy of the Bulletin, the country’s venerable newsmagazine, I read a section called “Flashback,” which recorded important events in history on that week’s dates. For January 22 it had this interesting entry: “1934: Actor Bill Bixby (died 1993) is born in Park Ridge, Illinois, US.”",

I remembered it as being green and somewhat weedy, with apartment buildings and tall fir trees rising from the undergrowth. That was in August. Now, a thick snow mantle subdued the “science city,” rendered it into a sharply focused two-tone photograph, made it look reasoned and disciplined. At a T intersection where a street met an avenue, the bus stopped and began to idle. The driver leaned back and lit another cigarette, blue lassos of smoke snaking around his rearview mirror, while all the twenty-somethings piled out. I figured this must be the center of town. The snow here had a packed-down, much-trodden patina and people were hurrying past, pushing kids in strollerlike conveyances that had sled runners instead of wheels. A group of boys, all of them about nine or ten years old, horsed around while waiting for their mothers to pick them up.",

I head there late, delayed both by the thought that I might make some friends if I let others go first and by a strange inability to find my hand towel in my duffel. By the time I walk in, it’s clear no one else felt so constrained. The intoxicating steam billowing from completed showers is enough to make me tipsy. It is also proof that most of the fifty-six other females still on the Rally have already partaken of the joys of hot water. Rarely in my life have I disrobed faster. Clutching my modest travel towel to my even more modest chest, I abandon my dusty cargo pants on a bench and scamper down the slimy corridor, and I enter the first shower stall I come to.",

A shortcut landed him in a stretch of mesquite and zacahuistle that Mexicans called El Desierto de los Muertos— the Desert of the Dead—but King was smitten by its many white-tailed deer and javelina. Sources vary on how he actually acquired the land that eventually became the largest ranch in the world, but many say he rounded up help by venturing into the hills of Tamaulipas, Mexico, and convincing an entire village to join him. According to legend, one hundred men, women, and children gathered up their cattle and burros and followed him across the border. My great-great-grandfather on my mother’s side was among them and soon became one of the proud Kineños who braved fires, floods, droughts, cactus, rattlesnakes, and the burning sun as they branded, castrated, inoculated, fed, and bred horses and cattle for their (gringo) patrón. In return, the patrón paid for their families’ housing and medical care, provided their children’s schooling, and distributed rations of beans, rice, and masa. Kids learned their trades from their parents as soon as they were physically able; the elderly were allowed to remain on the ranch until their final breath. And that is how the medieval fiefdom existed for generations.",
