Preheat oven to 375°F and grease a medium-sized muffin pan or line it with muffin papers.\n2. Combine dry ingredients and set aside.\n3. Beat egg with oil, sugar, and mashed papaya and banana in a large bowl.\n4. Mix in dry ingredients and walnuts (if using). Scoop mixture into prepared muffin pan. Bake in preheated oven for 18–23 minutes, until toothpick inserted in the middle of a muffin comes out clean.\nMakes 1 dozen\nTips\n• If the papaya is quite ripe, it will yield a lot of liquid when mashed. Drain off this excess liquid before adding the fruit.\n• You can make the muffins entirely with papaya if you like; just increase the quantity to 1 1⁄2 cups. The muffins will have a slightly moister texture and a flatter top.",

He paused in silence before heaving a sigh and coming to a halt. Not a soul emerged, but a door opened and a red carpet rolled out like a tongue cooling off on the platform. The hijras’ over-plucked eyebrows arched with curiosity. Whispers passed between the group and their earrings swung as they craned their necks to steal a glimpse through the blacked-out windows. Worried that the train might creep away with the stealth of its arrival, we gathered our things, much to the hijras’ distress, and picked our way through their outstretched arms, accompanied by their yells. Another door swung open and a head appeared, fitted with a boat-shaped hat, stolen from a mediaeval queen. Benoy, it turned out, was our personal butler for the next seven days.",

There he sat, behind his sempiternal cigar, glowering into the tender spaces of the sky as if what he saw there were an offense to the human race; yet Halo wondered if one could say of those small deep-sunk eyes, forever watchful behind their old-fashioned pince-nez, that anything they rested on escaped them. Probably not; for in certain ways he was sensitive to beauty, and not afraid of it, like Lorry. Only, to move him, it had to be beauty of man’s making, something wrung by human genius out of the stubborn elements. The sunset and the woodlands were nothing to him if they had not fed a poet or a painter--a poet preferably. Frenside had often said to Halo: “No, my child; remember I’m not a vegetarian--never could digest raw landscape.” But that did not mean that he did not see it, did not parcel it out into its component parts with those cool classifying eyes. George Frenside was aware of most things; little escaped him of the cosmic spectacle. Only for him the beauty of the earth was something you could take apart, catalogue, and pigeonhole, and not the enveloping harmony it was to the girl who sat beside him looking out on the sunset opalescence at their feet.",

We made it to Fajardo and the Sunbay Marina welcomed us, where we docked, cleaned the boat, and waited for the customs officials.\nWhen they arrived, they were pleasant, but took away all of our fresh fruit. I was surprised that they were wearing United States Customs and Border Patrol uniforms, and I was further surprised that I was checking back into the United States. After they left, Robin took down the customary yellow flag and replaced it with an American flag. Of course, Puerto Rico is an American territory and none of this should have surprised me.\nWe now had access to showers, laundry facilities, dry land, a town, neighbors to talk to, and more SCUBA-diving opportunities.",

Gabe and I took notes on the work expectations, tasks inconceivable to backcountry traildogs whose Glacier repertoire consisted of maintenance more than construction and rarely required a Skil saw, let alone a backhoe. The shovel-pulaski era seemed long gone, leaving us, after all these years, beginners again. The first weeks of work blended novelty and nostalgia and we thrived on the fast pace of large-scale construction while longing for those quiet, long-mile, backcountry days. Lunch breaks at alpine lakes? No way. Instead we lounged on the loader’s giant tires and slumped atop the Knaack box, more like a construction crew with minicoolers and Cokes than a trail crew with CamelBaks and trail mix. The Denali gang was union equipment operators and recent local high school grads, a potent blend of handy and clueless. Alec was the only other classic “traildog,” a seven-year veteran of Rocky, a hiking park with rockwork and alpine vistas, like Glacier. We bonded, of course.",

(I’ve had the most adorable lizard on my wall all day – he makes a very companionable sound as he scampers up and down industriously catching flies – so hygienic of him!) I was given tea and Marie biscuits – made in Karachi – by the second-hand clothes merchant, while he sent his peon off with my boots to be resoled. Thick new soles cost only 2s. and I got a second-hand khaki shirt for 3s. On arriving back here I was absolutely soaked; the rain has been coming down persistently all day.",

With his impressive 2-metre tall, muscular physique he was, quite literally, the largest man I had ever shaken hands with. He immediately inspired a deep sense of confidence and calm in our team. I had been a little anxious on the flight there, given it was my first time to Greenland, and because I really didn’t know what to expect. But now, seeing Bo made me relax. I could sense his protectiveness and an overwhelming feeling of trust enveloped me. I understood that we were in very good hands.

Burma has a rich supply of natural oil, and under the colonial government, which constructed oilfields in the flat, dry central plains, it was the second biggest producer of oil in the British Empire. Crude oil was sailed downriver to Syriam for processing into kerosene and engine fuel. The landscape was dotted with towering chimneys emitting black clouds of smoke. The area was also marked by a large population of American oil-drillers. One British policeman who was in Burma at that time recorded with displeasure the presence of these Americans and the filthy language they insisted on using. The Americans were always popping up in his crime files: he found one driller causing a commotion in a car with a prostitute, and had to deal with another who accused a policeman of stealing a watch that had simply been misplaced.",

But Undine, still hopeful of leaving West End Avenue, had heroically resisted the suggestion, and contented herself with the renewal of the curtains and carpet, and the purchase of some fragile gilt chairs which, as she told Ralph, would be “so much to the good” when they moved—the explanation, as she made it, seemed an additional evidence of her thrift.",

They do not, however, smile.\nIn Europe these islands would be openly gracious. There would be a plaza or a piazza or a plaka; there would be something more genial about them. Japanese geniality is of a different sort. It is more private. Nothing is shown openly. The house front is closed, the face is blank. Once past this, once inside, then true friendliness begins. Only in the bar, the restaurant, the hotel, the home, and only after you are identified and committed—only then do geniality, hospitality begin.\nJapan is not a place strangers easily enter—no matter the charm of the islands, the grace of the people. There is no tradition of anything but a politely hidden suspicion of the unknown wanderer. To be anonymous is, in Japan, to be nothing. Only after your name, occupation, family, history are known do you become real.",

Now on the walks I took I saw geographic features up and down the coast that had always been obscured by clouds before. The only problem was the cold. It froze my pen tip when I tried to sketch or make notes, and if the wind caught me square in the face it almost flash-froze my eyes. Wednesday dawned completely cloudless and ten below. I called Eric Penttila at nine o’clock and he was still waiting for a weather report. In fifteen minutes he called back and said the weather would be clear all day, so he guessed he was going. This development annoyed him in the extreme. “Nobody should even be living out on that rock,” he said. “We maintain those idiots out there. They ought to abandon that ridiculous place and move back to the mainland. They always need help and we’re always ferrying people out there to help them. Today I’m taking a nun and a social worker and a physical therapist and I don’t know who else, all to help those idiots out there.”",

For a moment, for one brief, shining moment, Elvis floated effortlessly in mid-air. His only connection to the ground was the one hand that was holding the side of the ladder. To make the scene even more amazing, Elvis held the pole in his other hand. He was “Defying Gravity.” The Flying Wallendas could not have done better.

The Caledonia slips through the grey water and sea mists of the English Channel, skirts the Iberian peninsula, then rounds the Rock of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean. It threads the needle of the Suez Canal at night: the water so still and dark it seems more like a geological feature, a seam of graphite clamped between the layers of the desert.
