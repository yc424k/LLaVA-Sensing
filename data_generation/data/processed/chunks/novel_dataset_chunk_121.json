It was almost entirely home-made with no cover on the engine and no doors or windows. You could read on the ceiling inside that it was constructed partly from wooden boxes in which something had been imported from the USSR. The wheels had belonged to a truck and were far too big for the body and the seats were planks across which you scrambled to get to your place as no space was wasted on an aisle down the middle. The bus had been so overcrowded on leaving Herat that my entry made no difference to the general misery (not that the Afghans seemed to regard it as misery) of being tightly wedged with nothing to lean on back or front and no chance to move an inch in any direction once you sat down. Eventually at 11 a.m. we set off and about ten miles from Robat the road petered out – not merely the good road, but any road at all. For the next two hours we bumped on over the hard rock and baked sand of the desert till the faintest trace of a track reappeared – which was worse than the desert. In the agony of the journey I’d forgotten to wonder why we were being compelled to travel in convoy but towards evening we passed a Land-Rover with its windshield shattered and its doors riddled by bullet-holes and two soldiers on guard.",

This absence of what would normally be considered a necessity in any civilized country went on for several months straight and then occurred periodically for the rest of my stay. Having already had a no-water experience without any notification in my apartment near the train station, I was already aware of the city’s insufficient supply. The secretary at my school told me that, as a child, she felt a kinship with America’s Wild West. Pans and buckets of water were filled and saved for necessary washing and toilet flushing. I, too, learned to be prepared, although I did find myself washing my hair in a salad bowl filled with bottled water on a few occasions.",

The old spell had been broken, at times, or seemed to be. But it always lay there, under the surface, dormant but undestroyed while I knocked around the far world, living in waveless places—Montana, London, New York. I remembered the first time I accompanied Mark up the Mendocino coast, shortly after moving to San Francisco. The swell was big and scary, with a numbing northwest wind ruining every spot except Point Arena Cove, which was protected by a thick kelp bed. I nervously followed Mark out through the channel there, intimidated by the wind, the freezing water, and, especially, by the heavy-gauge waves plunging and grinding down the rock reef. Mark threw himself into the fray, surfing aggressively, and I gradually moved farther out along the reef, taking off on bigger and bigger waves. Finally, I took off on a very big wave, and nearly fell when the nose of my board caught a piece of chop on the takeoff. I recovered, barely, and managed to make the wave. Afterward, Mark, who had seen that takeoff from the channel, said he had actually been frightened for me. “That would have been really, really bad if you hadn’t made it,” he said. “That wave was a solid ten feet, and the only thing that got you down that face was twenty years of experience.” It was true that I had been surfing on pure instinct at that point, too intent to be scared, although the hold-downs out on that part of the reef did look to be brutally long. It was embarrassing to admit it but Mark’s assessment pleased me deeply. I was trying to figure out how to live with the disabling enchantment of surfing—and with Mark’s efforts to weave the spell tighter—but he had said a lot of things, I realized, that I found gratifying.",

Twice he had been ready to help her – to help her by loving her, as he had said – and if, the third time, he had seemed to fail her, whom but herself could she accuse? … Well, that part of her life was over; she did not know why her thoughts still clung to it. But the sudden longing to see him remained; it grew to hunger as she paused on the pavement opposite his door. The street was dark and empty, swept by the rain. She had a vision of his quiet room, of the bookshelves, and the fire on the hearth. She looked up and saw a light in his window; then she crossed the street and entered the house.",

School children greeted us with pennants, cheers and a song. Then there was another speech to villagers. We inspected a training camp, a barracks, classrooms. The signs said: “Warm Welcome to American News Reporters.” U.C. was outraged: he didn’t care what they called me but he was not a News Reporter. “Welcome American Friends Directing our Defective Points.” “It is good for closer relations of China and America, honoured visitors coming to see our country.” No other news reporters or foreigners had ever been here, nor had any of the military brass from Chungking. U.C. and I agreed that this was due to their good sense. Unlike us, they must have known about travel conditions in China and also how this war worked. Chiang’s armies served as a defensive rearguard but were nowhere engaged in driving the Japanese out of China. Without air support, there wasn’t much they could do even if the Japanese had been Chiang’s major concern.",

    "target_paragraph": "Harbor Mouth had a short, hollow right that got longer and more complicated as the surf got bigger and the takeoff moved farther out the reef. Still, it never got very complicated. It was a wave that one could get wired—could come to understand deeply—in a summer dedicated to the task. I loved it at five feet and up, when, with clean conditions, the outside wall presented a perfectly even face and people often got fooled, moving too deep or too far out on the shoulder, unsure where to take off. There was a deep spot from which a six-foot wave, caught early and ridden correctly, could nearly always be made, and I got to know where that was, even though it gave no visual clues. Harbor Mouth’s signal feature, though, its claim to whatever fame it had, was the end-section on the right (there were also longer, less shapely lefts, running away from the channel). It was a very short, thick, shallow, highly reliable chunk of wave that almost always stayed open. If you timed it right, that section was as close to a guaranteed barrel as any wave I’ve seen. Even at two feet, you could squeeze through it and come out dry. For the first time in my surf career, I became accustomed to the view from inside, looking out from behind a silver curtain toward the morning sun. I had sessions where I got tubed on half my rides. I would trot back to Kobatake’s, where Caryn was still asleep on our pallet on the floor, my brain aflame with eight or ten brief, sharp glimpses of eternity.",

He descended through the dry and invisible corn, keeping his bearing on a star until he reached the trees, against the black solidity of which fireflies winked and drifted and from beyond which came the booming and grunting of frogs and the howling of the dog. But once among them, he could not even see the sky anymore, though he realised then what he should have before: that the hound’s voice would guide him. So he followed it, slipping and plunging in the mud and tripping and thrashing among the briers and tangled undergrowth and blundering against invisible tree trunks, his arm crooked to shield his face, sweating, while the steady cries of the dog drew nearer and nearer and broke abruptly off in mid-howl. He believed for an instant that he actually saw the phosphorescent glints of eyes although he had no light to reflect them, and suddenly and without knowing that he was going to do it, he ran toward where he had seen the eyes. He struck the next tree a shocking blow with his shoulder; he was hurled sideways but caught balance again, still plunging forward, his hands extended. He was falling now. If there’s a tree in front of me now, he thought, it will be all. He actually touched the dog. He felt its breath and heard the click of its teeth as it slashed at him, springing away, leaving him on his hands and knees in the mud while the noise of its invisible flight crashed and ceased.",

I never looked behind, having once warned Rachel to keep close to the cliff. (She has a perverse tendency to walk along the edge of precipices, no doubt the better to savour the depths below.) At the head of the ravine, where the path did a V-turn on to the snowy mountain, it was blocked by a small landslide. But the slope below the V-turn was of course not sheer and a dozen careful steps took us on to a path no longer crumbling but hair-raisingly slippy with frozen snow. Here I began to have nasty feelings in the pit of my stomach and these did not abate when we turned a corner to find a forty-yard avalanche sprawled across the path. By now the drop was again sheer but the yak’s deep, definite prints were our salvation. Actually the sloping mass of snow was quite firm and safe, though it looked as if it were about to go thundering down into that unbelievable chasm. Soon we were climbing steeply and another hundred yards took us away from the ravine on to a plateau so high that it seemed almost level with the lonely peaks of the Ladak Range.",

A wedding present that he despised. And Mrs Satterthwaite, in negligé, but with an immense hat; reading The Times with an eternal rustle of leaves because she never could settle down to any one page; and Sylvia walking up and down because she could not sit still, with a piece of toast in her fingers or her hands behind her back. Very tall; fair; as graceful, as full of blood and as cruel as the usual degenerate Derby winner. Inbred for generations for one purpose: to madden men of one type … Pacing backwards and forwards, exclaiming: ‘I’m bored I Bored!’; sometimes even breaking the breakfast plates … And talking! For ever talking; usually, cleverly, with imbecility; with maddening inaccuracy; with wicked penetration, and clamouring to be contradicted; a gentleman has to answer his wife’s questions … And in his forehead the continual pressure; the determination to sit put; the decor of the room seeming to burn into his mind. It was there, shadowy before him now. And the pressure upon his forehead …",

As soon as the girl is close enough, Coco launches off Agustino. Somehow the girl manages to catch him in her stride and, as the two monkeys jostle jealously for space, grunting angrily at each other, she doesn’t break pace.

We stood in a vestibule near an open window, next to a group of teenage boys who joked and laughed among themselves the whole way. The train moved slowly, in fits and starts, which gave us time to inspect the neighborhood. The roads, by then, were jammed with traffic, and the sidewalks were busy, too. Vendors crowded the platforms at some of the busier stations. I counted a few bookstalls and clothiers among them. We traveled several miles, and then the tram slowed and ground its wheels as we rounded a bend. Suddenly, the tram stopped. We waited there, unmoving, for several minutes. The tram was not yet in a station – nobody moved. In time, a few restless passengers slipped off the train, through the open doors. As time wore on, more and more passengers climbed down. They marched in ones and twos along a dirt path between the track and a stone wall. We jumped off the tram and followed the line to a busy square. We couldn’t tell where we were, and our map was of no use. We never found Victoria Station, but, after a few wrong turns, we did find the Corniche and our hotel.",

That boulevard, the 26 July highway, carried traffic between Cairo and Giza, and, for the first time since we stepped foot on Gezirah, we were surrounded by noise and exhaust. But we found Diwan, on the far side of the road, as promised, near Maison Thomas, a famous pizzeria. The shop was small and cramped and perfect in every way. The shelves and tables were stuffed and piled with books in every language. We found the travel section right away, but there too, the guidebooks served every country except Egypt. I asked the clerk if there were any other bookstores nearby. “Yes,” he said, but his command of English was not much better than my command of Arabic, so our conversation degraded after that. Teresa unfolded our map and showed it to the clerk. He inspected the map, scratched his chin, and frowned. Suddenly, the clerk stood up and shouted, “University!” I’m not sure what he said after that, but he pointed in the air and waved this way and that way till I was sure that he was giving directions. He walked us to the door and pointed down the road. Whatever else he may have said, it seemed that we were supposed to walk that way, across the island.",

Monks and holy men were thought of as ‘prize-fighters’ against the Devil’s minions, and only with their help – and their amulets, relics and remedies – could demons be fought or defeated. Across the east Mediterranean that tradition still continues: to this day Christian monks are believed to be powerful exorcists, a talent they share with their Islamic counterparts, the Muslim Sufi mystics.",

In the museum at San Pedro they had a mummy, labelled Miss Chile; even her long dark hair was intact. The museum made me feel I could walk out into the desert, dig my fingers a few inches into the warm sand and pull out a broken cup or a human bone. The arid sands struck an odd contrast with the rich treasures they yielded. There was a statue outside the museum of the grand master of Atacaman archaeology, the Belgian Jesuit Gustav Le Paige (he was a dead ringer for Gordon Jackson from the television series Upstairs, Downstairs), and alongside a paean to his life’s work I read that the Atacameño were agriculturalists and herders, oppressed by other tribes prior to the Conquest. Their little-studied language, Kunza, was spoken up until the end of the last century.",

The raft’s condition seems generally good, although the tent leaks through the observation port when nearby waves break. One night we shot down the front of a big roller, for several seconds sliding upon its tumbling foam as if we had fallen over a waterfall. Then last night we nearly capsized again. Everything is soaked. Today, though, a flat, hot sea surrounds me. The sun beats down on the wide expanse of this liquid frying pan and things begin to dry out once more. The sun and sedate sea are welcome.",

We had climbed steeply from our ledge to the carretera and could see it winding for miles across bare brown puna to an 11,000 foot pass. In one dip, we were startled to see our barefooted friends standing outside a derelict shack, looking towards us; evidently they had used some hidden redura. For the first time on this trek, I felt a twinge of apprehension. Meagre as our possessions are, by First World standards, to those two they must have seemed like fabled treasures of the Occident: padded flea-bags, husky suits space-blankets, a tent, binoculars – not to mention our mula bonito … And the four of us had the puna to ourselves; no dwellings, or shepherds, or horsemen were visible. As we drew level, one man stepped forward and abruptly asked for money. We stopped, and I explained that we had none – that’s why we were sleeping out on the mountain – we couldn’t go to a hotel without money – we were hoping to get some from a friend in Pomabamba … Both faces remained unnervingly impassive, but they must have believed me for they said no more. My story was plausible; we could hardly be mistaken for rich tourists, with our weather-blackened skins, sweat-stiffened hair, filthy clothes and disintegrating boots. Bidding them a cheerful ‘Adios!’, we continued at our normal pace. After a moment they began to follow us, so closely that we could hear their muttered arguing. ‘They’re probably deciding where to throw our bodies’, said Rachel with a macabre grin – the child reads far too many thrillers. I felt more relieved than I would admit when, at the pass, they turned west.",
