The detritus of construction work, sporting a stubble of drought-resistant weeds, lay piled between riven pavements and shop entrances. The electricity poles seemed to be lurching home from a drunken orgy; their tangled wires drooped low; no one could remember when electricity had last been available. By then the clouds had settled, immobile, above Hoima, forming a dark lid beneath which the heat felt like a sticky substance, impeding progress. The few visible locals were mostly young, male, not entirely sober and potentially hostile. But it is unfair to judge a town by its Sabbath persona; Hoima may be much more agreeable on weekdays. I didn’t, however, feel any irresistible urge to test that hypothesis.",

His analysis of what apartheid has done to both blacks and whites was devastating; even at this stage of my journey, some of his words moved me almost to tears.

    "target_paragraph": "By the time Becket joined us, Caryn and I, exhausted from fighting, were practically on the rocks. She got a room of her own in a collapsing warren of worker housing next to an old sugar mill on the north side of town. Lahaina had a gender imbalance, at least among its young arrivistes—there were way more men than women—and I was certain I saw a lot of the dudes around town taking note that the tasty little dark-haired haole girl from the ice-cream parlor was now living alone. Even Dan, the simpering draft dodger at the Either/Or, started putting the moves on her. I had been writing an epic poem, full of stormy tropical imagery, called “Living in a Car.” Now I turned my hand to a short story about a Filipino canecutter in Hawaii who spends his best years in a single-sex barracks, then falls in love with a blow-up sex doll. My situation wasn’t quite that dire, but I was not happy.",

After plodding all day over stony soil in the changeless sunshine, as the shadows lengthened, we turned directly up towards the mountains and began a two hours' ascent. It was delicious. They were so cool, so green, so varied, their grey pinnacles so splintered, their precipices so abrupt, their ravines so dark and deep, and their lower slopes covered with the greenest and finest grass; then dark ohias rose singly, then in twos and threes, and finally mixed in dense forest masses, with the pea-green of the kukui.",

With Diva’s help I could drive further forward or back with less risk of hitting anything, much more so than on my own. We did make a bit of progress, but mostly just seesawed back and forth. Plus, after all that rocking motion the truck cab bent away from the front trailer at an odd angle to the right where I sat facing out the windshield while the back trailer still bent more to the left. From a bird’s eye view we were gradually forming the letter “S.” The only thing that sat straight was the front trailer couched between two expensive diesel pumps connected to a flow of flammable liquid.",

Near the top, they had to wedge their hands and feet into a cleft and claw their way onto the summit, like mountaineers.

Yet this would be a gruelling trek in May, for now the broad, stony riverbeds are mere thirsty trickles and the terraced hillsides a series of dry, brownish undulations, only relieved by the thick green forests that cover the higher ridges. Few villages were visible, for their mud-walled houses blend perfectly with the surrounding earth: but on the highest hills we could see straggling little hamlets set amidst strips of maize, and it was possible to follow for miles the thin connecting thread of porters’ paths, endlessly winding around the mountains.",

Those who had the qualifications for running a store would be the Wesyas, and so on. Perhaps this would be a more \"fair\" way of organizing society. But Bali has been part of the Republic of Indonesia for only a few decades. And caste in Bali, whatever one's opinion of it, has been a very crucial part of the Hindu-Balinese social and cultural organization for more than 500 years.

They didn’t dawdle over espressos and tuck into mountainous plates of pasta, napkins bibbed into their collars. They didn’t engage in passionate arguments about trivialities. They took meetings. They made deals. They talked into car phones. They drove with restraint, mostly in BMWs and Porsches, and parked neatly. They all looked as if they had just stepped off the covers of Vogue or GQ. It was like an outpost of southern California in Italy. I don’t know about you, but I find southern California hard enough to take in southern California. This was Italy ? I wanted pandemonium and street life, people in sleeveless vests on front stoops, washing hanging across the streets, guys selling things from pushcarts, Ornella Muti and Giancarlo Giannini zipping past on a Vespa. Most of all, I wanted a cup of coffee.",

It was all unreal and unbelievable. Looking upward, far above us (in reality beneath us) floated the cloud-battle of Ukiukiu and Naulu. And higher up the slope of the seeming abyss, above the cloud-battle, in the air and sky, hung the islands of Lanai and Molokai. Across the crater, to the south-east, still apparently looking upward, we saw ascending, first, the turquoise sea, then the white surf-line of the shore of Hawaii; above that the belt of trade-clouds, and next, eighty miles away, rearing their stupendous hulks out of the azure sky, tipped with snow, wreathed with cloud, trembling like a mirage, the peaks of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa hung poised on the wall of heaven.",

I meet Dad and Son who, after some disappearance and machinations, tell me there is no room, but I am welcome to sit in the bar and drink whiskey. Several more kilometres at Bridgend is an actual B&B. I bang on the door. No one answers. On the last series of bangs the door flies open. I enter and yell. Nothing. After twenty minutes and with the weather looking inauspicious, I give up and head west. I ride around Loch Indaal, a sea loch aligned perfectly with the raging south-westerly wind. The traffic here is less than it was between Port Askaig and Bridgend, but the wind blows me all over the road, providing excitement for me and the oncoming tourists.",

Wedged in between a farmer with magnificent tufts of white hair winding out of his shirt and a woman with earlobes that swung low by her chin, we began another sign-language conversation with our companions. As train 32 paused at Talana, a bow-legged man boarded with a set of old scales over one shoulder and a basket of sapotas balanced against his hip, small round fruit that tasted faintly of caramel. The farmer bought a paper bagful and passed them around the compartment, smiling with a set of teeth that looked as though he had cleaned them with beetroot. Licking juice from my wrist, I muttered that we were going to Diu, prompting the compartment to wave and point across the track at a train that was about to move. Grabbing our bags, a couple of teenagers on mobile phones helped us off the train and I stumbled across the rocks, trying to reach the ladder to the doorway. My wet fingers slid from the railing and halfway up the ladder I felt the weight of my rucksack tipping backwards, taking me with it. I lost my footing and one handhold and began flailing like an upturned beetle, when two pairs of hands shoved my bag from below, boosting me up through the doorway, where I fell onto my knees as train number 33 began to move.",
