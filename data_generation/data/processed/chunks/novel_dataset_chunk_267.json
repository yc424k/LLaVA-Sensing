There was no light to read by or dry wood for a fire, the cold was getting worse and the wind was driving snow through a score of gaps. I huddled in a ball with my arms round my knees, stirring every few minutes to stamp and flap my arms. Too low for wolves, I thought melodramatically; or was it? After a while I stopped the singing with which I was trying to pass the interminable hours. There was nothing for it but to sit clenched and shivering in this prehistoric burial posture and listen to my teeth rattling. Every now and then I seemed to fall into a sort of catalepsy. But suddenly – was it midnight, or one in the morning? or later perhaps? – the wind fell and I heard voices, quite near, and jumped up and ran out shouting. There was silence, then someone called back. I could make out two faint blurs. They were villagers returning home. What was I doing there, on such a night? I told them. ‘Der arme Bua!’ They were all sympathy. But it was only half-past eight and the village was a mere two or three hundred metres away, just round the end of the hill … And within five minutes, there were the roofs and the belfry and the lighted doorway. The carpet of lamplight unrolled across the snow and the flakes floating past the windows were turning to sequins. Inside the inn the lamplit and steaming rustics round the table, veiled in the smoke of their lidded pipes, were maundering away with slurred vowels over their mugs. It was no good trying to explain.",

At Entebbe there is a White-run Virus Research Institute, one of three in the world, where all enquiries about the ethical standards applied to its work in Uganda are sidestepped. Other Western academics briefly visit Africa to pick up information painstakingly gathered and collated by African colleagues. They then fly off to present these findings – apparently the result of their own research – at one of the AIDS industry’s numerous and extravagantly run international conferences. These jamborees encourage AIDS ‘experts’ to mouth earnest platitudes and relay dramatic statistics for the benefit of the media, and to read papers written in impenetrable jargon for the benefit of each other, all by way of competing for funding for the next unconstructive project. Unconstructive, that is, for AIDS victims in Africa or anywhere else but lucrative for the experts. Meanwhile, out in the bush, the genuinely caring and knowledgeable Whites – always too busy to attend conferences – cannot afford basic medicines to relieve the agonies of the dying.",

I was also beside myself with anger, furious with the game warden, furious with Ali; imagine being in this Charlie Chaplin situation of the greatest peril, because the whole lot of them were bloody fools.

Within, directly under the beams, all by itself, on an upright chair beside a small table, sat an incongruous, startling, awe-inspiring apparition—a grimy old man of Mongolian aspect. He might have been frozen to stone, so immobile, so lifeless were his features. Belated visitors passed near the entrance of the shrine, peered within as at some outlandish and sinister freak of nature, and moved on with jocular words. Nobody ventured to overstep the threshold, whether from religious fear or because of something repellent, something almost putrescent, which radiated from his person. A contingent of Little White Cows, a kind of bodyguard, stood at a respectful distance beyond, intent upon his every movement. The Master never stirred. He sat there to be looked at—accustomed to homage almost divine; beatifically inane. Like the Christians of old, he wore no hat. The head was nearly bald. A long cloak, glistening with grease stains, swathed his limbs and portly belly, on which one suspected multitudinous wrinkles of fat. Two filmy lidless eyes, bulging on a level with his forehead, stared into vacuity; his snub nose grew out of a flattened face whose pallor was accentuated by the reflection of the glittering leaves—it looked faded and sodden, like blotting-paper that has been left out all night in the rain. Sporadic greenish-grey hairs were scattered about his chin. The mouth was agape.",

But sometimes for a day or more, I lose this feel of things, my breath is high up in my chest, and then I cling to the cliff edge as to life itself. And of course it is this clinging, the tightness of panic, that gets people killed: “to clutch,” in ancient Egyptian, “to clutch the mountain,” in Assyrian, were euphemisms that signified “to die.”17",

Indian women are everywhere on the sidewalk, occupying every nook and cranny of free space with their pyramids of Pringles cans, their pirated videos of Ricky Martin, and enough copies of Peter Drucker’s works on neoliberalism to occupy the citizenry for a century. But all these sights are dwarfed by the signs of modernity all around. Outside a chic McDonald’s an armed man stands guard, protecting a place whose prices are higher than those of the Parisian café next door. Across the street are kids with cell phones, and Internet cafés. At the place where the boulevard ends, a long straggly line of laborers is gathered, almost every day, around the base of a plate-glass skyscraper on which, too fittingly, is written, THE FUTURE OF BOLIVIA.",

At Aberdovey, he found dunes that in their ‘crescentic form’ approximated an ‘Aeolian sand-hill, the mound having two arms or horns similar in shape to the cusps of a four-days-old moon’. Such dunes, he noted, had a family resemblance with the barchan dunes of the Taklamakan Desert in Central Asia, and with the medao dunes of the Peruvian deserts. Back in Dorset, in the ‘loose dry sand of the sea-shore between Branksome Chine and Poole Haven’, he studied how sand formed into ridges and ripples around marram grass, and he photographed these shapes obsessively.",

Then after I’d let it soak a while I’d pull it back again, and put it on—and it would go ‘Twirk’—and there I’d have it, cool and clean, back on my head again! Isn’t it wonderful the things a kid can think of—hah?” she demanded, with a merry, glowing, and delighted face.",

In Des Moines, Iowa, where I grew up, the first skywalk was erected between a hotel and parking ramp about twenty-five years ago and was such a hit that soon other downtown businesses were getting in on the act. Now it is possible to walk halfway to Omaha without ever experiencing fresh air. All the stores that used to be at street level have moved up to the second floor, where the pedestrian traffic now is. Now the only people you ever see at street level in Des Moines are winos and office workers standing around having a smoke.

Droughts are leading to conflicts, human and livestock displacement, animal diseases and food insecurity. Kerry shared with us that the nomadic herders frequently have to dig deep holes to find water for both themselves and their livestock. They call them ‘Singing Wells’ because they sing to their livestock as they dig, and the cows recognize their family’s song and come down to the well to have a drink. The difference between each family’s song is usually clear but can be very subtle. At night, thirsty elephants seek out these wells. We got to see those wells as soon as we arrived at Sarara Safari Lodge, towards the end of our trek. Our guide explained that adult elephants, with great long trunks, have little problem reaching for the water, but the younger, inexperienced elephants can tumble in. If the animals can’t be pulled out, the elephants are forced to abandon their young.",

My wife feels she’s done justice to New York even though she’s never set foot inside the Plaza; I’ve been haunting London for six decades, and have never had cause to enter the Connaught. Raffles, however, is something different, the rare hotel that’s not just a base for sightseeing but an indispensable sight in itself. Often, I suspect, people come to Singapore to visit Raffles as much as they come to Raffles to enjoy Singapore.",

Later, I was drawing the shrine when a black-bearded person in Kabuli dress came up, muttered after my health, and stated that while photographing was permitted, drawing was not, and that my sketch was therefore his. At this I was seized by such a paralysing anger that I could not speak for several minutes. When I could, the words were taken out of my mouth by one of the servants from the hotel who, as he put it, “made fight” with the officious brute and learned that he was employed in the rebuilding scheme.

Eighty-two per cent of the county population is black. More than half the county residents live below the poverty level. Almost a third of them still don’t have indoor plumbing. That is really poor. Where I come from you are poor if you can’t afford a refrigerator that makes its own ice-cubes and your car doesn’t have automatic windows. Not having running water in the house is something beyond the realms of the imaginable to most Americans.",
