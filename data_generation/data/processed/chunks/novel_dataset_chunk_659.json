Stunned, he discovered that she was still breathing. Both her gloves were gone, and her bare hands appeared to be frozen solid. Her eyes were dilated. The skin on her face was the color of white porcelain. “It was terrible,” Hutchison recalls. “I was overwhelmed. She was very near death. I didn’t know what to do.”",

When rivers and air meet, condensation forms. Weather results, and weather makes dirt. Water from the sky—snow, sleet, downpours, sprinkles—impacts the surface of the Earth in small drops and wide puddles and rushing currents. Wind blows across it all, urging dirt and water onward, to drift and finally come to rest in a distant place. There are molecules of dirt on Boulder Pass that blew in from Egypt’s pyramids; the mud caked in my boot treads may have once cradled the bones of some delicate, gossamer wing.",

On flights from Seattle to Anchorage I always asked for a window seat on the right-hand side of the plane, because from it (if the weather was clear) I could observe white cruise ships on the deep blue of the Inland Passage, and the shrinking bigness of the Hubbard Glacier (usually described as larger than Rhode Island), and the delta of the Copper River with its glittering, complicated channels. I got to know the Anchorage airport well. In the big hexagonal waiting room on Concourse B there is a mounted Kodiak bear on all fours next to a polar bear standing on its hind legs. Both bears look fierce, both are “record class” animals (according to the plaques), and both were killed by dentists.",

Every day sailed to sea some fine ship bound for the Indies;* now and again another blackened and ragged with hairy unknown men on board crept painfully to anchor. No one missed a boy or girl if they dallied a little on the water after sunset; or raised an eyebrow if gossip had seen them sleeping soundly among the treasure sacks safe in each other’s arms. Such indeed was the adventure that befel Orlando, Sukey, and the Earl of Cumberland.* The day was hot; their loves had been active; they had fallen asleep among the rubies. Late that night the Earl, whose fortunes were much bound up in the Spanish ventures, came to check the booty alone with a lantern. He flashed the light on a barrel. He started back with an oath. Twined about the cask two spirits lay sleeping. Superstitious by nature, and his conscience laden with many a crime, the Earl took the couple—they were wrapped in a red cloak, and Sukey’s bosom was almost as white as the eternal snows of Orlando’s poetry—for a phantom sprung from the graves of drowned sailors to upbraid him. He crossed himself. He vowed repentance. The row of alms houses still standing in the Sheen Road* is the visible fruit of that moment’s panic. Twelve poor old women of the parish today drink tea and tonight bless his Lordship for a roof above their heads; so that illicit love in a treasure ship—but we omit the moral.",

O godfrey, Cass,” and then they heard Mr Hubert’s feet on the stairs and watched the light come down the hall and Mr Hubert came in, in his nightshirt, and walked over and set the candle on the table and stood looking at Uncle Buck.",

Then Cory Aquino, whom the people were still trying to persuade to enter politics, walked shyly up to the stage. In a soft, quavering voice, she gave the people her heartfelt thanks. Her husband, she said, would have been proud, deeply proud of them. Then, fists raised silently in the air, the entire congregation joined together in a slow and stirring rendition of “The Impossible Dream.” When it was over, a silence filled the church. Then, very slowly, the crowd went into a strong, subdued rendering of the banned national anthem, “Bayan Ko.” As I listened to the brave, solemn voices of the two little girls next to me, and as I heard them singing of redemption with all their hearts, I felt strange tears coming to my eyes. Theirs sounded to me like the voice of a nation struggling to find a dignity adequate to its sorrow.",

The air was full of dust and the wind roared about the bridge, whipping the water into waves topped with yellow froth that falling became rainbows. Upstream a herd of bullocks were swimming the river, thirty of them, with the herdsmen astride the leaders and flankers, urging them on. Beyond the river was Tirpul itself, a small hamlet with strange wind machines revolving on mud towers, with an encampment of black nomad tents on the outskirts and a great square caravanserai deserted on a nearby hill.",

(Our ascent was slow: suddenly we were aware of being at 9,500 feet.) Here Atahualpa sat while inspecting his troops and since his day the view can have changed but little. Below stretched a town undefiled by modern architecture, its roofs all red-brown tiles, its church belfries curiously squat; these were left half-finished as a protest against a Spanish tax on completed churches. The valley floor is now drought-burned, a beautiful but tragic golden-brown expanse scattered with rare patches of irrigated green. Last season sixty per cent of Peru’s rice crop was lost through drought and there is no foreign currency available for essential imported rice: many people are going hungry. And another calamitous season is on the way.",

Why had the American film industry not made films about the Vietnam War, was what the Colombian stringer for the Caribbean newspaper wanted to talk about. The young Colombian filmmakers looked at him incredulously. “What would be the point,” one finally shrugged. “They run that war on television.”\nThe filmmakers had lived in New York, spoke of Rip Torn, Norman Mailer, Ricky Leacock, Super 8. One had come to the party in a stovepipe preacher’s hat; another in a violet macramé shawl to the knees. The girl with them, a famous beauty from the coast, wore a flamingo-pink sequinned midriff, and her pale red hair was fluffed around her head in an electric halo. She watched the cumbia dancers and fondled a baby ocelot and remained impassive both to the possibility of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla’s comeback and to the question of why the American film industry had not made films about the Vietnam War. Later, outside the gate, the filmmakers lit thick marijuana cigarettes in view of the uniformed policía and asked if I knew Paul Morrissey’s and Andy Warhol’s address in Rome. The girl from the coast cradled her ocelot against the wind.",

The usual insulated steam pipes laced the village with their meanderings, and where the heat was escaping from the more run-down houses you could tell the location of the cracks by the elaborate, pure-white excrescences of frost that had built up around them. Some of these frost blooms were huge, like an outsize bole or a clot of dried sap on the side of a tree.",

In fact, if anything differentiated the lesbians I met in Beijing from my straight friends and colleagues, it was their auras: They positively radiated freedom, from their elfin hair-cuts to their flamboyant platform shoes. They were also politically aware. During a salon I later attended at Jayne’s house, a dozen lesbians sat in a circle and took turns sharing information and resources about everything from AIDS prevention to feminism. Several volunteered at a hot line for gays and lesbians in need of counsel. In many ways, these women were the closest I came to real “activists” or “dissidents” in China. They had even co-opted the Cultural Revolution term of tongzhi, or comrade, as their moniker.",

Students in regulation black dress were playing Renaissance and mediaeval chamber music on period instruments to a very high level of musicianship. This accompanied a fashion show of contemporary, slightly bizarre designs worn by young people with painted faces and space-age hairdos somewhere between Princess Leia and Jane Jetson. There were metallic epaulettes, gauzy insect wings, a dog-style cone collar, a transparent cubist skirt, a geodesic dome cape, and some strange veils. These were presented as cocktail dresses or evening gowns, or maybe theatrical costumes, or even works of art, not to be worn. Oddly, the music changed over to a very good brass ensemble which performed an elaborate big band version of “I Got Rhythm”. Twice. Interesting programming. There was no sign, banner, announcer or pamphlet explaining what this was, and after watching, I decided not to ask. They were students.",

Much of the time he’s speaking to people who know nothing about Buddhism— who may even be hostile to it—and he’s mastered the art of speaking simply, and ecumenically, from the heart, stressing, as he does, “spirituality without faith—simply being a good human being, a warm-hearted person, a person with a sense of responsibility.” Talking to his monks, he delivers philosophical lectures that few of the rest of us could begin to follow; speaking to the world, he realizes that the most important thing is not to run before you can walk.

After a ten-minute walk across the plateau we came to a fork in the track, where one branch continued around the mountain and another climbed steeply towards the summit. Some instinct (or perhaps it was only my hammering heart) told me that the gompa path went around, not up; but Mingmar, pointing to three chortens on the summit path, said ‘up!’. So up we went, to the 13,400-foot summit, where there was no sign of any gompa and the icy wind almost stripped the skin off our faces. Moving a little way down I sat in the shelter of a yak-house and said rather breathlessly, ‘I suppose we may call this a mountain-top?’ – but Mingmar replied firmly that it was no more than a high hill-top; apparently in these parts only permanently snow-covered peaks qualify as mountains.",

And then it was served to us on a dry-goods box in the house. Our hosts waited until we were done and then spread their table on the floor. But our table! We were certainly in the high seat of abundance. First, there was glorious raw fish, caught several hours before from the sea and steeped the intervening time in lime-juice diluted with water. Then came roast chicken. Two cocoanuts, sharply sweet, served for drink. There were bananas that tasted like strawberries and that melted in the mouth, and there was banana-poi that made one regret that his Yankee forebears ever attempted puddings. Then there was boiled yam, boiled taro, and roasted feis, which last are nothing more or less than large mealy, juicy, red-coloured cooking bananas. We marvelled at the abundance, and, even as we marvelled, a pig was brought on, a whole pig, a sucking pig, swathed in green leaves and roasted upon the hot stones of a native oven, the most honourable and triumphant dish in the Polynesian cuisine. And after that came coffee, black coffee, delicious coffee, native coffee grown on the hillsides of Tahaa.",
