What distinguishes that summit above the earthly line, is that it is unhandselled, awful, grand. It can never become familiar; you are lost the moment you set foot there.

Whatever whimsical impulse of kindliness had pushed him into his offer vanished when he realized that he was stuck with me for the term, but once he learned this bitter fact, he decided at least to bring me up the way I should go. He had worked in open-pit mines before coming to the university, and it was typical of his scornful attitude, that of a veteran miner, that he hadn't deigned to come to the explanatory lecture. He was one of those gangling, undernourished boys who work their way through college; he waited on table at a hash house when he wasn't in class, and got good marks and had a future. As a surveyor, he knew his business as well as our instructor did. By the time we graduated from the dumpy level to the transit, Reginald and I had the best record of any pair of engineers for our reports and drawings. None of this excellence, obviously, was due to my talents.",

The finding of a new Dalai Lama when all of Tibet is in Chinese hands would in the best of circumstances be treacherous; it became doubly so three years ago when Beijing unilaterally hijacked the second-highest incarnation in Tibet, that of the Panchen Lama, placing the Dalai Lama’s six-year-old choice under house arrest and installing a candidate of its own. (The Panchen Lama, by tradition, is the figure officially responsible for authorizing the Dalai Lama’s own incarnation, and the maneuver suggested that the Chinese may have few qualms about coming up with their own puppet as the next Dalai Lama.)",

The Eden was on the intersection of Freak Street and the Dharmapath, which was, I thought, the perfect location: at the intersection of hippiedom and Hinduism, where Haight-Ashbury meets the Himalayas. This, in fact, was exactly the kind of cross-cultural crossroads that I had hoped to find. For legend had it that Kathmandu was quite a trip—at once a time machine and a magic carpet—and I had come here to be transported. Not, however, to a dusty Himalayan kingdom, or even to a medieval community unchanged for many centuries. I wished to travel back no more than twenty years, and to be deposited in nowhere more exotic than a city of the spirit where people still regarded money as immaterial and youth as something more than a preparation for middle age. In Kathmandu I hoped to find the last stronghold of the sixties. And in the sixties I hoped to find a reflection of a younger and more innocent America, the land of idealism I was born too late to know.",

Coli, at forty-six, was a venerable figure: not many airmen were still alive and flying at that age. He wore a rakish black monocle over a missing right eye, one of five wounds he had sustained in combat. This was nothing compared with Nungesser’s extravagant affinity for injury, however. No one in the war was injured more?or at least got up again afterward. Nungesser had so many injuries that after the war he listed them all on his business card. They included: six jaw fractures (four upper, two lower); fractured skull and palate; bullet wounds to mouth and ear; dislocations of wrist, clavicle, ankle, and knees; loss of teeth; shrapnel wound to upper body; multiple concussions; multiple leg fractures; multiple internal injuries; and contusions “too numerous to list.” He was also gravely injured in a car crash in which a companion died. Often he was so banged up that he had to be carried to his plane by crew members and gently inserted into the cockpit. Even so, Nungesser shot down forty-four planes (he claimed many more), a number exceeded among French aviators only by Rene Fonck, and received so many medals that he all but clanked when he walked. He listed those on his business card, too.",

On too many occasions I have set aside my desires and opinions and acquiesced to the wishes of others, figuring it was better to be an approval whore than a social misfit. As you age, however, conformity loses both appeal and potency; the payoff never quite ratchets up a measurable degree of satisfaction. It’s easier to shed people who dampen your spirit than to barter away your sense of self.",

Had I flown direct from Dublin and landed in Kabul as a wide-eyed, sensitive-nostrilled newcomer to the East, I too might well have been unable to appreciate the finer points of Afghan life and culture. As it is, during my two months’ travelling from Istanbul to Meshed, the roads became daily less road-like, the mountains higher, the atmosphere rarer, the clothes stranger, the chairs scarcer, the Moslems more Islamic, the sanitary arrangements more alarming, the weather hotter, the stenches stronger, and the food dirtier. By the time I arrived at the Afghan frontier it seemed quite natural, before a meal, to scrape the dried mud off the bread, pick the hairs out of the cheese and remove the bugs from the sugar. I had also stopped registering the presence of fleas, the absence of cutlery, and the fact that I hadn’t taken off my clothes or slept in a bed for ten days.",

He’d grown up a few miles from the New Mexico line, in the Colorado town of Romeo, an unromantic burg where his family lived without running water. “In history class, all we heard about was the Forty-niners and mountain men and Pike’s fucking Peak,” Walter said. “Anglos called us ‘chili eaters’ and looked down on us as newcomers, even though we’d been there three hundred years before the so-called pioneers came west.”",

Admired for his intelligence, his energy, and his education, he was the brightest light of the Village. He was married and had a nineyear-old son, whom he often took camping. Tony was not yet thirty when he died. Larry Juneby, of Eagle, went out of a bar in Fairbanks and into the Chena River last week. Searchers are still dragging for the body. To drink, Michael says, Village people will sell their chain saws, their winter’s wood—anything at all. On Easter, in bright sun by the white frozen river, they hold sawing contests, bag races, and tea races (make a fire from scratch, melt snow, and make tea), but such wholesome scenes are increasingly rare. Money was once collected for a Village well only to be spent on liquor. In various elections over the years, the white community has voted itself in and out of prohibition. It has been dry since 1967. Bootleggers get upward of two hundred dollars a case for blended whiskey—eighteen dollars a quart. “One of them did not like being wakened in the night,” Michael tells me. “So he told the people just when to come around. He did that, really. He’s bootlegging, and he’s got hours.”",

The intention had been to incapacitate the small Cuban airforce so that the invading troops would be free from aerial bombardment, but Castro had cannily moved most of the Cuban bombers away from the airfields and camouflaged them. Two days later Brigade 2506, as the exile invasion force was known, landed at Playa Giron. The brigade had been led to believe that the air attacks had been successful and were not prepared for what was in store … The unexpected Cuban aerial attacks caused much damage and confusion; two freighters were destroyed and the rest of the fleet fled, leaving 1,300 troops trapped on Playa Giron and Playa Larga. During the night of April 17–18 the Cuban government forces renewed attacks on the brigade … Several B-26 bombers, two manned by US pilots flew over the Bay of Pigs from Nicaragua in an attempt to weaken the Cuban army and clear the way for the landing of supplies needed by the stranded brigade. Most of the bombers were shot down and the supplies never arrived. Castro’s army was victorious having captured 1,180 prisoners who were eventually traded for medical and other supplies from the US.",

Inevitably it is in a shambles: most of the tents have been torn to shreds and four have been blown away, including the chief lama’s. From the airfield sheets of water raced across the whole site, and to enter the camp one had to wade across a twenty-foot wide, four-foot deep torrent in which one of the children had nearly been drowned a few minutes before my arrival. All clothing, bedding and firewood are saturated and the little cooking-holes in the ground will be unusable for the next twelve hours; so these unfortunates cannot even console themselves with a hot drink, much less change into dry clothes as I have now done. When I arrived some of the torn tents were already being moved to less flooded spots, and piles of drenched possessions were stacked on the high firewood heaps all over the camp. Many families had begun frantically to dig drains, using spoons, knives, hands and feet in an attempt to get the water away more quickly. The sodden remains of those prized cardboard US milk cartons, which are used as domestic altars, were floating off rapidly in every direction and most families’ weekly grain ration was soaked through. Tiny children stood shivering beside their collapsed tents, and stiff-jointed grandparents searched in vain for a dry spot on which to sit.",

No trifle, it must be owned in fairness to him. Jim told me he darted desperate looks like a cornered man, gave one low wail, and dashed off. He was back instantly clambering, hammer in hand, and without a pause flung himself at the bolt. The others gave up Jim at once and ran off to assist. He heard the tap, tap of the hammer, the sound of the released chock falling over. The boat was clear. Only then he turned to look — only then. But he kept his distance — he kept his distance. He wanted me to know he had kept his distance; that there was nothing in common between him and these men — who had the hammer. Nothing whatever. It is more than probable he thought himself cut off from them by a space that could not be traversed, by an obstacle that could not be overcome, by a chasm without bottom. He was as far as he could get from them — the whole breadth of the ship.",

Seeing few alternatives, we followed her to a three-story nineteenth-century house regally designed with high ceilings, carved wooden doors, ornate light fixtures, and grilled ironwork but modestly kept with humble furniture and peeling paint. Vintage Chinese bicycles leaned against the outer wall of the courtyard while two floors’ worth of neighbors’ laundry dripped dry from above. Cecilia opened a padlock hanging on a door and let us peek inside. For $12 a night, she offered a king-size bed, a dresser, a vase of plastic roses, and a bathroom with a sliver of soap. While we deliberated, she darted off to the kitchen and returned with two steaming glasses of coffee. “Es negro como la piel y dulce como una muchacha,” she quipped. It’s as black as skin and sweet as a girl.",

In the semi-darkness the chairs on deck and the people sitting in them were angular shapes, the mouth being indicated by a tiny burning spot, and the arm by the same spot moving up or down as the cigar or cigarette was lifted to and from the lips. Words crossed the darkness, but, not knowing where they fell, seemed to lack energy and substance. Deep sighs proceeded regularly, although with some attempt at suppression, from the large white mound which represented the person of Mrs Flushing. The day had been long and very hot, and now that all the colours were blotted out the cool night air seemed to press soft fingers upon the eyelids, sealing them down. Some philosophical remark directed, apparently, at St John Hirst missed its aim, and hung so long suspended in the air until it was engulfed by a yawn, that it was considered dead, and this gave the signal for stirring of legs and murmurs about sleep. The white mound moved, finally lengthened itself and disappeared, and after a few turns and paces St John and Mr Flushing withdrew, leaving three chairs still occupied by three silent bodies. The light which came from a lamp high on the mast and a sky pale with stars left them with shapes but without features; but even in this darkness the withdrawal of the others made them feel each other very near, for they were all thinking of the same thing. For some time no one spoke, then Helen said with a sigh, ‘So you’re both very happy?’",

    "target_paragraph": "The old Diamond Shoals Lighthouse, now retired but still standing proud\n​At 1:05pm we get passed by the cargo ship Cosco Vietnam, 334 meters long and moving at an impressive 20 knots. I picture it full of toilet paper, Tupperware, and plastic bracelets.\n​We are now 70nm from Cape Lookout. I can feel it cooling off outside and I put a blanket over my legs. It’s sure to be another cold night, but we should be anchored safely by mid-morning and my first solo passage aboard Windflower will be complete. We will be in a safe harbor and I’ll be eating a hot bowl of chili in the cockpit while smiling at the world. Bob Marley will be playing on the tiny sound system, and I’ll be contemplating a trip ashore in Little Flower, the dinghy.\n​I feel tired and I look all around. Diamond shoals is behind us, Cosco Vietnam is well past, and shore is 15nm away. There is nothing I might run into, and so I should nap. I go below, set the countdown timer on my watch, which has been set at 22 minutes since I bought the watch in St Petersburg, Florida, in 2016. I lay down and the feeling is glorious. A sailor’s body is never relaxed unless laying down. Even when sitting the core is working to keep balance as the boat constantly moves. This makes laying down an unexpectedly wonderful feeling.\n​I fall asleep and dream, then feel a buzz on my arm and the dream evaporates. I’m on a boat, and the boat is moving across the ocean with nobody at the helm. I have to get up!\n​I poke my head out of the companionway and all is ocean and water and sky, Windflower, and nothing else. I check the chartplotter and we still proceed in the same direction we did 20 minutes ago. The AIS shows no ships within its range of 24 miles, and so I lay down again. The countdown timer resets and restarts itself, so I need not do anything to the watch. I fall asleep again. I dream. I awake to the buzzing on my left wrist. Again, I get up quickly, hold on to a post to assist my drowsy balance, then slowly and carefully make my way up the steps. I take two more naps, checking the horizon and the instruments between each.\n​After my final nap, I clip my tether to the large padeye outside the companionway before stepping out into the cockpit. I’ve read that sailors sometimes fall overboard when moving between cockpit and companionway, since their center of gravity is high. Should something unexpected happen, this is a vulnerable position and one should just go ahead and clip in before making the transition. That’s why I installed the two large padeyes on either side of the companionway. Both are through-bolted and reinforced with matching backing plates on the inside.\n​While sitting at the helm, once again in control of my vessel, I try to remember how many naps I just took, but they all blur together. I look at the time, trying to remember when I laid down for the first one. It’s all a mystery, and inconsequential.\n​A look at the chartplotter tells me that we have rounded all of Cape Hatteras. Diamond Shoals was just the beginning, but now the cape has been rounded, and I acknowledge the achievement for a second time, why not?",

Presently the ones on the platform heard the feet, the mute clashing of the shackles, the first truckload emerged from the compress, the second, the third; there were more than a hundred of them now in their bed-ticking overalls and jumpers and fifteen or twenty guards with rifles and shotguns. The first lot rose and they mingled, paired, twinned by their clanking and clashing umbilicals; then it began to rain, a slow steady gray drizzle like November instead of May. Yet not one of them made any move toward the open door of the compress. They did not even look toward it, with longing or hope or without it. If they thought at all, they doubtless knew that the available space in it would be needed for furniture, even if it were not already filled. Or perhaps they knew that, even if there were room in it, it would not be for them, not that the guards would wish them to get wet but that the guards would not think about getting them out of the rain. So they just stopped talking and with their jumper collars turned up and shackled in braces like dogs at a field trial they stood, immobile, patient, almost ruminant, their backs turned to the rain as sheep and cattle do.",

I’d found out about it just days before I’d flown to San Diego when a friend had texted me a screenshot of her Facebook announcement. I understood this hiker’s confusion. After all, I was no one?an eidolon. Even though he was friendly, just like the hikers at the Saufley’s, I couldn’t help but feel that I was under scrutiny. I’d scoured pictures of Snorkel after I’d gotten that text. She was thin. She had a shoe sponsor. She held the self-supported record on the Appalachian Trail. She was everything I wasn’t. If someone was supposed to break this record, it was her. Did my newfound companion believe me? Would anyone believe me? Did it matter to me if anyone believed me? Who was the Ghost? Was it really me? If it is, where on earth did someone come up with it? Or is there another woman somewhere in this desert moving fast toward Canada?",
