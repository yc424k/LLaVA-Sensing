His second was composed of three upside-down triangles, each balanced on its vertex with the wider end magically suspended above, the stones getting progressively larger up the stack. The topmost one was twisted at a right angle, making it look like one of those giant Easter Island heads.",

Every person came out of every house and began to set off fireworks ? big industrial-sized fireworks that shrieked across the sky and exploded with a sharp bang and filled the night with colour and sparks. For half an hour, from all around the peninsula, fireworks popped and glittered over the harbour and drifted spent into the sea. And then, precisely thirty minutes after it all began, everyone went back inside and Hammerfest slept again.",

If it had ended there, it would have redounded to Germany’s shame for ever, but of course it grew unspeakably worse, as the photographs and documents in the museum’s other rooms gruesomely testify ? people being herded onto cattle trains, piles of stick-like corpses, the gaunt faces of the living dead, all the pictures you have seen a thousand times.",

All sorts of beasts come and stare at me, and larks sing above me, and creeping things crawl over me, and stir in the long grass beside me; and here I bring my book, and read and dream away the profitable morning hours, to the accompaniment of the amorous croakings of innumerable frogs.",

She cooks and cans things. She grinds wheat berries and bakes bread. She breaks damp skins with an old gun barrel and works them with a metal scraper. A roommate she once had at the University of Alaska went off to “the other states” and left her a hundred-and-fiftydollar Canadian Pioneer parka. She has never worn it, because —although her cabin is in the coldest part of Alaska—winter temperatures have yet to go low enough to make her feel a need to put it on. “We’ve had some cool weather,” she admits. “I don’t know how cold, exactly. Our thermometer only goes to fifty-eight.” When she goes out at such temperatures to saw or to split the wood she survives on—with the air at sixty and more below zero—she wears a down sweater. It is all she needs as long as her limbs are active. Her copy of “The Joy of Cooking” previously belonged to a trapper’s wife who froze to death. Donna’s father, a state policeman, was sent in to collect the corpse.",

He had walked with his wife from their flat nearby to see a movie about Mozart and they had just emerged from the cinema to stroll home when some madman stepped from the shadows and shot him. It seemed to me one of the tragedies of our age because this must have been almost the last important place in the world where a prime minister could be found walking the streets unguarded and standing in movie lines just like a normal person.",

The conventional farm-folk of his imagination – personified by the pitiable dummy known as Hodge – were obliterated after a few days’ residence. At close quarters no Hodge was to be seen. At first, it is true, when Clare’s intelligence was fresh from a contrasting society, these friends with whom he now hobnobbed seemed a little strange. Sitting down as a level member of the dairyman’s household seemed at the outset an undignified proceeding. The ideas, the modes, the surroundings, appeared retrogressive and unmeaning. But with living on there, day after day, the acute sojourner became conscious of a new aspect in the spectacle. Without any objective change whatever, variety had taken the place of monotonousness. His host and his host’s household, his men and his maids, as they became intimately known to Clare began to differentiate themselves as in a chemical process. The thought of Pascal’s was brought home to him: ‘A mesure qu’on a plus d’esprit, on trouve qu’il y a plus d’hommes originaux. Les gens du commun ne trouvent pas de différence entre les hommes.’ The typical and unvarying Hodge ceased to exist. He had been disintegrated into a number of varied fellow-creatures – beings of many minds, beings infinite in difference; some happy, many serene, a few depressed, one here and there bright even to genius, some stupid, others wanton, others austere; some mutely Miltonic, some potentially Cromwellian; into men who had private views of each other, as he had of his friends; who could applaud or condemn each other, amuse or sadden themselves by the contemplation of each other’s foibles or vices; men every one of whom walked in his own individual way the road to dusty death.",

This was the major road and the surface was quite good though very up hill and down dale with much braking and shifting gears. The scenery was always different, usually glorious, never dull or ugly and most of it has blurred out of shape in my memory. We had to take a turn-off to the left for Kericho and I instructed Joshua to keep his eyes open. Joshua couldn’t read a map, not that it made much difference; little to choose from and as time went on I realized the map was more a wistful estimate than a statement of fact. There was really no reason to believe any information, printed or otherwise, but one must have faith in something or founder utterly and I based my faith and my distance calculations on the hotel-inn-resthouse booklet, figuring that it was 66 miles to Kericho from Nakuru but if we missed the turn the next possible stop was Kisumu, 111 miles, and we would never make that before dark.",

    "target_paragraph": "His dream was cut short by the vision of Laura Lou waiting for him in the dismal bedroom of the place where they boarded. They had begun life in New York in a decent rooming house, recommended by Vance’s old friend, the manager of Friendship House. It was clean, hygienic, not too dear; in fact, would have suited them exactly if, as cold weather came on, Laura Lou’s colds had not so often prevented her going out for her meals. She tried preparing their food on an electric cooker, but the dishes she produced were unpalatable and indigestible, and the woman who kept the house objected to the mess that resulted. So they had moved to their present quarters, far over on the West Side, in a leprous brownstone survival of an earlier world. When Vance entered the greasy hall a smell of canned soup and stale coffee told him that dinner had begun. “I do wish Laura Lou would go down without waiting for me,” he thought impatiently; but she never would, and on the days when he was late, and she had to eat her food cold, she always ended up with a sick headache. He reflected with a grin, as he sprang up the stairs, that the people he was going to describe in Loot--the dress-clothes people--were at that hour still dawdling over tea and cocktails, as he and Mrs. Pulsifer had done, in that circular panelled room with the flowers and the dove-coloured armchairs, to which he had never again been admitted. . . . Dinner, in that world, was two or three hours off, down the vista of a brilliant night. . . .",

It was vast and dazzling and immensely well appointed. The club movement in Australia is huge. In New South Wales alone, clubs employ 65,000 people, more than any other industry.

The loss of body heat is the most immediate danger, but the sleeping bag may give me enough protection. Water is the first priority, then food. After that, whatever else I can grab. Ten gallons of water rest in the galley locker just under the companionway—forty to eighty days’ worth of survival rations waiting for me just a hundred feet away. The raised stern quarter will make it easier to get aft. There are two large duffels in the aft cabin, hung on the topsides; one is full of food—about a month’s worth—and the other is full of clothes. If I can dive down and swim forward, I may be able to pull my survival suit out of the fore-peak. I dream of how its thick neoprene will warm me up.",

He was to break away, sending her into a frenzy of frustration. The scene picked up again with him standing contemplative against a tree (the same tree, I thought, heart beating, that had served as a love nest in a thousand Hindi movies through the ages). She had to approach him again, wind her body around his and then, pinning him against the trunk, lift her head for a kiss. When he recoiled, she was to push him down to the ground, hover over him where he lay and then, as she leaned down to kiss him, lose her balance so that the energetic couple would tumble over and over in the grass. This complicated movement was set to some capering melody, and throughout the contortions, the actress had to lip-synch (with the emphasis on lips) a tune sung by Lata Mangeshkar, or someone exactly like her.",

I really don’t understand why.) However, they can call them whatever they like, but as far as I’m concerned they’re acacias. What we hadn’t seen until now were the whistling thorn acacias. Now, here they were. Shorter than their cousins, they were decorated with hard, nut-like growths from which the thorns grow, and which are hosts to several varieties of ants who make their homes within them by boring holes. When the wind blows through these holes, the tree whistles. The ants repay their hosts by swarming and stinging browsing animals to deter them from eating the trees’ leaves, so it is a symbiotic relationship – housing in return for protection.\nTravelling on the rough, rocky, dirt roads to our destination we were several times held up by goats or cattle crossing the road, herded by bands of little dusty children. They ran beside the vehicles, shouting ‘Switi, switi!’ What does that mean? I asked Dedan. ‘They are asking for sweets. When they see tourist vehicles coming – they can see the dust a long way off – they drive their animals onto the road so you have to slow down. It is a sweety ambush.’",

Fantasies of hot-fudge sundaes with numerous varieties of ice cream dance through my head. Last night I nearly got to taste hot buttered whole-wheat biscuits, but they were snatched away from me when I woke up. And how many hours have I spent back on Solo, collecting the dried fruit, the fruit juices, the nuts? Hunger is a witch from whom there is no escape. Her spells conjure these visions of food and deepen the pain. I look at my stock. The can of beans is blown. I dare not eat them for fear of botulism. Then again, maybe they’re all right. Quickly now, pitch them! Do it, I tell you! The can lands with a sickening kerplunk. I’m left with two cabbage stems and wet, fermented raisins in a plastic bag. The stems are slimy and bitter. I eat them anyway.",

Camels seem not to care about pyramids at all, I joked. Teresa ignored me. She turned on her heels and gazed past me. This was the view that she had wanted to find on our first trip to the pyramids. From here, the pyramids formed a neat row, their colossal silhouettes brush over the horizon. On that first visit, a month earlier, Sayid had rushed us along, and scolded us for dawdling. This time, it was just us. There would be no guides, no watchmen, and no tourists to crowd Teresa’s view.",

I was impressed by the VIP Lounge, which I was not likely to see, I thought, again in this life, and enjoyed the passport and customs formalities which were so cursory as to make me feel rather like the Aga Khan. Such are the pleasures of travelling in a great man’s entourage. The old Valetta, however, had rather a second-hand air, and the Secretary of State inspected the guard of honour briefly. His wife and children were there to see him off, and he embraced them warmly and naturally in a way that would have touched old Frangos. The red dispatch cases were loaded and we climbed aboard and seated ourselves, while the pilot gave us a sharp talk about life-jackets, adding with a twinkle, ‘This is a well-victualled ship, and there won’t be any closing time once we are airborne.’",

It now offers a restaurant and overnight accommodation to hikers. Also on the summit is a wonderful, wildly incongruous lighthouse (Greylock is 140 miles from the sea), which serves as the Massachusetts memorial for soldiers killed in the First World War.

However, I freely concede that they are completely useless in cold and wet. The cotton sweater was something I had packed as a formality, as you might pack antisnake bite medicine or splints. It was July, for goodness sake. I hadn’t expected to need any kind of outerwear beyond possibly my trusty waterproofs, which of course I didn’t have either.

But the appeal to Ralph’s humanity had little chance of being heard today; he was no longer a model of concentration. The partition so carefully erected between the different sections of his life had been broken down, with the result that though his eyes were fixed upon the last Will and Testament, he saw through the page a certain drawing-room in Cheyne Walk.",

But as long as I could keep my feet down it might be possible to cross a hundred yards up. Much more tentatively, I made my way into the water. I worked my way across slowly while angling upstream, where the river appeared more passable. The farther I went, the more obstacles I saw. Weaving around boulders and holes in crotch-deep water, I once again felt the warmth of my body ebbing away. I finally reached a bend where it looked possible to finish crossing and began to make my way toward the trees splitting the channels. I felt the river pull harder and harder until my poles—planted in the strongest part of the current—vibrated with the power of the water. I could barely keep myself upright. My eyes tracked to where whitewater frothed as it flung itself over rocks and off of the drop. I knew there was a serious waterfall a short distance downstream. My mind raced to the recent death of an acquaintance while fording a river in the Brooks Range.",

The first order of business was to address the gelcoat blisters on Caribee’s bottom. She’d had two lifetime blister repair jobs done already and this was to be her third, and I was determined, final one. My plan was to peel about three millimeters off of the underwater surface and replace the lost material with biaxial fiberglass cloth set in epoxy resin, creating a laminate that would be impenetrable by water and thus immune to osmotic blistering in the future. We hired Powerboats to do the peeling with their specialized gelcoat peeling machine.",

After hours of potholed tracks and sand, I find the existence of pavement and road signs not only deeply meaningful, but cause for pure joy. Even the traffic jam we get stuck in not far from our hotel is a relief: if we break down now there’ll be plenty of people to help us. The image of Roxanne’s dragging trunk can’t stifle my ecstasy when I step under a stream of hot water in our hotel bathroom. It swirls the sand and dust out of my hair, turning gritty and brown before it’s sucked down the drain, taking my bad mood of that long day with it. I chant, “Rest day, rest day. Rest! Day!” as the water pounds down. Right now I’m all for reveling in my deep pleasure that we will stay in one place for two nights, and ignoring the big stinking bull in my china shop: that when we drive out of UB, we’ll still need six more days to cross Mongolia.",

As they raced about, a few fell, cutting up their shins and calves. Mamen, young and highly athletic and in his prime, was also extremely competitive. Going for a ball and desperate to score a goal, he felt his knee pop. He’d injured it years before in a skiing crash, and now he could feel it burning and swelling, but he brushed it off and went back to the match, whose outcome actually meant something to him. In his journal, he made sure to record the following: “It ended with victory for my team … but I feel considerably worn out and fatigued.”",

The huts had kelly-green canvas walls, with rectangular holes cut out of them and covered with mosquito netting for windows. Each was named for an Australian native tree.

One of the Tibetans tied an apron around his waist, picked up his ax and set about his work. As he did so, a gaggle of onlookers—most of them Chinese tourists from Hong Kong—started to inch closer to the sacred ground, chattering as they went. The man muttered something to himself, but continued about his task. Still, however, the visitors edged closer, giggling and whispering at the sight. The Tibetan stopped what he was doing, the gossip continued. And then, of a sudden, with a bloodcurdling shriek, the man whirled around and shouted again and, waving a piece of reddened flesh, he came after the visitors like a demon, slicing the air with his knife and screaming curses at their blasphemy. The tourists turned on their heels; still the Tibetan gave chase, reviling them for their irreverence. Terrified, the Chinese retreated to a safe position. The man stood before them, glowering.",

But perhaps her air was the inevitable result of the social rise which had advanced her from a cottage to a large house and fields. The case is not unexampled in high places.
