I’d just got a fire started after a 6 mile hike down river. Well, I figured, she got herself in a trap, so I went to looking for her. Found her 3 hours later, almost to Errol’s cabin with her right front paw in a number 4 doublespring. It was frozen solid. My lantern had run out of fuel and there was no moon. We ran to Errol’s cabin where I soaked her paw in lukewarm water for about an hour. It swelled plumb up as big as a cat track, but today it started to blister and I think it may heal. The swelling’s gone down a bit. Poor ole Molly Blue!",

On this occasion he let himself go, but he didn't really say anything in an entire half-hour except that knickers were immodest and that any girl wearing them rendered herself ludicrous and unwomanly. He did not, I marked with interest, forbid them. He didn't say anything that Dad would have to resent legally. He merely advised females against wearing pants, on the general grounds of morality, world civilization, and taste. Then he came to a stop, blew his nose, and started off the stage, with an avuncular wave of the hand to signify that we could adjourn. An English teacher ran up the steps and whispered to him frantically. Mr. Clarke clapped his hands to call us back, and walked to the center of the platform.",

Yet not one single house from Byzantine Constantinople still stands. Even the two largest Imperial palace complexes, the Great Palace and the Palace of Blanchernae, have disappeared but for a few arches, a line of windows, some buried foundations and a few splendid floor mosaics.",

In the hotel bar – carpeted with cigarette ends, bottle tops, crisp packets – the atmosphere was not welcoming. At 3 p.m. a dozen or so scruffy men and women, already half-drunk, greeted me by demanding beers all round. When I claimed to be short of cash one elderly man lurched to the counter and appropriated my half-full bottle of Castle. Then a younger man moved to the stool beside me. ‘Let’s share!’ said he, and took a swig from my glass. Retrieving it, I withdrew to the stoep, the preserve of the élite, where well-dressed youngish men, some with stylish briefcases between their feet, occupied a long bench. When I sat on the end my reception was cool. However, several spoke English – ungrammatical but graphic – and soon I was making progress. Two MK returnees from Uganda, very angry young men, were not at all interested in ‘amalgamation’ with the SANDF. If things don’t quickly change, they foretold, the growling Young Lions will show their claws. ‘People says justice comes but we can’t see it. Where has they hid it? We know! It’s hid for them and their white friends! We listen about “economic empowerment” for blacks. For what blacks? For them who make deals with white friends!’ And so on …",

Certain mechanical improvements might have been noticed in the roundabouts and highfliers, machines for testing rustic strength and weight, and in the erection devoted to shooting for nuts. But the real business of the fair had considerably dwindled. The new periodical great markets of neighbouring towns were beginning to interfere seriously with the trade carried on here for centuries. The pens for sheep, the tie-ropes for horses, were about half as long as they had been. The stalls of tailors, hosiers, coopers, linen-drapers, and other such trades had almost disappeared, and the vehicles were far less numerous. The mother and daughter threaded the crowd for some little distance, and then stood still.",

Soon I was overtaken by another platoon in full battledress, half-running, their sweating faces ugly with hate. Waving rifles and staves, they shouted threateningly at everybody and one deliberately kicked me as he passed. Then they were out of sight, over the dip in the road where it descended to the Catholic mission. At the end of the main street two complacent-looking well-dressed urban types, wearing KANU badges in their lapels, stood conferring by the kerb. Both shrugged and turned away when I ventured to ask, ‘What’s happening?’ A moment later several shots came from the direction of the mission. There was an odd non-reaction; no one retreated into doorways, no one exchanged words. I stood still, acutely aware of being de trop, a resented witness. Then a young clergyman, hurrying around the corner, noticed me and stopped. ‘Leave this place,’ he said. ‘Come with me.’",

There was a steady drip coming from the transmission, and he yelled up to Gillian to take her out of gear and shut her down. The transmission seal was leaking badly, and he knew that the transmission didn’t hold a lot of oil and could seize if it ran dry.

    "target_paragraph": "Mango Crisp\nThe perfect dessert when you have an embarrassment of mangoes. (And when you don’t, you can substitute berries—blueberries, raspberries, strawberries—for some of the mango.) Although not an option on Receta (our boat freezer wouldn’t keep ice cream), the crisp is delicious with vanilla ice cream. Alternatively, serve with lightly whipped cream, lightly sweetened sour cream or yogurt, or crème fraîche. (See Tips, below.)\nFor the topping\n1⁄2 cup flour\n3⁄4 cup quick-cooking or old-fashioned oats\n2⁄3 cup packed brown sugar\n1⁄4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\n2 tablespoons finely chopped crystallized ginger\n1⁄3 cup cold butter\nFor the fruit\n6 cups sliced ripe mango (about 3–4 mangoes, depending on size)\n1 1⁄2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice\n1⁄4 cup packed brown sugar (approx.)\n2 tablespoons flour\n1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter a 2-quart (8-inch-square) baking dish.\n2. Prepare the topping: In a large bowl, combine flour, oats, brown sugar, nutmeg, and crystallized ginger. Cut in cold butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Set aside.\n3. Toss the mango with the lime juice. Combine sugar and flour, and toss with fruit. Taste and adjust sweetness if desired. Spread fruit in the prepared dish.\n4. Sprinkle topping evenly over fruit. Bake in preheated oven for about 40–50 minutes, until the fruit is bubbling and the topping is crisp and lightly browned. Serve warm.\nServes 8\nTips\n• For a nutty topping, toss about 1⁄2 cup slivered almonds with the topping mixture.\n• To make crème fraîche, combine 2 cups whipping cream and 1 cup sour cream in a nonmetallic bowl, cover with plastic, and let stand at room temperature for 16–24 hours or until thickened. Refrigerate until serving.\n• To make your own crystallized ginger, peel ginger, slice into 1⁄4-inch-thick slices, and boil in cane syrup or sugar syrup (see this page) for 20 minutes. Remove from syrup, drain, and roll in granulated sugar. Allow to air dry on a rack, then keep in a tightly closed jar.",

Reed canoes bobbed here and there in the tranquil water and a few fishing boats filed out through the lake’s entrance. The wind was very cold and the smothering, leaden sky seemed to replicate our state of mind. Although we had come directly to Puno without stopping in Ilave, and had secured temporary lodging and a good meal at the local barracks, our luck seemed to have run out. Very politely the commanding officer had shown us the door, explaining that as this was a border checkpoint foreign civilians were strictly forbidden from staying overnight.",

During several years Macmaster had been borrowing hundreds at a time from Tietjens. The affair with Mrs Duchemin had cost her lover a good deal; he had week-ended almost continuously in Rye at the expensive hostel. Moreover, the famous Friday parties for geniuses had been going on for several years now, and these had meant new furnishings, bindings, carpets, and loans to geniuses—at any rate before Macmaster had had the ear of the Royal Bounty. So the sum had grown to £2,000, and now to guineas. And, from that date, the Macmasters had not offered any repayment.",

In the middle of the room swam up to the surface what seemed to be a table with a ring round it; and then the vague amorphous shapes of armchair and table emerged. But everything was disguised. On top of the wardrobe stood three white busts; the chest of drawers was surmounted by a bookcase; the bookcase was pasted over with crimson merino; the washing-table had a coronal of shelves upon it; on top of the shelves that were on top of the washing-table stood two more busts. Nothing in the room was itself; everything was something else. Even the window-blind was not a simple muslin blind; it was a painted fabric with a design of castles and gateways and groves of trees, and there were several peasants taking a walk. Looking-glasses further distorted these already distorted objects so that there seemed to be ten busts of ten poets instead of five; four tables instead of two. And suddenly there was a more terrifying confusion still. Suddenly Flush saw staring back at him from a hole in the wall another dog with bright eyes flashing, and tongue lolling! He paused amazed. He advanced in awe.",

And it really was a ship, a small one maybe, but big enough to be properly called a ship, I’d say.

All the surrounding mountains were too sheer for snow to lie on their grey-brown flanks and when the sky suddenly became overcast, at about one o’clock, the landscape acquired an aura of menacing desolation. A razor-keen wind rose, blowing against us, and I tightened my scarf, zipped my parka and put on my gloves. We were the only travellers on a track covered with the sort of frozen slush which jeeps hate. Nor did Hallam like it much. He soon began to flag – and when he flags he flags. We had covered the first twelve miles in three and a half hours but the last nine took five hours; yet Rachel walked about six miles, both to spare her mount and to restore her circulation. Apart from our kit, Hallam is now carrying over forty pounds of food: flour, sugar, milk, rice and dahl. However, we are spending two nights here so he can have a day off tomorrow and devote himself to eating the abundant (though inferior) hay supplied by the chowkidar at Rs.10 for a man’s load.",

In 1927, the iconic sign on the hillside above the city actually said HOLLYWOODLAND. It had been erected in 1923 to advertise a real estate development and had nothing to do with motion pictures. The letters, each over forty feet high, were in those days also traced out with electric lights. (The LAND was removed in 1949.)",

Since Amherst had won his point about the mills, the danger he had foreseen had been realized: his victory at Westmore had been a defeat at Lynbrook. It would be too crude to say that his wife had made him pay for her public concession by the private disregard of his wishes; and if something of this sort had actually resulted, his sense of fairness told him that it was merely the natural reaction of a soft nature against the momentary strain of self-denial. At first he had been hardly aware of this consequence of his triumph. The joy of being able to work his will at Westmore obscured all lesser emotions; and his sentiment for Bessy had long since shrunk into one of those shallow pools of feeling which a sudden tide might fill, but which could never again be the deep perennial spring from which his life was fed.",

There was a large crowd around it, and baskets and sacks were being tied on to the roof and shoved beneath the seats. The bus was an old commuter vehicle from China, and the original floor had been ripped out to allow more room for storage. When I sat on my seat my legs dangled way above a makeshift wooden platform. The front windscreen was plastered with stickers, small posters and photographs of revered holy sites around Burma; among them were the golden hanging rock of Kyaik-tyo, said to have been put in place by a wizard king, and the solitary peak of Mount Popa, which rises from the central plains and is home to the nat spirits. There were jewel-encrusted Buddha images, owls folded out of banknotes, and spiralling Pali inscriptions. I sat next to an elderly man smoking a long cheroot. He wore a broad-brimmed felt hat, and had thrown a bright pink towel around his shoulders. Passengers filed on to the bus in a steady stream of anoraks, scarves and towels. Two soldiers carrying muskets with wooden stocks and roughly hewn iron fittings squeezed their way through the sacks of vegetables and the wandering chickens to check ID cards, and eventually settled into specially reserved seats at the front.",
