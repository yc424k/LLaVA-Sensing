The headstone of a child’s grave, that of James Bertrand Petley, who was born in Mandalay in 1901 and buried here in 1903, had been badly whitewashed, as if someone had poured a bucket of paint over it. A mysterious half-burned candle stood on the otherwise neglected headstone of Edith Henrietta Homer, who died here in her mid-forties in 1921. Nearby, one tomb had been completely dug up. As I peered into the macabre hole, I was startled by a young Burmese man walking towards me across the empty cemetery. His hair was neatly parted, and in one hand he held a rolled-up geography textbook, which he beat against his other hand like a truncheon. ‘Black magic,’ he informed me when I asked if he knew why the grave had been dug up. He showed me other graves that were covered in obscene graffiti, and still others where unknown hands had tried to piece the splintered stones together like jigsaw puzzles. If I wanted to know more I should ask at the church, he said, pointing to a nearby bell tower.",

Stone, rock and ice are significantly less amenable to the hand’s touch than to the mind’s eye, and the mountains of the earth have often turned out to be more resistant, more fatally real, than the mountains of the mind. As Herzog discovered on Annapurna, and I discovered on the Lagginhorn, the mountains one gazes at, reads about, dreams of and desires are not the mountains one climbs. These are matters of hard, steep, sharp rock and freezing snow; of extreme cold; of a vertigo so physical it can cramp your stomach and loosen your bowels; of hypertension, nausea and frostbite; and of unspeakable beauty.",

Before that, for various arcane reasons mostly to do with regional distrust and envy, Australian railroad lines employed different gauges. New South Wales had rails 4 feet 81/2 inches apart. Victoria opted for a more commodious 5 feet 3 inches. Queensland and Western Australia economically decided on a standard of 3 feet 6 inches (a width not far off that of amusement park rides; people must have ridden with their legs out the windows). South Australia, inventively, had all three. Five times on any journey between the east and west coasts passengers and freight had to be off-loaded from one train and redeposited on another, a mad and tedious process. Finally sanity was mustered and an all-new line was built. It is the second longest line in the world, after Russia’s Trans-Siberian.",

But his shyness, his sensitiveness only made him more aimless and awkward, a tiresome clown, slack and uncontrolled, witless. All day long his mother shouted and shrilled and scolded at him, or hit him angrily. He did not mind, he came up like a cork, warm and roguish and curiously appealing.

At the far end of the town we found a filthy tea-house where lukewarm tea cost fifty paise a cup, as compared to thirty-five down-country. The smoke-blackened ceiling of this big, twilit room was supported by six tree-trunks and the floor was of beaten earth. Several men, wearing Chitrali caps and wrapped in blankets, were noisily using thick chapattis to mop up meagre helpings of stewed goat in chilli-hot gravy. They spat pieces of gristle on to the floor and viewed us with amused contempt. My memories of Gilgit town’s particular brand of passive unfriendliness were immediately revived.",

Planes used to fly from here to bomb the Germans during the war. Lena said she remembered when she was a girl there were big reunions of pilots who had been stationed here, and they sometimes did air shows and flew low over the dairy barns. Putting in my two cents, I added that some of the planes those pilots flew during the war had been built in the city of Detroit, not far from where I grew up, and that they had been flown here from Alaska and across Siberia as part of the Lend-Lease program. My attempt to join the Great Patriotic War conversation met with silence. America lost four hundred thousand people in the war, a frightening number; but Russia’s dead numbered about twenty million. To many Russians, America’s participation in the war was that of a bystander who holds the combatants’ coats and steps in at the end to finish off the loser.",

I sit beneath a Plexiglas hatch that looks like a boxy jet canopy. From here I can steer with an inside tiller, adjust the sails by reaching out through the open washboard to the cleats and winches beside the hatch, and keep watch, all at the same time. In addition, I can look at the chart on the table below me, chat on the radio beside me, or cook up a meal on the galley stove, all without leaving my seat. Despite the acrobatics of the sea, the cabin remains relatively comfortable. Save for an occasional drip of water feeling its way through the crevices of the hatch, my surroundings are dry. The air hangs heavy with the dampness of the coming storm, but the varnished wood of the cabin glows warmly in the soft light. The shapes contained in the wood grain become animals, people, companions. They calm me. The small amount of coffee that I manage to transfer from my lurching cup to my mouth warms me and props my eyes open. My stomach, made of some non-corroding, inexplodable, and otherwise nonimpressionable alloy, does not yearn for a dry biscuit diet; instead, I eat heartily and plan for my birthday dinner two days from now. I can’t bake a cake, having no oven, but I will have a go at chocolate crêpes. I’ll stir a tin of rabbit I’ve saved into a curry, ignoring the French superstition that even the slightest mention of lapin assures a crew the most wretched luck.",

He was moved in spite of himself by that note of passion and sorrow unknown on the more refined stage of European politics. But when the tall Antonia, advancing with her light step in the dimness of the big bare Sala of the Avellanos house, offered him her hand (in her emancipated way), and murmured, “I am glad to see you here, Don Martin,” he felt how impossible it would be to tell these two people that he had intended to go away by the next month’s packet. Don José, meantime, continued his praises. Every accession added to public confidence, and, besides, what an example to the young men at home from the brilliant defender of the country’s regeneration, the worthy expounder of the party’s political faith before the world! Everybody had read the magnificent article in the famous Parisian Review. The world was now informed: and the author’s appearance at this moment was like a public act of faith. Young Decoud felt overcome by a feeling of impatient confusion. His plan had been to return by way of the United States through California, visit Yellowstone Park, see Chicago, Niagara, have a look at Canada, perhaps make a short stay in New York, a longer one in Newport, use his letters of introduction. The pressure of Antonia’s hand was so frank, the tone of her voice was so unexpectedly unchanged in its approving warmth, that all he found to say after his low bow was—",

The Tore are saturated with springs which dry up, for the most part, in summer, but there must be a permanent supply of liquid between the porous “pietra morta” and the impenetrable limestone. To Ivan Nicolaevitch it seemed a simple matter to tap this reservoir by means of artesian wells sunk through a few feet of sandstone, and a profitable one, seeing that the villages are largely dependent on rain water collected in cisterns which is apt to fail or to become tainted, although living eels are kept in them for purposes of “purification.” But I should like to see the faces of the gentlemen of the ‘municipio’ if his proposal were submitted to them. No doubt the water of clean cisterns is purer and cooler than this surface-flow, but they are not always kept as they should be; many hundred people draw their supply from one not far from here which was recently found to contain 1440 microorganisms to the cubic centimetre.",

Talking about that thing he used for a pistol, that he dropped or throwed it away while he was running through that back yard. Eef Bishop let me look at it. That Memphis feller was right. It didn’t even look like a pistol. It looked like a old old mud-crusted cooter. It had two shells in it, the hull and another live one. The cap of the hull was punched all right, only it and the live one both had a little nick jest outside the cap, both of the nicks jest alike and even in the same place, so that when Eef taken the live one out and turned the hull a little and set it back under the hammer and cocked it and snapped it and we opened the cylinder, there was another of them little nicks in the case jest outside the cap, like sometimes that moss-back firing-pin would hit the cap and sometimes it wouldn’t. So it looks like Mink either tried out both of them shells before hand for practice test and both of them snapped once, yet he still walked in there to kill Flem jest hoping one of them would go off this time, which dont sound reasonable; or that he stood there in front of Flem and snapped maybe both of them at him and then turned the cylinder back to try again since that was all he had left he could do at that moment, and this time one of them went off. In that case, what do you reckon Flem’s reason was for setting there in that chair letting Mink snap them two shells at him until one of them went off and killed him?”",

Particularly delicious were the homemade antipasti with unusual uses of the onion, and the chef’s ‘nduja was exquisite. Originally made only in the nearby village of Spilinga, this spicy salami is now found all over Calabria and often tops the pizza calabrese. The ‘nduja is also spread on bruschetti and served on pasta. Made with pork lard, guanciale (cheek) and pancetta (bacon) mixed with the local peperoncino (hot pepper), the salami that is prepared and eaten in Tropea has a creamy consistency with a spicy, intense flavor. I had sampled the ‘nduja many times before, but nothing compared to what I consumed in that mom and pop establishment.",

    "target_paragraph": "Then there was more rattling and more grinding; and then again he was stood down on a stable floor; the darkness opened; light poured over him; he found himself alive, awake, bewildered, standing on reddish tiles in a vast bare room flooded with sunshine. He ran hither and thither smelling and touching. There was no carpet and no fireplace. There were no sofas, no armchairs, no bookcases, no busts. Pungent and unfamiliar smells tickled his nostrils and made him sneeze. The light, infinitely sharp and clear, dazzled his eyes. He had never been in a room – if this were indeed a room – that was so hard, so bright, so big, so empty. Miss Barrett looked smaller than ever sitting on a chair by a table in the midst. Then Wilson took him out of doors. He found himself almost blinded, first by the sun, then by the shadow. One half of the street was burning hot; the other bitterly cold. Women went by wrapped in furs, yet they carried parasols to shade their heads. And the street was dry as bone. Though it was now the middle of November there was neither mud nor puddle to wet his paws or clot their feathers. There were no areas and no railings. There was none of that heady confusion of smells that made a walk down Wimpole Street or Oxford Street so distracting. On the other hand, the strange new smells that came from sharp stone corners, from dry yellow walls, were extraordinarily pungent and queer. Then from behind a black swinging curtain came an astonishing sweet smell, wafted in clouds; he stopped, his paws raised, to savour it; he made to follow it inside; he pushed in beneath the curtain. He had one glimpse of a booming light-sprinkled hall, very high and hollow; and then Wilson with a cry of horror, jerked him smartly back. They went on down the street again. The noise of the street was deafening. Everybody seemed to be shouting shrilly at the same moment. Instead of the solid and soporific hum of London there was a rattling and a crying, a jingling and a shouting, a cracking of whips and a jangling of bells. Flush leapt and jumped this way and that, and so did Wilson. They were forced on and off the pavement twenty times, to avoid a cart, a bullock, a troop of soldiers, a drove of goats. He felt younger, spryer than he had done these many years. Dazzled, yet exhilarated, he sank on the reddish tiles and slept more soundly than he had ever slept in the back bedroom at Wimpole Street upon pillows.",

I had cracked a rib, possibly two, but this seemed a minor impediment to walking. And the bicycle could, with some botched repairs, be just about persuaded to move. So I cycled on to Linton, slowly. A warning, I thought superstitiously, had been issued to me: that the going would not be easy, and that romanticism would be quickly punished. It was only a few miles later that I remembered the letter a friend had sent me when I told him about my plan to walk the Icknield Way. Take care as you pass the ring-fort, he had written back. When I mentioned the fall later, he was unamazed. ‘This was an entry fee to the old ways, charged at one of the usual tollbooths,’ he said. ‘Now you can proceed. You’re in. Bone for chalk: you’ve paid your due.’ It was the first of several incidents along the old ways that I still find hard to explain away rationally.",

But I couldn’t get it to work. After a whole lot of pumping, there were still air bubbles in the line. Whenever my father did this, he always got rid of the air. What else did he do when the engine quit? Maybe he changed the filter? This was easier said than done. He had given me a special extractor that wound around the filter with a handle to give leverage. I slid it on and pushed and pulled. No response. I pushed a little harder. Still nothing. I positioned my foot on the handle and exerted all my force, twisting the filter canister out of shape, and then gave up. Two weeks later, in Bermuda, a mechanic who had to remove the filter with a vice grip told me I had been trying to unscrew it in the wrong direction.",
