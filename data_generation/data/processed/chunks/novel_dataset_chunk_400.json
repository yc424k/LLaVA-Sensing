This is a bad idea, because you have to step down when exiting a light aircraft, and soon he was sprawled in a puddle. Fortunately he was unconcerned about his dignity and only worried that his precious binoculars might be damaged. Having ascertained that they were not, he introduced me to the other two, who had stoutly British names that I can’t remember but were something like Basil and Rosemary.",

His large dark eyes were shining now with a deeper, fiercer light than they had had before, and on his pale cheeks there was a flush of angry colour. And now he no longer had to force himself to listen to what Hunt was saying: anger had fanned his energy and his interest to a burning flame; he listened tensely, his ears seemed almost to prick forward on his head, from time to time he dug his fork viciously into the tablecloth. Once or twice, it seemed that he would interrupt. He cleared his throat, bent forward, nervously clutching the table with his claw-like hands, but each time ended up thrusting his fingers through his mop of hair, and gulping down a glass of wine.",

The Incas transformed steep hillsides into steps of flat areas using thousands of stones and a lot of digging. The purpose was presumably to grow food and/or graze their animals.

She could hear silence in a thick rustling as he moved toward her through it, thrusting it aside, and she began to say Something is going to happen to me. She was saying it to the old man with the yellow clots for eyes. “Something is happening to me!” she screamed at him, sitting in his chair in the sunlight, his hands crossed on the top of the stick. “I told you it was!” she screamed, voiding the words like hot silent bubbles into the bright silence about them until he turned his head and the two phlegm-clots above her where she lay tossing and thrashing on the rough, sunny boards. “I told you! I told you all the time!”",

He had performed this feat on a massive roadster of the sort issued to policemen, carrying with him 150 lb. of baggage.

Four trips later I collapse in an attic room with a panoramic view of the coast, make tea, crack open a bag of freeze dried food and watch the rain pelt down. In a vain attempt to reduce the fumes wafting off my panniers, I take a bag of clothes to the laundry around the corner. No dice: two days. The pub on the corner is more forthcoming with beer, brightening life. My room is cosy. I am excited. The mainland tour has been fun.

The Vicar soon abandoned the struggle; but the tutor, who spoke the most fluent and accomplished English, gallantly continued to pour it out to her until the ladies, to the manifest relief of all concerned, went up to the drawing-room.",

But the shrill laughter of the children grated on his ears, and the bright pitiless sunlight mocked his sorrow, and a dull odour of strange spices, spices such as embalmers use, seemed to taint—or was it fancy?—the clear morning air. He buried his face in his hands, and when the Infanta looked up again the curtains had been drawn, and the King had retired.",

On the twenty- eighth of August, at the hour of midnight, and if the moon is shining— the moon must be shining— a spirit that has haunted these shores for ages rises up from the Gulf.

His search has always hitherto been fruitless, and he has sunk back, disheartened, into the sea. But to-night he found Mrs. Pontellier. Perhaps he will never wholly release her from the spell. Perhaps she will never again suffer a poor, unworthy earthling to walk in the shadow of her divine presence.”",

It was divided by partitions into two rooms—the kitchen and the General’s bedroom. This tiny room, ten by twenty feet, was the heart of the\nConstitutionalist army.

It was painted a dirty gray. On the walls were tacked photographs of showy ladies in theatrical poses, a large picture of Carranza, one of Fierro, and a picture of Villa himself.

That was all....",

To the west this deep hollow was bounded by a silver limestone wall, 300 feet high and topped by a frieze of frosted dwarf pines glittering against the deep blue sky – and ridiculously reminding me of a punk hair-do. Slim spruce saplings covered the steep slope on my right, each supple young branch bent under its sparkling snow burden. I stopped to drink from an ice-fringed stream; urban life had so deconditioned me that I was sweat-soaked, despite a steely cold wind. Then I paused to examine an old shingle-roofed shepherd’s hut – built generations ago but still sound, the thick spruce beams preserved by their own resin. The only nails used were of yew-wood; the yew, known in Moldavia as ‘the iron-tree’, is now a protected species because of its slow growth-rate. On the last precipitous climb to the massif’s long summit, slight breathlessness reminded me that I was now at 5,000 feet.",

She met Gerty’s lamentable eyes, fixed on her in a despairing effort at consolation, and the look brought her to herself. There was something to be done before she left the house: to be done with all the nobility she knew how to put into such gestures.

We drew up at the back of the Palace, where a canvas screen is always stretched at night to conceal the King’s private entrance and form a small enclosure in which he may walk. A servant was awaiting me here and guided me behind, where another white-clad servant, a good-looking boy with very bright teeth and a single ear-ring, took charge and beckoned me past the sentries and up the steps to an enormous plaster porch. I followed him through the entrance, and found myself in a small dark stone room which contained a cow.",

The impressive stonework?including five stone fountains?was crowned by an Inca overlook that took in Salcantay and most of the other important peaks near Machu Picchu.

It did not take us long to appreciate that we had been stranded in one of the most beautiful places that either of us had ever seen. We roamed along mud-walled alleyways, past a set of perfect mediaeval street scenes: blacksmith’s hammering, children playing in broken donkey carts, old ladies in smocks sitting beside the road, nuts and dried apricots laid out in front of them. Men bent under the weight of shoulder poles staggered home carrying water from irrigation runnels; a boy squatted on his hams drawing in the dust with a bent stick. Aksakal, the white-beards, set out in groups of three to take the evening air. They were dressed in flowing robes of khaki serge, tied loosely at the waist. On their heads they wore mountainous white turbans. Some had Caucasian features. When they greeted other aksakal coming in the opposite direction they would clasp each other’s hands, shake firmly, then stroke their beards with their right hands and conclude the ritual by touching themselves on the back of the neck.",

The sky above Kunming was smoky and yellow with dust but clear of Japanese planes; the day’s bombing had finished. Every day, ground crews scurried around shifting the runway markers, white-painted oil drums, and filling in new bomb craters to get ready for the arrival of the CNAC plane.",

She was trying to smash this thing lest it should grow more beautiful than she could bear.\n\"You see how I score by being shut up in Morfe. When I do get out it's no end of an adventure.\" (Was there ever such an idiot?)\nSuddenly she left off trying to smash the silence.\nThe silence made everything stand out with a supernatural clearness, the square, white-clothed table in the bay of the window, the Queen Anne fluting on the Britannia metal teapot, the cups and saucers and plates, white with a gentian blue band, The King's Head stamped in gold like a crest.\nSitting there so still he had the queer effect of creating for both of you a space of your own, more real than the space you had just stepped out of. There, there and not anywhere else, these supernaturally clear things had reality, a unique but impermanent reality. It would last as long as you sat there and would go when you went. You knew that whatever else you might forget you would remember this.\nThe rest of the room, the other tables and the people sitting at them were not quite real. They stood in another space, a different and inferior kind of space.\n\"I came first of all,\" he said, \"to bring you that.\"\nHe took out of his pocket and put down between them the thin, new white parchment book of her Poems.\n\"Oh … Poor thing, I wonder what'll happen to it?\" Funny—it was the least real thing. If it existed at all it existed somewhere else, not in this space, not in this time. If you took it up and looked at it the clearness, the unique, impermanent reality would be gone, and you would never get it again.",

The enclosure is enormous, large enough so that when I am inside it, I can’t see any of the edges and I get lost, panicking because I have Matt or Damon on my heels and I can’t find my way out. The birds in the aviary next door seem to find this hilariously funny. One macaw, Big Red, cackles with laughter, and his sidekick, a little blue parrot, screams, “Don’t do that!” whenever my boots gets stuck in the mud. Which they do, a lot, because it’s ankle deep and sucks and burps like the Bog of Eternal Stench. I can’t believe how many different shades of mud there are. It blows my mind as I stare at the ground, trying to shovel poo, but the spade Gustave has given me is broken, cracked with no handle.",

We played a lot of tennis, and rode the horses, or just tipped our chairs back in the gardens, a servant always positioned behind a bush with an eye on our glasses. We ate our meals outside, at night next to the fountain, around a table lit by three candles in an old gold candelabra. We usually had dinner with Germán’s parents. They were delightful company, she very quick in her speech and observations, he laconic and mischievous. At Los Lingues I looked through a window onto a very particular aspect of Chile. Life there was a manifestation of a continuous and very old tradition – the oldest tradition, except for that of the indigenous people. Once or twice someone talked about what had been taken away from them, and how much they had clawed back. I couldn’t bring myself to question too closely; among the Chilean upper classes it is the most keenly felt subject. But Los Lingues had survived, and they had survived – they always would.",

There are no words to describe her save the old ones that have served so often to picture the bygone heroine of romance and the fair lady of our dreams. There was nothing subtle or hidden about her charms; her beauty was all there, flaming and apparent: the spun- gold hair that comb nor confining pin could restrain; the blue eyes that were like nothing but sapphires; two lips that pouted, that were so red one could only think of cherries or some other delicious crimson fruit in looking at them. She was growing a little stout, but it did not seem to detract an iota from the grace of every step, pose, gesture. One would not have wanted her white neck a mite less full or her beautiful arms more slender.",

Sinker Jordan cadged small sums from the other checkers, and lived miserably on bottled pop and cheese at a little grocery across the road from the pier. Eugene was unable to beg or borrow. Partly from pride, but more from the powerful brooding inertia of his temper, which more and more was governing his will to act, he found himself unable to speak. Each day he said: ‘I shall speak to one of them today. I shall say that I must eat, and that I have no money.’ But when he tried to speak he could not.",
