While they chopped, stirred, seasoned, and tasted, I slowly unpacked my two-ounce dehydrated package of something-or-other, tossed it in a pot, added water, and put it on a burner. Voila, a meal?bland, yet warm and filling. As I repeatedly lifted fork to mouth, I thought about my joy in completing this difficult hike?and getting some food in my empty stomach. Exhausted after dinner, I went directly to my unheated cabin where, under four heavy blankets, I fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.",

    "target_paragraph": "At the frontier all was pandemonium. Government police had moved in to supervise its hundred-million-dollar annual revenue, and a machine-gun perched on a truck looked down on a mob of customs officials. After an hour our bus crept past a last barrier. The way swarmed with money-changers. The red, green and black of the Afghan flag gave way to the red, green and white of Iran, and the photogenic smile of President Karzai was replaced by the painted scowl of Ayatollah Khomeini and the owlish confusion of Supreme Leader Khamenei. The lorries were banked up five abreast for quarter of a mile, heavy with the shipment containers of evil memory, and piled with cement, Mitsubishi trucks, steel rods, Nestlé bottled water…\nThe Iranian police, dapper in bottle green, boarded our bus in twos and threes, glittering with suspicion, hunting for the opium which leaked like bacilli across the border. Iran had over a million addicts, and its frontiers teemed with armed guards. (Many of the Afghan opium-carriers who took to the mule tracks by night never returned.) The policemen’s screwdrivers tapped and rang over dashboard, bulkhead, engine. Our cases and sacks–and my worn-out rucksack–were dragged out, rolled past a scanner, then disembowelled. But my dollars, curled in their bottle of mosquito repellent, stayed undetected.\nThen, just as our bus was easing free, it was flagged down again, and the real search started. We were stood against a wall, as if to be shot, with our baggage at our feet. The Afghans looked bitter and depleted. Many of their passports had been signed by the illiterate with a thumbprint. When an officer realised I was a Westerner, I was motioned aside, guiltily exempt, with women and mewling children, while the men were ordered to take off their shoes, then sharply frisked. The bags were emptied again into the dust, spilling out their intimacies: spangled shoes and bras and family photographs. The few goods people were carrying for sale, the small exchanges of the Silk Road–pistachio nuts, woollen coats–were fingered, questioned, valued, then at last, mostly, returned. Two hours later our decrepit bus, nosing through stranded trucks, emerged on to the plains of Khorasan.",

    "target_paragraph": "A peddler from Parral came into town with a mule-load of macuche,—you smoke macuche when you can’t get tobacco,—and we strolled down with the rest of the population to get the news. This was in Magistral, a Durango mountain village three days’ ride from the railroad. Somebody bought a little macuche, the rest of us borrowed from him, and we sent a boy for some corn-shucks. Everybody lit up, squatting around the peddler three deep; for it was weeks since the town had heard of the Revolution. He was full of the most alarming rumors: that the Federals had broken out of Torreon and were headed this way, burning ranches and murdering pacificos; that the United States troops had crossed the Rio\nGrande; that Huerta had resigned; that Huerta was coming north to take charge of the Federal troops in person; that Pascual Orozco had been shot at Ojinaga; that Pascual Orozco was coming south with ten thousand colorados. He retailed these reports with a wealth of dramatic gesture, stamping around until his heavy brown-and-gold sombrero wabbled on his head, tossing his faded blue blanket over his shoulder, firing imaginary rifles and drawing imaginary swords, while his audience murmured: \"Ma!\" and \"Adio!\" But the most interesting rumor was that\nGeneral Urbina would leave for the front in two days. A hostile Arab named Antonio Swayfeta happened to be driving to Parral in a two-wheeled gig the next morning, and allowed me to go with him as far as Las Nieves, where the General lives. By afternoon we had climbed out of the mountains to the great upland plain of Northern Durango, and were jogging down the mile-long waves of yellow prairie, stretching away so far that the grazing cattle dwindled into dots and finally disappeared at the base of the wrinkled purple mountains that seemedclose enough to hit with a thrown stone. The Arab’s hostility had thawed, and he poured out his life’s story, not one word of which I could understand. But the drift of it, I gathered, was largely commercial. He had once been to El Paso and regarded it as the world’s most beautiful city. But business was better in Mexico. They say that there are few Jews in Mexico because they cannot stand the competition of the Arabs. \nWe passed only one human being all that day—a ragged old man astride a burro, wrapped in a red-and-black checked serape, though without trousers, and hugging the broken stock of a rifle. Spitting, he volunteered that he was a soldier; that after three years of deliberation he had finally decided to join the Revolution and fight for\nLibertad. But at his first battle a cannon had been fired, the first he had ever heard; he had immediately started for his home in El Oro, where he intended to descend into a gold-mine and stay there until the war was over....",

Sadly, the rising temperatures also affect the tundra’s vegetation, the only source of food for our reindeer,’ he said. Indeed, the next day, Edward confirmed that in November 2013, 61,000 reindeer starved to death in the Yamal Peninsula. It marked the largest ‘mortality episode’ of reindeer ever recorded in the region. Earlier, in November 2006, 20,000 reindeer had succumbed to the famine. The immediate cause, according to the team of researchers, was an unusual ice barrier that smothered the reindeer pastures. Reindeer can stamp through ice about three-quarters of an inch thick, using their hooves to access the nutritious lichen and plants below. But, in early November 2006 and 2013, the ice was a lot deeper?several inches thick?too tough even for the reindeer’s sharp hoofs. The animals died of starvation.",

Jobs that we now aim to divide between two cat coordinators, an administrator, a volunteer coordinator, two cooks, a construction coordinator, a construction team, small-animal coordinators, one, two or even three vets, and a parque director.",

As Miklos was not due home for a week I left soon after, feeling grateful, in a way I could not express, for what had been an extraordinarily moving – and enlightening – interlude. This was, emotionally, the best balanced family I visited in Rumania, though among the most materially deprived. Certainly the Arpads would benefit from the conveniences of an urban bloc: running water, electricity, central heating, a gas cooker, a bathroom. Yet Anna was emphatic that she would not wish to exchange her quiverful for mod. cons. And this affection-ruled though spartan home seemed to me to offer a better start in life than the standard bloc family. Filling one’s quiver so amply at the end of the twentieth century is not commendable. But – current social responsibilities apart – large families do provide some advantages. Not least are the cultivation of good manners (i.e., consideration for others) and an easy acceptance of a share of responsibility for running the communal show. Is it a coincidence that both those qualities have dwindled where family sizes have dwindled?",

My expectations frankly were not high, but in fact it was splendid. It’s run by the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory. What they have done is re-create over a large area three primary desert habitats—one that is very dry, one that gets a little moisture, and one that is normally dry but occasionally is swept by flash floods. This alone provided a worthwhile lesson—it makes you realize that deserts in their quiet, arid way are as varied as other environments—but I was also grateful to find various shrubs and other plants labeled and explained. It was a pleasure to be able to say, “Ah, so that’s kangaroo paw. Well, I never. And let’s see if this spinifex really does hurt as much as Ernest Giles said. Why, yes, it does!”",

    "target_paragraph": "In 1990 I had detected little royalist feeling, but a year later strengthening pro-monarchy currents were perceptible throughout Transylvania and Moldavia. In part this seemed to be a reaction to ex-King Michael’s having been rudely refused permission to visit his family tomb near Bucharest at Christmas 1990. (Which refusal suggests that Iliescu then saw royalism as a not inconceivable future threat.) In both Cluj and Timisoara several prominently displayed wall posters called for the restoration of the monarchy, showing photographs in which the ex-King looked remarkably like his distant cousin, King George VI. Yet no one with any political nous allowed themselves to give in to this regressive yearning for a Hohenzollern. Ex-King Michael has no heir and it is impossible to imagine how a not-very-bright septuagenarian, on a dusted-down throne, could possibly solve any of Rumania’s problems. However, Communist denigration makes him seem ‘good’ and increasingly desirable as the polar opposite to Communism. To quote several of my friends, ‘He is the only person who could get rid of the Front’. Of course no one can suggest how he might achieve that. He couldn’t organise either a fair election or a civil war, even if he wanted to, and a royal edict would be unlikely to dislodge Iliescu & Co.",

Even in the early days when she had lived with her parents in a ragged outskirt of Apex, and hung on the fence with Indiana Frusk, the freckled daughter of the plumber “across the way,” she had cared little for dolls or skipping-ropes, and still less for the riotous games in which the loud Indiana played Atalanta4 to all the boyhood of the quarter. Already Undine’s chief delight was to “dress up” in her mother’s Sunday skirt and “play lady” before the wardrobe mirror. The taste had outlasted childhood, and she still practised the same secret pantomime, gliding in, settling her skirts, swaying her fan, moving her lips in soundless talk and laughter; but lately she had shrunk from everything that reminded her of her baffled social yearnings. Now, however, she could yield without afterthought to the joy of dramatizing her beauty. Within a few days she would be enacting the scene she was now mimicking; and it amused her to see in advance just what impression she would produce on Mrs. Fairford’s guests.",

Marta, which was covered by another army with the President-Dictator in its midst. Don José became quite animated with a great flow of speech, bending forward anxiously under the steady eyes of his daughter. Decoud, as if silenced by so much ardour, did not make a sound. The bells of the city were striking the hour of Oracion when the carriage rolled under the old gateway facing the harbour like a shapeless monument of leaves and stones. The rumble of wheels under the sonorous arch was traversed by a strange, piercing shriek, and Decoud, from his back seat, had a view of the people behind the carriage trudging along the road outside, all turning their heads, in sombreros and rebozos, to look at a locomotive which rolled quickly out of sight behind Giorgio Viola’s house, under a white trail of steam that seemed to vanish in the breathless, hysterically prolonged scream of warlike triumph. And it was all like a fleeting vision, the shrieking ghost of a railway engine fleeing across the frame of the archway, behind the startled movement of the people streaming back from a military spectacle with silent footsteps on the dust of the road. It was a material train returning from the Campo to the palisaded yards. The empty cars rolled lightly on the single track; there was no rumble of wheels, no tremor of the ground. The engine-driver, running past the Casa Viola with the salute of an uplifted arm, checked his speed smartly before entering the yard; and when the earsplitting screech of the steam whistle for the brakes had stopped, a series of hard, battering shocks, mingled with the clanking of chain-couplings, made a tumult of blows and shaken fetters under the vault of the gate.",

They would bring tests; and opportunities for Fräulein to see all her incapability. Fräulein had thrown her thick gauze veil back over her large hat and was walking with short footsteps, quickly along the centre of the roadway throwing out exclamations of delight, calling to the girls in a singing voice to cast away the winter, to fill their lungs, fill their hearts with spring.\nShe rallied them to observation.\nMiriam could not remember having seen men working in fields. They troubled her. They looked up with strange eyes. She wished they were not there. She wanted the fields to be still—and smaller. Still green fields and orchards ... woods....\nThey passed a farmyard and stopped in a cluster at the gate.\nThere was a moment of relief for her here. She could look easily at the scatter of poultry and the little pigs trotting and grunting about the yard. She talked to the nearest German girl, of these and of the calves standing in the shelter of a rick, carefully repeating the English names. As her eyes reached the rick she found that she did not know what to say. Was it hay or straw? What was the difference? She dreaded the day more and more.\nFräulein passed on leading the way, down the road hand-in-hand with Emma. The girls straggled after her.",

The main streets are always wide and the sun-soaked mud walls look golden under the violet blue of the Persian sky. Almost all the traffic consists of pony-phaeton taxis and innumerable laden donkeys and bicycles. The inevitable jube (a channel of water flowing between footpath and road) runs everywhere but on the whole the streets are quite clean and I’ve come to the conclusion that Persian water is safe if you make it clear you want to drink it, not wash with it. Anyway I’ve been drinking it uninhibitedly with no ill effects.",

My culinary adventures began with a wild goose hung for so short a time that the roasted version was as tender as a basketball and as palatable as a rubber tire. The beaver tail I grilled made us grateful we weren’t nineteenth century trappers, dependent on its dense white fat to keep us alive. My beaver haunch pot roast drew fairly favorable reviews, though the leftovers remained in the freezer for a year.",

    "target_paragraph": "Meanwhile, to assist the natives in their adjustment to the new social order, federal programs administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs have long provided support of various kinds, from food and clothing subsidies to social services—a tradition of plausible generosity that reached its supreme expression in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, widely described as the most openhanded and enlightened piece of legislation that has ever dealt with aboriginal people. While giving them a tenth of Alaska and about seventeen thousand dollars for each man, woman, and child, the act created a dozen regional native corporations to hold and invest roughly half the money, and to distribute the rest, on established schedules, to individuals and to village corporations. Doyon, Ltd., is in area the largest of the regional corporations, covering the whole of the Athapaskan interior and including about nine thousand people in thirty-four native villages, among them the Hungwitchin, each of whom is a Doyon stockholder. Doyon’s fine new headquarters in Fairbanks are spread out and spacious, and resemble the headquarters of almost any large Eastern company that has just moved to a meadow in Connecticut. It is Doyon that is drilling for oil in the upper-Yukon region—within a hundred miles of Eagle. Two wells have proved dry, at nine and eleven thousand feet, but Doyon is undissuaded.",

Here and there massive brown boulders emerged eerily from the earth, like subterranean creatures coming up for air, and occasionally I caught glimpses of the sea – a grey plain, cold and bleak. I drove and drove, thinking that any moment now I would encounter the fabled Maine of lobster-pots and surf-battered shores and lonely lighthouses standing on rocks of granite, but the towns I passed through were just messy and drear, and the countryside was wooded and unmemorable. Once, outside Falmouth, the road ran for a mile or so along a silvery bay with a long, low bridge leading over it to a landscape of snug farms nestled in a fold of hills, and I got briefly excited. But it was a false alarm and the landscape quickly grew dull again. The rest of the time the real Maine eluded me. It was always just over there, like the amusement parks my dad used to miss.",

It would seem as if the Italian instinct to get into rapid touch with the world were the healthy instinct after all. For in these isolated villages, which have been since time began far from any life-centre, there is an almost sordid look on the faces of the people.

And whatever he touched in that rich fortress of his soul sprang into golden life: as the years passed, the fruit trees – the peach, the plum, the cherry, the apple – grew great and bent beneath their clusters. His grape vines thickened into brawny ropes of brown and coiled down the high wire fences of his lot, and hung in a dense fabric, upon his trellises, roping his domain twice around. They climbed the porch end of the house and framed the upper windows in thick bowers. And the flowers grew in rioting glory in his yard – the velvet-leaved nasturtium, slashed with a hundred tawny dyes, the rose, the snowball, the red-cupped tulip, and the lily. The honey-suckle drooped its heavy mass upon the fence; wherever his great hands touched the earth it grew fruitful for him.",
