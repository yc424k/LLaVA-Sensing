At any minute now a sentinel might start up out of the chaparral. For about a mile I descended a steep road that was often the dried bed of a river, winding down between high mountains. It was a black night, without stars, and bitter cold. Finally, the mountains opened into a vast plain, and across that I could faintly see the tremendous range of the Cadena, and the pass that the Tropa was to guard. Barely three leagues beyond that pass lay Mapimi, held by twelve hundred Federals. But the hacienda was still hidden by a roll of the desert.",

On expanses of common land, yellow-brown in February, livestock mingle: pony-sized horses, wandering sheep, tethered goats, countless poultry. Rough tracks lead to once-magnificent mansions, now occupied by several families, with weeds and cacti sprouting from cracked walls. Not far off, modest affluence is suggested by new DIY homes, some only half-finished but already lived in. Footpaths winding through tall bushes lead to primitive shacks proving poverty. Even the remotest of these enjoy electricity, but not piped water. Their inhabitants, though adequately clad and well-groomed, are the sort of people Fidel had in mind when he spoke, at the 2003 Pedagogy Conference in Havana, about the ‘many very poor white families who migrated from rural areas to the cities’.",

I ran up and across the overpass and down the other side—my hackles didn’t lower until I was almost two miles away. I know how animals must feel near highways, I thought. Soon after my fight or flight response ebbed, I reached the sign for the Upper Goose Pond shelter, which was a half mile off trail.",

As we followed David through the two coach cars, 124 pairs of sunken eyes sullenly followed our every move.

He had the sleepy good looks – a rare smile with perfect teeth, thoughtful brown eyes – which one sees sometimes in Turkish travel posters. But what was truly Turkish about him was the physical repose with which he confronted the world. No Greek can sit still without fidgeting, tapping a foot or a pencil, jerking a knee, or making popping noises with his tongue. The Turk has a monolithic poise, an air of reptilian concentration and silence. It is with just such an air that a chameleon can sit, hour after hour, upon a shrub, staring unwinkingly at the world, living apparently in that state of suspended judgement which is summed up by the Arabic word kayf. I have seen Sabri loading logs, shouting at peasants, even running down a street; but never has he con­veyed the slightest feeling of energy being expended. His actions and words had the smoothness of inevitability; they flowed from him like honey from a spoon.",

Second off, you don’t have the moisture problem up here you have in the States.” He wears Sears’ thermal long johns under cotton coveralls, and his feet are kept warm by Indian-made mukluks with Bean’s felt insoles and a pair of wool socks. He rarely puts on his parka. “You have to worry up here more about overdressing than about underdressing. The problem is getting overheated.” Gradually, his clothes have become rags, with so many shreds, holes, and rips that they seem to cling to him only through loyalty. Everything is patched, and loose bits flap as he walks. His red chamois-cloth shirt has holes in the front, the back, and the sides. His green overalls are torn open at both knees. Half a leg is gone from his corduroy pants. His khaki down jacket is quilted with patches and has a long rip under one arm. His hooded sweatshirt hangs from him in tatters, spreads over him like the thrums of a mop. “I’ll tell you one thing about this country,” he says. “This country is hard on clothes.”",

    "target_paragraph": "During the two or three weeks which had passed since their walk, half a dozen notes from him had accumulated in her drawer. She would read them, and spend the whole morning in a daze of happiness; the sunny land outside the window being no less capable of analysing its own colour and heat than she was of analysing hers. In these moods she found it impossible to read or play the piano, even to move being beyond her inclination. The time passed without her noticing it. When it was dark she was drawn to the window by the lights of the hotel. A light that went in and out was the light in Terence’s window: there he sat, reading perhaps, or now he was walking up and down pulling out one book after another; and now he was seated in his chair again, and she tried to imagine what he was thinking about. The steady lights marked the rooms where Terence sat with people moving round him. Everyone who stayed in the hotel had a peculiar romance and interest about them. They were not ordinary people. She would attribute wisdom to Mrs Elliot, beauty to Susan Warrington, a splendid vitality to Evelyn M., because Terence spoke to them. As unreflecting and pervasive were the moods of depression. Her mind was as the landscape outside when dark beneath clouds and straitly lashed by wind and hail. Again she would sit passive in her chair exposed to pain, and Helen’s fantastical or gloomy words were like so many darts goading her to cry out against the hardness of life. Best of all were the moods when for no reason again this stress of feeling slackened, and life went on as usual, only with a joy and colour in its events that was unknown before; they had a significance like that which she had seen in the tree: the nights were black bars separating her from the days; she would have liked to run all the days into one long continuity of sensation. Although these moods were directly or indirectly caused by the presence of Terence or the thought of him, she never said to herself that she was in love with him, or considered what was to happen if she continued to feel such things, so that Helen’s image of the river sliding on to the waterfall had a great likeness to the facts, and the alarm which Helen sometimes felt was justified.",

He could tell by the touch of Miss Barrett’s fingers that she was waiting for one thing only – for the postman’s knock, for the letter on the tray.

Nor could Aman get much work done; most of the men he was to have paid were unable to leave their high hamlets. All day everybody huddled around whatever heat was available and the wind howled and moaned like a creature in agony; everything in our room was permeated by fine dust and the mountains disappeared as the sky sank lower and darker over the Gorge. At three o’clock I went to the Hotel to fetch paratas for our supper and found the door closed for the first time. About thirty men were crouching around the fire in the flame-lit darkness (there is no window) and a chorus of friendly welcomes greeted me. It seems a long time since the evening of our arrival, when we were regarded with such grim hostility. As usual I had a long wait while our paratas were being kneaded, rolled, shaped and fried by a cheerful ragged youth with a running nose who I’m sure hasn’t washed since birth; he is the fourteen-year-old Balti apprentice of the Pathan proprietor. I wouldn’t dare take Rachel to such a filthy region during summer: now it is too cold for bacteria to survive.",

Only recently had this land become public. For a hundred years the whole of this area—several hundred acres of the most glorious coastal property in Victoria—was off limits to the public because it was owned by the military, which used it as a firing range. Pause with me for a moment while we put this in perspective. Here you have a country of 3 million square miles, nearly all of it empty and eminently bombable. And here, just a couple of hours’ drive outside the country’s second city, you have a headland of rare and sumptuous beauty, and of considerable ecological importance, and from this land you bar the public because you are trying to blow it to smithereens. Doesn’t make much sense, what? The upshot is that after many years of wheedling and cajoling, the military was finally prevailed upon to yield a fragment of this land to form a national park. Even so, the army kept about two-thirds of the peninsula and still occasionally lofts bombs into it. In consequence, once you have acquired a ticket of admission at a visitors’ center on the edge of Portsea, you have to pass through a two-mile-long zone of military land on a road lined on both sides with tall fences bearing severe warnings of unexploded bombs and the folly of trespass. You can take a shuttle bus into the park or walk. I decided to walk, for the exercise, and set off through the cloaking mist. I appeared to have the place pretty much to myself.",

One night an orange and white cat had run out like a flash from the underbrush only to be crushed under the wheels before I could even think of avoiding it. I especially hated that.

The train goes slowly over the perilous and dizzy height of a wooden trestle; far below, the traveller can see and hear the clean foaming clamours of rock-bright mountain water; beside the track, before his little hut, a switchman stands looking at the train with the slow wondering gaze of the mountaineer. The little shack in which he lives is stuck to the very edge of the track above the steep and perilous ravine. His wife, a slattern with a hank of tight-drawn hair, a snuff-stick in her mouth, and the same gaunt, slow wondering stare her husband has, stands in the doorway of the shack, holding a dirty little baby in her arms.",

They are in striking contrast to today’s Japan, where the smell of money everywhere is overwhelming, and everything has been polished and made perfectly neat and sterile. But beauty is not limited to brand new tatami and pure white wood: somewhere deep in people’s hearts ‘poor’ brings with it a sense of relaxation and ease.",

Now their breed, Boers who have let the twentieth century pass them by, is almost extinct. Their expressions softened when I stroked the oxen and asked permission to photograph them. The Boers’ affinity with their cattle once forged a strong link between Xhosas and trekboers.

The poem accepts their invitation to descend, and the walker imagines ‘step[ping] down into the sea / into another knowledge / wild and cold’. The allusion is to Elizabeth Bishop’s great poem ‘At the Fishhouses’, which passes into the ‘clear gray icy water’ of a Newfoundland harbour; water that is ‘like what we imagine knowledge to be: / dark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free’. Bishop in turn casts backwards, I think, to Wordsworth in 1815 writing of how one accesses ‘the depths of reason’: a profound realm ‘to which the mind cannot sink gently of itself – but to which it must descend by treading the steps of thought’. The three poems become restatements of each other – a print-trail or series of steps of their own.",

(I also have a theory that being undernourished does not help.) From that altitude there was a big change in scene for the pine woods begin here with gigantic trees twice the height of any other pines I’ve seen. I also noticed lots of holly trees and evergreen oaks – which always remind me of Castile – and there was green grass everywhere instead of arid earth. All morning the sky remained a lovely clear blue with a few pure white clouds – in welcome contrast to the brazen, colourless glare over the desert – but at midday it began to fill with grey rain or snow clouds. I’d anticipated being exhausted on arrival and going to sleep immediately, but I’m so ‘toughened up’ by now that I wasn’t a bit tired, apart from shortness of breath, so after a fistful of raw beans I went up the mountain to collect firewood and enjoy the delicious coolness and gusts of rainy wind. From here one can see right down the twenty-mile length of the valley, which remains unclouded, to the Indus Gorge and the infinity of white peaks beyond. I don’t wonder at people risking their lives to climb mountains; even getting up to 12,000 feet and standing looking down at what one has conquered is wonderfully satisfying.",

It dwarfed the pilgrims seething at its mouth; again men were needed to give scale to a too simple geography. At the foot of the slope pilgrims, preparing for the final ascent, bathed in the clear, holy waters of the Amarvati stream and rubbed their bodies with its sand. On his own pilgrimage Karan Singh had compromised here, as he had done at Sheshnag: ‘Here again I adopted the unorthodox course of getting the water carried in buckets to the tent, but this time I did not get it warmed up and bathed with the ice cold water. It was clear and warm, however, so the cold bath did not cause any inconvenience.’",

So we returned to the bush house because the only other sleeping option was in the car in the hotel parking lot. And, I must confess, we seriously pondered that option.",

Often just one carriage, the rectangular box on wheels sported green paint on the front and rear, a whitish wagon with a touch of blue and two passenger doors leading up several steps to the seating, all second-class, not in the sense of second-best, but second-rate, inferior. A third class didn’t exist. Bumping and rattling its way along the Ionian coast’s single track, the line was plagued with long delays, as when one locomotive had a problem, the approaching train also stopped, afraid of colliding even with a half hour or more between them. Cows on the track held us up for over an hour one afternoon. A drunk sleeping across the rails jolted us to a stop on a lazy Sunday morning. We accompanied him to the next station, waited forty-five minutes for a police car to pull up, watched the officers enter the bar for un caffè (an espresso) and finally board the train, saying, “Amico (friend), put your shoes on!” I had wanted to make that same request three quarters of an hour earlier. I avoided the pair of seats in which the sad boozer had left leaves and debris until they eventually blended with the others.",
