The pedestrian street was hardly recognizable from the desolate thoroughfare of a few hours earlier when businesses were closed and the entire population was taking part in the midday repast. Apart from the families and groups of young and old, the municipality’s modest core was comprised of a number of churches, a few aristocratic houses, the city park and a shopping district, all under surveillance of the castle’s tall, stone walls on the ridge above.",

My exhaustion aside, I had no illusions that ours had been anything but a simple walk along defined trails, accompanied by cheerful and experienced guides, supported by both horses and mules, with plenty of food and even a small portable gas stove, which had miraculously delivered hot coffee at the summit as we stared down into the clouds, trying to discern the outlines of the Laguna de Santiago.",

All along our line awoke the answer, but after a few more volleys the Federal fire altogether ceased. From the town came other, more mysterious sounds. The electric lights went out and in the darkness there was a subtle stir and movement, indefinable.\nAt length the order was given to advance, but as our men crept forward in the dark the front rank suddenly gave a yell, and the truth spread through the ranks and out into the country, in one triumphant shout.\nGomez Palacio had been evacuated! With a great babble of voices the army poured into the town. A few scattered shots sounded where our troops caught some of the Federals looting—for the Federal army had gutted the whole town before it left. And then our army began to loot.\nTheir shouts and drunken singing and the sounds of smashing doors reached us out on the plain. Little tongues of flame flickered up where the soldiers were burning some house that had been a fort of Federals.\nBut the looting of the rebels was confined, as it almost always is, to food, and drink, and clothes to cover them. They disturbed no private house.",

A barrel-organ played like an obscene nightingale beneath wet leaves. Children ran across the road.

Now distracted by brown panelling; now by a fern in a pot; here improvising a few phrases to dance with the barrel-organ; again snatching a detached gaiety from a drunken man; then altogether absorbed by words the poor shout across the street at each other (so outright, so lusty)—yet all the while having for centre, for magnet, a young man alone in his room.",

My aunt slept late on her mattresses, Wordsworth was busy cleaning, and I walked around the town. Preparations were in progress for some festival. There were decorated cars of pretty girls parked at street corners. Outside the cathedral and the military academy, which faced each other over the little memorial tank, squads of soldiers goose-stepped. There were pictures of the General everywhere—sometimes in uniform and sometimes in civilian clothes looking like the amiable well-fed host of a Bavarian bierstube. There had been unpleasant stories in Buenos Aires about his early rule—enemies tossed out of aeroplanes into the jungle, bodies washed up on the Argentine shore of the two great rivers with their hands and feet bound with wire, but there were cheap cigarettes on the street and cheap whisky in the stores and no income tax to pay (so my aunt had told me) and even the bribes were not unreasonable if one were doing well and could pay regularly, and the oranges lay under the trees hardly worth the bother of gathering when they were threepence a dozen in the market, and everywhere there was the smell of flowers. I hoped that Mr Visconti’s investment would prove a success. There were worse places than this to end one’s days.",

    "target_paragraph": "I finally left the camp today at 3 p.m., swathed in the ceremonial white scarves presented by Tibetans on these occasions. All morning, while I oiled, washed and checked Roz, crowds of Tiblets had been surrounding me, staring in wonder at the strange machine. (For obvious reasons bicycles are not used in this area.) After lunch I cycled round the compound to demonstrate how the thing worked and gave rides to those brave enough to want them. Poor Dubkay got very envious then and begged to be allowed to cycle a little way down the road; but Roz is so much lighter and faster than the Indian models to which he was accustomed on the plains that I didn’t dare risk him going over a precipice. Instead, I gave him a farewell present of my solar topi, which he immediately clapped on his head – despite the cold north wind – to the great joy of the assembled Tiblets. Finally my saddle-bag was packed and, saying as few goodbyes as possible, I left the camp via a back route, escorted by Juliet, Oliver, Kesang, Deirdre and a number of ayahs. These accompanied me as far as Forsythe Bazaar, where dozens of the resident Tibetans joined the group. Then I mounted Roz – for the first time in five months – and a moment later we had whizzed away out of sight down the steep road.",

The Tuscan July heat is invasive to the body but not to the stone churches that hold on to the dampness of winter, releasing a gray coolness slowly throughout the summer. I have a feeling, walking into one, then another, that I walk into palpable silence. A lid seems to descend on our voices, or a large damp hand. In the vast church of San Biagio below Montepulciano, there is an airy quiet as you enter. Right under the dome, you can stand in one spot and speak or clap your hands and far up against the inner cup of the dome an eerie echo sends the sound rapidly back. The quality of the sound is not like the hello across a lake but a sharp, repeated return. Your voice flattened, otherworldly. It is hard to think a mocking angel isn’t hovering against the frescoes, though more likely a pigeon rests there.",

At 5.30 I moved Juana to a patch of green grass, lest there might be no Alf at Lacabamba; this patch was so perilously placed that it would have been risky to leave her there unsupervised. It rained lightly last night and was still cloudy and humid when we began to climb through thick groves of trees with delicately scented rose-pink or violet blossoms. Our path sometimes became a rock-stairs and we were all sweat-drenched when we arrived in the deserted Plaza, which faithfully follows the Spanish pattern universally imposed on these Andean settlements. Soon we were noticed by a stocky, cheerful-looking young woman with a kindly-bossy manner who broke the news that here we could find no Alf, oats, noodles, tinned milk, eggs, tinned coffee, sugar, bread, rice or beer. ‘Chicha?’ I asked wistfully, more out of habit than with great expectations. But yes! – there was chicha! It surprised our friend that a gringo would drink it … She knocked on her neighbour’s door and after a few moments it was opened by an old, old woman in a black shawl (recalling the Irish ‘mountainy’ women of my childhood) who wonderingly but graciously invited us into her twilit and bare-shelved shop. She drew forward a low stool for Rachel and a rickety chair for me, then provided two litres of watery chicha fascinatingly diversified by scraps of floating vegetation. (‘Better than insects’, commented Rachel, peering into my glass.)",

Gerace was once full of churches, convents and monasteries. Patrician houses line the streets—picturesque, but certainly not at their prime. On my first visit to Gerace, I was too concentrated on not slipping on the wet stone pavement to take in the atmosphere as described by Lear. I saw a lot of the gray buildings he had mentioned, but not the lovely dove color of which he had written. On return visits I saw more colors, walking the medieval streets fit for the noble families and archbishops they once accommodated. Gerace boasted a rich history.",

    "target_paragraph": "As we were eating, an extraordinary character came in – obviously a tribal chieftain of some sort as he was laden with gold ear-rings and bracelets and fabulous silver and stone necklaces and wore rings on every finger. He stood about six foot two in his bare feet and had the oldest face I’ve ever seen, yet was erect and vigorous. His long black hair and beard looked odd against the wrinkles and he had very sharp but kindly brown eyes and still excellent teeth. It goes without saying that he was filthy dirty and stank to high heaven – even more than the pony-men! He had evidently come to welcome them as the first over the pass this year and there was terrific salaaming and hand-shaking all round. On arrival he disregarded me completely but then he got used to the idea and became quite friendly. After he’d gone more strong tea completed the meal, which to me was the most wonderful I’ve ever eaten anywhere – despite the fact that I was sitting watching the bare-handed cook stoking the fire with dung in between kneading chapattis. Having taken turns puffing a post-prandial hookah the men went to sleep again and I continued writing till nearly midnight, when I curled up in my bedroll which was on hire for a shilling from the proprietor but seemed astonishingly free of inhabitants. I woke at 6.30 a.m. with an awful earache, as the cold had been intense all night and I couldn’t sleep with my head covered because of the smell of the bedding. Also this evening I’ve a rotten sore throat and snuffles – inevitable after yesterday’s wetting and freezing – but that’s a small price to pay for the Babusar Pass.",

    "target_paragraph": "Kingsford Smith was not only the greatest Australian aviator of his age but possibly the greatest aviator ever. He held more records than anyone else and tackled infinitely more daring challenges. Just a year after Charles Lindbergh made his historic solo flight across the Atlantic, Kingsford Smith became the first to cross the Pacific—a far more ambitious enterprise, not simply because the scale was greater but because flying conditions were much, much tougher and far less well understood. At the time of his Pacific attempt, only ten months had passed since the first airplane had successfully flown to Hawaii in a race sponsored by a Hawaiian pineapple magnate—and that event had claimed the lives of ten airmen. So when in 1928 Kingsford Smith set off with a crew of three from San Francisco aiming to reach Brisbane by way of Honolulu and Suva in Fiji, the undertaking was widely held to be impossible and insane, and so it nearly proved. Six hundred miles out from Hawaii, Kingsford Smith flew into a belt of meteorological liveliness known as the intertropical convergence zone—an expanse of boiling clouds, towering storms, and the sort of winds that could blow a mustache off. As his small craft began to bounce about like some kind of elasticized toy, Kingsford Smith had no idea what to expect, or when it might end, because no pilot had ever flown into such a system before.",

For a moment Archer stood with his eyes fixed on Medora's fantastic figure, straining to see who came behind her; but the little procession was at an end, for all the lesser members of the family had taken their seats, and the eight tall ushers, gathering themselves together like birds or insects preparing for some migratory manoeuvre, were already slipping through the side doors into the lobby.",

He was luxuriously relaxed now and smiling beatifically. But he was barely sentient, though when at his request I lit a cigarette and put it between his lips he opened his eyes for a moment and thanked me. Rather surprisingly he said: ‘I was with your brother at Thermopylae. What a fellow!’ ‘Indeed?’ I said, anxious to have an eye-witness description of his death, but Mr Honey was fading into sleep now. The cigarette rolled from his lips into the road and lay there burning.",

A thousand glistening umbrellas were tilted over a thousand bowler hats in Piccadilly; the Jermyn Street shops, distorted by streaming water, had become a submarine arcade; and the clubmen of Pall Mall, with china tea and anchovy toast in mind, were scuttling for sanctuary up the steps of their clubs. Blown askew, the Trafalgar Square fountains twirled like mops, and our taxi, delayed by a horde of Charing Cross commuters reeling and stampeding under a cloudburst, crept into The Strand. The vehicle threaded its way through a flux of traffic. We splashed up Ludgate Hill and the dome of St Paul’s sank deeper in its pillared shoulders. The tyres slewed away from the drowning cathedral and a minute later the silhouette of The Monument, descried through veils of rain, seemed so convincingly liquefied out of the perpendicular that the tilting thoroughfare might have been forty fathoms down. The driver, as he swerved wetly into Upper Thames Street, leaned back and said: ‘Nice weather for young ducks.’",

His voice when he wasn’t being too funny, wasn’t showing off, was simple accompaniment to trees above her head, to herself, revitalized, born into trees. “We aren’t in any Gothic setting, George” she wanted to say but didn’t say. “It’s under water” she wanted to say; “It’s under deep-sea water,” she didn’t say. Her eyes half-closing saw George gone tawny, leaf-colour, his hair is the colour of leaves drifting down, he had drifted down from trees. She did say “It’s your hair George.” Hair now started upright to her vision as she opened wide eyes; Harlequin was facing her on a narrow wood path. George was Harlequin though for a moment he had swung back. For a moment George had swung back through a swing door and back and back. George was wavering with his green eyes and his odd Gozzoli features, his curious beauty that made people hate him, his odd tawny hair gone (in small rings) hot on his damp forehead. “Why is it that I can’t love George Lowndes properly?”",

But she was perfectly conscious of her present situation, and derived some pleasure from the reflection that she could rejoice equally in solitude, and in the presence of the many very different people who were now making their way, by divers paths, across London to the spot where she was sitting.",

Once into Mongolia, the only hotel available to us was in Ulaanbaatar; other than that, we had all camped together outside small towns. One way or the other, we knew where everyone would be at nightfall. They were either working on their car or eating in the dining tent. There was no other place to be. In a bizarrely contradictory way, that was reassuring. Here in the belly of Russia’s vast interior we are again in hotels, except that none are big enough to house the entire Rally, so we’re split among three or four lodges every night.

They dragged General Jean Vilbrun Guillaume Sam, until the dawn of the day of the massacre, president of the Republic, from his hiding place. They chopped his hand that tried in its last desperation to save him from the massed frenzy outside the legation gates. They dragged him through the door into the court and there a woman whose dainty hands had never even held a broom, struck him a vicious blow with a machete at the root of his neck, and he was hurled over the gate to the people who chopped off his parts and dragged his torso in the streets.",

Even New York is crying because you are leaving,” a friend had said as I pulled away from the Seaport dock. I looked at the chart of the harbor inside the oversized Ziploc plastic bag in front of me, but had no idea of my position in relation to it. I concentrated on the vague form of the boat ahead. On both sides, Varuna was crossing paths with the immense rumbling hulks of all the liners, tugs and tankers traveling through and anchored in the harbor. As the fog thickened, every so often one of their horns would blast its Morse signal to warn the passing boats. Suddenly, through the patter of the rain, I heard Varuna’s engine cough and falter. Put, put, put . . . put . . . put. . . . Our speed decreased by half. I watched with a growing panic as the boat carrying my father was swallowed into the mist ahead.",

As one who has used Williams-Sonoma as a toy store for years, I begin to get back to an elementary sense of the kitchen. Three wooden spoons, two for the salad, one for stirring. A sauté pan, bread knife, cutting knife, cheese grater, pasta pot, baking dish, and stove-top espresso pot. We brought over some old picnic silverware and bought a few glasses and plates. Those first pastas are divine. After long work, we eat everything in sight then tumble like field hands into bed. Our favorite is spaghetti with an easy sauce made from diced pancetta, unsmoked bacon, quickly browned, then stirred into cream and chopped wild arugula (called ruchetta locally), easily available in our driveway and along the stone walls. We grate parmigiano on top and eat huge mounds. Besides the best salad of all, those amazing tomatoes sliced thickly and served with chopped basil and mozzarella, we learn to make Tuscan white beans with sage and olive oil. I shell and simmer the beans in the morning, then let them come to room temperature before dousing them with the oil. We consume an astonishing number of black olives.",

Nor did Simon look up even then, even when the car burst once more into thunder and a soundless dun crash of fading dust. After a while the wagon emerged from the dust, the mules now at a high flop-eared trot, and jingled past him, leaving behind it upon the dusty insect-rasped air a woman’s voice in a quavering wordless hysteria, passive and quavering and sustained. This faded slowly down the shimmering reaches of the valley and Simon removed from the breast of his shirt an object slung by a greasy cord about his neck. It was small and of no particular shape and it was covered with soiled napped fur: the first joint of the hind leg of a rabbit, caught supposedly in a graveyard in the dark of the moon, and Simon rubbed it through the sweat on his forehead and on the back of his neck, then he returned it to his bosom. His hands were still trembling, and he put his hat on and got back onto the road and turned toward home through the dusty noon.",
