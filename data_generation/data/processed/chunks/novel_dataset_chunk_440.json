A large silent space that exists near the center of the place the way something may be just near the heart of a person, seldom seen, but still essential. In its absence, there’d be nothing.",

Ten thousand feet above, the huge backlit spike of Ama Dablam hovered over the head of the valley like an apparition. And seven thousand feet higher still, dwarfing Ama Dablam, was the icy thrust of Everest itself, all but hidden behind Nuptse.

With a population of twenty-five hundred, Haines wasn’t very big?“Sometimes people drive off the ferry and go straight through town, looking for Haines, and then have to turn around”?but it had all the hallmarks of a picture-postcard Alaskan town: a library and bookstore that towns ten times larger would envy, a pedestrian-friendly layout (I never did find an explanation as to why Inside Passage towns had been laid out with such fine sidewalks, which predated cruise ships), an excellent coffee shop with picnic tables outside where dogs lounged in the shade under their owners’ feet, a brewpub, and at least one oddball tourist attraction (a museum devoted entirely to hammers). The town was also surrounded by some of the most beautiful scenery in Alaska: snowy peaks on three sides standing over the serene waters of Lynn Canal, all of it likely to be visible, because a row of tall mountains blocks most of the rain that soaks other Inside Passage cities. It was a Tuesday just before the start of summer, and half the cars in town had mountain bikes and kayaks lashed to their roofs. A trio I sat next to at the Bamboo Room restaurant had sunburned faces and white raccoon circles around their eyes. They’d just finished a photo shoot for a snowboarding catalog.",

Now and then a passenger train goes by, and if the time is summer and the weather, as usual, hot, many shirtless passengers are hanging from the open windows with the curtains flapping beside them. Not even the most luxurious car on the Trans-Siberian Railway offers air-conditioning. Then more freight comes along, sometimes timber by the trainload. Siberian timber can be three or four feet in diameter, a size only rarely seen on logging trucks in America today. Some of these trees are called korabel’nie sosni—literally, “caravel pines,” trees from which ships’ masts were made.",

The men wore dark suits, flamboyant ties, pointed shoes and Rolex watches; some played compulsively with lap-top computers. Everyone was drinking ‘shorts’ and nibbling cocktail snacks.

    "target_paragraph": "Stalin never saw this or any Siberian gulag with his own eyes. Once he had attained power, he seldom left western Russia, preferring to stay in or near the Kremlin most of the time. Perhaps the unhappy fate of every Russian ruler who set foot in Siberia gave him pause. Although he had passed through western Siberia often as a young man (those alleged six escapes), neither then nor afterward was he ever east of Baikal. His underlings must have occasionally shown him charts of this Topolinoe road and its system of prison camps, and maybe they even showed him photographs. But for him this camp would have been only a point on a map, a detail of a plan. The strange feeling of absence that prevailed in the frozen silence here had to do with the secrecy and evil of the place’s conception, and with its permanent abandonment, in shame, after its author was gone. Now the place existed only nominally in present time and space; the abandoned camp was a single preserved thought in a dead man’s mind.",

However, as the mandatory power weakened, the underground Zionist militia smuggled boatloads of destitute Jews past British coastguards.

A few gilt-edged, feathery clouds broke the monotony of the pale green sky, and the beech forest that clothed the lake’s steep banks to the water’s edge had not yet completely lost its brilliant autumn colours. The evening light gave the remote ranges a purple tint impossible to describe or to paint.",

I love everyone.” He patted the drivers on their shoulders, and the drivers smiled. The two backpackers, we soon learned, were friends from America. They were in their late twenties, and one lived in California, the other in New York. This was their first visit to Egypt; they had arrived a few days earlier, on a whirlwind, last-minute trip. They toured the pyramids at Giza one day, slept on cots in a hostel in Cairo, and then flew to Aswan the day before. They followed their Lonely Planet guidebooks (on-line edition, courtesy of their phones) straight to the Philae and booked their journey a few hours after us. From Aswan, they planned a trip to the Sinai Peninsula, maybe a resort town like Sharm el-Sheikh they said, though they had yet to decide. I asked how they would get there. Their guidebooks and on-line forums suggested a ferry across the Red Sea from Safaga, and they asked if we knew anything about it.",

By then three young privates, clad in off-white singlets and blue denim shorts, were busily beheading calves at each post, using a larger and less curved edition of the ordinary kukri. The animals’ heads were tied to the posts and held steady by one man, while another gripped the hindquarters; personally I would have been very nervous indeed were I holding the head, and seeing that fearsome weapon flashing down so swiftly within inches of my own neck. Yet in the course of over fifty killings we didn’t see even one slight miscalculation, each head being severed with a single clean stroke. As the heads fell they were thrown towards the bases of the flagstaffs, where for moments they lay with ears violently twitching and mouths opening and shutting – a sight which slightly unnerved me at first, as I am not accustomed to watch sacrifices. All the bodies were dragged around the flags in a circle, with blood spurting, and when they had been brought back to the slaying-post they were flung together beside the heap of clay. Many of these carcasses continued to move for an astonishingly long time after death – and they were not merely twitching, but kicking so vigorously that it was difficult to drag them on the ritual round. I longed to be able to experiment by leaving one on its feet after decapitation; probably it could have walked quite a few steps before collapsing. Stories about perambulating, headless bodies have never previously convinced me, but now I find them quite credible.",

    "target_paragraph": "I do not know the meaning of Nerano (it is also called Anarano, Donerano, Inerano, and Inderano in old deeds), but Citarella is one of the many names on Capri which wandered over during the Amalfitan domination–the result, I suppose, of overcrowding in the days before the Republic received its death-blow in the war with Pisa, when the Pandects were carried off. Says Edrisius: “The island of Capri is inhabited by men of Amalfi who keep flocks there.” The family of Citarella is a well-known one; they were nobles of Ravello and patricians of Amalfi, and no doubt drew their name from the town of Cetara (Cctarelli) on that coast. Now what does Cetara mean? I cannot say. All kinds of origins have been suggested for the names of such places in Italy; perhaps it also means “rocky”, for Hecataeus has a “Kyterion polls,” which is now Cirisano, on a rocky height; Cetraro in Calabria is similarly situated; citarella, the rock-haunting bird, is the same as our kestrel; Berard derives it from a Hebrew word signifying high spot, mount of sacrifice. The islet of Kythairon, whence Venus took her epithet of Cytherea, is notoriously stony and bare; Phoenicians founded her temple there, and her cult spread thence over Cyprus and Greece to Campania. And so we arrive, as the result of this philological disquisition, at a most unexpected conclusion: the name Citara (Citarella) is not derived from Venus Cytherea, but “vice versa”.",

Miscellany ate up hands, too: haul brush, guy small trees, direct traffic as equipment crossed the road, and make constant runs to the shop for diesel can, shackles, tow strap, dunnage, chains, cell phone, hard hat, mattock handle, Griphoist, zerk grease. To keep things interesting, something was always getting stuck: truck, loader, puncheon, tools. Occasionally even a human went down big, by an inadvertent step too close to the edge of a mud pit or a calculated belly flop performed for lunchtime laughs.",

Here four homes were awaiting demolition. The Khairiyas’ crudely constructed three-storey house sheltering seventeen members of an extended family, had been built in 1990 without a permit. Said Shaul, ‘Twenty years ago no permits were being granted to Palestinians – same as now. So what do you do? You have a family to shelter, you can’t get a permit, you can’t move to a location where you can get a permit. Therefore you build where you are, hoping for the best. Then you rear your family in suspense, always fearing the worst …’ And here the worst is about to happen – 200 new housing units for settlers.",

Walking in the woods alone, in the snow, in May, was lovely and weird—snow on green ferns, inches of melting white beneath my boots, the sway of quiet through branches. I forgot, as I often do, to call out, to yell, “Hey bear!” as is prudent when hiking alone. I forgot myself. Halfway back to the cabin, I saw a bear. Off the trail to my left, lumbering through the trees, snapping branches beneath its feet, a huge male grizzly moved, also alone, parting the snow in the air before it. Unaware of me. Had this one peeked through our cabin window? A stripe of white mapped its spine, flanks falling away like slopes off a high ridge, corniced along the top. I stopped, blood rackety in my veins. I watched the bear move in steady snow with an ambling poise, rolling to one side and the other like a graceful fat man in no particular hurry. Thirty yards away? I saw my hand stretched out in the air, separate from me, palm out, inviting in, warding off. Noticed, it fell to my side.",

Save for two in the middle of the street, they were all precisely the same – yellow-grey boxes with slate tents on top. Nothing whatever was happening; a few children were playing in the street, two cats turned something over in the gutter with their paws. Yet a woman leaning out of the windows searched this way, that way, up and down the street as if she were raking every cranny for something to feed on. Her eyes, rapacious, greedy, like the eyes of a bird of prey, were also sulky and sleepy, as if they had nothing to feed their hunger upon. Nothing happened – nothing whatever. Still she gazed up and down with her indolent dissatisfied stare. Then a trap turned the corner. She watched it. It stopped in front of the houses opposite which, since the sills were green, and there was a plaque with a sunflower stamped on it over the door, were different from the others. A little man in a tweed cap got out and rapped at the door. It was opened by a woman who was about to have a baby. She shook her head; looked up and down the street; then shut the door. The man waited. The horse stood patiently with the reins drooping and its head bent. Another woman appeared at the window, with a white many-chinned face, and an under lip that stood out like a ledge. Leaning out of the window side by side the two women watched the man. He was bandy-legged; he was smoking. They passed some remark about him together. He walked up and down as if he were waiting for somebody. Now he threw away his cigarette. They watched him. What would he do next? Was he going to give his horse a feed? But here a tall woman wearing a coat and skirt of grey tweed came round the corner hastily; and the little man turned and touched his cap.",

One was air cargo, with companies like FedEx and UPS taking advantage of Anchorage’s central location between Asia, Europe, and North America to refuel planes and change crews. Another was senior citizens. Residents who in the past came up to make money and then departed now stick around because of the low taxes. “We’re not exactly Florida, but our senior population has experienced the fastest rate of growth of any state for the last couple decades,” he said.",

Just outside, tearing at the bag of McKinlay’s things they’d brought along for him, was an Arctic fox. Mamen fired a few shots and brought down the fox, their first fresh game at Skeleton Island. Mamen skinned the animal and made a large stew, and all of them were so hungry they agreed that it was the finest fare they’d had since leaving the Karluk. Malloch gorged himself on at least two pounds of the fox meat. But the fox lasted only a couple of meals, and they were soon back to pemmican. Mamen noted that Malloch was eating more than his share lately, and this behavior, and their dwindling stores, worried him: “Yesterday he ate two pounds of pemmican and today he ate over a pound of pemmican.… We will soon be ruined the way he carries on; he must reef his sails if he wants to be with us.”",

Actors are addressed by titles that sound strange to modern ears, such as ‘Wakadanna’ (‘Young Master’) for an onnagata like Tamasaburo. (‘Danna’, or ‘Master’, is the title for an important male-role player, but an onnagata, no matter how old he gets, remains ‘Young Master’.) Each backstage room is decorated with banners carrying the distinctive emblems of the actors, just like aristocratic heraldry. There is a constant exchange of gifts: fans, hand towels or rolls of fabric, all of which carry symbolic significance. It is a truly feudalistic world, far removed from that of ordinary mortals. Once, when I told Tamasaburo about my trepidation on going backstage, I was surprised when he answered, ‘I feel exactly the same way!’",

All these streams were frozen over and I used my dula to test the strength of the ice before committing myself to it. When I came on the unfrozen Satpara – hardly five yards wide – I crossed by an exquisitely beautiful but not very reliable-looking bridge of solid ice. Then I saw two small dark figures coming towards me across the whiteness, bent in a familiar posture that meant they were carrying firewood – the chief product of Satpara hamlet. I altered course to meet them, intending to use their tracks, and as we approached each other they looked so startled I thought for a moment they were going to drop their loads and run away.",

And when you have got your pennies, what then? They are only pennies, after all—unpleasant, battered copper things, without a gold piece among them, and never worth the degradation of self, and the hatred of those below you who have fewer, and the derision of those above you who have more. And as I perceive I am growing wise, and what is even worse, allegorical, and as these are tendencies to be fought against as long as possible, I'll go into the garden and play with the babies, who at this moment are sitting in a row on the buttercups, singing what appear to be selections from popular airs.",

The street looked strange, unfamiliar; the compound gate was broken, the metal flattened on the ground. Then she noticed Aunty Ifeka’s kiosk, or what remained of it: splinters of wood, packets of groundnuts lying in the dust. She opened the car door and climbed out. She paused for a moment because of how glaringly bright and hot it was, with flames billowing from the roof, with grit and ash floating in the air, before she began to run toward the house. She stopped when she saw the bodies. Uncle Mbaezi lay facedown in an ungainly twist, legs splayed. Something creamy-white oozed through the large gash on the back of his head. Aunty Ifeka lay on the veranda. The cuts on her naked body were smaller, dotting her arms and legs like slightly parted red lips.",

Yet however terrestrial and lumpy their appearance just now to the mean unglamoured eye, to themselves the case was different. They followed the road with a knowledge that they were soaring along in a supporting medium, possessed of original and profound thoughts, themselves and surrounding nature forming an organism of which all the parts harmoniously and joyously interpenetrated each other. They were as sublime as the moon and stars above them, and the moon and stars were as ardent as they.",

Its public buildings and houses ascended the island’s steep rock in a shallow out-of-the-wind indentation on its northwest side, one small structure mounting above another like the apartments of desert cliff dwellers. The village’s vertical access ways were zigzag staircases carved into the cement-hard snow. I walked and climbed around the village for a couple of hours, stepping into a store or office now and then to get warm. I saw a frozen seal on the floor of the vestibule of the tribal health building, and a polar bear skin hanging on a wooden frame, and two boys shooting a small black dog out by the village dump, and a guy carrying cans of soda pop on his shoulders into the general store when the cans exploded in the cold and sent soda cascading all over him and down the back of his neck. I spent a good while examining a walrus-skin boat on a rack near a launching ramp at the bottom of town. Almost nobody makes skin boats anymore. Splitting the skins and sewing them require skills both physical and spiritual; you have to have absolute quiet in your soul to sew the skin covering to the willow frame. This twenty-foot boat, a museum-quality object, was obviously still being used.",

From the Puerta you could see fifty miles across the vast arid plain that the Spaniards named Llano de los Gigantes, where the little mountains lie tumbled about; and four leagues away the low gray houses of Mapimi. There lay the enemy; twelve hundred colorados, or\nFederal irregulars, under the infamous Colonel Argumendo. The\ncolorados are the bandits that made Orozco’s revolution. They were so called because their flag was red, and because their hands were red with slaughter, too. They swept through Northern Mexico, burning, pillaging and robbing the poor. In Chihuahua, they cut the soles from the feet of one poor devil, and drove him a mile across the desert before he died.\nAnd I have seen a city of four thousand souls reduced to five after a visit by the colorados. When Villa took Torreon, there was no mercy for the colorados; they are always shot.",
