    "target_paragraph": "That was the fall before the winter from which the people as they became older were to establish time and date events. The summer’s rainless heat—the blazing days beneath which even the oak leaves turned brown and died, the nights during which the ordered stars seemed to glare down in cold and lidless amazement at an earth being drowned in dust—broke at last, and for the three weeks of Indian summer the ardor-wearied earth, ancient Lilith, reigned, throned and crowned amid the old invincible courtesan’s formal de-function. Through these blue and drowsy and empty days filled with silence and the smell of burning leaves and woodsmoke, Ratliff, passing to and fro between his home and the Square, would see the two small grimed hands, immobile and clasping loosely the bars of the jail window at a height not a great deal above that at which a child would have held them. And in the afternoons he would watch his three guests, the wife and the two children, entering or leaving the jail on their daily visit. On the first day, the day he had brought her home with him, she had insisted on doing some of the housework, all of it which his sister would permit, sweeping and washing dishes and chopping wood for fires which his nieces and nephews had heretofore done (and incidentally, in doing so, gaining their juvenile contempt too), apparently oblivious of the sister’s mute and outraged righteousness, big yet not fat, actually slender as Ratliff realised at last in a sort of shocked and sober … not pity: rather, concern; usually barefoot, with the untidy mass of bleached hair long since turning back to dark at the roots, and the cold face in which there was something of a hard not-quite-lost beauty, though it may have been only an ingrained and ineradicable self-confidence or perhaps just toughness. Because the prisoner had refused not only bond (if he could have made one) but counsel. He had stood between two officers—small, his face like a mask of intractability carved in wood, wasted and almost skeleton-thin—before the committing magistrate, and he might not even have been present, hearing or perhaps not hearing himself being arraigned, then at a touch from one of the officers turning back toward the jail, the cell. So the case was pretermitted from sheer desuetude of physical material for formal suttee, like a half-cast play, through the October term of court, to the spring term next May; and perhaps three afternoons a week Ratliff would watch his guests as, the children dressed in cast-off garments of his nephews and nieces, the three of them entered the jail, thinking of the four of them sitting in the close cell rank with creosote and old wraiths of human excreta—the sweat, the urine, the vomit discharged of all the old agonies: terror, impotence, hope. Waiting for Flem Snopes, he thought. For Flem Snopes.",

Then I was launched into space. I tried to get away from my board, but dared not dive straight down—the inside bar was shallow. I hit the water awkwardly, twisted, and hit the bottom, softly, with one shoulder. I felt my board flash past, actually brushing my arms, which were over my face, in the moment before the wave landed on me.

Because he could not see the smoke from here and now all he remembers is the empty dawn-hill from which he will let himself downward into the creekside mist to wait for her, and it is wrong now. Because he stands in sun, visible—himself, earth, trees, house—already cohered and fixed in visibility; no darkness to flee through and from, and this is wrong. So he stood, baffled, moaning and swaying for a time, then he moved again, across the yard to the lot gate. He had learned to open it too. He turned the catch and the gate vanished from between its two posts; he passed through and after a moment he found the gate where it had swung to against the fence and closed it and turned the latch and went on across the sun-glared lot, moaning, and entered the hallway of the stable.",

Since I have no tennis shoes I take off the boots and sling them over my shoulder, proceeding barefoot. I walk lightly across shoals of quicksand and ford the river when necessary, but over the pebbled and rocky stretches the going is hard and slow.",

Just a few square meters have been cleared near the house, a stretch of grass and moss with some stepping stones in it. The edges of this plot are planted with azaleas and hagi (bush clover), which have been long unattended and are beginning to spread unruly twigs outwards and upwards, hiding a mossy stone lantern and some ceramic statues of badgers. Towards the back are a variety of trees: an ancient cherry tree (propped up with wooden supports), a maple, camellias and a gingko tree. Behind these trees, the garden drops away to a waterfall in the stream, and a heavily wooded mountain soars up from the far bank. When I arrive home on Friday night, I throw open the glass doors of the verandah, and the sound of the waterfall swells up into the house. In that instant, all thoughts of the week in Tokyo blow clean away, and I feel like I have returned to my true self.",

All of its internal life exists within three paper-thin layers of tissue—the phloem, xylem, and cambium—just beneath the bark, which together form a moist sleeve around the dead heartwood. However tall it grows, a tree is just a few pounds of living cells thinly spread between roots and leaves. These three diligent layers of cells perform all the intricate science and engineering needed to keep a tree alive, and the efficiency with which they do it is one of the wonders of life. Without noise or fuss, every tree in a forest lifts massive volumes of water—several hundred gallons in the case of a large tree on a hot day—from its roots to its leaves, where it is returned to the atmosphere. Imagine the din and commotion, the clutter of machinery, that would be needed for a fire department to raise a similar volume of water.",

Spain is a bad place to crack up.”\n“I feel as though we’d been married all our lives and never had anything but problems.” She pushed his hair back from his forehead and kissed him. “Do you want to swim now?”\n“Yes. Let’s dive from the high rock. The really high one.”\n“You do,” she said. “I’ll swim out and you dive over my head.”\n“All right. But hold still when I dive.”\n“See how close you can come.”\nLooking up, she watched him poised on the high rock, arced brown against the blue sky. Then he came toward her and the water rose in a spout from a hole in the water behind her shoulder. He turned under water and came up in front of her and shook his head. “I cut it too fine,” he said.\nThey swam out to the point and back and then wiped each other dry and dressed on the beach.\n“You really liked me diving that close?”\n“I loved it.”\nHe kissed her and she felt cool and fresh from the swimming and she still tasted of the sea.",

Beyond the pole two grotty pavilions – a circular rest-room and an oblong restaurant – were constructed a few years ago in a moment of mad extravagance to cater for a visit from the Thai Crown Prince. On what is left of a low hill – some B-52 demolished its southern side – stands the biggest surviving jar and several others. From here one is overlooking level miles of brown, desert-dusty land dominated by an enormous aviation fuel depot, recently built to supply the adjacent airbase and Lao Airforce headquarters. (The airforce consists of nine elderly MiGs; let’s hope it never expands.) Also visible is the new airport and a new airforce personnel housing estate. However, this unlovely panorama is hidden by the hill as one wanders around grassy acres strewn with jars of various sizes in various states of repair. A few have lids lying nearby; one is decorated with a crude carving of a dancing figure. There was nobody in sight as I limped between them, pausing often to handle one with the peculiar sort of awe inspired by man-made objects ancient and inexplicable. It pleases me that the experts cannot explain these containers or identify the people who made them. The more scientists inform us about our world and our universe, the more our imaginations need such mysteries to toy with. A local legend insists that the jars belonged to a race of giants – and maybe they did …",

They refused to believe that we rode waves on them. They figured our boards were little airplane wings. Did we use them for fishing? When we got to Tavarua, coasting in with outboard engine lifted through a coral-studded channel on the northeast shore, we could see that the swell had dropped sharply from the day before. It actually looked too small to ride now. But our companions would be confirmed in their doubts if they didn’t see some surfing, so I quickly paddled out. The water over the reef was absurdly shallow, less than a foot deep, and the waves were knee-high and weak and really too quick to surf. But I managed to snag one, and when I jumped to my feet I could hear shouts and whistles coming from the beach. I rode for a few yards, then bellied in. The swell we had seen from the hillside was dead.",

October was well advanced, but steadily burning with a warmth that made the early months of the summer appear very young and capricious. Great tracts of the earth lay now beneath the autumn sun, and the whole of England, from the bald moors to the Cornish rocks, was lit up from dawn to sunset, and showed in stretches of yellow, green, and purple. Under that illumination even the roofs of the great towns glittered. In thousands of small gardens, millions of dark-red flowers were blooming, until the old ladies who had tended them so carefully came down the paths with their scissors, snipped through their juicy stalks, and laid them upon cold stone ledges in the village church. Innumerable parties of picnickers coming home at sunset cried, ‘Was there ever such a day as this?’ ‘It’s you,’ the young men whispered; ‘Oh, it’s you,’ the young women replied. All old people and many sick people were drawn, were it only for a foot or two, into the open air, and prognosticated pleasant things about the course of the world. As for the confidences and expressions of love that were heard not only in cornfields but in lamp-lit rooms, where the windows opened on the garden, and men with cigars kissed women with grey hairs, they were not to be counted. Some said that the sky was an emblem of the life they had had; others that it was the promise of the life to come. Long-tailed birds clattered and screamed, and crossed from wood to wood, with golden eyes in their plumage.",

Imagine a proportionate number of ‘people’s parliaments’ gathering in Britain, by request of the government, to discuss, for instance, the Poll Tax, or closing mines or post offices, or the introduction of university fees, or an airport extension or new Tridents. Then try to imagine Britain’s democratically elected government giving consideration to voters’ views … But would we Minority Worlders appreciate this sort of collective involvement in running our countries? It requires a certain expenditure of mental energy – and time. Moreover, despite having regular access to ‘free and fair elections’, and complaining so often about governmental decisions, we seem to feel terminally disempowered in relation to decision-making. But enough of fantasy-land – let’s return to Manzanillo.",

I dropped in one afternoon to catch up on my journal and there he was, whacking an espresso scoop against the countertop. My heart beat double time as he took off his baseball cap, rubbed the glistening beads of sweat from his brow, and hacked. Then he ran his slim white fingers through his sleek black hair and glanced up at me. Our eyes locked through the coffee bean steam of the espresso machine. With a cappuccino in one hand and a banana nut muffin in the other, I slid into an empty seat in his full view. As my fingers slowly unwrapped my muffin in a suggestive manner, my eyes wandered up and over my coffee toward the counter, up the espresso machine to the shoulders, up the neck toward the dimpled chin, past the button nose to the ebony eyes staring right back at me. We exchanged flirtatious glances as I polished off my coffee and sifted through my journal.",

I had never seen anyone ride a wave that size in California. I couldn’t recall another photo of anyone doing so. The wave was North Shore scale—Waimea, Sunset. Except the water temperature was probably fifty degrees—cold enough to make the surface hard to penetrate, and a falling lip feel like concrete. And the spot was not a famous, well-mapped reef but a shifty, ferocious, obscure beachbreak. I hoped I would never see Ocean Beach that big. Meanwhile, that photo went a long way toward explaining the local obsession with Mark.",
