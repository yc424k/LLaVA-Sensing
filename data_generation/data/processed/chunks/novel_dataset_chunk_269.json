This was foreboding news. To Bartlett it meant that, at least for now, their chances for bears were slim. Bears feed on seals, and the last seal holes they’d seen were between twenty-five and forty miles out on the ice, near the pressure ridges. That explained the bears they’d run into there. As it warmed up later in the spring and early summer, and the ice broke apart closer to the island, the seals would certainly work their way toward shore, bringing the bears with them. But that was a few months away, and food was going to run out. Without fresh meat, they’d have to survive on pemmican.",

Then follow that skinny line of snow until it curves sharply to the right.” This was something I’d trained myself to do many years earlier, a drill I forced myself to go through every time I climbed, and on Everest it may have saved my life. By 6:00 P.M., as the storm escalated into a full-scale blizzard with driving snow and winds gusting in excess of 60 knots, I came upon the rope that had been fixed by the Montenegrins on the snow slope 600 feet above the Col.

(It is a fortunate coincidence that the recent Japanese expedition used canvas of the exact hue prescribed by the Mahayana School for such ceremonies.) No attempt had been made to reproduce the Tibetan flag – which has an extremely involved pattern – but a tattered standard of red, blue and yellow was being borne on a bamboo pole at the head of the procession; and it was an oddly moving sight to see the camp marching along behind, all out of step, and to hear them singing their stirring National Anthem, all out of tune.",

    "target_paragraph": "mutton snapper speared in the cut between Big Galliot Cay and Big Farmers Cay\n​Another cold front is coming, and Hatchet Bay is calling me back. I look forward to the safe and peaceful anchorage, and to more surfing. I pull up the two anchors and motor out of Big Galliot Cay, scraping the bottom as I do.\n​After carefully motoring through the narrow channel to the deeper water to the west, I set sail and put us on a broad reach. Windflower jumps at the occasion and accelerates to 7 knots. The sun shines happily, the water glows in a bright shade of sapphire blue, and the wind blows perfectly. This is truly the best of sailing, care-free and fun, with another island anchorage on the way.\n​Unfortunately, the autopilot, which has been intermittently shutting itself off, turns off for good. I still have the wheel pilot that came with the boat, and am reminded of the principle of having a backup for everything important. I find myself to be very glad I didn’t remove the wheel pilot after installing the below-deck autopilot back at the York River Yacht Haven in Virginia.\n​I sail past Black Point Settlement and Staniel Cay to the west side of Pipe Cay.\nLocation: 24.2386º N, 76.5209º W\n​After dropping the hook and the customary inspection of the anchor, I swim under the keel to have a look, since I have not done so since bouncing on the bottom at Little Galliot Cay. I am dismayed to see what looks like a seam has opened up in the center of the keel, running longwise most of its length. This is going to take some thought, and I go ahead and row to a nearby rock for some uneventful and uninspiring spearfishing.\n​Back at the boat, it is time for some autopilot troubleshooting. After determining that power is being supplied to the black box that powers the autopilot, I open it up. Looking inside, I can see where it looks like a short has burned one of the components, but that is as far as my almost non-existent electrical skills take me. I contact the company, and am led through some troubleshooting, and it is determined that I need a new black box, which will be shipped to a friend in St Augustine, Florida.\n​I am depressed, and my sailboat simply feels like a collection of things that will all eventually break.\n​The next morning, I sail out through Conch Cut and aim for Little San Salvador Island. But the wind is not quite right, and I can’t point high enough to aim at the island, so I change plan and change course and aim instead for Cape Eleuthera.\n​Since we are on a close reach, I am able to lock off the wheel and let Windflower tend to herself while I enjoy the view of dark and deep blue water.\n​The sail is fine, and I anchor just south of where I anchored at Cape Eleuthera two weeks before, but this time, I find better sand for the Vulcan.\nLocation: 24.8319º N, 76.3480º W",

Do her hair as she might, her forehead remained like an egg, bald, white. No clothes suited her. She might buy anything. And for a woman, of course, that meant never meeting the opposite sex. Never would she come first with anyone. Sometimes lately it had seemed to her that, except for Elizabeth, her food was all that she lived for; her comforts; her dinner, her tea; her hot-water bottle at night. But one must fight; vanquish; have faith in God. Mr Whittaker had said she was there for a purpose. But no one knew the agony! He said, pointing to the crucifix, that God knew. But why should she have to suffer when other women, like Clarissa Dalloway, escaped? Knowledge comes through suffering, said Mr Whittaker.",

We stop on the edge of the road, just in front of a gloomy, empty fumador. Agustino raises his hands, and then drops them again. Dolf, the gangly Dane who lost his race so spectacularly, is waiting for us, bouncing up and down on his toes. My eyes flick nervously between him and Agustino.

Now I was trembling with shock. It seemed pointless to continue; the sensible thing would be to wait here for the next homeward-bound train. I hesitated, then realised I couldn’t, at this stage, turn away from Transylvania. And the idea of trying to survive with nothing but the inadequate garments I wore had a certain macabre attraction; it appealed to what some people unkindly describe as my masochism. Of course the nature of this journey would be changed; the Rough Guide (also stolen) had just reminded me that in Rumania ‘life is literally at risk during winter unless you come … equipped as if for a short walk in the Himalayas’ – which is exactly how I had come equipped. Therefore I couldn’t trek deep into the mountains and would be totally dependent on Rumanian hospitality.",

We let our attention shift, allow our eyes to glance to other, more immediate, concerns. But the change is constant, inexorable, gathering pace. Remember even the apocalyptic Permian extinctionthe extinction event that dwarfs all others, when the future of life itself appeared in doubttook place over a period of perhaps a hundred thousand years.

Happily, they were as jolly as they were corpulent; each roared with laughter as I went in through a side window only to end up splayed across their laps. The ice was broken, and from that moment on the passengers seemed as family, all delighted to be sharing the promise of a new day. With the canopy low and open to the wind, and the gunwales riding just inches above the waterline, the water taxi roared downstream, the driver completely unfazed by all the driftwood in the stream, deadheads that, if hit, could readily sever the motor at the shaft, as had occurred to that chalupa at San Pedro on the night Juan, Xandra, and I had tried to run the river from Puerto Wilches to Simití.",

I had a hangover you could sell to science, but after two cups of strong coffee at a sunny table outside the Popp, a handful of aspirins, two cigarettes and a cough so robust that I tapped into two new seams of phlegm, I felt tolerably human and was able to undertake a gentle stroll to the waterfront through the dappled sunshine of St Pauli Park. There wasn’t much to see upon arrival, just cranes and dockyards and the broad, sluggish estuary of the Elbe. I thought of what Konrad Adenauer used to say: ‘You can smell Prussia when you get to the Elbe.’ I could only smell dead fish, or at least I assumed it was dead fish. Maybe it was Prussians.",

They counted the rich green copper cupolas and sighed and exulted over the whole picture, the coloured sky, the coloured town, the shimmering of the trees.\nMaking their way along the outskirts of the town towards the station in the fading light they met a little troop of men and women coming quietly along the roadway. They were all dressed in black. They looked at the girls with strange mild eyes and filled Miriam with fear.\nPresently the girls crossed a little high bridge over a stream, and from the crest of the bridge beyond a high-walled garden a terraced building came into sight. It was dotted with women dressed in black. One of the figures rose and waved a handkerchief. “Wave, children,” said Fräulein’s trembling voice, “wave”—and the girls collected in a little group on the crest of the bridge and waved with raised arms.\n“Ghastly, isn’t it?” said Gertrude, glancing at Miriam as they moved on. Miriam was cold with apprehension. “Are they mad?” she whispered.",

It was a reproduction of the photograph that had stood so long on his desk. The desiccating air of memory had turned her into the mere abstraction of a woman, and this unexpected evocation seemed to bring her nearer than she had ever been in life. Was it because he understood her better? He looked long into her eyes; little personal traits reached out to him like caresses—the tired droop of her lids, her quick way of leaning forward as she spoke, the movements of her long expressive hands. All that was feminine in her, the quality he had always missed, stole toward him from her unreproachful gaze; and now that it was too late life had developed in him the subtler perceptions which could detect it in even this poor semblance of herself. For a moment he found consolation in the thought that, at any cost, they had thus been brought together; then a flood of shame rushed over him. Face to face with her, he felt himself laid bare to the inmost fold of consciousness. The shame was deep, but it was a renovating anguish; he was like a man whom intolerable pain has roused from the creeping lethargy of death. . . .",

As you progress terrific vistas reveal themselves below. Now you see the island-studded blue-green southern reaches, and the ships coming stately through the Lamma Channel. Half a mile later you are looking towards the Pearl River Estuary, and there lie the fleets of merchantmen at their moorings in the outer anchorage, and a jetfoil is streaming away towards Macao or Guangzhou, and the hills of Guangdong stand blue in the distance. Then, just as you are beginning to pant a little perhaps, through a sudden gap you see the city itself precipitously below you, stirring in the morning. The early sun catches the windows of Kowloon across the water, the ferries are coming and going already, and the traffic hurries to work over flyover and highway far below. Seen from this high eyrie it is like somewhere in another country.",
