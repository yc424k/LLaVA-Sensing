It had been the first really warm spring day – the water cold and bracing. It was good to feel salt on one’s skin, in one’s hair, salt mixed with dust between one’s sandalled toes. It would be another hour before lamp-light, and by now the harbour walk would be full of people taking their dusk aperitifs. I was on my way to buy a torch battery and a roll of film when the flute intervened.",

Several groups of horsemen and a few horsewomen overtook us on their way to San Marcos and greeted us gravely. Juana brayed sociably to the ponies. Rachel was walking, so that her flea-bag and husky suit could be laid across the load and saddle to dry. In a small pueblo, where groups with churns were awaiting the Cajamarca milk-lorry, a young man kindly pointed out a redura down a steep slope of red earth between high red embankments. Then came a grey-brown plain where emaciated sheep grazed on nothing. At its edge we found ourselves staring into an apparently fathomless ravine, long, narrow and vegetation-filled; this Andean landscape is wondrously unpredictable. Suddenly an elderly limping campesino in a frayed poncho appeared like a genie and indicated another redura, half overgrown by green thorny bushes, which hairpinned around the side of the ravine. It then levelled out while taking us onto a bare, boulder-strewn mountain-side where it plunged precipitously to join the road near San Marcos.",

High up, in the immense and tempestuous skies, the clouds were driving at furious speed, in an inexhaustible processional, across the visage of a wild and desolate moon, which broke through momently with a kind of savage and beleaguered reprisal to cast upon the waste below a shattered, lost and fiercely ragged light. Here then, in this storm-lost desolation of earth and sky, the train hung poised as the only motionless and unchanging object, and all things else – the driving and beleaguered moon, the fiercely scudding clouds, the immense regimentation of heaven which stormed onward with the fury of a gigantic and demoniacal cavalry, and the lonely and immortal earth below sweeping past with a vast fan-shaped stroke of field and wood and house – had in them a kind of unchanging changefulness, a spoke-like recurrence which, sweeping past into oblivion, would return as on the upstroke of a wheel to repeat itself with an immutable precision, an unvarying repetition.",

What other tongue had had the power to touch his pride and his senses as this one had – how cruelly had its disdain wounded him, how magnificently had its praise filled his heart with glory! On these nights when he and Starwick had walked along the river in these vehement, passionate and yet affectionate debates, he would relive the scene for hours after it had ended, going over their discussion again and again, remembering every gesture, every intonation of the voice, every flash of life and passion in the face. Late in the night he would pace up and down his room, or pause dreaming by his window, still carrying on in his mind the debate with his friend, inventing and regretting splendid things he might have said, exulting in those he had said and in every word of approval or burst of laughter he had provoked. And he would think: Ah, but I was good there! I could see how he admired me, how high a place I have in his affection. For when he says a thing he means it: he called me a poet, his voice was quiet and full of passion; he said my like had never been, that my destiny was great and sure.",

I was dreaming up an idea for a TV show that I hoped I could shoot in Argentina. I had been ready to move there, at least for a while.

It was more than just a slackening of joints and muscles, it was a collapsing of the entire body as undammed water collapses, arrested for the moment for him to look at but still seeking that profound and primal level much lower than that of the walking and upright, lower than the prone one of the little death called sleep, lower even than the paper-thin spurning sole; the flat earth itself and even this not low enough, spreading, disappearing, slow at first then increasing and at last with incredible speed: gone, vanished, no trace left above the insatiable dust.

George had never seen him before in such a state of extreme agitation. He fairly prayed above the sweating men: It was obvious that the coarse indelicacy of their touch made him shudder. The grin was frozen on his face in an expression of congealed terror. He writhed, he wriggled, he wrung his little hands, he crooned to them. And if anything had happened to that fat, pointed finger, George felt sure that he would have dropped dead on the spot.",

The train roared on across the vast lift of the Piedmont: at night, as he lay in his berth, in a diseased coma, it crawled up into the great fortress of the hills. Dimly, he saw their wintry bulk, with its bleak foresting. Below a trestle, silent as a dream, a white rope of water coiled between its frozen banks. His sick heart lifted in the haunting eternity of the hills. He was hillborn. But at dawn, as he came from the cars with the band of returning students, his depression revived. The huddle of cheap buildings at the station seemed meaner and nearer than ever before. The hills, above the station flats, with their cheap propped houses, had the unnatural closeness of a vision. The silent Square seemed to have rushed together during his absence, and as he left the car and descended the street to Dixieland, it was as if he devoured toy-town distances with a giant’s stride.",

The AMC, founded over 120 years ago, is not only the oldest hiking club in America but the oldest conservation group of any type. It charges a decidedly ambitious $50 a night for a bunk, dinner, and breakfast and consequently is widely known to thru-hikers as the Appalachian Money Club. Still, to its considerable credit, the AMC maintains 1,400 miles of trails in the Whites, runs an excellent visitor center at Pinkham Notch, publishes worthwhile books, and lets you come into its huts to use the toilets, get water, or just warm up, which is what we gratefully did now.",

According to his anonymous hagiographer the dust from his clothes was more powerful than roasted crocodile, camel dung or Bithynian cheese mixed with wax – apparently the usual contents of a Byzantine doctor’s medicine chest. This dust could cure constipation, cast leprosy on an unbeliever, bring a donkey back to life and restore sour wine to sweetness. It was clearly a particularly handy thing to have on board ship in the event of a storm. A certain Dorotheus, a cleric at Symeon’s monastery, sailed during the forbidden period of the year in the midst of winter, trusting to the protection of his stylite master. Far out to sea, however, the vessel ran into a tremendous storm which lashed it with waves so high they rolled over the deck. The Captain was in despair, but Dorotheus took some dust which had been blessed by St Symeon and sprinkled the ship with it; ‘a sweet fragrance filled the air, the churning sea was pacified, a fair wind filled the sails and safely brought the ship to its destination.’",

These gardens consist of families of date trees, five or six sprung from the same stump; fruit trees, casting sparser shadows, whose velvety fruits fall into the seguias; and the parsimonious water supply that carries refreshment to the compact, golden fields which have yielded the meagre barley harvest.",

Already I had heard a great deal about this infamous place, an unrenovated air-raid shelter that now served as a $1.50-a-night bordello where beds were laid out in the windowless corridors and guests could reach the bathroom only by crawling through a hatch. In the lobby of this now legendary underground haunt, a rock-and-roll band serenaded drunken couples, while well-fed sixteen-year-old girls spread themselves languorously out on couches. Keys, of course, were strictly forbidden. “Une fois,” began my roommate, “je devais attendre trente minutes parce que la gardienne lavait ses mains.”",

He senses that the light-fall, surfaces, slopes and sounds of a landscape are all somehow involved in accessing what he calls the ‘keyless chamber[s] of the brain’; that the instinct and the body (the felt smoothness of pebbles, the seen grain of light) must know in ways that the conscious mind cannot. Weather, in particular, is ‘integral’ to his thinking, as Eleanor Farjeon notices: ‘Other people talk about the weather, Edward lived it.’ Like Nan Shepherd thirty years later, he recognizes that weather is something we think in – ‘the wind, the rain, the streaming road, and the vigorous limbs and glowing brain and what they created …We and the storm were one’ – and that we would be better, perhaps, speaking not of states of mind, but rather of atmospheres of mind or meteorologies of mind.",

I test batting from the sleeping bag to use as a caulking, but even when densely compressed, air flows through it. My old gloppy sponges may be effective if I cover them with collars of foam strips. For five hours I try to fill the gaps in the seal. Each time I pump up the tube, a trickle of bubbles breaks the surface. I push in more caulking, but the bubbles multiply and grow larger. To keep the tube tolerably inflated requires fifty pumps every half hour. Three thousand pumps will be needed each day to keep Rubber Ducky III alive. That’s over two hours of grueling exercise, about twice what I think my body can manage. When the seas rebuild, if the patch holds at all, I’ll probably have to double my efforts. It’s impossible.",

He had not yet recovered from the boat ride—and now this. When we finished, I followed a path that led around the bay and onto the tundra. I had never been on actual Russian tundra before. First off, I found old vezdekhot tracks, a whole convention of them, wandering in different directions, and lots of the aluminum containers that Russian military rations come in.

All afternoon it had been no colder than a normal December day at home but once the sun sets the temperature drops dramatically and the Gilgitis get ready for bed. Fuel is a major problem in these unforested areas. Gilgit when last I saw it in midsummer seemed Paradise-on-earth. Now it is no less beautiful in quite a different way, but without our luxury clothing it would seem Hell-on-earth tonight. Yet most of the locals go about barefooted, or sockless in open leather sandals, wearing only cotton shirts and loose pantaloons under their blankets – if they are lucky enough to possess blankets. And judging by appearances the majority are also inadequately fed. No wonder the death-rate soars during winter.",

The kneecap was so loose he could move it all around; it looked grotesque floating freely about, and when he straightened his leg to put weight on it, the joint responded with electric bolts of pain. He went to Dr. Mackay, who examined it and confirmed that it was dislocated. He administered some medications and told Mamen to go easy on it, and by the next morning the kneecap had slipped back into place and the swelling subsided, but it still concerned him. He prided himself on his physical abilities and knew that Bartlett needed him at full strength.",

They requested him to arrange for a meeting with the Imam’s representative, Sheikh Isa ibn Salih, near Sib. They added with no little effrontery that the meeting must take place as soon as possible, since the Imam had collected a large body of troops for the purpose of attacking the Sultan and could not postpone operations for more than a few days. He had gathered together the heads of the rebellious tribes at Sarur, near Samail, to hear the upshot of the conference. The projected meeting was approved, and the Political Agent went to Sib on September 10, in H.M.S. Dalhousie, but news was brought to him by Humeid ei-Fuleiti that, owing to trouble in the interior, Isa ibn Salih would not be able to come to Sib till September 15. The excuse seemed to be genuine; the trouble in question was the murder of the Sheikh of the important Hinawi tribe of the Beni All, Khalaf ibn Sinan; and the Political Agent consented to return on September 15.",

Thayer said, “Shoo!” The grizzly stopped. Thayer walked backward, with no sudden starts. The grizzly followed. In such manner, Thayer walked backward about two hundred yards. Then the grizzly moved off a distance and walked parallel to him all the way—a mile or so—to his camp, where it lost interest and turned away.",
