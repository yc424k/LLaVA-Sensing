On the stone stands you will find offerings of five or six grains of rice, one-yen coins, rows of tiny red torii and mini-bottles of saké, of the sort sold in vending machines. You will also find Japanese-style candles burning on the altars, with twisting fire rising from their wicks, echoing the motif of the flaming jewels.

    "target_paragraph": "It was not that the villages were ever dull to me, and only here in French Guinea were their simplicity and hospitality a little tarnished by the touch of white rule, but the rising in the dark, the hurried breakfast, the seven hours of tramping along narrow paths through the hot-house forest with no view to either side and only occasional glimpses of sky above, this routine became almost unbearable. I was usually alone with a carrier or a guide who couldn’t speak English, for Mark and Amedoo could not keep my pace, and I had to try in vain to occupy the mind, to think of things to think about. I would calculate: I can think of this place or that person for so many hundred steps, and I would have a sense of triumph when the thought lasted me for a few dozen steps further than I had hoped. But usually it was the other way; the image or the idea lost interest a long while before I had taken the hundred paces. And this succession of thoughts had to be kept up for six or seven hours on end. I remember for what a long time I was able to think of fruit salts, for far longer and with more longing than I thought of beer or iced drinks. I suppose my digestion was suffering from the tinned foods, rough rice, the dry tough African chickens, and about five eggs a day. For the only way to economize our tinned supplies, which threatened to run short, was to eat off the country, rice, eggs and chicken, for meal after meal.",

But there could be no doubt that he was in reality still possessed to the full by the new idea, whatever that might be. At length he went back to the door of the dining-room, paused, and found that the songs, toasts, and conversation were proceeding quite satisfactorily without his presence. The Corporation, private residents, and major and minor tradesmen had, in fact, gone in for comforting beverages to such an extent that they had quite forgotten not only the Mayor, but all those vast political, religious, and social differences which they felt necessary to maintain in the daytime, and which separated them like iron grills. Seeing this the Mayor took his hat, and when the waiter had helped him on with a thin holland overcoat, went out and stood under the portico.",

She was beautiful; tall, lavishly curved, smooth brown skin, thick wavy brown hair to her shoulders and long green eyes: living proof that miscegenation does a power of good. Standing in the doorway, with her hands on her hips, she stared at the peeling blonde visitor with undisguised contempt and dislike. I couldn’t think how to respond. Cringe or snub? Jean, apparently sure of himself by daylight, ordered her to bring food. Rice and lobster and fried bananas. Delicious. Perhaps her cooking compensated for her witchcraft. She moved slowly, graceful as a panther, showing resentment in every gesture. She refused to speak or eat with us.",

By June 1963 there were over 1100 children in the camp, which had adequate accommodation for about 300, and at this point SCF sent a fully trained nurse – Juliet Maskell, from Birmingham – to cope with the crisis as best she could. Not surprisingly, Juliet collapsed from overwork after six weeks, and was now a patient in Kangra Mission Hospital. The Menteths were in despair about this situation and by the time tea had been cleared away it was obvious that my destination would have to be Dharamsala instead of Kangra.",

If a fracture occurred, one might get stuck in their bag, and they “hobble your arms and legs and you drown,” he’d warned.

It didn’t go down too well when, a few days after arriving in the Netherlands, I asked a passing stranger why there were tricolor French flags on display everywhere. ‘They’re not French flags,’ he harrumphed. ‘They’re Dutch. The French stole our flag and turned it sideways.’ When Brits return home from holidays abroad they immediately start grumbling about how terrible it is to be back in the cold and rain. The Dutch, meanwhile, walk through the arrivals hall at Schiphol airport with huge grins on their faces, delighted to be back in their perfect little country.",

With my backpack for a pillow, I lay down and drew my jacket tight around me. The bench was slatted and hard and studded with big roundheaded bolts that made reclining in comfort an impossibility—doubtless their intention. I lay for a long time listening to the sea washing over the beach below, and eventually dropped off to a long night of mumbled dreams in which I found myself being pursued over Arctic ice floes by a beady-eyed Frenchman with a slingshot, a bag of bolts, and an uncanny aim, who thwacked me repeatedly in the buttocks and legs for stealing a linen napkin full of seepy food and leaving it at the back of a dresser drawer in my hotel room. I awoke with a gasp about three, stiff all over and quivering from cold. The fog had gone. The air was now still and clear, and the sky was bright with stars. A beacon from the lighthouse at the far end of the breakwater swept endlessly over the sea. It was all most fetching, but I was far too cold to appreciate it. I dug shiveringly through my backpack and extracted every potentially warming item I could find—a flannel shirt, two sweaters, an extra pair of jeans. I used some woolen socks as mittens and put a pair of flannel boxer shorts on my head as a kind of desperate headwarmer, then sank heavily back onto the bench and waited stoically for death’s sweet kiss. Instead, I fell asleep.",

It was a cow bell, drowsy, far and broken in a gust of wind, as it came to him faintly from the far depth and distance of a mountain valley; the receding whistle-wail of a departing train, as it rushed eastward, seaward, towards the city, through some green mountain valley of the South; or a cloud shadow passing on the massed green of the wilderness, and the animate stillness, the thousand sudden, thrumming, drumming, stitching, unseen little voices in the lyric mystery of tangled undergrowth about him.",

The bottom fell away into nothingness as we drifted out over the depths. It felt like flying over a canyon. It was eerie to be looking down hundreds of feet into the crystal water, the deep blue contrasting sharply with the light green of the lagoon. Shafts of sunlight pierced the depths, quivering and undulating. The only sound was the slight whistle of the wind blowing across the opening of my snorkel.",

A place he had never been, but where the grass grew greener and the bricks were redder, where the freight train and the cistern, in addition to the proud horses, in that splendid symmetry, including nature, surpassed anything that he had ever seen and they gave him a pleasant feeling. It was The North, The North, the shimmering and charming North, the North of green grass, the red stable and the perfect houses. The placid and symmetrical North, where even freight trains and machines always seemed freshly painted. It was the North, where even the factory workers wore a gleaming blue jumpsuit as ornate as a soldier's uniform; where even the rivers were blue like sapphires; where you couldn't see a single unpolished edge anywhere. It was the North, the perfect, shiny, happy and symmetrical North. It was the North, his father's land, where he would one day go. He paused for a moment to look at another window. That lavish and well-photographed landscape filled him, as always, with a feeling of comfort and expectations.",

He is a fat young man with fairish curly hair and an important bearing. Give a man control of some machine, and at once his air of importance and more-than-human dignity develops. One of the unaccountable members of the crew lounges in the little doorway, like a chicken on one foot, having nothing to do. The girl from Cagliari comes up with two young men—also Sardinians by their thick-set, independent look, and the touch of pride in their dark eyes. She has no wraps at all: just her elegant fine-cloth dress, her bare head from which the wisps of hair blow across her brow, and the transparent \"nigger\" silk stockings. Yet she does not seem cold. She talks with great animation, sitting between the two young men. And she holds the hand of the one in the overcoat affectionately. She is always holding the hand of one or other of the two young men: and wiping wisps of windblown hair from her brow: and talking in her strong, nonchalant voice, rapidly, ceaselessly, with massive energy. Heaven knows if the two young men—they are third class passengers—were previous acquaintances. But they hold her hand like brothers—quite simply and nicely, not at all sticky and libidinous. It all has an air of \"Why not?\"",

So we made the best of things and tried to enjoy the situation and make our lives as full as possible in a less than optimal situation. We bought a window air conditioning unit and built a plenum of plywood to fit the center hatch so that the whole boat was cool and arid in the sultry Trinidadian climate. This was a dramatic improvement in comfort but meant that we spent more time chilling under the AC and somewhat less time doing boat work. We rigged our television with an antenna in order to receive local broadcasts. We built a sturdy staircase of pine to replace the steep pipe ladder we had been obliged to climb dozens of times per day. I built a large lockable plywood toolbox so that I could leave my tools, projects, supplies and chemicals down below at night instead of carrying everything up and down at the start and end of every workday, a great time saver. I built a workbench and fitted it with a vice. All in all it was quite comfortable and convenient, at least as much as is possible on the hardstand, which essentially amounts to living on a boat propped up in the middle of a dry field and surrounded by a lot of other boats.",

After cutting blocks enough for a few layers, they’d roof the igloo with their tent and weight it down with pemmican tins, snowshoes, and more heavy blocks, then shovel lighter snow on top. Then they would crawl in, with just enough headroom to sit up and boil water for tea and a gruel of pemmican and seal meat. Even though they were exhausted by the end of each day, it was hard to sleep with the wail of the winds, which flapped the tent roof and more than once tore it completely off, so they had to run out onto the ice in the middle of the night and leap on it before it blew away. And there was the constant fear of the ice splitting right beneath them; so they lay fully clothed, curled together for some body heat, shaking and trembling in a half-dozed stupor.",

We found another restaurant with a menu posted out front. It promised grilled meats and rice dishes and plates of pasta, but the doors were closed and the lights were off.

I stumble through sucking mud toward this false vision, on and on until the muck is over my feet, and up to my ankles, and I am shin-deep in a warm broth that, when stirred, releases a draft so stagnant I can taste it.",

This sort of place is by now, in most parts of the world, tourist-sodden. I, however, had it to myself as I walked towards the Customs Office. By then the seasonal forenoon wind had risen and white waves frisked on the deep blue water. A few miles off-shore lay a scrubby islet shaped, disconcertingly, like a nuclear submarine – and inhabited, my binoculars revealed. (Post-breakfast, these no longer shook.) Ahead of me a long wooded promontory sheltered Bukoba’s important port. There is no road – not even what Tanzanians call a road – to Mwanza; all traffic must go by water and Tanzanian Railways runs a speedy, efficient ferry service. Now I could see the Victoria, spick and span, painted dazzling white. She would sail at 9 p.m. and dock at 6 a.m.; a nine-hour non-stop journey, as compared to the three hours from Britain to Ireland, which helps get Lake Victoria in perspective. At the Customs Office I booked a berth in a six-berth second-class cabin (£4) and bought Lear’s ticket (80p). And there I met Mumfi, booking a ticket for the first stage of her return journey to the UK a week hence.",

As I turned the last corner and came to rest under the belfries of the Abbey I saw that the whole village was there in the little square, the usual loafers sitting under the Tree of Idleness. The crowd was of Sunday proportions; nobody had gone to work. But as the engine fell silent I was aware of some altogether novel factor about the scene. It lacked all animation. The whiskered shep­herds were all sitting in their accustomed places but nobody had ordered a coffee; the dusty packs of playing-cards lay on Dmitri’s shelf untouched. It was like a hollow transcription of a known reality snapped by the camera’s lens. To the matured resonance of the Abbey’s silence the villagers had added, like an extra dimension, a silence of their own, hollow and profound. My footsteps echoed harshly on the gravel as I walked slowly across to the little café which was crowded but utterly silent. Everybody looked at the ground, awkwardly and with a shy clumsy disfavour. My good morning provoked a raised head and a nod here and there, but not the usual roar of response and the wave of brown hands. Dmitri stood behind his bar counter holding on to his apron as if for support, and swallow­ing. He had turned so white that he looked as if he were about to faint. He answered my greeting by moving his lips sound­lessly. My mail lay on the counter before him. I took up the letters, feeling as if I should apologize for intruding upon a scene of such universal grief.",

Eugene remembered the soft cool nights of summer, the assembled boarders and ‘I Wonder Who’s Kissing Her Now,’ which Gant demanded over and over; ‘Love Me and the World Is Mine’; ‘Till the Sands of the Desert Grow Cold’; ‘Dear Old Girl, the Rob-bin Sings Above You’; ‘The End of a Perfect Day’; and ‘Alexander’s Rag-Time Band,’ which Luke had practised in a tortured house for weeks, and sung with thunderous success in the High School Minstrels.",

Every contact with the humanitarian movements distinguishing her native country from the selfish laissez faire and cynical indifference of Europe filled her with a new optimism, and shed a reassuring light on all her private cares. America really seemed to have an immediate answer for everything, from the treatment of the mentally deficient to the elucidation of the profoundest religious mysteries. In such an atmosphere of universal simplification, how could one’s personal problems not be solved? “The great thing is to believe that they will be,” as Mrs. Swoffer said, à propos of the finding of funds for the new League For Discovering Genius. The remark was so stimulating to Pauline that she immediately drew a large cheque, and accepted the chairmanship of the committee; and it was on the favouring breeze of the League’s applause that she sailed, at the tea-hour, into Lita’s boudoir.",
