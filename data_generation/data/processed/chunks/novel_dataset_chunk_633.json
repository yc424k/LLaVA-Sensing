As Crocodylus was newly opened, and, in that pre-internet era, word had still not spread about this little eco resort in the rainforest, the place was quiet. Apart from a few backpackers like us, the only guests were occasional couples. The women had nice hair and many sets of bikinis and were not living out of rucksacks. The men looked clean cut and wore shades, even in the dim rainforest.",

Then Jenny put on the sponge.\nShe could hear Jenny say, \"It was the Master's fault. She didn't ought to have been left in the room with him.\"\nShe remembered. The dining-room and the sharp spike on the fender and Papa's legs stretched out. He had told her not to run so fast and she had run faster and faster.

We have eaten beef and pudding enough to live for a week without tasting food. Therefore we cluster like maggots on the back of something that will carry us on. Decorous, portly—we have white hair waved under our hats; slim shoes; little bags; clean-shaven cheeks; here and there a military moustache; not a speck of dust has been allowed to settle anywhere on our broadcloth. Swaying and opening programmes, with a few words of greeting to friends, we settle down, like walruses stranded on rocks, like heavy bodies incapable of waddling to the sea, hoping for a wave to lift us, but we are too heavy, and too much dry shingle lies between us and the sea. We lie gorged with food, torpid in the heat. Then, swollen but contained in slippery satin, the sea-green woman comes to our rescue. She sucks in her lips, assumes an air of intensity, inflates herself and hurls herself precisely at the right moment as if she saw an apple and her voice was the arrow into the note, “Ah!”",

Although he is near seventy, he still works long, hard hours, and when it snows in Chicago, his work ethic forces him outside in his overcoat to scrape snow and ice from the car. He then drives to a distant location, opens a store, manages it during the storm, and simultaneously substitutes for any missing salesmen. One night in a particularly bad blizzard, he closes the store, anxious to get home. But the highways are slippery, and rapidly falling flakes block visibility. Cars move at incredibly slow speeds, the roads too bad to navigate. Dad tries to continue, but soon cars jam the entire highway. Police come down the midline and shoulders to pick up stranded motorists. Schools and churches shelter men wearing wrinkled suits, perspiration-drenched shirts, and smelly, wet wool overcoats.",

The trouble was the banks, far too steep, making a sharp V with water at the bottom. The Landrover would go nose down all right, but how would it go nose up. This was a baby canyon and needed a baby bridge across its top. Still, others passed this way so it must be a possible operation. Sitting here didn’t solve the problem; taking it fairly fast in second gear might be the best method. The Landrover sped down, the front wheels landed past the middle of the stream, the rear wheels stayed on the rear bank, and in this inclined position stopped dead. I shifted to first gear and heard a grinding noise. No movement. In vain I tried to pull the four-wheel gear; either it had jammed or I had run out of muscle.",

Spaces reserved for doubles are rare and are usually occupied by standard rigs. Naturally, doubles drivers never park in a fuel lane overnight. The truck stops would have something to say about that! When stopping overnight a doubles driver either found one of those rare pull-through spots or pulled nose first into a parking space in the middle of the lot, far from curbs. Being a longer rig, the back trailer takes up part of the space behind, essentially taking two spaces.",

It was night: the fire burned cheerfully in the grate, the hot coals spurting in small gaseous flares from time to time. The house was very quiet all around them. Outside they could hear the stormy wind in the trees along the road. Morison flicked his cigarette into the fire, poured out a drink of whisky into a glass, saying as he did so: ‘I say, old chap, you don’t mind if I take a spot of this before I go to bed, do you?’ Then he shot some seltzer in the glass and drank. And Eugene sat there, without a word, staring sullenly into the fire, dumbly conscious of the flood of sick pain and horror which the casual foulness of the man’s suggestion had aroused, stubbornly trying to deny now that he was thinking of the girl all the time.\n \nOne night, as Eugene was coming home along the dark road that went up past the playing field to the house, and that was bordered on each side by grand trees whose branches seemed to hold at night all the mysterious and demented cadences of storm, he came upon her suddenly standing in the shadow of a tree. It was one of the grand wild nights that seemed to come so often in the autumn of that year: the air was full of a fine stinging moisture, not quite rain, and above the stormy branches of the trees he could see the sky, wild, broken, full of scudding clouds through which at times the moon drove in and out with a kind of haggard loneliness. By that faint, wild, and broken light, he could see the small white oval of the girl’s face – somehow even more lovely now just because he could not see it plainly. And he could see as well the rough gleaming bark of the tree against which she leaned.",

It began in 1964, when my family arrived in Yokohama. In that year, the imbalance between city and rural incomes passed a critical point, and farmers from all over Japan fled the countryside. Much poorer and with a more loosely organized society than the rice-growing communities of the plains, Iya was especially hard hit, as villagers moved down to Tokushima and Osaka. After 1970, the pace of kaso increased, and Iya was filled with abandoned houses. It occurred to me that I could own a house there.",

The second language is English and almost everyone speaks it with a charming New Zealand lilt mixed with the music of their own accent. To me, Marquesan, Tahitian and Samoan all sound pretty much the same, a sort of phonetically spoken Asian language laced with many twists and rolls of the tongue, and I stuttered along with my usual Please’s and Thank You’s in Samoan, unable to get much further in the short time I was there.",

Dew had fallen heavily since the wind had dropped, but, as he stood there, he thought there would be frost by morning.\nAs he stood breathing deep and then listening to the night, he heard first, firing far away, and then he heard an owl cry in the timber below, where the horse corral was slung. Then inside the cave he could hear the gypsy starting to sing and the soft chording of a guitar.\n“I had an inheritance from my father,” the artificially hardened voice rose harshly and hung there. Then went on:\n“It was the moon and the sun\n“And though I roam all over the world\n“The spending of it’s never done.”",

We were then joined by Luis (aged ten) and Carlos (aged seven) who live in a nearby isolated shack. They are an enchanting pair, their curiosity and excitement beautifully tempered by courtesy and sensitivity. The local fuel is poor and our fire was a problem. So they rushed off, returned with armfuls of aromatic grass, stuffed it between my stones, expertly wielded their panama hats – and within five minutes our coffee water was boiling. They were very concerned lest Juana might be stolen while we slept and advised me to put the picket down inside the tent!",

In trying to isolate this peculiarity, if it exists at all and is not simply an illusion, we must beware of a danger well known to explorers of both the micro- and the macrocosmic – that of confusing the thing observed with the mind of the observer, of constructing not a picture of external reality but simply a mirror of the thinker. Can this danger be avoided without falling into an opposite but related error, that of separating too deeply the observer and the thing observed, subject and object, and again falsifying our view of the world? There is no way out of these difficulties – you might as well try running Cataract Canyon without hitting a rock. Best to launch forth boldly, with or without life jackets, keep your matches dry and pray for the best.",

But Mrs. Ralston’s method was different, and less easy to analyze. What Mrs. Manson Mingott had accomplished with epigram, invective, insistency and runnings to and fro, the other achieved without raising her voice or seeming to take a step from the beaten path. When she had persuaded Jim Ralston to take in the foundling baby, it had been done in the turn of a hand, one didn’t know when or how; and the next day he and she were as untroubled and beaming as usual. And now, this adoption! Well, she had pursued the same method; as Sillerton Jackson said, she behaved as if her adopting Tina had always been an understood thing, as if she wondered that people should wonder. And in face of her wonder, theirs seemed foolish, and they gradually desisted.",

When it comes to not speaking Mandarin, it turns out I’ve been in good company. The room grows still, but only briefly, and then the chatter and laughter build again, like an orchestra tuning for an overture. Normally I’m so impatient that if there’s even one person ahead of me in line I dissolve into twitches. Impatience could be called one of my chief features. Or more accurately, my greatest flaw. My reaction to knowing that the people in front of me will move to the next thing before I will is physical, a combination of jaw clenching, muscle tensing, and shallow breathing. My brain becomes undisciplined, unwilling to focus on a conversation, conniving instead on how I can right this unfairness by sneaking to the front. Would that I could say I do these things unconsciously, but I don’t. My intolerance shames me. With Sybil’s company, and no route book demanding attention, for the first time in my life I feel relaxed in a crowd. This is such a novel experience that I smile at the ceiling, marveling at what it feels like to be too happy while waiting in line. These couple of hours of companionable banter are more welcome to me than a hot shower at the end of a long day’s drive. Almost.",

Rodney’s rooms were small, but the sitting-room window looked out into a courtyard, with its flagged pavement, and its single tree, and across to the flat red-brick fronts of the opposite houses, which would not have surprised Dr Johnson,* if he had come out of his grave for a turn in the moonlight.

Individually the gentlest of men, the Copts at prayer made a massive, dense, booming sound, each stanza sung by the monastic cantor echoed by a thundering barrage of massed male voices. The wall of sound reverberated around the church, bouncing off the squinches of the dome, crashing onto the mud-brick roof then down again like a lead weight into the nave. Yet despite its heaviness, there was nothing harsh or brutal about the Coptic chant, the swelling notes of the refrain resolving to give the whole threnody a tragic, desolate air, as if all the distilled deprivations of generations of monks were being enunciated and offered up, at once an agonised atonement for the sins of mankind and an exorcism forestalling the terrors of the night to come.",

Orwell’s hatred towards colonialism, nurtured in the heat and solitude, grew like a hothouse flower. He wrote that he felt guilty about his role in the great despotic machine of empire and became haunted by the ‘faces of prisoners in the dock, of men waiting in the condemned cells, of subordinates I bullied and aged peasants I had snubbed, of servants and coolies I had hit with my stick in moments of rage’. One of Orwell’s most famous essays, ‘A Hanging’, describes walking a convicted criminal to the gallows in a Burmese prison. The key moment in the piece is when the condemned man steps aside to avoid getting his feet wet in a puddle and Orwell realizes that this nameless victim is a living human being just like himself: ‘He and we were a party of men walking together, seeing, hearing, feeling, understanding the same world; and in two minutes, with a sudden snap, one of us would be gone—one mind less, one world less.’ This essay, first published in 1931, is still used today in campaigns against capital punishment.",

    "target_paragraph": "Among them, however, you will often find the most rewarding surprises. This was so now when I took down a photographic history of Surfers Paradise, the famous Queensland beach resort, which caught my eye because I was heading there shortly. The book covered the story of the resort’s development from the 1920s, when it was a flyblown coastal hamlet of neither fame nor consequence, to the early 1970s, when it abruptly burst forth as a kind of Miami Beach of the Southern Hemisphere. What particularly captivated me were the photographs of it during its intermediate phase, in the 1940s and ’50s, when it was much closer in spirit and appearance to Coney Island or Blackpool. It is odd to be filled with a nostalgic longing for a place you have never known, but I was with Surfers Paradise and its innocent vacationers. I gazed enraptured at page after page of crisp black-and-white photographs showing happy people at play—strolling in happy groups along the Esplanade, jitterbugging in dance halls, sitting with drinks at surfside bars. How I envied them their snazzy outfits.

There’s not much I can do except search for a particular size of bolt or wipe off a socket wrench for him. I’m purely a set of hands with no brain. Now and then I glance at the monastery above us. The dark gray cliff face looks like it’s been polished by hand over the centuries, and I wonder why religious buildings are so often placed in spots that are so difficult to reach. From my vantage point it looks like a toy, peopled with tiny Rally crews making their way along narrow wood walkways that connect the buildings. A request for a screwdriver brings me back to the hot tarmac. Bernard sweats while I loll about trying to look engaged in the serious work going on next to me.",

The North Side, where we were to spend many years, has a reputation for elegance, but for a long time my eyes saw only what I already knew I would see—awful Chicago. Even when my senses convinced me that the street where we lived was not as dark, not as hemmed in as I had expected, I felt dark and hemmed in. At that, it wasn't a pretty place. My father found an apartment on Lawrence Avenue and signed a lease without consulting my mother, and she was not pleased, though it wasn't really as squalid as she said it was. Later, we were to move several times, and each removal would find us in a pleasanter place, but I couldn't look into the future, and I thought we would be stuck forever, without escape, in that narrow red brick building with its curious strung-out arrangement of rooms hitched to each other like boxcars.",

Odds were very great that one touch of man scent would cause him to stop his activity, pause in a moment of absorbed and alert curiosity, and then move, at a not undignified pace, in a direction other than the one from which the scent was coming. That is what would happen almost every time, but there was, to be sure, no guarantee. The forest Eskimos fear and revere the grizzly. They know that certain individual bears not only will fail to avoid a person who comes into their country but will approach and even stalk the trespasser. It is potentially inaccurate to extrapolate the behavior of any one bear from the behavior of most, since they are both intelligent and independent and will do what they choose to do according to mood, experience, whim. A grizzly that has ever been wounded by a bullet will not forget it, and will probably know that it was a human being who sent the bullet. At sight of a human, such a bear will be likely to charge. Grizzlies hide food sometimes—a caribou calf, say, under a pile of scraped-up moss—and a person the bear might otherwise ignore might suddenly not be ignored if the person were inadvertently to step into the line between the food cache and the bear. A sow grizzly with cubs, of course, will charge anything that suggests danger to the cubs, even if the cubs are nearly as big as she is. They stay with their mother two and a half years.",
