My first impression was confirmed: I had never seen such smoothness. Hand movements were strikingly in synch with feet. Knees were more deeply bent than in the surfing I was used to, hips looser. There wasn’t much nose-riding, which was the subspecialty rage at the time on the mainland and required scurrying, when the opportunity arose, to the front of one’s board—hanging five, hanging ten, defying the obvious physics of flotation and glide. I didn’t know it then, but what I was looking at was classic Island style. I just took my mental notes from the channel, and began, without thinking about it, to walk the nose less.",

Although sleep was impossible, Laura and I sank into a state of exhausted, befuddled semi-consciousness, and thereafter the night took on a confused and even surreal quality. Sometime soon after midnight, we ran into a herd of camels. There must have been nearly a hundred of them and the first thing we saw was the dust cloud they raised looming ahead of us in the headlights like a bank of swirling sea fog. They were running towards us along the road and when we slowed down, you could hear the thundering of their hooves on the ground long before you could see the camels themselves. Then they were all around us, banging into the pick-up, muzzling its sides, lolloping along aimlessly with the whole desert to wander in, yet pressing around us as closely as a herd of cows in a Dorset lane.",

I tried to go to Romania, but Ceausescu’s sentinels reckoned I was a decadent parasite and refused me a visa. Then the police raided a flophouse where I was staying. They arrested three Brits, who were convicted the next day of hashish possession and sentenced to several years each. I moved to another roof.

During the seventeenth century alone the population of the Netherlands doubled, and more mouths to feed and people to house meant that even more land was needed. As the Industrial Revolution picked up speed, a new solution presented itself in the form of steam-powered pumps. Initially resisted by farmers, who thought the engine noise would scare cows, these quickly enabled massive new polders to be drained, including nearly 200,000 acres in the nineteenth century alone. In the 1860s, steam pumps helped drain a huge lake south of Amsterdam, including a certain part known, on account of its many shipwrecks, as the ‘ship-hole’. The name survived at the airport built on the new polder – Schiphol – where planes could land and take off from an area that used to be several metres under water.",

Sprays of flaxen-haired corn lay on the hedges, brushed from the shaggy carts that came up from the meadows short legged and primeval looking. The round-headed clouds never dwindled as they bowled along, but kept every atom of their rotundity. Now, as they passed, they caught a whole village in the fling of their net and, passing, let it fly free again. Far away on the horizon, among the million grains of blue-grey dust, burnt one pane, or stood the single line of one steeple or one tree.",

Indeed, as Reichel-Dolmatoff revealed in all of his studies, it is only through an appreciation of the broader geographical and cultural contexts that one can even begin to understand what these enigmatic and monumental statues may be trying to say.",

Long before this I had realised that plums were to be my portion : plums, or bananas, or very green apples, mitigated by a biscuit unless biscuits chanced to be scarce (in which case the ladies got them), at a time of day when the rest of Europe was sitting down comfortably to its luncheon; and I had learned to acquiesce in this as I acquiesced in all the other privations, for I saw for myself that it was impossible to arrange a cooked meal except before leaving or after arriving in camp. A reasonable man is silent before the impossible; still, plums are poor things to march on. March on them however I had to, and Hunger (a most unpleasant and reverberating companion) came too, and marched with me every day.",

This may help to explain the contradictory colour-epithets which the ancients bestowed upon it. Even now it is still revered as emblem of peace and plenty, a sprig of olive being attached to boats and houses after the Easter blessing. There is this peculiarity in its leaves, that they can make no fluttering movements like those of most plants; they are affixed to the stem like metal plates, and if the wind blows it is the whole limb of the tree which sways. And so a pretty effect may often be seen upon these olive-coloured slopes: the branches bending with one accord to the breeze expose the white under-surface of all the leaves, and the hillside is clothed in silver.",

The film was rough, and the sound bad, as Hendrix and his band played in a scrubby field in a howling trade wind. There was a sketchy, cinema-verité romance between Hendrix and a willowy black woman from New York. She was holding the Maui hippie commune scene at arm’s length, and Hendrix was holding it farther away than that. His slurred, throwaway lines made me laugh. A passive-aggressive commune leader named Baron got so annoying that Hendrix was obliged to pick him off a balcony with a rifle. The movie ended with a no-budget sequence about “space brothers” from Venus landing in the crater at Haleakala. I took the ending as pure spoof. But the more talk I heard, in the bookstore and elsewhere, about “Venusians,” the more I realized that mine was a minority interpretation.",

Greylock is the highest eminence in Massachusetts and the first hill over 3,000 feet since Virginia for northbound hikers. It’s just 3,491 feet to the top, but, surrounded as it is by much smaller hills, it looks considerably bigger. It has in any case a certain imposing majesty that beckons.

Then she added: ‘You look like nothing on earth; in your place I’d go to bed at once, Stephen.’\n‘You go to bed, Puddle, if you’re tired—where’s Mother?’\n‘In her bath. For heaven’s sake do come to bed! I can’t bear to see you looking as you do these days.’\n‘I’m all right.’\n‘No, you’re not, you’re all wrong. Go and look at your face.’\n‘I don’t very much want to, it doesn’t attract me,’ smiled Stephen.\nSo Puddle went angrily up to her room, leaving Stephen to sit with a book in the hall near the telephone bell, in case Angela should ring. And there, like the faithful creature she was, she must sit on all through the night, patiently waiting. But when the first tinges of dawn greyed the window and the panes of the semicircular fanlight, she left her chair stiffly to pace up and down, filled with a longing to be near this woman, if only to stand and keep watch in her garden—Snatching up a coat she went out to her car.",

I knew it was close. A frog serenade greeted me and waves of homesickness washed over me.

In other habitats, the rim of sky above the horizontal is broken or obscured; here, together with the overhead portion, it is infinitely vaster than that of rolling countryside and forest lands….In an unobstructed sky the clouds seem more massive, sometimes grandly reflecting the earth’s curvature on their concave undersides.

But his brief account gave me a glimpse of an alternate history embedded in the saga of European conquest. With hindsight, it’s tempting to see the exploration and settlement of America as grimly mechanistic: the inexorable grinding down of one world by another. Individuals seem to matter little, except as agents of distant empires, or as their inevitable victims.",

Then he turned deliberately and carefully until he believed he was facing his back trail and the direction from which he had come, and walked forward.

Inscrutable, eternal, indifferent – those were the words; the right words. But I don’t feel it, she said, looking at the stars. So why pretend to? What they’re really like, she thought, screwing up her eyes to look at them, is little bits of frosty steel. And the moon – there it was – is a polished dish-cover. But she felt nothing, even when she had reduced moon and stars to that. Then she turned and found herself face to face with a young man she thought she knew but could not put a name to.
