He asserted that he did so because the local people are always avid for containers, which is true. But why not set the cans upon the wall instead of littering the place, and making the people pick them up out of the mud?",

    "target_paragraph": "My bus winds up into the land of carved dust. The hills circle and uncoil around us, then level out into a high valley where a tributary of the Yellow River has smoothed its bed to a broken pavement. Out of the scattered villages the bus fills up with Muslim Hui, their women wimpled in black or dark green lace; and soon the towns are thronged with their high white caps, as if thousands of chefs were inexplicably wheeling bicycles and handcarts through the streets. As we go west, the mosque minarets, where no muezzin is allowed to call, taper above the roofs in fantastical belvederes and colonettes, or stand like filigreed toys along the heights which shadow us to Labrang.\nThen suddenly, beyond Linxia, the loess hills have gone, and our valley steepens into stone. A young monk climbs on board, and smiling Tibetan herdsmen in dented felt hats. The shoulders of unseen mountains drop towards us out of the clouds. Once some police stop the bus and we are all emptied on to the verge while a man sprays disinfectant over the floor. The SARS virus has erupted in Xian to our east. The leftover Chinese hook on white masks. The Tibetans go on smiling.\nSoon we are travelling up a steep, misty corridor. The river flows faster, purer, the colour of pale jade. The mountains close in. We have crossed a border unmarked by any map, already infringing on the plateaux of Tibet. The Buddhist stupas sit like nipples on the hills, while prayer-flags fly from the house courtyards and rustle over cairns in the pastures. Here and there, set far up a hillside, the tiered roofs of a monastery cascade to white walls. Then the road disintegrates to a gravel track. In the dusk the slopes are stamped with the shapes of sleeping yaks, and snow is falling in a soft, thin silence.\nI disembark into the night and cold of Labrang. I am still more than three hundred miles from the Tibetan frontier. Lights fade down the street where Hui and Chinese shops have settled beside the monastery town beyond. My feet crunch over the snow, seeming light and lonely, and from somewhere in the darkness ahead–like an old god clearing his throat–sounds the braying of a horn. Then a familiar elation wells up: the childlike anticipation of entering the unknown, some perfect otherness. Your body lightens and tingles. The night fills up with half-imagined buildings, voices you do not understand. The experience is inseparable from solitude and a vestigial fear, because you don’t know where the road will end, who will be there.\nAs it is, the street empties and I cross a rubbish-filled dyke into the unlit Buddhist quarter, and turn by chance into the monastery guesthouse. It is a courtyard of naked rooms, frosty with trees. Besides a caretaker, I glimpse only the herdsmen pilgrims lumbering from door to door, huge against the snow in their swathing coats. My room has a wooden bed and a pail for collecting water from the communal tap. A coal-burning stove sends a wonky chimney through a hole in the ceiling. A lightbulb hangs from a wire. The room costs fifty pence a night. I stretch out under a damp quilt, and listen to the faint, brittle snap of twigs outside as the snow settles.",

The construction was a slow, painstaking process. Days of rain helped—the torrential squall made for dismal hunting conditions and provided Kuraluk with time to work. McKinlay was impressed by the man’s skill: “He spent one of the wettest days working outside in the rain, putting the finishing touches to the framework, lashing all the separate pieces together with sealskin thongs.” He carved and whittled a double-bladed paddle out of a washed-up plank of lumber, and two weeks after starting the task, they brought the frame inside out of the rain to dry. Auntie took measurements and cut lengths of sealskin and sewed these taut around the frame, and the boat was complete on July 18. Everyone was impressed. “When finished,” wrote Chafe, “it looked as if it had been made by some expert boat builder, with modern tools and conveniences … instead of with only a hatchet and a knife.”",

Then she became utterly static beside him and without moving at all she seemed to envelop him, giving him to think of himself surrounded, enclosed by the sweet cloudy fire of her thighs, as young girls can.",

The Brera is the bohemian section of Milan, and, drug addicts notwithstanding, I felt a return to happiness and sanity. (Insanity is a lack of proportion.) I found a Tuscan restaurant with pots of tulips and dimity curtains where I ate tagliatelle with a sauce of tomato and cream; and giant crayfish; and a cream custard.

At the end of each string was a piece of ballast—a bulldog clip, a small bucket, a doorknob—to keep it weighted down, and when I walked down the side streets on a breezy day they clinked together like wind chimes. I watched a deliveryman clip folded newspapers to the end of certain strings. If no one was home, the papers would dangle there waiting to be pulled up later. A vendor tied two plastic bags of noodles to a string for customers waiting above, and a teenage girl sent a lottery ticket flying up to her mother. Once, when I had left a friend’s sixth-floor apartment, I realized only after I had climbed down the stairs and stepped into the light drizzle outside that I had left my umbrella behind. As I looked up towards her balcony, I saw that she had already tied the umbrella to her string and was lowering it down to me.",

There's no worse feeling for a Brit on holiday than checking into a motel after a long drive, and heading out for a cold beer to find bars locked, and chains and padlocks on gas station beer fridges. If we suspected a town to be one of these unfortunate outposts of sobriety, we'd cruise down the main street, warily scanning shops and restaurants for signs of alcohol consumption. Only when we saw full glasses being raised, would we commit to staying the night.",

But in this respect she found Marjorie rather cold; felt somehow the same difficulty in talking to her that she had in talking to men. Marjorie never giggled, was never frightened, seldom embarrassed, and in fact had very few of the qualities which Bernice considered appropriately and blessedly feminine.",

While playing in a tournament of absolutely no consequence in Bridgeton, New Jersey, he lunged for a ball and caught the middle finger of his racket hand on the perimeter fence. The injury itself was trifling, but the wound became infected and two weeks later the top joint of the finger had to be amputated. Today the problem would be resolved with a course of antibiotics. In 1922, Tilden was lucky not to lose his arm or even his life. (Calvin Coolidge’s son would die from a similar infection two years later.)",

Yet that Newson would ever now return to Casterbridge to claim her as a daughter there was little reason to suppose. He was a wanderer and a stranger, almost an alien; he had not seen his daughter for several years; his affection for her could not in the nature of things be keen; other interests would probably soon obscure his recollections of her, and prevent any such renewal of inquiry into the past as would lead to a discovery that she was still a creature of the present. To satisfy his conscience somewhat Henchard repeated to himself that the lie which had retained for him the coveted treasure had not been deliberately told to that end, but had come from him as the last defiant word of a despair which took no thought of consequences. Furthermore he pleaded within himself that no Newson could love her as he loved her, or would tend her to his life’s extremity as he was prepared to do cheerfully.",

It was called ‘the Honeymooners’ Bench’.\n‘That look – that look – that look! Ah – but Trilby had looked like that, too! And there are many Taffys in Devon!’\nHe sat himself down and smoked and gazed at the sea below, which the sun (still in the east) had not yet filled with glare and robbed of the lovely sapphire-blue, shot with purple and dark green, that comes over it now and again of a morning on that most beautiful coast.\nThere was a fresh breeze from the west, and the long, slow billows broke into creamier foam than ever, which reflected itself as a tender white gleam in the blue concavities of their shining, shoreward curves as they came rolling in. The sky was all of turquoise but, for the smoke of a distant steamer – a long thin horizontal streak of dun – and there were little brown or white sails here and there, dotting; and the stately ships went on…\nLittle Billee tried hard to feel all this beauty with his heart as well as his brain – as he had so often done when a boy – and cursed his insensibility out loud for at least the thousand-and-first time.\nWhy couldn’t these waves of air and water be turned into equivalent waves of sound, that he might feel them through the only channel that reached his emotions! That one joy was still left to him – but, alas! alas! he was only a painter of pictures – and not a maker of music!\nHe recited ‘Break, break, break,’ to Alice’s dog, who loved him, and looked up into his face with sapient, affectionate eyes – and whose name, like that of so many dogs in fiction and so few in fact, was simply Tray. For Little Billee was much given to monologues out loud, and profuse quotations from his favourite bards.\nEverybody quoted that particular poem either mentally or aloud when they sat on that particular bench – except a few old-fashioned people, who still said,\n‘Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!’",

As soon as we reached a peak, we were always rewarded with breathtaking views. The valleys and frozen lakes below were spectacular. As I gazed in awe, the vast emptiness, desolation and barrenness that enveloped us inevitably made me ponder our own insignificance. Subsequently, from these heights, the downhills were formidable, a much-deserved reward after the long and hard slogs. Descending a snowy trail at full speed on a fatbike, with towering mountains all around, in the remote wilderness of Greenland, made me feel more alive than I had felt in a long time.",

In the last week, the cooling breeze has turned biting. It is an almost arctic cold. Utterly unprepared, we walk around with shocked expressions, bundled up in every single item of clothing we have stuffed in our backpacks. It makes for some strange-looking volunteers. I myself am wearing a huge fluffy mustard-yellow coat I found in the storage room over a pink eighties ski jacket. The beanie on my head is shaped like a frog. I hear Flighty rustle. A branch creaks, there’s a low, contented croak. I sense her head cocking again, peering at me with one orange-rimmed eye. My eyes start to close. It’s not even six. The days are getting shorter.

    "target_paragraph": "After lunch we paid our respects to the Raja; on the way it began to snow and it hasn’t stopped since. By giving Hallam his head we were shown how to enter the Palace courtyard through a wooden double-door – fifteen feet high and beautifully carved – in a twenty-five-foot-high stone wall. A wide passageway between two-storeyed stables and granaries leads under an archway to a secluded quadrangle, and on the far side stands the many-storeyed Palace, built about 140 years ago by the present Raja’s great-grandfather. The off-white, fortress-like façade is broken at irregular intervals by ten windows of very unequal size. In the centre, built on to the main structure like enormous bay windows, and now in a sad state of disrepair, is a handsome set of four wooden balconies. As the main entrance is no longer in use we climbed a flight of broken, ice-encased steps to a side door where two lovely-looking but very shy young women were obviously awaiting us. The Raja’s daughters, I assumed, though they spoke no English. Smilingly but in silence they guided us along interminable twilit corridors with mud floors and mud walls no different from any peasant’s hovel. Then a low doorway led into almost total darkness and we both stumbled frequently while groping our way through further low doorways, with invisible raised thresholds. When a startled hen squawked and fluttered beside us in the darkness, Rachel emitted an understandable yelp of alarm and gripped harder on my hand. At last we saw a glimmer of light ahead and stepped into a small, low-ceilinged room with a tiny window near the floor. The temperature was around freezing point and the only furniture was a charpoy, a threadbare Bokhara rug and a much-dented tin stove. Two rifles stood against the wall in one corner and a razor and shaving brush lay on the window ledge. The young women gestured towards the charpoy, on which we duly sat. Then they seated themselves on the rug – still silent – and a beaming, excited-looking maidservant hurried in to light the stove. Despite our companions’ resolute silence I felt bound to attempt some bright social chit-chat, in my best hybrid English/Urdu/Balti, but mercifully the Raja soon arrived.",

All through the statehood years, Atwood had been writing columns advocating that the capital be moved. Atwood had, in Harris’s words, “always been ve-he-ment on the subject.” When initiatives made the ballot in 1960 and again in 1962, Juneau taxed property owners to raise money to fight and defeat them. Twelve years went by, during which oil was discovered at Prudhoe Bay, in Arctic Alaska. Money was on the way. In the same period, the population of the Anchorage Bowl a great deal more than doubled. “Fairbanks and Juneau and the bush always combined and defeated the previous initiatives,” Harris told me one day at the cleaners. “But now we had the votes.”",
