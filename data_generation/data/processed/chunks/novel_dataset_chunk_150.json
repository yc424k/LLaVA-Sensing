One morning I chanced to pass as they evaded little Ali (who usually had an older helper) and went bounding up a long stairway devouring everyone’s potted plants en route. (The lucky few Balatans within reach of even an hour’s sunshine assiduously cultivate pots of herbs, flowers and beans.) Poor Ali felt mortified and I gave evidence that evening when he was being unfairly scolded. There was nothing an eight-year-old could do once the goats had twigged the absence of his older brother.",

Perhaps Major Charge might address a remark to me over the hedge. ‘Dolly, my darling,’ my father whispered, dying in the small hotel, as I lay in the Highgate nursery with a night-light beside the bed to drive away the fears which always gathered after my mother—or was it my stepmother?—had pecked me good night. I was afraid of burglars and Indian thugs and snakes and fires and Jack the Ripper, when I should have been afraid of thirty years in a bank and a take-over bid and a premature retirement and the Deuil du Roy Albert.",

Yorgo, the old man’s grandson who had taken my horse and me under his wing (planning to guide us next morning on a short-cut over the hills to a point where we could swoop down on the army again), fished out a long bone flute. The music that began to hover through the hut was moving and breathless. It started with long and deep notes separated by pauses; then it shot aloft in patterns of great complexity. Repeated and accelerating trills led to sustained high notes which left the tune quivering in mid-air before plummeting an octave to those low and long-drawn initial semibreves. Notes of an icy clarity alternated with notes of a stirring, reedy, and at moments almost rasping hoarseness. After a long breath, they sailed again into limpid and piercing airs of a most touching softness; the same minor phrase recurred again and again with diminishing volume, until the final high flourishes presaged the protracted bass notes once more, each of them preceded and followed by a lengthening hiatus of silence. One can think of no apter or more accurate reflection in sound of the mountains and woods and flocks and the nomads’ life.",

The hook, taking two minutes on the way, revolved down to us as the thick steel cable was payed out. This, until the steps were cut in 1932, was the only way into the monastery. In those days, the traveller squatted in a net whose topmost meshes were hitched over the hook, which then floated gently into the air and, revolving and unwinding on itself, was slowly hauled up to the platform on a winch. The net, on its arrival, was fished in with a hooked pole and lowered to the boards. The traveller was then released. In the past century a rope as thick as a man’s wrist was used. Answering the query how often it was changed, a former abbot is reported to have said: ‘Only when it breaks . . .’",

Now, as I set up a deckchair and sun umbrella, Indonesian and Chinese inspectors in business attire tiptoed between the sunbaking men, taking notes on clipboards and surveying the site for demolition. By the end of the year, this would all be torn down.",

Though she did not flush easily, auroral lights ran under her clear skin, were lost in the shadows of her hair, and broke again in her eyes; and her voice seemed to shoot light too, as though her smile flashed back from her words as they fell—all her features being so fluid and changeful that the one solid thing about her was the massing of dense black hair which clasped her face like the noble metal of some antique bust.",

The midday light showered on the woods and a yellow loop of the Danube and a water-meadow full of skaters, all foreshortened as they wheeled and skimmed beneath the flashing line of windows. We were standing at the centre of a wide floor and peering – under a last ceiling-episode of pillars and flung cloud where the figures rotated beneath a still loftier dayspring of revelation – at a scene like a ballroom gallop getting out of hand. Draperies whirled spiralling up biblical shanks and resilient pink insteps trod the sky. We might have been gazing up through a glass dance-floor and my companion, touching me on the elbow, led me away a couple of paces and the scene reeled for a second with the insecurity of Jericho, as trompe l’oeil ceilings will when a shift of focus inflicts the beholder with a fleeting spasm of vertigo. He laughed, and said: ‘On se sent un peu gris, vous ne trouvez pas?’",

He showed us to a carpeted room furnished with a sliding wooden window, a fireplace, and a lot of old books in a niche over the door; it had the smell of an English drawing-room, exhaled by a pot-pourri of rose-leaves that were drying in another niche. Children staggered in with the luggage. Others brought us tea as we sat in the grass outside, gazing at the cool serpentine shadows among the green hills smeared with gold, above which rose the abrupt lilac peaks of the western Hindu Kush.",

It’s no wonder pan-flute virtuosos can make a rendition of “Walking on Sunshine” (which I later heard at the Cusco airport) sound like a funeral dirge. The Andes are a lonely place.",

Every architectural element was decorated with an almost baroque richness of late antique sculpture: over the omega-shaped sanctuary arch, friezes of animals tumbled amid bucolic vine scrolls and palmettes; feathery volutes of windblown acanthus wound their way from the capitals to the voussoirs of the arches, and thence down exuberant and richly carved pilaster strips. The church was sixth-century, yet the architectural tradition from which it grew was far older: the same decorative vocabulary could be seen on Roman monuments two hundred years earlier at Ba’albek and Leptis Magna. At the time of its construction, this sculpture must have appeared not just astonishingly rich; it must also have seemed deliberately conservative, even nostalgic, a deliberate attempt at recalling the grand old Imperial traditions during a time of corruption and decline.",

Haines was the free-spirited half of the pair, and a rare creature in these parts: a town that had stood up to the cruise ship industry and survived when punished for its impudence. When one major company pleaded guilty to dumping “toxic effluent” in Lynn Canal in 1998, Haines introduced its own per-passenger tax. The cruise lines quickly erased Haines from their itineraries. “Ships enter our lives, small cities on the move, consuming beauty, belching waste,” Haines historian Daniel Lee Henry has written. “At the very least, we expect them to behave.” Almost twenty years later, the town sees an average of only one or two big ships a week. Haines has decided to be itself, and it seems to be doing just fine.",

Lighter than a midsize chainsaw by a good twelve pounds, an axe cannot run out of gas, throw its chain, or kick back. An axe is slower, and when efficiency is required, or volume, you’ll wish for the fumy grace of a chainsaw. But as a backup for the saw, or if you have miles to walk and might not need to cut at all, an axe is the most stowable choice. Anyone who thinks an axe is quiet has never had to chop through an old-growth larch. Work is noisy, with or without gas.",

One may retort that the first is a reality (the current reality of our world) while the latter is simply an abstract idea, or an ideal towards which humanity one day may, or may not, move. However, this is not correct. The idea of a world without nationalities is already something we experience as a reality. It is a reality that goes unnoticed because it is the substratum we take for granted: The moment one speaks of one’s nationality with respect to other nationalities, he indirectly presupposes a common quality upon which he makes comparisons. This quality is none other than the basic concept of a human being – the common humanity we all share. [Universal Brotherhood] It is as human beings that we are different. So, while we affirm the concept of nationalities and differentiation, we simultaneously affirm an underlying oneness. Our common humanity is neither a rationalization nor a deduction. It is as much a given as our nationality.",

The cockpit was partitioned off, and for the passengers there was no view forward. Cook’s smile had thinned with altitude. He was a slim man, with receding hair combed straight back, a real-estate man, who somehow seemed formal in a Levi jacket and Levi pants and hiking boots. He had been in Alaska thirty-seven years. He was an advocate of the capital move, and he still held hopes for a site on the Fairbanks side of the Alaska Range. Among his six children was a young accountant who, opposing the move, had helped organize the Fairbanks chapter of Alaskans United. Like father and son, Fairbanks as a whole had split on the issue, and Fairbanks’ vote on the initiative was almost a balance, with a slight tip toward the proponent side.",

That’s where I would have kept straight on, to Jefferson and the railroad, he thought; and suddenly, now that it was too late, now that he had lost all hope of alternative between planned and intelligent escape and mere blind desperate harried fleeing and doubling through the swamp and jungle of the bottom like a spent and starving beast cut off from its den, he knew that for three days now he had not only hoped but had actually believed that opportunity to choose would be given him. And he had not only lost that privilege of choice, but due to the blind mischance which had permitted his cousin either to see or guess what was in the wallet, even the bitter alternative was deferred for another night. It began to seem to him now that that puny and lonely beacon not only marked no ultimate point for even desperate election but was the period to hope itself, and that all which remained to him of freedom lay in the shortening space between it and his advancing foot. I thought that when you killed a man, that finished it, he told himself. But it dont. It just starts then.",

We stalked rabbits and missed, picked bush foods and generally had a good time. He was sheer pleasure to be with, exuding all those qualities typical of old Aboriginal people – strength, warmth, self-possession, wit, and a kind of rootedness, a substantiality that immediately commanded respect. And I wondered as we walked along, how the word ‘primitive’ with all its subtle and nasty connotations ever got to be associated with people like this. If, as someone has said, ‘to be truly civilized, is to embrace disease,’ then Eddie and his kind were not civilized. Because that was what was so outstanding in him: he was healthy, integrated, whole. That quality radiated from him and you would have to be a complete dolt to miss it.",
