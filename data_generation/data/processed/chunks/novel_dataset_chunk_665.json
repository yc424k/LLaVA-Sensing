But she had recalled it without vain bitterness; her store of resignation amounted almost to dignity. She reflected stoically that everything decays, wears out, in this world; that the way of kindness should be made easy to the well disposed; that her daughter Winnie was a most devoted sister, and a very self-confident wife indeed. As regards Winnie’s sisterly devotion, her stoicism flinched. She excepted that sentiment from the rule of decay affecting all things human and some things divine. She could not help it; not to do so would have frightened her too much. But in considering the conditions of her daughter’s married state, she rejected firmly all flattering illusions. She took the cold and reasonable view that the less strain put on Mr Verloc’s kindness the longer its effects were likely to last. That excellent man loved his wife, of course, but he would, no doubt, prefer to keep as few of her relations as was consistent with the proper display of that sentiment. It would be better if its whole effect were concentrated on poor Stevie. And the heroic old woman resolved on going away from her children as an act of devotion and as a move of deep policy.",

It seemed to him that Winny was somewhere on the island smiling gently as of old, and when all had gone he swam in the way the boats had been rowed and found the new- made grave beside the ruined Abbey of the Holy Trinity, and threw himself upon it, calling to Oona to come to him. Above him the square ivy leaves trembled, and all about him white moths moved over white flowers, and sweet odours drifted through the dim air.",

Of course, not all business establishments close down. Milanesi, perhaps recognizing the silliness of having a siesta in a city where mink is worn through March, are engaged in an ongoing debate about business hours, a political issue. Milan is a city of banners, so the dialogue is a public one. Gay banners strung across streets demand shorter working hours, longer working hours, different working hours (8:00 A.M. to 2:00 P.M.). Meanwhile, shops are closed from 12:00 to 4:00, as are tabacchi (where one also buys bus and tram tickets), and in the city where St. Augustine was converted and the Arian heresy was defeated, mink-clad matrons jostle and shove in shops, their manners worse than I have seen exhibited by barefooted South American campesinos standing in mud and haggling over three pathetic eggplants, though the whole point of their dress is to appear well bred. Milanesi do not saunter; they are always purposeful, though to what purpose it is not always clear. Their voices are staccato, like their heels clicking on the slick marble floors.",

Well, Hetty was not one of our own class, of course. She was simply a girl in a village. But I really loved her. I am quite sure that I loved her. All during this wonderful May that we have been having, I used to run down and see her two or three times a week. Yesterday she met me in a little orchard. The apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing. We were to have gone away together this morning at dawn.

The thought of having to wake every morning with this weight on her breast roused her tired mind to fresh effort. She must find some way out of the slough into which she had stumbled: it was not so much compunction as the dread of her morning thoughts that pressed on her the need of action. But she was unutterably tired; it was weariness to think connectedly. She lay back, looking about the poor slit of a room with a renewal of physical distaste. The outer air, penned between high buildings, brought no freshness through the window; steam-heat was beginning to sing in a coil of dingy pipes, and a smell of cooking penetrated the crack of the door.",

Italian babies are swaddled against every climatic and internal contingency. Years ago I sailed on Italian ships from Bombay to New York, a toddler on each hip. They were sweet and wild, my two- and three-year-olds, and had that funky, sweaty, talcumy-delicious smell one loves. The Arabian Sea was glass, the winds caressed, and in the grand ballroom of the ocean liner, my India-bred children, who did not see the point of clothes, took off their clothes and danced. The mothers of the babies in swaddling clothes, returning from Australia, where their meager fortunes had been made, were horrified. That my children's diapers weren't Alpine white was for them a cause of amazement in the ship's laundry room, where we were much discussed. On this ship there was a near mutiny because the supply of anisette had run out halfway to port; this behavior caused me to regard my fellow passengers and crew with affection.",

Nothing of it is now left, though late-nineteenth-century photographs exist of its last towers standing crooked on the beach. Historical data about Dunwich is sufficiently profuse that maps have been made of the former outline of streets, buildings and churches, and their positions relative to the current shore. In this way, swimming off the shingle beach, you can float over invisible streets and buildings: the further out you go, the further back in history you’ve reached. Once, unaware of the ebb tide that was ripping round the coast, I crunched over the shingle and swam to around 1842, before I realized that I was being pulled rapidly out to sea, and struck out in panic for the present day.",

What an achievement that is. Did you know that to achieve the same density of population in America as in England you would have to uproot the entire populations of Illinois, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Michigan, Colorado, and Texas and pack them all into Iowa? Twenty million people live within a day trip of the Lake District and 12 million, roughly a quarter of England’s population, come to the Lakes each year. No wonder on some summer weekends it can take two hours to get through Ambleside, and that you could almost walk across Windermere by stepping from boat to boat.",

Mrs. Tracy was below, preparing supper, and the house, sometimes so dreary and repellent to him, seemed peaceful and homelike. Laura Lou’s face lit up at his entrance. “Here--I brought you these. They’re good and juicy,” he said, pulling a couple of oranges out of his overcoat pockets. He bent to kiss her, and she pressed her cheek against his. “Oh, they’re beauties, Vanney; but you oughtn’t to have spent all that money.” He sat down beside her, laughed, and said: “I’ve spent a lot more; I’ve paid off what was owing to Hayes.”",

I had been looking forward to the journey for the chance to see a little of Mount Snowdon and its environs, but the rain was soon falling so hard, and the bus windows were so beaded with dirty droplets, that I could see almost nothing—just blurry expanses of skeletal, rust-colored ferns interspersed at intervals with motionless, soaked, seriously discontented looking sheep. Rain pattered against the windows like thrown pebbles and the bus swayed alarmingly under gusts of wind. It was like being on a ship in rough seas. The bus lumbered with grinding reluctance up twisting mountain roads, its wipers flapping wildly, to a plateau in the clouds, and then embarked on a precipitate, seemingly out-of-control descent into Blaenau Ffestiniog through steep defiles covered with numberless slagheaps of broken, rain-shiny slate. This was once the heart of the Welsh slate-mining industry, and the scattered rejects and remnants, which covered virtually every inch of ground, gave the landscape an unearthly and eerie aspect like nothing else I had seen before in Britain. At the epicenter of this unearthliness squatted the village of Blaenau, itself a kind of slate slagheap, or so it seemed in the teeming rain.",

Her face was dreadfully expressionless and her right hand deformed – lacking three fingers and reversed. She wore her alms pouch over that wrist as she walked slowly past us, staring straight ahead, the pouch extended but making no other effort to stimulate generosity. The only reaction to her presence was a twitch of disgust on some faces; she collected not even one coin from the three hundred or so citizens in the Square. I followed her down the Strada Petru Groza to the Orthodox cathedral, where she curled up on the steps and seemed at once to fall asleep like a weary puppy. Beggars do best outside the churches of all denominations, where they gather – both Gypsies and Rumanians – before every service.",

I quickly descended the rock wall, but the opposite side was an arduous climb, and the walking stick proved a hindrance. I hurled it to the top and, clutching at bushes and protruding rocks, struggled my way to the top. There I retrieved my walking stick and went on. Soon, on a fallen tree, I saw a nest holding four brown spotted eggs. They were only a little smaller than chicken eggs and still warm. The mother must have just left the nest. I was thankful to have happened upon nourishing food. I cracked open one of the eggs and was about to pour its contents into my mouth when I noticed the tiny baby curled up inside. Should I eat it or not? No, I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I put the broken egg back in the nest with its brothers and sisters.",

    "target_paragraph": "We stopped at the first hotel we came to, in a broad colonial street reeking of urine; scores of youngsters, some rather hostile and mocking, gathered to watch us unloading on the pavement. I then rushed off to fodder-hunt, leaving Rachel sitting on the hotel doorstep holding Juana. Mercifully I was in time to buy the last four kilos of the evening’s supply of green oats (no Alf here) from a friendly campesino woman who has promised to put eight kilos aside for me tomorrow morning. Juana munched ravenously while the hotel proprietor, an amiable but rather ineffectual character, sent minions to look for a safe corral. Rachel took our gear up a narrow, steep stairs and down a long corridor to our room, which has a carved balcony overlooking the street, a clean single bed, a clean bare wooden floor for me to sleep on, a tiny locker for me to write on, a feeble electric bulb for me to write by (luxury after torchlight!) and even a chair for me to sit on. Pretty good value for forty-five pence. When Rachel rejoined me it was dark and crowds of men had collected to admire Juana and beg me to sell her; the Peruvians are far more interested in our mula than in ourselves! After a cold forty minutes sitting on the pavement under frosty stars we appealed to a passing policeman for corral advice; he shrugged indifferently and walked on. ‘Show him the Prefect’s chit!’ urged Rachel. But at that moment the mestizo draper whose shop is next to the hotel took pity on us and offered to corral Juana in his yard for two nights. We left her tethered beside a mound of withered maize stalks. Then to an eating-house for human fodder and so to bed, Rachel almost asleep on her feet as we crossed the deserted plaza.",
