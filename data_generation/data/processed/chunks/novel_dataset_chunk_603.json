Only the fact that we had three breakdowns in less than a hundred miles saved me: I was able to get out then and recover. The driver told me that there was no bicycle shop before the frontier town of Tieabad so here I am a day ahead of schedule; actually the road was so bad for the last sixty miles that even if Roz hadn’t succumbed I would probably have given up the unequal struggle and hitched a ride over that stretch for both our sakes: the only alternative would have been to walk every yard of the way.",

A part of its imperfect top was blown off, and a piece of its side blown out, and the side rent gave one a frightful view of its interior, with the risk of having lava spat at one at intervals. The name \"Blowing Cone\" is an apt one, if the theory of their construction be correct. It is supposed that when the surface of the lava cools rapidly owing to enfeebled action below, the gases force their way upwards through small vents, which then serve as \"blow holes\" for the imprisoned fluid beneath. This, rapidly cooling as it is ejected, forms a ring on the surface of the crust, which, growing upwards by accretion, forms a chimney, eventually nearly or quite closed at the top, so as to form a cone. In this case the cone is about eighty feet above the present level of the lake, and fully one hundred yards distant from its present verge.",

For the first time in my life, I felt at ease in wild places, and I learned then how much I’d changed.",

Wandering among the graves (many vandalised), I again pondered the value of White intervention in Africa. My misgivings were strengthened in the Bishop’s Palace, a rambling bungalow half-smothered by bougainvillaea and jacaranda. Here a worried white-haired clergyman took up where the Home’s chaplain had left off. He deplored various ill-judged Western projects to help AIDS victims’ families, particularly the funding of orphans’ schooling. This, he said, involved providing fees, books, uniforms and a weekly food allowance. It seems such projects can provoke serious dissension. Many orphans, had their parents been alive, could never have gone to school – so why should they now be given a privileged status? How could schooling compensate for the loss of parents? The system might even make life harder for them if they lost the support of their envious age-group, which they needed more than schooling. Some children, with both parents alive and well, were leaving home – egged on by their families – and presenting themselves elsewhere as ‘orphans’. Would it not make more sense to fund the expansion of refuges like the Toro Babies’ Home? A Ugandan-run institution could be more effective because those in charge were aware of all the cultural nuances. It was hard to disagree with that angry old man.",

There were light skimming noises in the dense undergrowth to either side, the swift bullet-shadows of birds. A garter snake, greener than wet moss, as long as a shoelace and no thicker than a woman’s little finger, shot across the path, its tiny eyes bright with terror, its small forked tongue playing from its mouth like an electric spark. Laura cried out, drawing back in sharp terror; at her cry he snatched up a stone in a wild lust to kill the tiny creature that shot at them, through its coils, the old snake-fear, touching them with beauty, with horror, with something supernatural. But the snake glided away into the undergrowth and, with a feeling of strong shame, he threw the stone away. ‘They won’t hurt you,’ he said.",

And what a wonderful area it is. I wandered past the little cove where my hero, the aviator Charles Kingsford Smith (about whom much more anon), once impossibly took off in an airplane, and into the shaded hills above, through quiet neighborhoods of cottagey homes buried in flowering jacaranda and fragrant frangipani (and in every front garden cobwebs like trampolines, in the center of each the sort of spider that would make a brave man gasp). At every turn there was a glimpsed view of blue harbor—over a garden wall, at the bottom of a sloping road, suspended between close-set houses like a sheet hung to dry—and it was all the finer for being furtive. Sydney has whole districts filled with palatial houses that seem to consist of nothing but balconies and plate glass, with scarcely a leaf to block the beating sun or interrupt the view. But here on the north shore, wisely and nobly, they have sacrificed large-scale vistas for the cool shade of trees, and every resident will, I guarantee, go to heaven.",

In addition, the stick had enabled me to reach a higher section of the S-curved chute, where the angle was more favorable. I discovered that I could move upward, inch by inch, through adhesion and with the help of the leveling tendency of the curve. I gave an extra little push with my big toe – the stones collapsed below, the stick clattered down – and crawled rather like a snail or slug, oozing slime, up over the rounded summit of the slide.",

We were able to cook what food we had left only by hand-holding the pans over the canted burners of the propane stove while cooking. It was a gimbaled stove, but wouldn’t tilt quite as far as the boat was now heeled. The first morning chore following each sleep-deprived night was making coffee and breakfast before the sun started heating up the cabin. By the time we had eaten and cleaned up we were already tired, and the day’s work hadn’t even started. It got hot on the rock pile during the cloudless, windless days that followed in the wake of Andrew’s rampage. The only place where the temperature was bearable was in a hollowed-out cavity that we made between the rocks in the shade of the hull. It was only shaded in the afternoon. That’s when we would pull the cockpit cushions under the hull and lie in the shade like dogs wallowing into the cool dirt under an old front porch in summertime.",

But it would not do altogether, this shouting and damning your eyes, Andrew felt, picking his way down the cliff, this clapping him on the back, and calling him ‘old fellow’ and all that; it would not altogether do. It was the worst of taking women on walks. Once on the beach they separated, he going out on to the Pope’s Nose,* taking his shoes off, and rolling his socks in them and letting that couple look after themselves; Nancy waded out to her own rocks and searched her own pools and let that couple look after themselves. She crouched low down and touched the smooth rubber-like sea anemones, who were stuck like lumps of jelly to the side of the rock. Brooding, she changed the pool into the sea, and made the minnows into sharks and whales, and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by holding her hand against the sun, and so brought darkness and desolation, like God himself, to millions of ignorant and innocent creatures, and then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream down. Out on the pale criss-crossed sand, high-stepping, fringed, gauntletted, stalked some fantastic leviathan (she was still enlarging the pool), and slipped into the vast fissures of the mountainside. And then, letting her eyes slide imperceptibly above the pool and rest on that wavering line of sea and sky, on the tree trunks which the smoke of steamers made waver upon the horizon, she became with all that power sweeping savagely in and inevitably withdrawing, hypnotized, and the two senses of that vastness and this tininess (the pool had diminished again) flowering within it made her feel that she was bound hand and foot and unable to move by the intensity of feelings which reduced her own body, her own life, and the lives of all the people in the world, for ever, to nothingness. So listening to the waves, crouched over the pool, she brooded.",

A stray bitch had made the dark corner where the sacks stood a lying-in ground for her puppies. All these eyes, expanding and narrowing, some adapted to light, others to darkness, looked from different angles and edges. Minute nibblings and rustlings broke the silence.

Plump chairs and sagging sofas were scattered about the rooms and on each of them a young person in intellectual-looking glasses was curled up reading one of the proprietor’s books, evidently from cover to cover (I saw one owlish young man turn down the corner of a page and replace the book on its shelf before scowling at me and departing into the night). It all had an engagingly clubby atmosphere, but how it stays in business I have no idea. Not only was the guy on the till conspicuously underemployed ? only at the most considerable of intervals did he have to stir from his own book to transact a small sale ? but its location, on the banks of the Seine in the very shadow of Notre-Dame, surely must push its rent into the stratosphere.",

Muir’s ability to mix dreaminess with feistiness reminded me a little of Kim. He loved to wander off in the woods and to walk around the house shirtless, strumming Beatles tunes on his guitar, but as president of the Friends of Glacier Bay, he had fought successfully to phase out commercial fishing in the park, much to the annoyance of some neighbors and powerful political foes, such as Senator Frank Murkowski. (Murkowski later became governor and appointed his daughter Lisa to his vacant Senate seat, an unpopular move that helped open the door for a little-known candidate named Sarah Palin to take his new job.) As Alaska’s ecology mutated in unpredictable ways and its economy suffered from the collapse of oil prices, the state’s two senators and its lone congressman, Don Young, had committed to a clear path for the future: to push for new oil drilling in places like ANWR.",

Just as they arrived, a seal emerged in open water but dipped back under the surface before anyone could fire a shot. The Eskimos motioned for them to spread out along the lead and wait. After about thirty minutes the seal resurfaced right in front of McKinlay, who shouldered his rifle and squeezed off a round, the bullet hitting the surface just after the seal slipped back under. After what McKinlay thought was another interminable wait, he and Jenness gave up, unaccustomed to the patience required. The Eskimos spent eight to ten hours at a time kneeling or lying silently on the ice, rifles ready, perpetually scanning the water before them for the telltale blip of a seal coming up for air. Then, moving as little as possible, they’d shoulder their weapon, aim, exhale, and fire in one precise, effortless motion. It was impressive to watch their skill, and they did not miss often.",

Curly’s life in Burma is mired in seediness: whores and whisky bottles are littered around his house, and one evening, when the servant produces a mother and daughter for his pleasure, he throws poker dice with his friend to see who will have which one. (The mother was the one they both wanted, given that her daughter was only twelve years old.) A Christian priest living at a mission in the outpost seems to offer Curly some sense of salvation, encouraging him to change his ways and to better himself through books in the Rangoon library. The notes only hint at the discovery which will shatter Curly’s admiration of the priest. There is gossip about the clergyman’s penchant for boys, a fleeting glimpse of a photograph of a young person in a blue longyi placed on a chest of drawers, and a mention that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the sex of Burmese children as they all wear similar clothes.",

It was, in a sense, the pantheon of the Uzbek nation. Yet it was deserted. Nobody read its faded inscriptions, nor laid flowers. When I questioned passers-by, they knew nothing about it.\nFor the Shaybanids had arrived too late. Their invasion suggested uncomfortably that something other than Uzbekistan had existed here before. So the Russians, and the Uzbeks themselves, mislaid them.",

There is the story of the boot-boy, the story of the man with one eye, the story of the woman who sells winkles. Let him burble on with his story while I lie back and regard the stiff-legged figures of the padded batsmen through the trembling grasses. It seems as if the whole world were flowing and curving—on the earth the trees, in the sky the clouds. I look up, through the trees, into the sky. The match seems to be played up there. Faintly among the soft, white clouds I hear the cry “Run”, I hear the cry “How’s that?” The clouds lose tufts of whiteness as the breeze dishevels them.

At the other end, too, the wet ascends higher and higher, for is not one wading about in long and soaking grass, trying to perform one’s (so to speak) household duties? And if, when the ascending wet and the descending wet meet, and the whole man is a mere and very unhappy sponge, he still can use such words as healthy and jolly, then I say that that man is either a philosopher indeed, worthy of and ripe for an immediate tub, or he is a liar and a hypocrite. I heard both those adjectives often that day, and silently divided their users into the proper categories. For myself I preferred to say nothing, thus producing private flowers of Stoicism in response to the action of the rain.",

I suppose it must be nice, in a place as perennially rainy as Manchester, to be able to shop undercover, and if you are going to have these things at all, much better to have them in the city than outside it. But after 6 P.M. it is just twenty-five acres of deadness, a massive impediment to anyone trying to walk through the heart of the city since the doors are locked at night. I could see through the windows that the inside had been tarted up since the last time I had been there—and very nice it appeared now, too—but outside it was still covered in those awful tiles that make it look like the world’s largest Gents lavatory, and indeed as I passed up Cannon Street three young men with close-cropped heads and abundantly tattooed arms were using an outside wall for that very purpose. They paid me scant heed, but it suddenly occurred to me that it was getting late and the streets were awfully empty of respectable-looking fellows like me, so I decided to get back to my hotel before some other late-night carousers put me to similar use.",
