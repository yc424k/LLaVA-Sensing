China had caused me to question so much about myself and what it meant to be a journalist, a human rights advocate, a citizen of a democracy, and an American that it was frightening me. By that point, I was losing arguments on what I valued most, including the right to an open media. My foremost antagonist in this realm was not Chinese but, interestingly enough, a former Soviet. Sergei was a handsome man who lived in my compound with his wife, Zhenya, and ten-year-old daughter, Masha. They moved to Beijing from Leningrad in the late 1980s because Zhenya (who was half Chinese) got a job teaching Russian at the university next door. I spent many a Sunday afternoon with them, trading an hour’s worth of English tutoring with Masha for conversational practice with Zhenya or heated debates with Sergei. Although he seemed progressive in other ways, he could not fathom the point of a free press.",

I’d left Heather on this trail—locking her away along with all my hurts and insecurities—leaving the wounds to fester and living a life only half-true to myself. Now, I’d found a sense of wholeness.

Our host was a blond, heavy man with bloodshot eyes and a scar across his forehead. He hailed my companions with gallantry; me, much more guardedly. His dinner-jacket made me feel still more of a ragamuffin. (I cared passionately about these things; but the fact of being called Michael Brown – we had to stick to it now – induced a consoling sense of disembodiment.) Perhaps to account for my lowly outfit among these jewelled figures, he introduced me to the women as ‘der englische Globetrotter’, which I didn’t like much. Men guests who were unacquainted toured the room in the German way, shaking hands and reciprocally announcing their names: I did the same. ‘Muller!’ ‘Brown!’ ‘Ströbel!’ ‘Brown!’ ‘Tschudi!’ ‘Brown!’ ‘Röder!’ ‘Brown!’ ‘Altmeier!’ ‘Brown!’ ‘von Schröder!’ ‘Brown!’ … An old man – a professor from Tübingen, I think, with heavy glasses and a beard – was talking to Lise. We wrung each other’s hands, barking ‘Braun!’ and ‘Brown!’ simultaneously. Snap! I avoided the girls’ glance.",

    "target_paragraph": "But what is perhaps the strangest thing about walking through India is that you can come, over time, to love every minute of it, from the funk to the beauty and all the bits in between. You come to love it because, in order to cope, you have to give up on trying to mentally categorize a thousand simultaneous encounters into “good” and “bad” and instead let things be what they are. You stop judging and become an observer, which allows you to begin to see the moment just as it is: horrible and flawed and exquisite all at once. In India, despite your privilege, you are not the center around which everything else orbits. All of your whims and desires aren’t met in the same way as they can be in the West. You get what you’re given. You don’t get to shape or form your surroundings, to push them in the direction you want them to move in, to swap money for granted wishes. You have very little say. You’re merely one of the many irrelevant masses of fleshy guts occupying space among many others, and there are bigger, more important masses than you, like herds of horned buffalo breathing heavily in your direction, like the single shitting cow clogging a highway. So you give in, because there is no choice, which sounds like a bad thing but it’s not, because it’s humbling. And only when you’re humbled can you fall into a state of surrender. Now in flow, your brain is no longer buzzing with the useless narration of “I like this” and “I can’t stand that” or “This should be another way” or “I wish I hadn’t done that.” Instead, you are giving everything around you the permission to be as it is, in all its flaws, because with or without your permission, that is the way it is for now. And it’s only there for you to behold for that single three-second window, before it will move on into the swirling dust storm of atoms and become a new version of itself.",

This boy stood slim and taut in white jodhpurs and tunic, looking rather like a sensuous angel and vibrating with a fierce joy as he drummed faster and faster. Soon everyone was clapping in time to the music and frequently the women ululated; but all my attention was on the girls, whose every muscle was brought into supple, vigorous action – sometimes subtly, as they followed each other in a circular, pacing movement, shuddering with energy and ecstasy – then violently, as they advanced towards an imaginary male partner with undisguised sexuality, or dropped to their haunches and remained so for a few moments, convulsively working their shoulder-muscles. The dancers were glistening with sweat when their performance was interrupted by four little boys, who had been watching the bridegroom’s route from a hilltop and who rushed breathlessly into the tent to announce his approach.",

There were her eyes – they still seemed to her rather bright, in spite of the lines round them – the eyes she had shaded in the railway carriage because Dubbin praised them. But now I’m labelled, she thought – an old maid who washes and watches birds. That’s what they think I am. But I’m not – I’m not in the least like that, she said. She shook her head, and turned away from the glass. It was a nice room; shady, civilized, cool after the bedrooms in foreign inns, with marks on the wall where someone had squashed bugs and men brawling under the window. But where were her glasses? Put away in some drawer? She turned to look for them.",

There was no obvious student housing, no shops, and no cafes like we expected to find near a major university. The only person we passed was a barefoot street vendor. He wore a long, grey djellaba and sat on the ground in the shade of low-hanging tree. His inventory of used textbooks spilled across the sidewalk and lined the curb. Most of the titles were Arabic, though a few were French or English. All of the books were old and their covers faded. The vendor’s stock was little more than a potter’s field for the printed word. We slowed to inspect the display, but nothing caught our eye. I’m not sure whether the hapless merchant even noticed us. He never moved.",

I had intended to walk to the hilltop ruins of Tiberius’s villa, where the old rascal used to have guests who displeased him hurled over the ramparts onto the rocks hundreds of feet below, but when I emerged from the hotel a cold, slicing rain was falling, and I spent the morning wandering from cafe to cafe, drinking cappuccinos and scanning the sky. Late in the morning, out of time to see the villa unless I stayed another day, which I could scarce afford to do, I checked reluctantly out of the Hotel Capri and walked down the steep and slippery steps to the quay where I purchased a ticket on a slow ferry to Naples.",

After night fell, the water became rich with phosphorescence, and the air was filled with a high discordant music, made of many different notes: the siren song of dolphins. The drifting pair also saw that they were at the centre of two rough circles of phosphorescence, one turning within the other. The inner circle of light, they realised, was a ring of dolphins, swimming round the upturned boat, and the outer circle was a ring of sharks, swimming round the dolphins. The dolphins were protecting the father and his son, keeping the sharks from them.",

    "target_paragraph": "He crossed low terrain at first. His mother rode with him. His father hovered in the air. Then he changed passengers, taking on a friend named Gary Powers, and they began to move up Woodchopper Creek. His altitude at the start was nine hundred feet. The highest point on the trip was well above four thousand. They travelled five days, fourteen hours a day. There was plenty of wind. The highest temperature they experienced was zero. They stopped to cut their way through trees with a chain saw (fearing to doze them because the wanigan might be crushed). The Cat fell twice through rotting ice. With no difficulty, it climbed out of the water. There was some luck in the conditions, but not much. With less ice in Woodchopper Canyon, Stanley might have been stopped. But successive overflows on the creek had built the ice thickness in places to thirty feet. Nearing the head of Woodchopper, he moved the Cat slowly up a steep slope of ice, slid back, crept again, slid back, and thought for a while he wouldn’t make it. Without the grousers, the big rig would have been stopped, but they held just enough, and gradually he crawled out of the head of the creek—only to move into snow so deep the D9’s steel tracks spun out. Stanley thought it wise to stop for the night. For one thing, all this was happening in a blizzard. Next day, the sky was clear, the air colder, and Stanley moved on a contour through the deep snow until he found an uphill route. Steadily, he climbed ridges, sometimes in little snow, sometimes in seven-foot drifts. At one point, the going was so steep that he disengaged the sled and tried first to clear a trail. “I knew that ridge was too steep to go over, because it was almost vertical. So I went around to the right. Without them ice grousers, the machine would have slid sideways and straight to the bottom as if it was on skates. Gary was scared to death. I went real slow now, and slipped some, and then went down to a dead crawl. I had it idled as low as it would go. I went on a half a mile or so. When I saw it was possible, I went back for the sled.”",

By early afternoon we were down to stream-level and in boggy trouble: Juana hates bogs. We could only solve the problem by walking in the stream for a mile or so, thus avoiding the unpredictable marshy patches on both banks. (How will my boots react to that?) Beyond this hazard, non-puna vegetation rioted in the gorge on our left. Here were meticulously built Inca stairs, and walls of smooth slippery wet rock down which poor Juana slid miserably but without protest. By now she seems to have accepted that life with the Murphys is a Fate Worse Than Death about which nothing can be done. It frustrates us that she spurns sugar, which is relatively plentiful; we can reward her more heroic endeavours only with cuddles and sweet words.",

    "target_paragraph": "Blueberry pickers in the Pine Barrens are almost all brought in from outside, but they are not migrant workers. They come mainly from Philadelphia, in privately owned school buses that bear the words “Farm Labor Transport.” For the most part, the buses are driven by the men who own them, and the drivers, like their passengers, come from the city. The drivers are mainly Negroes, and so are the passengers. The drivers read newspapers and magazines all day and get three cents a pint on the berries their passengers pick. It is up to the drivers to find the pickers, and they start cruising Philadelphia streets before dawn, offering a day’s work to anyone they can find, sometimes picking up men who are so drunk that they have no idea what they are getting into and who sober up in the blazing sun of the Pine Barrens wondering how they got there. Busloads vary every day. About a third of the people are steady sober pickers who make daily trips in the same bus. There are always some who do almost no work and are simply taking advantage of a chance to have a day in the country. There is usually a high percentage of schoolchildren, some of whom appear to be too young to have working papers, but at least they seem to enjoy themselves and to be there by choice. Women in their eighties ride the farm-labor transports, too. So, occasionally, do prostitutes, who go with their customers out of the blueberry clearings into the woods. Some pickers spend more in this manner than they earn during the rest of the day. Some become so drunk in the fields that they fall down in the hot sand between the blueberry bushes and pass out. “We got everything from hoochy-coochy girls on up today,” Charlie told me. Pickers are paid seven cents a pint. Picking begins when the dew dries on the bushes—and is not done on rainy days—because the blue of a blueberry is a protective wax, and it comes off on the hands if the berries are wet. Some of the wax comes off anyway, and pickers’ hands are always blue. A real star can earn eighteen dollars in a day, but most pickers make about ten dollars, and those who do not pick steadily make less than that. Bus drivers clear from twenty-five to fifty dollars a day. Sometimes pickers of any sort are so scarce that growers have to compete for the favor of the drivers, and on days like that the drivers have been paid as much as ninety dollars. When the pickers get into the buses and start the ride back to Philadelphia, the drivers sell them wine. On arrival in the city, some people are drunk and have spent their day’s pay in the buses. (This sorry scene is not repeated during the cranberry harvest in the fall, when the bogs are flooded an inch or so over the vines, and the cranberries, which float, are batted free by motorized water rakes until they form a great scarlet berry boom—hundreds of thousands of cranberries bobbing and drifting with the wind or on a slow drainage current to a corner of the bog, where they are hauled in.)",

In truth, by now I had memorized the lesson so well that the very names of the places I had yet to visit communicated a sharp visual image of them. I could see the lemon-groves of Lapithos and feel the dense cool air of its orchards: hear the sullen thunder of the headspring as it gushed into the valley from the mountain’s summit. The great double-combed crown of Hilarion stood almost directly behind us with its castle taking the last lion-gold rays of the evening upon its tawny flanks. Over the saddle below it ran the main road to Nicosia, piercing the range at its lowest point. East of us loomed other peaks whose sulky magnificence echoed each other, min­gling like the notes of a musical chord: Buffavento, seat of the winds, with the silent and graceful Gothic abbey of Bellapaix below it in the foothills; Pendedactyl whose five-fingered peak recalled the fingerprints of the hero Dighenis; fading all of them, and inclining slowly eastward into the mist like the proud sails of some Venetian argosy, to where Cape Andreas drowsed in spindrift at the end of the long stone handle of the Karpass. The place names chimed as one spoke them like a carillon, Greek Babylas and Myrtou, Turkish Kasaphani, Crusader Templos … The mixture was a heady one.",

With a grizzly, you should make for a tall tree, since grizzlies aren’t much for climbing. If a tree is not available, then you should back off slowly, avoiding direct eye contact. All the books tell you that if the grizzly comes for you, on no account should you run. This is the sort of advice you get from someone who is sitting at a keyboard when he gives it. Take it from me, if you are in an open space with no weapons and a grizzly comes for you, run. You may as well. If nothing else, it will give you something to do with the last seven seconds of your life. However, when the grizzly overtakes you, as it most assuredly will, you should fall to the ground and play dead. A grizzly may chew on a limp form for a minute or two but generally will lose interest and shuffle off. With black bears, however, playing dead is futile, since they will continue chewing on you until you are considerably past caring. It is also foolish to climb a tree because black bears are adroit climbers and, as Herrero dryly notes, you will simply end up fighting the bear in a tree.",
