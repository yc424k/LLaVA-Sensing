The man’s name was Raymond Orteig. He was from France originally but was now a successful hotelier in New York. Inspired by the exploits of World War I aviators, Orteig offered a prize of $25,000 to the first person or persons who could fly nonstop from New York to Paris, or vice versa, in the next five years. It was a generous offer but an entirely safe one since it was patently beyond the scope of any airplane to cover such a span in a single flight. As Alcock and Brown had painfully proved, just flying half that distance was at the very bounds of technology and good fortune.",

I went around from stay to shroud and tightened just enough to keep the mast straight. Then with the wire tension gauge I repeated the steps until I was getting the proper reading on each wire. That was it. The rig was statically tuned. Dyform wire is an architectural wire that doesn’t need re-tensioning. This was as far as I could take Quest on dry land. The most important step in tuning the rig would be to bring Quest out on the water, heel her over and dynamically tune the shrouds when there was maximum pressure on the wire. But first things first, I would have to get Quest onto the water.",

To pocket her pride and search for the first husband seemed, wisely or not, the best initiatory step. He had possibly drunk himself into his tomb. But he might, on the other hand, have had too much sense to do so; for in her time with him he had been given to bouts only, and was not a habitual drunkard.",

But at the other end of the house, the end of the Signori Inglesi, old Giorgio, at the door with one of his girls on each side, bared his bushy head, as white as the snows of Higuerota. Mrs. Gould stopped the carriage. She seldom failed to speak to her protégé; moreover, the excitement, the heat, and the dust had made her thirsty. She asked for a glass of water. Giorgio sent the children indoors for it, and approached with pleasure expressed in his whole rugged countenance. It was not often that he had occasion to see his benefactress, who was also an Englishwoman—another title to his regard. He offered some excuses for his wife. It was a bad day with her; her oppressions—he tapped his own broad chest. She could not move from her chair that day.",

It took every grain of iron in my blood to steel myself, but I did after about five minutes.

So Tashi, born in a Tibetan nomad’s tent in the heart of Nepal, now had the run of a Boeing 707.",

Somebody slammed the doors shut and dropped the bar into place. The violence surged to full power much faster this time, but there was something different about it, a change in tenor that was hard to define. It was the wind’s direction; it was coming from the south now, and that somehow gave it an entirely different character. The air in the big open room filled with a fine mist, almost a fog. It tasted salty. It took a moment for the implications of this to register, but then I realized that the wind had to be picking up salt water from the shallow banks outside the harbor, two hundred feet below the schoolhouse and a quarter of a mile away. Unbelievable. It just didn’t seem possible that a heavy salt spray could be driven so far uphill and so far from the sea, and how was so much of it getting into the room anyway? People started backing away from the south wall; the crowd parted around a window and we could see that one of the shutters had a space at the bottom. It was less than an inch wide, but the salt spray blasted through it with the force of a pressure washer. Someone came up with a plastic tablecloth and two Bahamian men tried to stuff it into the crack, but it kept blowing out before it could be wedged in far enough to stay. We would just have to endure the salt spray.",

    "target_paragraph": "His own jobs were chiefly of a Jesse James variety, or something between Al Capone and Robin Hood, leaving out the modern-political complications. The steady work was made up of highway holdups, kidnappings, blackmail; on one occasion the band blew up a truckful of carabinieri, killing seven and maiming more; in the end some eighty carabinieri had been killed, plus an undetermined number of plain citizens. A fairly typical episode was the attempted kidnapping of a Palermo businessman named Antonino, in September 1946. He and his wife were being driven to their country house by a chauffeur, in the evening, when they were stopped by a taxi parked in the middle of the road; a group of men jumped out and tried to pull Mr. Antonino into the taxi, but being a strong man and evidently rather high-strung he struggled with them and so got filled with bullets instead. His wife was also shot, but not fatally; the chauffeur had fainted in the car. This assault was a failure; so was another on a jewelry shop in Palermo, in which the owner resisted and for some reason was not even shot. But the failures were few. Other incidents were more romantic: stripping the duchess politely of her jewels and later returning the volume of Steinbeck (his favorite author) that he had taken from her table, with a note: “I don’t see why anyone as reactionary as you should have such a book, so I thought of not returning it, but when Giuliano gives his word he always keeps it.”",

    "target_paragraph": "CHAPTER XXXVIII\nIndia, 2011\nTHAT EVENING I speak to the manager about how cold it is in my tent and that it doesn’t really have hot water. He looks perplexed. “I’m a little sick,” I tell him. I ask if perhaps I couldn’t have an actual room. Given that I am the only guest, it isn’t that hard for him to make an adjustment. There is a bungalow available. It is made of concrete, and he promises me it has hot water. Right after supper, where the waiter still stands beside me, water pitcher in hand, I move into the cottage, which is a bit more expensive, but at least it has walls and isn’t open to the elements and the air. And I’m assured there is hot water. I’m a little embarrassed for making a fuss. My mother almost always changed hotel rooms and tables in restaurants.\nMy bungalow is tucked down a stone path at the edge of the woods. I like it right away. The worker who takes me there turns on the hot water to prove that it has hot water. He leaves the water running as he shows me the room—which in fact needs no explanation.\nBut we discover a large grasshopper sitting on my bed. It is bright green and the size of an ashtray. I am afraid he will kill it, but instead he gets a plastic cup from the bathroom, where the water is still running. Carefully the young man captures the grasshopper, and then cradles it in his hands. He steps out onto the patio to let it go, and the grasshopper hops away. Then the young man turns off the shower, content that I have hot water, and is gone.\nI unpack, put my things into drawers, into the bathroom. I am thrilled to take my first hot shower since arriving in India. I turn it on and wait, but the water is ice-cold. I wait and wait, but there is still no hot water. The man was so anxious to prove to me that there was hot water, I reason, that he depleted my supply. I rinse off, deciding to postpone my shower until the next day. I lie down and immediately drift off. On the wall above my head is a painting. Shiva is playing a flute and the sacred cows are dancing.",
