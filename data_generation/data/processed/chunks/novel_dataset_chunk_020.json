The manufacturers of mountain-bikes would have us believe that these can be pedalled across any sort of surface. Not so. Even an aristocratic Dawes Ascent is quite often defeated by African roads. Normally I enjoy walking as much as cycling but ‘walking’ hardly describes the pushing of a laden Lear up near-vertical hills through slithery mud or skiddy deep gravel, or dragging him over rocky outcrops and four-foot-deep erosion channels. (Luckily the local mud was not adhesive, as in Kenya.) These gradients were incomparable; on mountains that in more effete countries would be furnished with several hairpin bends the track went straight up and down. Freewheeling on such slopes and surfaces was impossible and on arrival in Kyenjojo the brake-muscles in my thighs were throbbing. Traffic, however, was not a problem. On Day One I met two vehicles, on Day Two three. All were overladen truck-buses travelling at about twelve miles an hour. Astonished excitement caused the passengers around the edges almost to fall off when they saw me.",

She was of medium height, her head rather small, and her face I can only describe as heart-shaped: it was wide at the temples and tapered to a delicate pointed chin. She had fine, silky, wavy hair, bound with a chaplet of leaves made of beaten gold, the chaplet tied at the back with a red-purple ribbon. Neither face nor figure was of the classic type, as we conceive it. The face was beautiful in its own way and touched a chord within me that answered with all the warmth of my nature.",

The door was either built for people much smaller than I or, my suspicions, so that admission was for single entrance and in a position too awkward to hold a spear or axe. I figure if the experts can’t come up with a definitive interpretation, I am allowed to speculate as well. The ground floor is dirt and would have been a good place for communal goings on around a fire. I don’t think this broch had a roof but some believe they did. What we all agree on is that this broch is a marvel of engineering. The rocks are drystone, meaning no mortar. They were carefully placed and balanced to construct this building which today stands ten metres high, five thousand years later. The broch was most likely higher before the stones were appropriated for local construction, including the Bernera Barracks. The two concentric walls with massive stones provide platforms, upper level floors, and wall separation. How did they get these stones to this site and in place? It is easy to see people conducting daily chores downstairs and sleeping upstairs, living here safe and sound. It takes no imagination at all.",

Few hotel guests use the television room at this time; however, various grizzled safari guides hang out there between jobs. This shared space led to some interesting conversations. An aging American professor who hangs around in the television room piqued the interest of these hardened African safari guides. They wanted to know why I was in Africa, what I was doing here, and what my life in America was like. In a similar vein, a bush-wise safari guide was of special interest to an aging American professor. Specifically, I wanted to learn more about Africa and the African bush and realized that these guides held the nuggets of information for which I was searching. All in all, it was a match made in bush heaven.",

In summer, the border guards would fire salvoes, the Wee One would open his accordion, yesterday’s killers would offer me home brews, and the mothers would cackle with missing teeth. In autumn, I’d watch the falcons hang in the rain like omens. A creaky door would open into the old house with an iron-frame bed, blackened pots left behind by the Greeks, abandoned photographs of children, faded faces from some unmournable past that lives under the skin. As if the border itself was the collective skin. As if, by staying in the Village in the Valley for ever, I’d be reunited with something. All the roads and crossroads of my adulthood, all the arrivals and departures, all the cities and faces vanished when I was in the Village in the Valley, like mist over the hills. All I had to do was drink from the River Lethe. What is more atavistically pleasing than the end of the road?",

Still, we never ate very much and the deficit became even graver when we were told that evening there had been a landslide further ahead and we couldn’t pass; we would have to spend the night in a little village called Anco. Early the next day we set off again, mounted on our truck, but only a little way up the road we reached the landslide and had to spend the day there, starving and curious, observing the workers set explosives to the huge boulders that had fallen on the road. For every laborer, there were no less than five bossy supervisors, shouting out their opinions and hindering the work of the dynamiters, who were not exactly model workers themselves. We tried to fool our hunger by going down to swim in the torrential river running through the gully below, but the water was too icy to stay in for long and neither of us is particularly resistant to the cold, as I’ve said before. In the end, after one of our stock stories of woe, one of the men gave us some corn cobs and another a cow’s heart and some offal.",

His own skill set was taking a careful, step-by-step approach to solving problems—an orientation that, along with a considerable dollop of patience, had enabled him to oversee the construction of a five-story multifamily apartment building, as well as to wait in line to buy chicken and cooking oil and other groceries for his family. He left it to Cary to draw the blueprints for their life together. He bicycled to his job at the Cojímar recreation complex because Cary did not think it was right to use her state car and driver to get him there.",

In my preoccupation with the frescoes I had forgotten to look down into the gulf. The lower world was hidden beneath a snowy mass of cloud that rose in a solid waste to the edge of the parapet. Only the monasteries emerged like outposts in a Polar wilderness, as if one could cross the half-mile to the Transfiguration on snow-shoes. The bridge, the tiles and the rotunda of St Barbara were just visible. The rest was snowed under. St Stephen and Holy Trinity rode high on the pale billows, and a bell sounded over the intervening distance like the signal of an ice-bound ship in distress. Towering high above this white desert, the giant blue monolith next to St Barlaam was hooped with three perfect smoke-rings of cloud.",

I thought how his bizarre love for an old woman had taken him from the doors of the Grenada cinema, where he used to stand so proudly in his uniform, to die on the wet grass near the Paraguay river, but I knew that if this was the price he had to pay, he would have paid it gladly. He was a romantic, and in the only form of poetry he knew, the poetry which he had learnt at St George’s Cathedral, Freetown, he would have found the right words to express his love and his death.

These stone chortens, usually built in the middle of paths, are symbols of Nirvana; when walking around them Buddhists always keep them on their right and it is one of the signs of a Bön-po that he keeps them on his left. This was a very old chorten, with grass and weeds flourishing in the crevices between the stones; one could almost have passed by without noticing it, yet its very inconspicuousness seemed to symbolise most fittingly the often imperfectly understood but ever present Buddhist influence that guides all Tibetan peoples.",

Donald said that they were in Maeva Beach and that the moorings in the harbor were for much larger commercial ships. Donald also mentioned that the run within the lagoon was no problem but that he needed to be mindful of the traffic light at the southwestern end of the airport runway. He was a bit confused. A traffic light at the end of the runway? Donald explained that the lagoon channel took them right past the end of the runway and that the traffic light was there to stop sailboats with tall masts from passing across the flight path when a plane was taking off or landing. If the light was red, the boat had to wait.",

    "target_paragraph": "This afternoon our track climbed gradually across uninhabited heathland – rough, brown, rock-strewn and flecked with green patches of bog. When an icy wind brought driving rain and hail from the sharp, high mountains to the east poor Juana was shocked and dismayed; probably she has never before experienced the like. An hour later the force of the gale ripped Rachel’s cape at the neck but happily the rain/hail/sleet eased off soon after. We were climbing ever higher. Now occasional hovels crouched on the bleak moorland, far back from the track, and in fenced-off areas sheep, cattle and horses were huddled together with their backs to the wind. ‘Juana must envy them,’ commented Rachel, who had had some difficulty keeping her steed facing into the gale. At 4.30 we found this sheltered stretch of level, slightly boggy ground between a long, high, smooth-topped ridge and a much higher, jagged mountain. Short green grass grows between tall clumps of coarse brown ichu grass – which last, perversely, Juana seems to prefer. In the soft bogginess it was difficult to find a reliable spot for the picket. The clouds spat warnings at us as we got the tent up but we were safely tucked away in dry clothes, eating buns and sardines, when the next deluge came. How to dry my sodden bush-shirt and jeans is tomorrow’s problem. I’ve no idea where we are this evening but the setting sun confirmed that we’re moving south, which is the general idea.",

Compensation is our panorama of the tile rooftops and into the countryside. The belle époque café in the center of town doesn’t appear to have changed an iota since 1870—marble tables, red velvet banquettes, gold mirrors. The waitress polishing the bar has cupid-bow lips and a starchy white blouse with ribbons on the sleeves.

For, as Monk was beginning to find out, though men live in a billion different worlds of mind and thought and time, the world of feeling that they live in is very much the same. The dullest slug of brutish earth whose battered flesh and stunned, abortive brain was ever hurtled through the foul and fetid darkness of the tunnel’s depths to Brooklyn could comprehend no more of Einstein or of Shakespeare than a dog prowling through a library could know about his master’s books.

That evening had been the particular one of the week upon which Grace and herself had been accustomed to privately deposit flowers on Giles’s grave, and this was the first occasion since his death eight months earlier on which Grace had failed to keep her appointment. Marty had waited in the road just outside Melbury’s, where her fellow pilgrim had been wont to join her, till she was weary; and at last, thinking that Grace had missed her and gone on alone, she followed the way to the church, but saw no Grace in front of her. It got later, and Marty continued her walk till she reached the churchyard gate; but still no Grace. Yet her sense of comradeship would not allow her to go on to the grave alone, and, still thinking the delay had been unavoidable she stood there with her little basket of flowers in her clasped hands, and her feet chilled by the damp ground, till more than two hours had passed. She then heard the footsteps of Melbury’s men, who presently passed on their return from the search. In the silence of the night Marty could not help hearing fragments of their conversation, from which she acquired a general idea of what had occurred, and that Mrs. Fitzpiers was by that time in the arms of another man than Giles.",

    "target_paragraph": "MANY CUBANS WHO HAD SUFFERED far less personal tragedy than Jorge also turned away from the Catholic Church. During the long years when attending mass was suspect, many Cubans who had been baptized Catholics drifted off into Santería, or abandoned religion altogether, focusing on the next day’s meals rather than the next life. The churches themselves, some of them ancient, were beaten down by Cuba’s humidity and rain, and with no funds for maintenance and repair, and rapidly shrinking congregations, they fell into ruin. The big churches fared worse than newer chapels like La Milagrosa. The masonry walls of Los Escolapios church grew splotchy with black mold, and its entrance was often draped with dead chickens and putrid fruit left as sacrifices to the Santería gods. After the roof over the rear vestibule collapsed, covering the statue of Christ with plaster and dust, believers like María del Carmen’s sad friend, Caridad Guerra, who’d lost her family on the 13 de Marzo, were terrified when they went in to pray, fearing that the whole ceiling could come down on them.",

To refute the solipsist or the metaphysical idealist all that you have to do is take him out and throw a rock at his head: if he ducks he’s a liar.

Up at dawn, we did four loads of laundry at the yacht club and then taxied to Supermercado Rey where we bought three rotisserie chickens, several vats of potato salad, cole slaw and baked beans along with dozens of cans and bottles of soft drinks and water. Back at the yacht club dock where we’d tied up to make the final preparations we iced down the drinks, cleared the decks of unnecessary gear, flaked the rented warps on deck and secured the makeshift tire-fenders to cleats and lifelines. We tied thick towels over the glass of our solar panels to protect them from the lead-filled monkey’s fists of the heaving lines and tied off the wind generator to keep the lines from tangling in its spinning blades. At 1600 our single professional Panamanian line handler, Naldo, stepped aboard and we released the dock lines and motored out to the Flats to await the arrival of the canal advisor. We rafted up to Irene. Our good friends Tapio and Eeva were going to be additional line handlers for our transit. Regulations required us to have at least four line handlers plus a helmsman. The first mate can double as a line handler so Cheryl made four.",

    "target_paragraph": "SO much depends then, thought Lily Briscoe, looking at the sea which had scarcely a stain on it, which was so soft that the sails and the clouds seemed set in its blue, so much depends, she thought, upon distance: whether people are near us or far from us; for her feeling for Mr Ramsay changed as he sailed further and further across the bay. It seemed to be elongated, stretched out; he seemed to become more and more remote. He and his children seemed to be swallowed up in that blue, that distance; but here, on the lawn, close at hand, Mr Carmichael suddenly grunted. She laughed. He clawed his book up from the grass. He settled into his chair again puffing and blowing like some sea monster. That was different altogether, because he was so near. And now again all was quiet. They must be out of bed by this time, she supposed, looking at the house, but nothing appeared there. But then, she remembered, they had always made off directly a meal was over, on business of their own. It was all in keeping with this silence, this emptiness, and the unreality of the early morning hour. It was a way things had sometimes, she thought, lingering for a moment and looking at the long glittering windows and the plume of blue smoke: they became unreal. So coming back from a journey, or after an illness, before habits had spun themselves across the surface, one felt that same unreality, which was so startling; felt something emerge. Life was most vivid then. One could be at one’s ease. Mercifully one need not say, very briskly, crossing the lawn to greet old Mrs Beckwith, who would be coming out to find a corner to sit in, ‘Oh good-morning, Mrs Beckwith! What a lovely day! Are you going to be so bold as to sit in the sun? Jasper’s hidden the chairs. Do let me find you one!’ and all the rest of the usual chatter. One need not speak at all. One glided, one shook one’s sails (there was a good deal of movement in the bay, boats were starting off) between things, beyond things. Empty it was not, but full to the brim. She seemed to be standing up to the lips in some substance, to move and float and sink in it, yes, for these waters were unfathomably deep. Into them had spilled so many lives. The Ramsays’; the children’s; and all sorts of waifs and strays of things besides. A washerwoman with her basket; a rook; a red-hot poker; the purples and grey-greens of flowers; some common feeling which held the whole together.",

With the exception of a 1956 Chevrolet carcass rotting on a curb, there wasn’t a car in sight, enabling us to walk directly in the street instead of just along it. The residential area quickly gave way to a commercial strip where a bakery featured bread loaves as long and wide as the pickets of a fence, and a pharmacy sold medicine bottles with handwritten wrappers glued upon them. A dark, musty warehouse served as a melancholic farmer’s market, where vendors sat listlessly behind bins of scrawny yuccas, plantains, guavas, and chilies and a butcher sold ham by the slice. Across the street, a long-lashed woman in a window cried out, “Cerrrr-veeeee-zaaaa!” until a customer stopped by. She whipped out a glass, poured him some beer, and plunked it on the sill; he chugged it down, wiped his lip, slipped her some pesos, and continued down the street as she washed the glass, wiped it dry, and resumed her barter cry: “Cerrrr-veeeee-zaaaa!” Another vendor—a gorgeous old man in a beret—had scrawled his croquette menu on a piece of cardboard with a Nike decal stuck on it. When I pointed at the brazen capitalist symbol, he grinned good-naturedly and said: “Es bonito.” It ’s pretty.",

Beyond deep invisible valleys white swathes of wild pear blossom draped some slopes and new-leaved beeches glowed in the noon sun – pale green fires amidst the dark surrounding pines. Buzzards glided in wide circles, jays and woodpeckers were noisy and busy. The remains of a few ancient wayside stone fountains – still providing sweet spring water – indicated that in former times this was a commonly-used route. Now the roughness of the track necessitated my walking down as well as up.",

The ‘plush-coloured mountains approached by lemon-coloured foothills’ were now obscured by the decaying skyscrapers, windows boarded up with black eye-patches. The ‘bronze statue of Marjoribanks in a cloak’ must have come down with the Revolution, and disappeared along with the ‘drinkable white wine and disgusting beer’.

Bartlett waved to the others, who tromped around in the cold and waved back, shouting encouragement. As they walked away from Shore Camp, Bartlett slung one arm around McKinlay like a schoolmate and told him to help Munro as much as he could. He was going to need every assistance. They crunched along in the new snow without speaking for a time. After about a half mile, Bartlett stopped and turned and looked McKinlay directly in the eyes. He clapped him hard on the shoulders in his usual way. He said he wished he could put McKinlay in charge overall, but as a scientist with no official position in the ship’s company, it wouldn’t do. “It would be resented by officers and crew,” Bartlett said. But he made it known that McKinlay was his first choice.",

But Kyoto is not just Zen and tea; it was also the center of the culture that grew from the fine-grained sensibility of the kuge. When the capital was moved to Tokyo in 1868, many of the kuge moved north with the Emperor. Their village around the Imperial Palace was razed, leaving the large open spaces you see today surrounding the palace. As a result, almost nothing tangible remains of kuge history, and their culture never became a tourist attraction; there is very little written about their world, so most people are hardly aware that it ever existed. Nevertheless, their romantically delicate sensibility survives in waka poetry, incense ceremony, geisha dance and Shinto ritual. But if I had not purchased a few 5000-yen shikishi on a whim, I would never have discovered it.",

When Orlando had done telling her that she was a fox, an olive tree, or a green hill-top, and had given her the whole history of his family; how their house was one of the most ancient in Britain; how they had come from Rome with the Caesars and had the right to walk down the Corso (which is the chief street in Rome) under a tasselled palanquin,* which he said is a privilege reserved only for those of imperial blood (for there was an orgulous* credulity about him which was pleasant enough), he would pause and ask her, Where was her own house? What was her father? Had she brothers? Why was she here alone with her uncle? Then, somehow, though she answered readily enough, an awkwardness would come between them. He suspected at first that her rank was not as high as she would like; or that she was ashamed of the savage ways of her people, for he had heard that the women in Muscovy wear beards and the men are covered with fur from the waist down; that both sexes are smeared with tallow to keep the cold out, tear meat with their fingers and live in huts where an English noble would scruple to keep his cattle; so that he forbore to press her. But on reflection, he concluded that her silence could not be for that reason; she herself was entirely free from hair on the chin; she dressed in velvet and pearls, and her manners were certainly not those of a woman bred in a cattle-shed.",
