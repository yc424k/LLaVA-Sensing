Then his first son, James, fled, quitted the cabin he had been born in, the plantation, Mississippi itself, by night and with nothing save the clothes he walked in. When Isaac McCaslin heard about it in town he drew a third of the money, the legacy, with its accumulated interest, in cash and departed also and was gone a week and returned and put the money back into the bank. Then the daughter, Fonsiba, married and moved to Arkansas. This time Isaac went with them and transferred a third of the legacy to a local Arkansas bank and arranged for Fonsiba to draw three dollars of it each week, no more and no less, and returned home. Then one morning Isaac was at home, looking at a newspaper, not reading it, looking at it, when he realised what it was and why. It was the date. It’s somebody’s birthday, he thought. He said aloud, “It’s Lucas’s. He’s twenty-one today,” as his wife entered. She was a young woman then; they had been married only a few years but he had already come to know the expression which her face wore, looking at it always as he did now: peacefully and with pity for her and regret too, for her, for both of them, knowing the tense bitter indomitable voice as well as he did the expression:",

Then the British did the job for them, burning eight amakhanda on the plain of Mahlabathini, including Ondini, the royal homestead, which smouldered for four days. On 28 August Cetshwayo was captured and eventually imprisoned in Cape Town’s Castle. Sir Garnet Wolseley’s ‘pacification’ of Zululand was complete and on 1 September the chiefs formally accepted his settlement. It abolished the independent kingdom, reducing it to thirteen fragments whose chiefs would in future be nominated by the British. Subsequently, the relentless exploitation of Natalian farmworkers gave rise to various embryonic political movements, some with militant tendencies. But most chiefs remained loyal to the whites.",

But I was given no time to sit. Two Hmong soldiers hastened towards me, astonished and wary. Armed with rifles, revolvers and knives, they asked challenging questions – the challenge vaulted the language barrier. However, they were extremely polite, though when I signed my intention to walk on into the mountains it was made very plain that the falang must at once return to Vang Vieng; even had I spoken Lao, this would not have been a matter for negotiation. Then another young man appeared, this one Lao Lum, unarmed and wearing civvies and an ID badge – a local official, equally polite but equally emphatic that I must immediately turn back. Had I been foolish enough to defy this trio, they would certainly have arrested me. Yet I bore them no grudge; they were only obeying orders.",

I stepped around the barrier and walked down old Highway 61. Clumps of weedy grass poked through the surface here and there, but it still looked like a serviceable road. All around on both sides for a considerable distance the land smoked broodingly, like the aftermath of a forest fire. About fifty yards along, a jagged crack appeared down the center of the highway and quickly grew into a severe gash several inches across, emitting still more smoke. In places, the road on one side of the gash had subsided a foot or more, or slumped into a shallow, bowl-shaped depression. From time to time I peered into the crack but couldn’t gauge anything of its depth for the swirling smoke, which proved to be disagreeably acrid and sulphurous when the breeze pushed it over me.",

One heard the waves breaking and flapping against the side of the boat as if they were anchored in harbour. Everything became very close to one. For the sail, upon which James had his eyes fixed until it had become to him like a person whom he knew, sagged entirely; there they came to a stop, flapping about waiting for a breeze, in the hot sun, miles from shore, miles from the Lighthouse. Everything in the whole world seemed to stand still. The Lighthouse became immovable, and the line of the distant shore became fixed. The sun grew hotter and everybody seemed to come very close together and to feel each other’s presence, which they had almost forgotten. Macalister’s fishing-line went plumb down into the sea. But Mr Ramsay went on reading with his legs curled under him.",

To every side of us the mountain fell away. It felt as though we were balanced on the pinnacle of the Eiffel Tower. The clouds had cleared and a glossy white light had replaced the murk of the early morning. I spotted the yellow dot of our tent thousands of feet below. Seen from this height, the glacier which we had crossed the previous day to reach the base of the ridge resolved itself into a pattern of shallow pale billows. I could see dozens of tiny meltwater lakes which had formed in the hollows between the billows, winking at me like shields in the sun. Their blueness was startling. To our west, the light of the rising sun poured down the mountain faces of the Mischabel range. The wind was fierce, drumming against the skin of my cheeks until it was numb, and pushing coldly through the gaps in my clothing.",

Partway up its pathless north face, a heron launched itself from high rocks above me - a foldaway construction of struts and canvas, snapping and locking itself into position just in time to keep air-bound - before beating seawards on its curved wings, away towards Rosroe. Around noon, I reached the summit: a rough broken tableland of flat rocks, perhaps a quarter of an acre in area, and planed smooth by the old ice. There was a single small cairn, and on its top sat a horned sheep’s skull. I picked up the skull, and as I did so water streamed from its ragged nose-holes in sudden liquid tusks, and ran on to my hand and up my sleeve. I put it back on the cairn top, having turned it so that it faced eastwards and inland, looking over miles of empty land glinting with lakes, on which thousands of wild geese over-wintered each year. The sun came out, breaking fitfully through the clouds and warming my hands and face. Seawards, I looked across the intricate tasselwork of inlet and peninsula. Close at hand, sheets of mica scattered the sunshine, so that even the dry rocks shone in the light. I found a rough pyramid of quartz, and took it for my storm-beach.",

The Mission Bunkhouse, by the way, was a mariner’s mission. It has broadened its audience so that it welcomes travellers, like me, as well as people who look like drug addicts. That is, they look like drug addicts to me. Since I am sharing the communal bathroom with them, I get to decide my comfort level, describing them as I see fit. Families also live here. This upsets me because I am confronted, once again, with my personal prejudices about how people should live. The backstory is often that they have moved from a country where they had NO economic hope and that living here with me and my toxic shoes is an improvement. It took tremendous courage and determination to move here. Their kids will have a different life. Everyone is pleasant and welcoming, all on journeys like me.

It turned out to be dust sweeping in from the desert through the open windows. I glanced out and saw that we had arrived at Pokhran. In 1998, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leader of the ‘nonviolent’ Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had conducted five underground nuclear tests at Pokhran, with rightwing Hindus then pushing for a temple to mark the spot.

Its ground plan is confusing, because there are restaurants on several floors, rooms opening one into another, rooms square and rooms circular, with balconies and staircases leading here and there, huge chandeliers like a gaming-hall, mock junks piled high with victuals. There seem to be a couple of thousand tables, and at them in uproarious enjoyment sits a vast multitude of Chinese, in families running the gamut from infancy to old age. Nobody is alone. Nobody is silent. The noise is deafening, all that talk and laughter mingling with the clanking of plates, the shouts of waiters from one side of the room to the other, the occasional cries of babies, the sizzling of woks and the Chinese music blaring from hidden loudspeakers.",

Tensions were high, and widespread war appeared imminent. But Bartlett flipped through these reports with distracted interest. The news of the Karluk survivors, it seemed to him, was much more pressing and important, and he was frustrated by the waiting. He wanted to act and grew more impatient with each day.",

In August 1944, the Franks were betrayed and arrested. The family feared for their lives, but for Anne even the train journey to Camp Westerbork was a source of interest: after years trapped indoors, she couldn’t tear herself away from the windows offering views of meadows and forests. At the camp the Franks were assigned to barracks and set to work breaking old batteries apart with hammers and chisels. On 2 September, the camp authorities read out the names of the next thousand people to be sent to Auschwitz, including the eight former inhabitants of the secret annexe. Only Anne’s father Otto survived.",

Off to my left, two young black men in 49ers warm-up jackets were silently putting a pair of miniature remote-control dune buggies through their paces; they wove and whirled and fishtailed in the sand. Off to my right, a group of white people were beating the hell out of pillows with yellow plastic clubs. As I passed, I could hear screaming and cursing: “Bitch! Bitch!” “Get out of this house!” Some people were weeping. A chubby man in his forties was pounding a sheet of paper laid on a pillow. When it flew off, he chased it down, bellowing, “Get back on there, you bitch!” Near the water’s edge, I found another middle-aged man, gazing out to sea, his yellow club at his feet, a beatific expression on his face. He eyed my board as I knelt to strap on my leash. I asked about the pillow beaters, and he said they were engaged in something called the Pacific Process. Thirteen weeks, three thousand dollars. This exercise, he said, was called Bitching at Mom. I noticed he was wearing work gloves. Hey, no use getting blisters while beating the bejeezus out of Mom.",

It was a two-and-a-half-hour journey to Naples and everyone on the train, without apparent exception, passed the time by sleeping, stirring to wakefulness only to note the location when we stopped at some drowsing station or to show a ticket to the conductor when he passed through.

I knew there was a vast shopping mall in the town somewhere because I had read about it, but I couldn’t for the life of me find it, and I couldn’t even find anyone to ask. The annoying thing was that nearly all the buildings looked like they might be shopping malls.

Ogoun Balingio. But this ceremony was to Ogoun Badagris. Before his altar there were eggs and corn meal, the signs of fertility. There were sweets, and parched corn and peanuts. Of course, the water dedicated to the dead and the liqueurs, cognac, red wine, rum clairin and a red cock. The same one that I had seen tied all day by one leg before the bath house of ceremony. I felt I knew that rooster because another had attacked him while he was tethered there and while he showed plenty of courage, being tied by the leg hindered his movements, and I had driven off his assailant. I looked into his round brown eye in the hounfort and looked away. A sword was stuck into the earth at the central pole and a round black hat something like a Turkish fez was hung on the handle of it. Joswee, the sabreur (sword-bearer) who belonged to the compound of Dieu Donnez, engaged Pierre Charles the sabreur of Annee’ La Cour in mock combat. It was a very lively encounter and brought wild cheering. As Pierre Charles was forced to give away before Joswee, a figure leaped into the door. It was all in blazing red from head to foot. The skirts of the robes were very full and trimmed in white lace. This figure rushed forward, put on the fez, seized the sword and challenged Joswee fiercely. The crowd went mad as the clever dance went on. Neither really conquered the other. It was not done to prove strength and courage. It was done as a symbol of Ogoun’s power to help warriors and for the magnificent and spirited grotesque.",
