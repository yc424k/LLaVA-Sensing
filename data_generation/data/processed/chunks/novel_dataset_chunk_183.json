His footfalls rang out upon the silence. The air had a close, dead smell compounded of many elements, among which he could distinguish the dusty emanations of old wood and worn plankings and the ghostly reminders of many meals long since eaten.

Soto still believed the government was neutral and ordered each commander to seize a stretch of territory, to raid and take hostages. Secretly he was dreaming of a revolution that would spread from Patagonia and engulf the country. He was not very bright. His character was frigid and austere. At nights he went off to sleep alone.

I’m not sure what I had expected four months in Europe to do to a Tibetan but they seemed to have done no harm to Lobsang. He brought with him a calmness and dignity which I personally found very soothing at that time, suffering as I was from my first dose of concentrated publicity.",

She said it had been a hotel (in fact, it had been the office of the All-Russian Insurance Company, heavy irony) and was no longer used as a prison, only for interrogation and headquarters.

But he could not; she did not seem to be aware of him at all; the corridors where he sought her were empty, and he moved quietly in his seat beneath the thin tinkling of the music and looked about at the other politely attentive heads and beyond them, in the doorway, Harry making significant covert signs in his direction.

No identity based on being about-to-leave. The realization was as striking as sun in my eyes: though the job was seasonal, I was not. I lived in Denali. Since then, we’ve sallied forth, of course: trips abroad, holidays with family, arts residencies, a semester of teaching Outside, a winter cabin-sitting for a friend, but always returning in between.

I felt no hunger, was unaware of the pain in my feet, didn’t feel the weight of the pack or the irritating rain. At one place on the cliff I noticed a large hollow that formed a sort of giant cave, open on all sides, but roofed over by a protrusion of rock. Within it were piles of twigs, branches, and entire trees, all of them bone dry. Here I could get a fire started. Perhaps I should build a huge bonfire as a signal for Kevin.

A patch of grass caught fire, lit up, and Ugwu saw a ferret by the cluster of trees ahead, hunched like a giant tortoise. Then he saw them: crouched silhouettes moving forward, a herd of men. They were in his killing range and it felt too soon, he had expected more to happen before they delivered themselves to him, before he detonated his ogbunigwe and it pushed outward in a spray of violent metal. He took a deep breath. Carefully, firmly, he connected the cable and the plug in his hands and the immediate forceful blow-up startled him, although he had expected it. For the briefest moment, fear clenched his bowels. Perhaps he had not calculated well enough. Perhaps he had missed them. But he heard somebody close to him shout, “Target!” The word reverberated in his head as they waited for long minutes before hauling themselves out of the trench and going over to the scattered corpses of the vandals.",

Over a period of several years I doggedly sifted through the scientific literature, hoping to find a clue that would explain this conundrum. One afternoon I came across an article titled, “Identification of Swainsonine as a Probable Contributory Mycotoxin in Moldy Forage Mycotoxicoses.” The article described a fungus, Rhizoctonia leguminicola, which commonly grows on many species of legumes during the summer months in soggy climates. And R. leguminicola, it turns out, is a variety of mold that produces a potent alkaloid called swainsonine—a compound well known to ranchers and veterinarians as a killer of livestock. The literature of veterinary medicine is rife with cases of animals stricken by swainsonine poisoning after eating damp forage contaminated with R. leguminicola.",

It was no longer half seen and guessed at, from hints and gleams, as if a girl couched on her green-sea mattress tired her brows with water-globed jewels that sent lances of opal-tinted light falling and flashing in the uncertain air like the flanks of a dolphin leaping, or the flash of a falling blade. Now the sun burnt uncompromising, undeniable. It struck upon the hard sand, and the rocks became furnaces of red heat; it searched each pool and caught the minnow hiding in the cranny, and showed the rusty cartwheel, the white bone, or the boot without laces stuck, black as iron, in the sand. It gave to everything its exact measure of colour; to the sandhills their innumerable glitter, to the wild grasses their glancing green; or it fell upon the arid waste of the desert, here wind-scourged into furrows, here swept into desolate cairns, here sprinkled with stunted dark-green jungle trees. It lit up the smooth gilt mosque, the frail pink-and-white card houses of the southern village, and the long-breasted, white-haired women who knelt in the river bed beating wrinkled cloths upon stones. Steamers thudding slowly over the sea were caught in the level stare of the sun, and it beat through the yellow awnings upon passengers who dozed or paced the deck, shading their eyes to look for the land, while day after day, compressed in its oily throbbing sides, the ship bore them on monotonously over the waters.",

Its two tourist hotels are discreetly invisible from the centre where I was immediately captured by an elderly white woman waving a scrap of cardboard inscribed: ‘BLANCA $20’. Blanca assured me her home was just around the corner. She lied. Around a corner, yes – but at the end of a mile-long street of single-storey casas. If uncaptured, I would have chosen one of the several main street lodgings. As we walked – Blanca wheeling a rattling bicycle – oxen were ambling back from the fields to their stables behind the houses and children were shoo-ing hens to their coops and next door to Blanca’s home (which didn’t display the logo) excited porcine noises greeted the filling of troughs.",

Or between harping at Bernard to do something I want versus backing off because I’ve invaded Bernard’s space and letting him arrive at what I want in his own time. On the road, Bernard has adjusted to my fervent desire to go out and walk around the streets, any streets, as soon as we’ve reached our day’s destination. Now, though, I can wait until he’s had a shower, changed, and drunk a beer before we do so.",

In midafternoon we stopped for lunch and ate our kielbasa, bread, and hot, sugared tea off the Niva’s back bumper. In the wind the food tasted delicious, seasoned with cold and engine exhaust. I was glad to be standing up and moving around.",

There were few people around and the traffic was light. In May 1948 Jaffa’s population was about 100,000 Muslim, 70,000 Christian, the rest Jews. Fourteen months later the Palestinians were fewer than 4,000. ‘And now,’ said Hasan, ‘we’re about 22,000 and half of us have to fit into some relatives’ space. This is part of the “dispossession” policy, the plan to “relocate” us. All over Israel, from the ’60s to the ’80s, we couldn’t get permits for new houses or even repairs. Old places need attention but when owners dared to repair without permits Amidar claimed demolition rights. The most unlucky people, like my mother, had to pay for a demolition because they broke the law!’",

There were many settlements, but the locals seemed unfriendly. One little man of about fifty – dressed in a ragged bush-shirt and cotton shorts – made a miscalculation when he saw the lone faranj. Standing before me on the path he grabbed my dula and tried swiftly to pick my pockets – in full view of three leering youths who were sitting under a tree. However, in populated areas one can afford to be aggressive and this morning my mood was not sunny: I punched him in the eye, wrested my dula from him and brought it down hard on his skull. As he reeled away I further relieved my feelings by throwing a stone at the youths and shouting ‘Hid!’",

A few hundred yards beyond the summit was a campsite with a wooden shelter in a big grassy clearing against a backdrop of dark trees. There were a lot of people there, far more than I’d expected this early in the season. The shelter—a basic, three-sided affair with a sloping roof—looked crowded, and a dozen or so tents were scattered around the open ground. Nearly everywhere there was the hiss of little campstoves, threads of rising food smoke, and the movements of lanky young people.",

His mind wandered back to his first sight of the Willows, when he had come there with Laura Lou and Upton. He had recalled, then, waking in the night years before at Euphoria, as a little boy, and hearing the bell of the Roman Catholic church toll the hour. That solemn reverberation, like the note of Joshua’s trumpet, had made the walls of the present fall, and the little boy had reached back for the first time into the past. His first sight of the Willows had renewed that far-off impression; he had felt that the old house was full of muffled reverberations which his hand might set going if he could find the rope. . . . Since then the years had passed, and he had learned many things. His hand was nearer the rope--he was “warm,” as the children said. But when he tried to evoke the Elinor Lorburn who had waltzed in the ballroom and wreathed her hair with flowers before her tilted toilet mirror the dumb walls remained dumb . . . he could not wake them. . . .",

Of course I was not going to fetch the hot water and return with it, as it were (to pursue my simile), in my beak.

    "target_paragraph": "TWENTY-THREE KINDS OF ORCHIDS grow in the Pine Barrens—including the green wood orchid, the yellow-crested orchid, the white-fringed orchid, the white arethusa, the rose pogonia, and the helleborine—and they are only the beginning of a floral wherewithal that botanists deeply fear they will someday lose. One day, I heard a lady botanist say, with gentle anguish in her voice, “If Sim Place were developed, what would happen to Habenaria integra then?” Habenaria integra, the yellow southern fringeless orchid, grows mainly around Sim Place, a semi-ghost town several miles east of Hog Wallow. The people the lady was addressing could, of course, give no answer; they simply looked more or less distressed. The occasion was a summer field trip of the Philadelphia Botanical Club, on a day so debilitatingly hot that only a loyal core of about a dozen people had met at a Pine Barrens crossroads and proceeded as planned through several areas of woods. Six hundred and fifty thousand acres of wilderness were spread out around them, but they moved virtually on tiptoe to avoid hurting plants underfoot. One of the first species they examined was the threadleaved sundew, which grows in boggy depressions and, like several Pine Barrens plants, is insectivorous. There is little nitrogen in Pine Barrens soil, and the region has selected some plant species that get their nitrogen elsewhere—mainly from the bodies of insects. The filiform leaves of the sundews were spread out like the spines of umbrellas, and their glands were covered with a glutinous secretion that sparkled in the sun. Brooks Evert, an insurance executive, whose wife had organized the outing, carefully scooped up a sundew in a large handful of the wet sand it was growing in. He showed it to the group. Caught in the shining fluid on the sundew’s glands, several winged creatures were struggling and dying. Evert carefully set the plant back in the ground as he had found it. Mrs. Evert said, “As a rule, we take nothing and we leave nothing.” The group moved onward through the bog, passing thousands of additional sundews. “Oh, my goodness,” another woman said. “I’m stepping on them.”",

And there are other methods of defiance, other ways of ultimate refusal, other means of exercising one's last-remaining right of manhood--and some of them are no less terrifying to contemplate than this!
