The whole earth, its fairest fame of praise, its dearest treasure of a great success, its joy of travel, all its magic of strange lands, the relish of unknown, tempting foods, its highest happiness of adventure and love—would all be his: flight, storm, wandering, the great sea and all its traffic of proud ships, and the great plantation of the earth, together with the certitude and comfort of return—fence, door, wall, and roof, the single face and dwelling place of love.",

He wore a long straw cape and a tattered conical hat, and the stick in his belt proclaimed him a warrior. His belt was made of twisted rope like the rope that decorates the gateways of shrines. A thicker rope was nailed to the tree above his head and from it hung the white twists of paper that, in Shinto, are the universal charm against evil. He had a face of stuffed white cloth. His features were carefully outlined in black ink, and he stared, not at the crows in the field, but at the deserted crossroads. I started with surprise when I saw him, and I shivered when I turned away and his eyes were on my back.",

Travellers of the next century, always supposing there are any, will scarcely know whether they are in Buenos Aires or Chicago, skyscrapers all the way, skyscrapers to break the heart. When we saw it, the working city of Hongkong at the base of the Peak looked as if nailed together hurriedly from odd lots of old wood and sounded like a chronic Chinese New Year. It was brilliant with colour in signs and pennants; the narrow streets were jammed by rickshaws, bicycles, people, but not cars; the highest building was an imposing square bank and it wasn’t very high. The gentry lived in gracious homes up the sides of the Peak, social position established by height.",

And even though its feeling of space and ease, like its gold rush past and its sense of limitless future, gives Australia a somewhat Californian air, it feels more provisional, more pressureless than the frontier states of America, less troubled by introspection or ambition. Here, in fact, is a world that makes California seem positively frantic by comparison. In his novel Bliss, a typically Australian compound of irony, fancy, and profanity, Peter Carey shrewdly depicts his homeland as a mythic Eden “on the outposts of the American Empire … [with] business more or less done in the American style, although without quite the degree of seriousness the Americans liked.”",

When they turned back, Darrow saw that Owen and Sophy Viner, who had gone down the steps to the garden, were also walking in the direction of the house. As they advanced, Sophy paused in a patch of moonlight, between the sharp shadows of the yews, and Darrow noticed that she had thrown over her shoulders a long cloak of some light colour, which suddenly evoked her image as she had entered the restaurant at his side on the night of their first dinner in Paris. A moment later they were all together again on the terrace, and when they re-entered the drawing-room the older ladies were on their way to bed.",

She went quickly from table to table around the room, stopping briefly to see who would feed her. After a while she came back to the wall and sat watching us. I reached out towards her, and in a blur of black, silver and pink tongue she sank her sharp little teeth into my hand. Not deeply; I think she thought I was offering her something. There was no malice involved, just a misunderstanding, but I wouldn’t be putting my fingers near her face again.\nOne of the armed watchmen walked us back to our bungalow by torchlight. I was wondering if it was really necessary, or a little bit of theatre put on for tourists, and if there were likely to be any wild animals so close to us, when we passed within touching distance of two kudu grazing on the lawn, and I remembered the steaming heap of elephant dung we had seen earlier. We stood outside for a few minutes listening to the sounds of the night – snorts, chewing, squeaks and rustles, the chirping of crickets and rustling leaves. In the distance, something was barking. And the night air was soft and comforting.",

Nearby was the work of Lee McGary. His sculptures, also in bronze, surpassed any I had yet seen. The unbelievable detail, portraiture, and appearance of motion amazed me. One sculpture is of a slim Native American woman, over six feet tall, leaning into the wind. Her arms outstretched, she is wearing a fringed leather dress and a colorful beaded shawl, also fringed in leather. She carries a multicolored Indian blanket across her back, flowing outward as she seems to move forward. The folds in the “leather” cause the clothing to look exactly like fabric; I had to touch it to know it was metal. Intricately beaded moccasins decorate her feet and a beaded leather sheath holds her knife?moccasins and sheath also in bronze. She wears an expression of peaceful joy, looking as if she was petrified in motion, in this outfit, in this position.",

There she sat, such a lovely thing, delicately fair in the dark frame of the car, obviously someone everybody would long to be allowed to love, the enormous hat of the early summer of 1914 perched on hair whose soft abundance he had often, in happier days, luxuriously stroked, and was so completely already uninterested in him that she hardly bothered to turn her head. Wasn't this hard? Now, wasn't this terribly hard? Mr. Skeffington asked himself, his whole being one impassioned protest. Hadn't he worshipped her, lived for her, thought only of her--even, somehow, when he was thinking of the pretty little girl in the office as well? And what, in the long run, were the pretty little girls in the office to a man? Nothing; nothing; less than nothing, compared to a darling, exquisite, and, as he had supposed, permanent wife.",

The dry winter wind still blew, but a screen of thatched hurdles erected in the eye of the blast kept its force away from her. On the sheltered side was a turnip-slicing machine, whose bright blue hue of new paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene. Opposite its front was a long mound or ‘grave,’ in which the roots had been preserved since early winter. Tess was standing at the uncovered end, chopping off with a bill-hook the fibres and earth from each root, and throwing it after the operation into the slicer. A man was turning the handle of the machine, and from its trough came the newly-cut swedes, the fresh smell of whose yellow chips was accompanied by the sounds of the snuffling wind, the smart swish of the slicing-blades, and the choppings of the hook in Tess’s leather-gloved hand.",

She seemed very fond of her relatives, among whom she looked like a fairy princess; and I think they admired her very much, and treated her with some deference. The object of our visit was to procure a ie of birds feathers which they had been making for her, and for which I am sure 300 birds must have been sacrificed.

His home stood across the road, on the edge of the wadi, a cramped, DIY breeze-block bungalow replacing the half-ruin – shelled by the IDF in 2002. ‘We wanted to repair,’ said Jibril, ‘but to make a small house took less money.’",

It was the last scene of an existence created by Mrs Verloc’s genius; an existence foreign to all grace and charm, without beauty and almost without decency, but admirable in the continuity of feeling and tenacity of purpose. And this last vision had such plastic relief, such nearness of form, such a fidelity of suggestive detail, that it wrung from Mrs Verloc an anguished and faint murmur, reproducing the supreme illusion of her life, an appalled murmur that died out on her blanched lips.",

The ceiling of the largest drawing room of the Casa Gould extended its white level far above his head. The loftiness dwarfed the mixture of heavy, straight-backed Spanish chairs of brown wood with leather seats, and European furniture, low, and cushioned all over, like squat little monsters gorged to bursting with steel springs and horsehair. There were knickknacks on little tables, mirrors let into the wall above marble consoles, square spaces of carpet under the two groups of armchairs, each presided over by a deep sofa; smaller rugs scattered all over the floor of red tiles; three windows from the ceiling down to the ground, opening on a balcony, and flanked by the perpendicular folds of the dark hangings. The stateliness of ancient days lingered between the four high, smooth walls, tinted a delicate primrose-colour; and Mrs. Gould, with her little head and shining coils of hair, sitting in a cloud of muslin and lace before a slender mahogany table, resembled a fairy posed lightly before dainty philtres dispensed out of vessels of silver and porcelain.",

It was the ancient gateway town to China, the junction point of the Silk Roads leading north from India and east from Afghanistan. All merchants travelling overland to China would have had to pass through it. It is the easternmost place marked on Ptolemy’s map of the world and he describes it as the entrance to Seres, the Land of Silk. Traders from the classical West came here to exchange their goods for the mysterious ‘down’ that they genuinely believed grew on trees. Pliny was typical. ‘The Seres are famous for the wool of their forests,’ he wrote authoritatively. ‘They remove the down from leaves with the help of water.…’ This was at least one step nearer the truth than the other contemporary theory that silk was really a vegetable, possibly a distant cousin of the cabbage family.",

Still half-asleep, I followed rote memory to pack up and slip past his tent back onto the trail. Dawn broke over an hour later, slightly increasing my cognitive function. I got water from a creek near the small cabin named for Mike Ulrich, built by snowmobilers, and began the prolonged climb up Blowout Mountain. The forest and bushes were damp with dew and low-lying clouds hung in the valleys. It was still the beginning of August, but the perennial moisture of the Pacific Northwest clung to the crest, making the air clammy. Despite the chill, the effort of the climb had me sweating, and I didn’t bother to put on my jacket as I circled past the summit. Instead, I hurried back to the shelter of the trees, out of the drifting fog that left goosebumps on my sweaty skin. I knew I’d reached the high point of the day before dropping back into the windless forest.",

When Barbara left for college, we became a happy threesome. But now it would be only Mom and me. What if we ran out of things to talk about? (I jotted down a list.) What if she had nothing to eat?
