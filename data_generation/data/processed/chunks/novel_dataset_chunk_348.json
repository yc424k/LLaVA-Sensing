I knew the theory well enough. I knew how a plow anchor engaged the bottom and how the chain’s catenary held it at the correct angle. It just took one good practical demonstration to convince me. We were in about twenty feet of water when I let the anchor go. When the anchor hit bottom we started to drift back. When we came to the end of the 120 feet of chain that I had let out Quest stopped dead and snapped to attention and the chain went bar tight.",

    "target_paragraph": "Which brings me to why calligraphy is not prized in Japan today. It has to do with the way it is taught. Alone of all the traditional arts, calligraphy is instantaneous and free, ideal for busy modern people. But at some point it became a very serious affair. Students must sit still in seiza; they must slave for years to acquire technical ability in ancient styles that are completely obscure to the average person. In addition, calligraphy is afflicted by a ‘society disease’. Most professional calligraphers are members of societies that have a pyramidal structure, with grand masters at the head, vice-chairman, board members and judges below that, and lower strata of members and students at the bottom. Art yearbooks list the calligraphers in the same way that sumo posters list the wrestlers: the people at the top of the pyramid get more space. A chairman gets a photograph and a fourth of a page; a vice-chairman gets a photograph, but only an eighth of a page; and so on, on down to mere ‘provisional members’ who get only their name in small print. A glance at the name cards of typical modern calligraphers confirms their commitment to the society system. You will find one or more titles – ‘Board Member of X Society’, ‘Associate Member of Y Society’, ‘Judge of Z Society’ – all indicating that modern calligraphers are as busy establishing their place in committees as they are producing works of art.",

He stood by the low wall with his face set seaward, as if all his sight were fixed on the trail of smoke that marked the far-off passage of a steamer. Mrs. Tailleur's face was fixed on his. He was aware of it.",

He was arrested and convicted of assaulting two Border Police but only given a one-month sentence; among his vigorously vocal defenders were Noam Chomsky, Peter Tatchell and Naomi Klein. In 1997 he had received a six-month sentence for having an improper relationship with a fifteen-year-old Palestinian boy. Raouf did not mention that fact but it emerged two years later when David Norris was running for the Irish Presidency. He seemed likely to win until someone revealed that in 1997 he had written to the Jerusalem High Court requesting a non-custodial sentence for his former partner. Luckily Ireland had another, equally admirable candidate, but this anti-Norris campaign exacerbated the bad smell coming from the dead Celtic Tiger.",

The Murphys were hard, sterile, arid, meagre, and cruel: they were disfigured by a warped and infuriated puritanism, and yet they were terribly corrupt. There was nothing warm, rich, or generous about them or their lives: it seemed as if the living roots of nature had grown gnarled and barren among the walls and the pavements of the city; it seemed that everything that is wild, sudden, capricious, whimsical, passionate, and mysterious in the spirit of the race had been dried and hardened out of them by their divorce from the magical earth their fathers came from, as if the snarl and jangle of the city streets, the barren and earthless angularity of steel and stone and brick had entered their souls. Even their speech had become hard, grey, and sterile: the people were almost inarticulate; it is doubtful if one of them had three hundred words in his vocabulary: the boy noticed that the men especially – Murphy, his two sons, Feeney, and O’Doul – made constant use of a few arid words and phrases, which, with the intonation of the voice and a slight convulsive movement of the arms and hands, filled in enormous vacancies in thought and feeling, and said all that they could say or wished to say. Chief among these words or phrases was ‘You know?’ … or ‘You know what I mean?’ – words which were uttered with a light protesting emphasis on ‘You’, a slight and painful movement of the hands or shoulders, and an air that the listener must fill in for himself all that they wanted to imply. For epithets of rich resounding rage, for curses thick and opulent with fury, in which he had believed their tongues were apt and their spirits prodigal, he discovered that they had no more to offer than ‘Chee!’ or ‘Jeez!’ or ‘Ho-ly Jeez!’ or ‘Christ!’ or ‘Ho-ly Christ!’ or occasionally ‘Ho-ly Mary!’ Finally, they made a constant and stupefying use of that terrible grey abortion of a word ‘guy’: it studded their speech with the numberless monotony of paving brick; without it they would have been completely speechless and would have had to communicate by convulsions of their arms and hands and painful croakings from their tongueless throats – the word fell upon the spirit of the listener with the grey weariness of a cold incessant drizzle; it flowed across the spirit like a river of concrete; hope, joy, the power to feel and think were drowned out under the relentless and pitiless aridity of its flood.",

How beautiful the evening was! and her beauty was its beauty. The tragedy of Greece was the tragedy of all high souls. The inevitable compromise. She seemed to have grasped something. She would write it down. And moving to the table where her husband sat reading she leant her chin in her hands and thought of the peasants, of suffering, of her own beauty, of the inevitable compromise, and of how she would write it down. Nor did Evan Williams say anything brutal, banal, or foolish when he shut his book and put it away to make room for the plates of soup which were now being placed before them. Only his drooping bloodhound eyes and his heavy sallow cheeks expressed his melancholy tolerance, his conviction that though forced to live with circumspection and deliberation he could never possibly achieve any of those objects which, as he knew, are the only ones worth pursuing. His consideration was flawless; his silence unbroken.",

Log work had always been an integral part of trailwork, and the tools and techniques were the same, but with trees of that size, the possibilities were new. On forest projects, we dropped trees for bridge stringers and milled them into decking for puncheon and running plank. To cross a narrow span, we could use a single log, snapping a chalk line up the middle and ripping it with a saw to make a Gadbury-style bridge, or adze a planed walking surface easily wide enough for a hiker, perhaps two children abreast. Imagine a tree this large—like the stumps in Northwest lore, big enough to build a house in—sufficient, not a component, not a material. A structure in and of itself. Which, of course, is also what it was before we cut it down.",

It spit black smoke in the air, and its brakes burned hot asbestos as it rolled to a stop. We grabbed our bags and ran for the nearest door, but really, there was no hurry. A crush of tired, smelly, and angry passengers stormed off the train from every door. Some passed their luggage through the open windows to family and friends on the platform. The touts were right behind. You have hotel? Where you go next? We ignored their sales pitches and waited for a clearing among the crowds. A young man, about twenty years old, asked if we were headed to Aswan. “Yes,” I said. He told me to follow him and he led us to the first car, which by then was nearly empty. He politely held open the door for Teresa, and told me to find a seat, the conductor would be along soon to take our tickets, he explained. Teresa frowned at that, but I realized the fellow was speaking in polite generality. I reached in my pocket and found a crumpled note. I couldn’t read the number, but by its size and condition, I guessed it were a fiver. I slipped it to the young man, and he gratefully accepted. Teresa asked me why I tipped him at all, what had he done for us, she wondered. “It’s Ramadan,” I said. (I had read that Sadaqah – voluntary charity – during Ramadan is rewarded ten-fold on Judgment Day. I’ll let you know.) We wandered into the car and looked for a clean seat.",

After ten pumps, it seized up. God damn it! What happened? The emergency electric bilge pump came to mind. I jumped down into the sloshing cabin, pulled the switch, heard the pump churn to life, then flew up the two steps out to the cockpit to disengage the Monitor, grabbed the tiller and headed Varuna into the wind.

The few friends I could find writhed over the Cyprus question like worms halved by the ploughshare – hardly able to believe their own eyes and minds. I was able to spend one memorable afternoon forgetting Cyprus however, with old George Katsimbalis in a favourite taverna under the Acropolis; and a whole day recalling Belgrade with Sir Charles Peake, who had been my Ambassador there, and who was now grappling with the thankless task of repre­senting us in Greece: a Greece changed out of all recognition by the Enosis problem.",

Finally we ended up in a hotel that showed no outward indication of being one. The first floor of the high-rise it occupied was a day-care center, the second floor a medical clinic, the third some kind of store. The hotel consisted of part of the building’s seventh floor and offered cabinet-sized guest bedrooms, a sitting room with a television and two chairs, and a communal shower. The beds were comfortable, though, and the older ladies who ran the place attentive and kind.",

No brain can automatically feel sleepy just because its owner must rigidly adhere to a schedule. I couldn’t help but imagine how I would be reading or watching TV if at home.

As soon as she saw him, our sultry heroine fell pouting to her knees. At that, the redeemer ripped off his disguise to reveal a white tuxedo, and the two began blurting out a duet while shaking their hips together in a copy of Saturday Night Fever. Instantly, there was joy all round. Scores of onlookers turned into blazered men and bangled and bejeweled houris, writhing and wriggling in unison. The lead couple shimmied and slithered through a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers routine, arching their hips and flashing their eyes as they went. And everyone was happy, everything seemed good.

Traffic backed up behind us immediately with a great honking and roaring that did not let up as people drove around us on the ice. The mother from Khandyga was worried because from here it was several miles to land. I told her not to disquiet herself because Sergei could fix anything. He and the driver were peering under the hood. The driver seemed overwhelmed, but Sergei had taken a piece out of the engine and was strolling on the ice, hunting around.",

    "target_paragraph": "Less than two weeks after Inca Land appeared in bookstores, Bingham began the third act of his remarkable career. He had long cultivated the powerful Republican Party chairman of his conservative home state of Connecticut. His wooing paid off in November of 1922, when Bingham was elected lieutenant governor. Two years later, he was tapped to run for governor. Bingham’s Yale credentials and fame as a man of action made him unbeatable in 1924, a very good year for Republicans’ Calvin Coolidge?led ticket. Before Bingham could occupy the governor’s mansion in Hartford, however, Connecticut’s senior U.S. senator committed suicide. Party bosses chose the governor-elect to run in a special election for the Senate seat. Bingham won again. He was sworn in as governor on January 7, 1925, and over the next twenty-four hours gave what was described as “the longest inaugural address in the history of the state”; appeared in a parade with full military escort; and hosted a governor’s ball at which he made his entrance flanked by two columns of men standing at attention, as a band played “Hail to the Chief.” So as not to be forgotten, he had commissioned the biggest portrait of a Connecticut governor ever to hang in the state’s official gallery. On the second morning of the Bingham administration, the governor resigned, and as one reporter recalled, “was off to Washington, his jaw set in broad self-satisfaction.”",

Clouds of dust would fly up into the air, drift around the flat for a while, then settle on the beds and desk and chairs. There it remained. Dusting was a particular bugbear of Murti’s, rarely attempted and never with any success. But Olivia, a model employer, believed it would be churlish to point this out. After Murti had completed her statutory five minutes of dust re-distribution, my wife waved her a cheery goodbye. ‘Jolly good, Murti,’ she would say. ‘That’s enough for today.’",

As an English-speaker with connections abroad, he may have been sensitive to outside criticisms of the ‘integration’ policy. And perhaps those criticisms, in which I join, are essentially unfair. The government’s ambition to unite Laos’s disparate tribes, eliminate ‘primitive superstitions’ and bring the benefits of modernization to all simply replicates the attitudes, not so long ago, of missionaries and the more benevolent colonial officials. Even now, in the Rich World, a belief that minorities should be allowed to preserve their own cultures is not general – and is scorned if those cultures get in the way of commercial activities.",

But he was not trying yet; it was still all right, he was not worried; it would return when the time was ready and even stand still to his hand. Then one night he was allowed a bath and a barber (they had taken his razor blades away from him) came early the next morning and shaved him, and in a new shirt and manacled to an officer on one side and his court-designated lawyer on the other he walked through the still early sun, up the street where people—malaria-ridden men from the sawmill swamps and the wind- and sun-bitten professional shrimpers—turned to look after him, toward the courthouse from the balcony of which a bailiff was already crying. It was like the jail in its turn, of two storeys, of the same stucco, the same smell of creosote and tobacco spittle but not the vomit, set in a grassless plot with a half dozen palms and oleanders again too, blooming pink and white above a low thick mass of lantana. Then an entry filled yet, for a while yet, with shadow and a cellar-like coolness, the tobacco stronger, the air filled with a steady human sound, not exactly speech but that droning murmur which might have been the very authentic constant unsleeping murmur of functioning pores. They mounted stairs, a door; he walked up an aisle between filled benches while heads turned and the bailiff’s voice still chanted from the balcony, and sat at a table between his lawyer and the officer then a moment later rose and stood again while the gownless judge in a linen suit and the high black shoes of an old man came with a short quick purposeful stride and took the Bench. It did not take long, it was businesslike, brief, twenty-two minutes to get a jury, his appointed lawyer (a young man with a round moon face and myopic eyes behind glasses, in a crumpled linen suit) challenging monotonously but it just took twenty-two minutes, the judge sitting high behind a pine counter grained and stained to resemble mahogany with his face which was not a lawyer’s face at all but that of a Methodist Sunday School superintendent who on week days was a banker and probably a good banker, a shrewd banker, thin, with neat hair and a neat moustache and old fashioned gold-rimmed spectacles. “How does the indictment read?” he said. The clerk read it, his voice droning, almost drowsy among the redundant verbiage:",

Responding to the poll and to the article, Fortuyn agreed to be interviewed for a radio programme in Hilversum, a small town near Amsterdam. The interview complete, he left the building to travel to his next appointment. As he strode towards his Jaguar, a young man stepped forward and shot him six times. Fortuyn bled to death in the car park.",
