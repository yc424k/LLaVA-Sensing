Shortly before Smith’s departure, they began a campaign of terror against Indians, burning villages, looting the tombs of “dead kings,” and cutting off natives’ heads and limbs to force tribes to hand over food. Smith, for all his harshness, knew that such tactics would invite retribution. Sure enough, natives responded by massacring trade parties, in one case stuffing the mouths of English corpses with food, as a warning to any others who “shold come to seeke for breade and reliefe amongste them.”",

The storm of the previous night had cleared the air, and Paris shone in morning beauty under a sky that was all broad wet washes of white and blue; but Darrow again noticed that her visual sensitiveness was less keen than her feeling for what he was sure the good Farlows—whom he already seemed to know—would have called \"the human interest.\" She seemed hardly conscious of sensations of form and colour, or of any imaginative suggestion, and the spectacle before them—always, in its scenic splendour, so moving to her companion—broke up, under her scrutiny, into a thousand minor points: the things in the shops, the types of character and manner of occupation shown in the passing faces, the street signs, the names of the hotels they passed, the motley brightness of the flower-carts, the identity of the churches and public buildings that caught her eye. But what she liked best, he divined, was the mere fact of being free to walk abroad in the bright air, her tongue rattling on as it pleased, while her feet kept time to the mighty orchestration of the city's sounds. Her delight in the fresh air, in the freedom, light and sparkle of the morning, gave him a sudden insight into her stifled past; nor was it indifferent to him to perceive how much his presence evidently added to her enjoyment. If only as a sympathetic ear, he guessed what he must be worth to her. The girl had been dying for some one to talk to, some one before whom she could unfold and shake out to the light her poor little shut-away emotions. Years of repression were revealed in her sudden burst of confidence; and the pity she inspired made Darrow long to fill her few free hours to the brim.",

It was a great deal more appealing than I had expected it to be, not least because one of the walls was dominated by a large photograph of a linesman, Adgee Cross by name, standing at the top of a ladder buck naked, repairing a telegraph line and looking for all the world as if this were absolutely the correct attire for telegraph repairs in the outback. He was naked, Mike told me, because he had just swum the Murchison River with his ladder and didn’t want to get his clothes wet. I didn’t say anything, but the thought crossed my mind that wet clothes would dry out in minutes in the desert, whereas boots—the one thing he had kept on—would stay wet for hours. My suspicion is that Adgee Cross did his line repairs naked because he liked to. To which I say: why not?",

Smoke had blackened the earthenware tureen and the light caught its pewter ladle and stressed the furrowed faces, and the bricky cheeks of young and hemp-haired giants … A small crone in a pleated coif sat at the end of the table, her eyes bright and timid in their hollows of bone and all these puzzled features were flung into relief by a single wick from below.

    "target_paragraph": "Angela did not return in a week, she had decided to remain another fortnight in Scotland. She was staying now with the Peacocks, it seemed, and would not get back until after her birthday. Stephen looked at the beautiful ring as it gleamed in its little white velvet box, and her disappointment and chagrin were childish.\nBut Violet Antrim, who had also been staying with the Peacocks, had arrived home full of importance. She walked in on Stephen one afternoon to announce her engagement to young Alec Peacock. She was so much engaged and so haughty about it that Stephen, whose nerves were already on edge, was very soon literally itching to slap her. Violet was now able to look down on Stephen from the height of her newly gained knowledge of men—knowing Alec she felt that she knew the whole species.\n‘It’s a terrible pity you dress as you do, my dear,’ she remarked, with the manner of sixty, ‘a young girl’s so much more attractive when she’s soft—don’t you think you could soften your clothes just a little? I mean you do want to get married, don’t you! No woman’s complete until she is married. After all, no woman can really stand alone, she always needs a man to protect her.’\nStephen said: ‘I’m all right—getting on nicely, thank you!’\n‘Oh, no, but you can’t be!’ Violet insisted. ‘I was talking to Alec and Roger about you, and Roger was saying it’s an awful mistake for women to get false ideas into their heads. He thinks you’ve got rather a bee in your bonnet; he told Alec that you’d be quite a womanly woman if you’d only stop trying to ape what you’re not.’ Presently she said, staring rather hard: ‘That Mrs. Crossby—do you really like her? Of course I know you’re friends and all that—But why are you friends? You’ve got nothing in common. She’s what Roger calls a thorough man’s woman. I think myself she’s a bit of a climber. Do you want to be used as a scaling ladder for storming the fortifications of the county? The Peacocks have known old Crossby for years, he’s a wonderful shot for an ironmonger, but they don’t care for her very much I believe—Alec says she’s man-mad, whatever that means, anyhow she seems desperately keen about Roger.’\nStephen said: ‘I’d rather we didn’t discuss Mrs. Crossby, because, you see, she’s my friend.’ And her voice was as icy cold as her hands.\n‘Oh, of course if you’re feeling like that about it—’ laughed Violet, ‘no, but honest, she is keen on Roger.’\nWhen Violet had gone, Stephen sprang to her feet, but her sense of direction seemed to have left her, for she struck her head a pretty sharp blow against the side of a heavy bookcase. She stood swaying with her hands pressed against her temples. Angela and Roger Antrim—those two—but it couldn’t be, Violet had been purposely lying. She loved to torment, she was like her brother, a bully, a devil who loved to torment—it couldn’t be—Violet had been lying.\nShe steadied herself and leaving the room and the house, went and fetched her car from the stables. She drove to the telegraph office at Upton: ‘Come back, I must see you at once,’ she wired, taking great care to prepay the reply, lest Angela should find an excuse for not answering.\nThe clerk counted the words with her stump of a pencil, then she looked at Stephen rather strangely.",

She had a busy career performing major roles by Mozart, Verdi, Wagner, Strauss, Saint-Saens and more. She was once accompanied by Richard Strauss at the piano. She was an early champion of Gustav Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde, performing it with such noted conductors as Bruno Walter and Oskar Fried. Although the Vienna State Opera was her main base, she toured extensively, and retired in 1961 to a life of teaching. Most of her recorded legacy has been preserved on CD.",

    "target_paragraph": "On an autumn afternoon of blue sky and sunshine, Stephen had the Croix de Guerre pinned on her breast by a white-haired and white-moustached general. First came the motherly Mrs. Claude Breakspeare, whose tunic looked much too tight for her bosom, then Stephen and one or two other members of that valiant and untiring Unit. The general kissed each one in turn on both cheeks, while overhead hovered a fleet of Aces; troops presented arms, veteran troops tried in battle, and having the set look of war in their eyes—for the French have a very nice taste in such matters. And presently Stephen’s bronze Croix de Guerre would carry three miniature stars on its ribbon and, each star would stand for a mention in despatches.\nThat evening she and Mary walked over the fields to a little town not very far from their billets. They paused for a moment to watch the sunset, and Mary stroked the new Croix de Guerre; then she looked straight up into Stephen’s eyes, her mouth shook, and Stephen saw that she was crying. After this they must walk hand in hand for a while. Why not? There was no one just then to see them.\nMary said: ‘All my life I’ve been waiting for something.’\n‘What was it, my dear?’ Stephen asked her gently.\nAnd Mary answered: ‘I’ve been waiting for you, and it’s seemed such a dreadful long time, Stephen.’\nThe barely healed wound across Stephen’s cheek flushed darlky, for what could she find to answer?\n‘For me?’ she stammered.\nMary nodded gravely: ‘Yes, for you. I’ve always been waiting for you; and after the war you’ll send me away.’ Then she suddenly caught hold of Stephen’s sleeve: ‘Let me come with you—don’t send me away, I want to be near you…I can’t explain…but I only want to be near you, Stephen. Stephen—say you won’t send me away…\nStephen’s hand closed over the Croix de Guerre, but the metal of valour felt cold to her fingers; dead and cold it felt at that moment, as the courage that had set it upon her breast. She stared straight ahead of her into the sunset, trembling because of what she would answer.\nThen she said very slowly: ‘After the war—no, I won’t send you away from me, Mary.’",

How he would safely convey passengers in both directions when no plane was yet capable of a successful westward crossing was a matter he failed to explain. As with so many Levine schemes, it was quickly forgotten.",

Kainene used to say their mother’s breasts did not dry up at all, that their mother had given them to a nursing aunt only to save her own breasts from drooping.",

Besides, the wandering man in him, the man used to mountains, to long lonely tramps, to the hush and mystery of nights in the open, felt himself in the toils of the old magic. It was no longer Judith drawing him on, but the night itself beckoning him to fresh heights. The child at his side had travelled with him into the beauty as far as she could go, and now he needed nothing from her but the warmth of her nearness. His highest moments had always been solitary . . .",

I switched on the TV and looked through the magazines while I waited for it to warm up. They were all women’s magazines, but they weren’t like the magazines my mother and sister read. The articles in my mother’s and sister’s magazines were always about sex and personal gratification. They had titles like “Eat Your Way to Multiple Orgasms,” “Office Sex—How to Get It,” “Tahiti: The Hot New Place for Sex,” and “Those Shrinking Rain Forests—Are They Any Good for Sex?” The British magazines addressed more modest aspirations. They had titles like “Knit Your Own Twin Set,” “Money-Saving Button Offer,” “Make This Super Knitted Soap-Saver,” and “Summer’s Here—It’s Time for Mayonnaise!”",

The earth was a cemetery, a necropolis in which were interred countless now-extinct species. Drastic tidal actions, global tsunamis, severe earthquakes, volcanoes, the passing of comets: these were what had shaped and shaken up the earth’s surface into its present disruption. One popular Catastrophic theory of mountain-formation suggested that, since the earth was cooling from a white-hot original state, its volume was slowly reducing and its surface was consequently prone to severe crumpling – just as the skin of an apple crinkles as it dries out. The world’s mountain ranges were corrugations or crumples in the earth’s skin.",

It held her up, supported her, so that she could sit erect, her feet stretched sideways, out from the bed, wrapped round in the cool sheet. She wanted to see Christian, just to say good-night. She had said, “if the door’s open, just pop in to let me know, you are back.” At the hotel door, downstairs, she had insisted, “it’s only ten. I must pack anyway. Do your duty by the town, as I did this afternoon with the casino; go see something, maybe that outdoor movie.” He had held the bamboo and bead curtain for her, waited. “O do go, do go, Christian. Someone must see the fireworks. If I pack to-night, I am quite free to-morrow.” There had been occasional mild explosions and flickering of blue light. But now the show, whatever it was, was over. The traffic, last night, had made her think of the “battle of the taxis.” Last night, she lay thinking, listening to the hoot, the steady rumble, like Piccadilly traffic. The 14th of July, of course, every one would be out. Last night she had been frightened, said, “Italy, France.” She was swept into a circle of terror, “France, Italy.” She loved France— Italy and Monaco, a beauty patch, to be swept under. No, no, no her heart protested. Now there was shrill continual trembling, like (Christian said) “wind in telegraph wires.” They were, she was certain, tree-toads; he called them courtilliéres. He said, “in the Cevannes, they called them courtilliéres.” She said, “I’m sure they’re tree-toads.” The shrill persistent song of the far insects thrilled in her, like her own blood. The cry beat in her, was her. She was beating with it, was it, wrapped in the cool sheet.",

Dozens of ebullient schoolchildren, directed by two adults, were neatly arranging thousands of dark blue plastic chairs on the concrete expanse overlooked by Ché’s statue. Pathways were being vigorously swept with twig brooms. Teams of sound technicians were erecting pylon-like amplifiers that arrived in bits on trucks, their reconstruction reminding me of childhood struggles with Meccano. (I pre-date Lego.) This whole area, quite dejected on my first visit, had been spruced up: weeds gone, fountains splashing, grass clipped, flower-beds glowing, broken concrete steps mended, faded billboards renewed, though Ché’s exhortations remained the same: Hasta la victoria siempre.",

I set out for it and found it after some wandering around. The Cottage Palace is a small château sequestered in the woods and behind gates like a mafia don’s retreat on Lake Tahoe. I paid my admission, took off my snow-covered coat and hat, removed my boots, and put a pair of tapichki on my feet.

(On point c, it has to be said, Ireland was flawed until 1971 when we altered our constitution to abolish the ‘special position’ of the Roman Catholic Church. And Britain does have all those Anglican bishops in the House of Lords …) Europe’s senior democracies quarried their foundation stones gradually, over centuries, and had them in place long before full-blown democracy appeared. In contrast, throughout much of the Majority World they have only recently been carted from the quarry and remain not very securely laid. Yet the free-marketeers pretend ‘democracy’ can be quickly contrived wherever its façade seems likely to serve their purposes.",

One was a young man in beaver hat and ample cloak. To his arm clung a feminine figure so closely wrapped and muffled that, until the corner light fell on it, Delia hesitated. After that, she wondered that she had not at once recognized Tina’s dancing step, and her manner of tilting her head a little sideways to look up at the person she was talking to.",

A stormy night with broken moonlight had come on. There was a splash of wet in the air, and up to windward there was a promise of rain-squalls; and then there was the trough of the sea, cold and cruel in the moonlight, in which the Snark complacently rolled. And then we took in the sea-anchor and the mizzen, hoisted the reefed staysail, ran the Snark off before it, and went below—not to the hot meal that should have awaited us, but to skate across the slush and slime on the cabin floor, where cook and cabin-boy lay like dead men in their bunks, and to lie down in our own bunks, with our clothes on ready for a call, and to listen to the bilge-water spouting knee-high on the galley floor.",

An innocent question about his health provoked from Bolívar an acidic reply: “It isn’t nature that has reduced me to this, but the pain gnawing at my heart. My fellow citizens couldn’t kill me with daggers, so they are trying to kill me with ingratitude. When I cease to exist, those hotheads will devour each other like a pack of wolves, and what I erected with superhuman effort will drown in the muck of rebellion.”",

Hilarious stories were told of Tim's celebrated pleasure tour upon the inheritance of the second fortune. He had chartered a private car, stocked it plentifully with liquor, and selected as his travelling companions the most notorious sots, vagabonds, and tramps the community could furnish. The debauch had lasted eight months. This party of itinerant bacchuses had made a tour of the entire country. They had exploded their empty flasks against the ramparts of the Rocky Mountains, tossed their empty kegs into San Francisco Bay, strewn the plains with their beer bottles. At last the party had achieved a condition of exhausted satiety in the nation's capital, where Tim, with what was left of his inheritance, had engaged an entire floor at one of the leading hotels. Then, one by one, the exhausted wanderers had drifted back to town, bringing tales of bacchanalian orgies that had not been equalled since the days of the Roman emperors, and leaving Tim finally in solitary possession of the wreckage of empty suites.",

He shook his head, and raced along. A fat woman came edging her way carefully along the boards, a cloth over her head. “Ead?” I asked. “Ead?” She stopped and squinted at me through the rain. I pointed again to the blurred “193,” and she motioned vaguely toward a nearby shack. I sloshed my way over to a wooden fence, and knocked. No answer. Finally, a haggard, wild-eyed woman appeared above me on the second floor. “Ead?” I called up. “Do you know Ead?” She shouted something out, then hurried back into her shelter. Clearly, it was useless. I turned and made my soggy way back to my luxury hotel.",

    "target_paragraph": "The sad story served, among other things, to highlight what was perhaps the strangest of all the features of India’s relations with abroad: that many of India’s dreams of the outside world, whether British or American or even Soviet, were curiously dated. Neither Don McLean nor P. G. Wodehouse, after all, was notably popular on the streets of London or New York. But in this land of dusty stairwells, Humphrey Bogart-style black telephones and Ambassador cars unchanged for twenty years, they fit right in. And even as “jolly good”s still echoed around the gentlemen’s clubs, the movie mags trafficked in a fast talk full of “groovy gals and guys.” The respectable daily newspapers still followed the sober and august example of The Times of London, hardly recognizing that their model had itself become zappily popularized, and to that extent Americanized; the glossy new magazines took their models from America, but here too they seemed somewhat behind the times, India Today appropriating the red border and structure of Time but investing it with some old-fashioned fast-and-Luce rhetoric, while newborn Debonair billed itself as the Indian Playboy but still adhered to a fifties sensibility of black-and-white modesty. “No, I’m sorry, Miss Brasenose,” said the caption under the cartoon in The Statesman, one of India’s most respected papers, “but ‘coitus interruptus’ was not the first Roman governor of Ireland.” The slightly jejune nature of the joke, its Latin atmosphere, its provision of its heroine with the name of an Oxford college—all this gave even a semi-daring crack the somewhat musty and cobwebbed air of a Victorian schoolroom.",

Scurfing a patch away from the glazed window, Gant looked out. The Square in the wan-grey frozen morning walled round him with frozen unnatural smallness. He felt suddenly the cramped mean fixity of the Square: this was the one fixed spot in a world that writhed, evolved, and changed constantly in his vision, and he felt a sick green fear, a frozen constriction about his heart because the centre of his life now looked so shrunken. He got very definitely the impression that if he flung out his arms they would strike against the walls of the mean three-and-four-storey brick-built buildings that flanked the Square raggedly.",

    "target_paragraph": "Rumors that Byrd had at the very least exaggerated his achievement persisted for years, and suspicions were darkened by his family’s long refusal to let scholars examine his papers. It wasn’t until 1996, after Byrd’s archive was purchased by Ohio State University for its new Byrd Polar Research Center, that Byrd’s log of the flight became available for examination. The log showed heavy erasures where Byrd had done his calculations of distance traveled, suggesting to many that he had falsified the data. A more generous interpretation would be that he had made a mistake in his first calculation and started over. No one can absolutely say, but according to Alex Spencer of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., it is now generally believed among experts that Byrd and Bennett never reached the pole.",
