A hot dog stand called Guudo Doggu occupied one end of the almost empty road, and midway along it I found a little ryokan where the young woman who came to the entrance hall said to me in exquisitely polite Japanese, ‘Would you be kind enough to wait an honorable moment while I ascertain the availability of a room?’ and then skipped back into the kitchen and shrieked, ‘It’s a gaijin!’",

For the final twenty minutes of the journey, as on the way into Beirut, we found ourselves crawling uphill behind another pair of the ubiquitous Syrian tank-transporters, each weighed down with its cargo of two Soviet T-72 battle tanks.

I fill a five-gallon bucket with freshwater from a jerry can and use the old-school foot-stomping method to shift the dirt around a little, drowning everything in flower-scented fabric softeners.

It was delightful to be in the country, to study the working-out of her improvements, and do her daily exercises with windows open on the fresh hill breezes; but already her real self was projected forward into complicated plans for the Cardinal’s entertainment.

Pale, drawn memsahibs in summer frocks are pulling along four-year-old grandchildren, trying not to think too much about where their Henrys or Percivals might have been last night. Everywhere I look, these same men (or their colleagues), wispy-haired and large-bellied, lobster-coloured in the heat, are walking hand-in-hand with lissome, long-haired, dark-skinned girls younger than their daughters. The rubber plantation of Maugham’s day may be a twenty-sixth-floor condo now, but the story’s much the same.",

Our eyes met, and I quickly turned away and struck up a conversation with a young Canadian woman and young American man sitting next to me. Nice kids. Both had finished their first year at college and were walking the Camino as much for adventure as for self-discovery. It always surprises me when I meet young people who talk about self-discovery and spiritual balance. They get it, and they integrate it into their lives at an early age.",

The horse stops at the tent entrance and ten men stand below it struggling to hold up massive neon strobe lights that bathe the groom in glare. His baby face sweats with the heat but is frozen in terror. The wedding band—twelve men in white starched uniforms with red and gold epaulets, cummerbunds, pith helmets and grand mustaches—tumble out of a rickshaw and start blowing and banging on their instruments.",

Production had ground to a halt years before when the machinery broke down. Tubes then had to be imported from Europe, but they cost more to make and ship across the Atlantic. Cary had the Novalum mechanics figure out what it would take to get the line up and running. Then she used money from selling scrap aluminum to buy replacement parts. Soon she was receiving accolades for producing cigar tubes that were just as good as the imported ones but cost substantially less.",

As he moved between the crags and cataracts, over the fells and the moors, and through the pathless wilds, a sense of joy - joy, the ‘beautiful and beauty-making power’ as he had longingly called it during the dark spring of 1802 - began to seep back into him. Walking over soft mossy ground on the slopes of Red Pike - ‘a dolphin-shaped Peak of a deep red’ that rises to the south-west of Buttermere - he gave ‘many a hop, skip, & jump’. Up on the mountains that year, he found not the ‘Darkness & Dimness & a bewildering Shame, and Pain that is utterly Lord over us’ which had characterised his depression, but instead a ‘fantastic Pleasure, that draws the Soul along swimming through the air in many shapes, even as a Flight of Starlings in a Wind!’",

A pair of girl hawkers on a corner fumbled nervously as they packed up their few boxes of fruit and the packets from which cigarettes are sold singly. They hastened away as I heard cheerful chanting and saw an ANC Women’s League march approaching, led by three youngish women bearing an enormous white banner with the legend: ONE CHICKEN IN EVERY POT, ONE HOUSE FOR EVERY FAMILY, ONE CAR IN EVERY DRIVEWAY. (Is a car really more important than education and medical care? Or was this a deliberate tease, playing on current white fears?) The 150 or so women and a dozen men were escorted by almost as many troops and police. Joining the march, I noticed that a remarkable number of low-ranking, poorly paid KZP officers wear costly gold watches.",

The flash was almost too novel for its inexpressibly dangerous nature to be at once realized, and Gabriel could only comprehend the magnificence of its beauty. It sprang from east, west, north, south. It was a perfect dance of death. The forms of skeletons appeared in the air, shaped with blue fire for bones – dancing, leaping, striding, racing around, and mingling altogether in unparalleled confusion. With these were intertwined undulating snakes of green. Behind these was a broad mass of lesser light. Simultaneously came from every part of the tumbling sky what may be called a shout, since, though no shout ever came near it, it was more of the nature of a shout than of anything else earthly. In the meantime one of the grisly forms had alighted upon the point of Gabriel’s rod, to run invisibly down it, down the chain, and into the earth. Gabriel was almost blinded, and he could feel Bathsheba’s warm arm tremble in his hand – a sensation novel and thrilling enough; but love, life, everything human, seemed small and trifling in such close juxtaposition with an infuriated universe.",

Fr. Alexandros was a tall, rubicund figure with a faded serge cassock, a short Orthodox pigtail and a grey beard, matted and tangled like John the Baptist’s on some early Byzantine icon. I had stumbled across him on a walk one afternoon, soon after digging out the manuscript of The Spiritual Meadow from the library at the Monastery of Iviron. He lived alone in a small wooden hut in a clearing in the forest, high above Karyes. It was an idyllic place, a bright and silent retreat, fringed with lilies and ilex and commanding an astonishing view down over the silver domes of the Russian Skete to the deep, fragmented blue of the Aegean far below. But this, Fr. Alexandros told me, was not his home, nor where he longed to be: he had moved to this Greek hilltop only a decade before, after being driven out of his hermitage in the Holy Land.",

Evidently she was rudderless—blown about by gusts, by impulses. Nerves was almost certainly her category, or would be quite soon if no one helped her. Poor little thing, thought Mrs. Arbuthnot, her own balance returning hand in hand with her compassion, and unable, because of the table, to see the length of Mrs. Wilkins's legs. All she saw was her small, eager, shy face, and her thin shoulders, and the look of childish longing in her eyes for something that she was sure was going to make her happy. No; such things didn't make people happy, such fleeting things. Mrs. Arbuthnot had learned in her long life with Frederick—he was her husband, and she had married him at twenty and was not thirty-three—where alone true joys are to be found. They are to be found, she now knew, only in daily, in hourly, living for others; they are to be found only—hadn't she over and over again taken her disappointments and discouragements there, and come away comforted?—at the feet of God.",

Other men sat against the wall in tall chairs and smoked, awaiting their turn in the barber chairs, admiring the paintings hung on the wall, or admiring their own reflections in the long mirror. Should he, Scripps, go in there? After all, he had four hundred and fifty dollars in his pocket. He could go where he wanted. He looked, once again, irresolutely. It was an inviting prospect, the society of men, the warm room, the white jackets of the barbers skillfully snipping away with their scissors or drawing their blades diagonally through the lather that covered the face of some man who was getting a shave. They could use their tools, these barbers. Somehow, it wasn’t what he wanted. He wanted something different. He wanted to eat. Besides, there was his bird to look after.\nScripps O’Neil turned his back on the barber shop and strode away up the street of the silently frozen Northern town. On his right, as he walked, the weeping birches, their branches bare of leaves, hung down to the ground, heavy with snow. To his ears came the sound of sleigh bells. Perhaps it was Christmas. In the South little children would be shooting off firecrackers and crying “Christmas Gift! Christmas Gift!” to one another. His father came from the South. He had been a soldier in the rebel army. ’Way back in Civil War days. Sherman had burned their house down on his March to the Sea. “War is hell,” Sherman had said. “But you see how it is, Mrs. O’Neil. I’ve got to do it.” He had touched a match to the white-pillared old house.\n“If General O’Neil were here, you dastard!” his mother had said, speaking in her broken English, “you’d never have touched a match to that house.”\nSmoke curled up from the old house. The fire was mounting. The white pillars were obscured in the rising smoke-wreaths. Scripps had held close to his mother’s linsey-woolsey dress.\nGeneral Sherman climbed back onto his horse and made a low bow. “Mrs. O’Neil,” he said, and Scripps’s mother always said there were tears in his eyes, even if he was a damned Yank. The man had a heart, sir, even if he did not follow its dictates. “Mrs. O’Neil, if the general were here, we could have it out as man to man. As it is, ma’am, war being what it is, I must burn your house.”\nHe motioned to one of his soldiers, who ran forward and threw a bucket of kerosene on the flames. The flames rose and a great column of smoke went up in the still evening air.\n“At least, General Sherman,” Scripps’s mother said triumphantly, “that column of smoke will warn the other loyal daughters of the Confederacy that you are coming.”\nSherman bowed. “That is the risk we must take, ma’am.” He clapped spurs to his horse and rode away, his long white hair floating on the wind. Neither Scripps nor his mother ever saw him again. Odd that he should think of that incident now. He looked up. Facing him was a sign:",

In order to land, Mr. Graham had to make three passes over the unpaved airstrip before some browsing cattle would get out of the runway. But during the flight over the canyons he had shown Husk not only his own properties but also several small uranium mines in the vicinity actually in operation: yes, Husk could see for himself the test holes, the adits and tailings, the winding jeep roads along the verge of dizzy ledges. And as they flew over the claims Mr. Graham switched on the scintillometer wired to a case of storage batteries which he carried in the plane and pointed out to Husk the pointer readings on the dials, indicative he explained of radioactive minerals somewhere in the mesa below. It would be his partner’s job, on the ground, to locate those deposits precisely.",
