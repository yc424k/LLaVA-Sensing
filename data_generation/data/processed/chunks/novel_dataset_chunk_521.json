This is Skardu’s main bazaar but in midwinter many traders hibernate; half the little stalls were closed and the rest carried very meagre stocks. Abbas Kazmi’s name is known to everyone here, so despite a predictable dearth of English-speakers and a certain surliness in the atmosphere – possibly owing to this being the start of Muharram – it was easy to find him. But even Hallam’s surefootedness was tested on the thick ice and packed snow of the town’s often-used paths.",

A rough black pill-box was tilted askew on his matted and whiskered head. His black double-breasted waistcoat of homespun goats’ hair was tucked into a black sash below which a hairy and broad-pleated black kilt jutted stiffly to his knees. Black tights of the same stifling stuff covered his long legs and he was shod in those Greek mountain shoes that turn up at the tip and curl back in a broad canoe-like prow and end in a wide black pom-pom covering the front of the foot. The thick soles were clouted and the nails grated underfoot. He loped along the middle of the road, gazing ahead as though to avoid the contaminating houses. A long shepherd’s staff, whose crook was a carved wooden snake, lay across his shoulders. He had looped his arms over it in the flying and cruciform position in which many mountaineers carry their crooks and their guns. He was, in fact, a Sarakatsán. Heads turned under the dusty acacias as he passed and the smack of cards and the clatter of backgammon counters died down for a few moments. I got up and dogged his steps at a discreet distance.",

In Chicago he would think I imagine I am going to fail and he would fail; now he knew he was going to fail and he refused to believe it, refused to accept no for an answer until threatened almost with physical violence. He was not trying hospitals alone, he was trying anyone, anything. He told lies, any lie; he approached appointments with a frantic cold maniacal determination which was inherent with its own negation; he promised anyone that he could and would do anything; walking along the street one afternoon he glanced up by sheer chance and saw a doctor’s sign and entered and actually offered to perform any abortions thrown his way for half the fee, stated his experience and (he realised later when comparatively sane again) only his ejection by force forestalled his showing Buckner’s letter as a testimonial to his ability.",

If he left the room for a minute she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.",

The place lies high and in the open, and lacks the lavish shade of the more protected New England villages. The clump of weeping-willows about the duck pond, and the Norway spruces in front of the Hatchard gate, cast almost the only roadside shadow between lawyer Royall’s house and the point where, at the other end of the village, the road rises above the church and skirts the black hemlock wall enclosing the cemetery.",

    "target_paragraph": "Another product seen all over Calabria and sold in great abundance at grocery stores, specialty and tourist shops, as well as open-air markets is the peperoncino (hot pepper), a New World fruit long appreciated by the Calabrians and written about by travelers to the region as early as the seventeenth century. The climate suits the plant, yielding a quality product that Calabrians consume in ample quantities. Used in many of their sausage and cold cuts, in pasta sauces, and on pizza and bruschetta, the peperoncino is found on tables as a general condiment, fresh, in oil or dried. Many add a spoonful of what is often packaged for tourists as the “bomba calabrese” to whatever they eat—a mixture of finely chopped vegetables with a healthy dose of peperoncino in oil. Personally, dark chocolate with peperoncino is one of my favorites. At the market, I bought a scoop of the dried flakes to make the well-known aglio (garlic), olio (olive oil), peperoncino sauce for pasta.",

The immaculately clean, wallpaper-lined storefront was filled with trays of freshly made candy. His eyes fell for a moment on some chocolate balls. He unconsciously licked his lips.

Often I used carefully to shut all the windows and draw the door curtain, hoping thus to obtain a greater freedom of speech, though this was of little use with the Ilsa and the Ailsa on either side, their windows open, and perhaps a group of caravaners sitting on the ground immediately beneath.",

When the Spaniards arrived, only the Inca royalty were allowed to chew this sacred plant, which acts as a mild narcotic?suppressing hunger, boosting energy, and alleviating the effects of soroche. Although very illegal in the United States, coca leaves have about the same relationship to cocaine that Sudafed cold tablets have to crystal meth. Each member of our team happily received his ration every morning, and the few strangers we encountered along the way, once we left Choquequirao, invariably tried to beg a pinch off the muleteers. Twice I saw Juvenal holding a fan of three coca leaves before his lips, as if making an offering to the apus. I was too intimidated to ask what he was doing.",

It was the Grajagan shot, clipped from a surf mag, of me standing, board under arm, at the edge of the reef while an empty, backlit, fabulous-looking left roars past. Becket had tacked up a caption, “Chickens Do Surf.” The reference was to my ankles, which are skinny. “I know why you had to go around the world,” he said while I studied the photo. “It was because you couldn’t find enough things to be miserable about in this country.”",

Not to do so would be to invite bad luck – including lactation failure – by offending the relevant phi. A few months previously a neighbour had defied this custom after her second baby and the infant, though born healthy, had since gone from one infection to another, with frequent fevers. His mother’s angering of the phi was being blamed and the father, who only believes in forest cures, was further upset by the baby’s being stuffed with Western medicines. ‘I don’t believe in charcoal,’ said Mrs Osakhanh, ‘but still I must respect the phi.’",

I have a vivid recollection of one person whom I encountered on this stretch of road. This was a young nomad, muffled in a long sheepskin coat and wearing a pigtail, as all Tibetan men do who are not monks. He led us to his black tent made of yak’s hair where his wife was waiting for him. She was a merry creature, always laughing. Inside the tent we found a treasure that made our mouths water—a haunch of venison. Our host gladly sold us a portion of the meat for an absurdly low price. He begged us to say nothing about his hunting or he would get into trouble. Taking of life, whether human or animal, is contrary to the tenets of Buddhism and consequently hunting is forbidden. Tibet is governed on a feudal system, whereby men, beasts and land belong to the Dalai Lama, whose orders have the force of law.",

What made Weston feel familiar was, of course, that it was just like everywhere else. It had Boots and Marks & Spencer and Dixons and W. H. Smith and all the rest of it.

I then reflect. I AM old. Back in Oban, I watch as a busload of tourists get off their coach bus, many of whom are considerably younger than me but members of the walking dead, and observe: maybe old isn’t a useful paradigm.

The river seemed quite full because confined to a narrow, deep bed. Stately groves of mature eucalyptus were swaying in the breeze, interspersed with plantations of silver-blue-green saplings – all quivering and shimmering. Beyond the gorge, our path rose gradually, following the curves of a series of red-brown mountains. By Andean standards this region is densely populated; its gentler slopes allow more cultivation, and enclose wider, more fertile valleys, than any we saw this morning. But we passed no pueblos and our hunger reached the ‘acute’ mark as the air became thinner and colder. I ate the four raw eggs, Rachel having declined to share them with me. Then the terrain was again uninhabited, as the Camino Real ran level along a sheer grey mountain wall of naked rock with a slit-like chasm on the left – its rar-away floor a tangle of trees and shrubs. Ahead rose a bulky, forested mountain; and at last, between the trees, we glimpsed a few roofs. But another hour passed before we turned the shoulder of this 11,000 foot mountain, near its summit, and were looking down on a dense eucalyptus wood through which Huamachuco – at 9,300 feet – was just visible.",

But Peter—however beautiful the day might be, and the trees and the grass, and the little girl in pink—Peter never saw a thing of all that. He would put on his spectacles, if she told him to; he would look. It was the state of the world that interested him; Wagner, Pope’s poetry,* people’s characters eternally, and the defects of her own soul. How he scolded her! How they argued! She would marry a Prime Minister and stand at the top of a staircase; the perfect hostess he called her (she had cried over it in her bedroom), she had the makings of the perfect hostess, he said.",

Most of the cars, trucks, and vans were familiar, though: the Ocean Beach surf crew was out in force. Some of its members slouched behind steering wheels, others sat on the hoods of their cars, a few stood on the embankment above the beach. Nobody was in a wetsuit, and no boards had been unsheathed. But everyone was staring out to sea. I looked for a minute, and saw nothing. I rolled down my window and called to Sloat Bill, who was standing on the embankment, heavy shoulders hunched, hands jammed in the pockets of a ski jacket. He turned, regarded me for a moment from behind mirrored sunglasses, then cocked his head toward the surf and said, “Doc and Peewee.”",

A tattered American flag flapping in the cold rain marked the disputed boundary between the United States and Canada. Inside one of the huts, railroad officials had prepared a sumptuous meal for their esteemed visitors. Harriman asked Edward Curtis to photograph the assembled guests, but the poor midday light made the task impossible. The return trip down to Skagway was halted momentarily when someone noticed that Harriman was missing?the railroad man had wandered off to have a look around.",

The ivy will snake back and unrig our flats and terraces, as it scattered the Roman villas. The sand will drift into our business parks, as it drifted into the brochs of the Iron Age. Our roads will lapse into the land. ‘A ghost wilderness hovers around the entire planet,’ wrote the poet and forester Gary Snyder, ‘the millions of tiny seeds of vegetation . . . hiding in the mud on the foot of an arctic tern, in the dry desert sands, or in the wind . . . each ready to float, freeze or be swallowed, always preserving the germ.’",
