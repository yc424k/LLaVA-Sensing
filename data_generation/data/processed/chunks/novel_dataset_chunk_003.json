Only my little village lay obstinately outside the frame of things, saturated by the smoke of wood fires in an early autumn, its inhabitants drowsing away the noons at their spindles. But they were no longer talking village affairs, weddings, baptisms, for the radio bulletins poured in upon them, drenching them with news they might never have known of searches and curfews and killings in the various quarters of the island. Then, too, masked men had visited them to collect arms, frightening the wits out of them. ‘I thought they were Easter mummers,’ said Anthemos, ‘and then I became afraid of the firelight shining on their masks. They said: “Dighenis wants all the shotguns.” They were armed. What could we do? We handed them over – all except Petro who had hidden his. They were not from here, you know. Nobody recognized them. They came in a car and left it on the threshing-floor.’",

A very quiet despair was in his heart, a weary peace that brooded too upon the house of death and tumult, that flowed, like a soft exploring wind, through its dark halls, bathing all things quietly with peace and weariness. The boarders had fled like silly sheep to the two houses across the street: they had eaten there, they were clustered there upon the porches, whispering. And their going brought him peace and freedom, as if his limbs had been freed from a shackling weight. Eliza, amid the slow smoke of the kitchen, wept more quietly over the waste of supper; he saw the black mournful calm of the negress’s face. He walked slowly up the dark hall, with a handkerchief tied loosely round his wound. He felt suddenly the peace that comes with despair. The sword that pierces very deep had fared through the folds of his poor armour of pride. The steel had shared his side, had bitten to his heart. But under his armour he had found himself. No more than himself could be known. No more than himself could be given. What he was – he was: evasion and pretence could not add to his sum. With all his heart he was glad.",

    "target_paragraph": "I took this advice when dealing with the next threat, which came after I had said ‘Viszontlatasna!’ (farewell) to Harghita and was returning to Moldavia, now crossing the Bicaz Pass from the west. Half-way up, when it had been deluging coldly for an hour, I came on hundreds of sheep huddling in the thin forest, being semi-sheltered from the sleet. (Already many had died all over Moldavia and Transylvania, having been shorn at the normal time in an abnormal season.) Here I was ready when five great white woolly dogs leaped from the embankment to the road and encircled me, barking and snarling. I froze while they stood poised to attack, some five yards away; their terrifying noise must surely bring the shepherd quickly to my rescue. Not so, however. They then began to advance, in little jerky movements, their snarling becoming almost hysterical. At that moment I was as scared as I have ever been on my travels. I thought very fast. Should I try to remove the panniers and deter them by swinging Luke in a circle? I felt weak with relief when a dishevelled woman (the shepherd’s wife?) appeared on the embankment, a cigarette hanging from one corner of her mouth and wearing a peevish expression. As usual, the pack at once obeyed her screamed orders. But their withdrawal was reluctant and they continued to growl loudly and walk along the top of the embankment, parallel with me, until I was off their territory – which is of course wherever the flock happens to be. As I passed a nearby hut I observed the shepherd lying on a fleece by the doorway in – undoubtedly – a drunken stupor.",

It was spring, and the big swells from the Aleutians that sent huge surf to the North Shore were finished for the year. We stopped at the fabled big-wave spot, Waimea Bay. Except for the fact that the sea was flat, it looked just like its pictures. We hiked up the canyon behind the beach and swam in a freshwater pool. Dad, Kevin, and I jumped off a cliff into the cold brown water, daring each other to go higher. In feats of stupid physical daring, I had, I realized, surpassed my father, although he was athletic, not timid, and not yet forty. My family, I thought, knew less and less about me. I had been leading a clandestine life, particularly since we moved to Hawaii. Much of that was down to surfing, and it had begun back in California.",

Such rock handiwork is evident through out the Sperry district; trails wind past decades of drystone masonry. Rock walls ten courses thick with a keystone the size of a couch, a squared chunk of pink rock that it took five of us to move, climbing turns with stairs on a slight batter, retaining walls that bear up slopes of scree.

He just watched them: the two oldish couples, man and wife of course, farmers obviously, without doubt tenant-farmers come up from the mortgaged bank- or syndicate-owned cotton plantation from which the son had been drafted three or four or five years ago to make that far from home that sacrifice, old, alien too, too old for this, unreconciled by the meagre and arid tears which were less of tears than blisters; none of the white people actually watching as the solitary Negro woman got up from her back bench and walked down the aisle to where the young woman’s soiled yellow hat was crushed into the crook of her elbow like a child in a child’s misery and desolation, the white people on the bench making way for the Negress to sit down beside the young white woman and put her arm around her; Goodyhay still standing, his arms propped on the closed fists on the plank, the cold seething eyes not even closed, speaking exactly as he had spoken three nights ago while the three of them knelt on the kitchen floor: “Save us, Christ. The poor sons of bitches.” Then Goodyhay was looking at him. “You, there,” Goodyhay said. “Stand up.” Mink did so. “He’s trying to get home.

And mingled with this warmth, there was an overpowering odor of food. At hundreds of tables people were sitting together devouring tons of flesh—ox flesh, great platters of sliced cold sausages, huge slabs of veal and pork—together with the great stone mugs that foamed with over a liter of the cold and strong October beer. There was a heavy and incessant rumble of voices full of food, an enormous and excessive clatter of heavy pottery and knives, that rose and fell in brittle waves. Down the central aisles and around the sides moved and jostled constantly another crowd looking restlessly over the densely packed area for a vacant place. And the brawny peasant women who acted as waitresses plunged recklessly through this crowd, bearing platters of food or a half-dozen steins of beer in one hand, and brusquely thrusting human impediments out of their way with the other.",

It was very hot, almost too hot for sight-seeing, on the Nevada's bow. Expectation among the lieges became tremendous and vociferous when Admiral Pennock's sixteen-oared barge, with a handsome awning, followed by two well-manned boats, swept across the strip of water which lies between the ships and the shore. Outrigger canoes, with garlanded men and women, were poised upon the motionless water, or darted gracefully round the ironclads, as gracefully to come to rest. Then a stir and swaying of the crowd, and the American Admiral was seen standing at the steps of an English barouche and four, and an Hawaiian imitation of an English cheer rang out upon the air. More cheering, more excitement, and I saw nothing else till the Admiral's barge, containing the Admiral, and the King dressed in a plain morning suit with a single decoration, swept past the Nevada. The suite followed in the other boats,—brown men and white, governors, ministers, and court dignitaries, in Windsor uniforms, but with an added resplendency of plumes, epaulettes, and gold lace. As soon as Lunalilo reached the California, the yards of the three ships were manned, and amidst cheering which rent the air, and the deafening thunder of a royal salute from sixty-three guns of heavy calibre, the popular descendant of seventy generations of sceptred savages stepped on board the flag-ship's deck. No higher honours could have been paid to the Emperor \"of all the Russias.\" I have seen few sights more curious than that of the representative of the American Republic standing bare-headed before a coloured man, and the two mightiest empires on earth paying royal honours to a Polynesian sovereign, whose little kingdom in the North Pacific is known to many of us at home only as \"the group of islands where Captain Cook was killed.\" Ah! how lovely this Queen of Oceans is! Blue, bright, balm-breathing, gentle in its strength, different both in motion and colour from the coarse \"vexed Atlantic!\"",

The trailers looked aligned to me, but Hilda had other ideas. She pulled forward to realign her approach to the back trailer again. If Hilda didn’t want my direction, I would happily ride in the cab while she worked. I decided to walk around some other trailers well clear of where she repositioned the rig and walk up to the passenger side door. A couple of minutes later I made my way around to the other side of the cab. The passenger door stopped right in front of me, as Hilda rolled the rig back to a halt. Due to the height of the cab, I couldn’t see Hilda ten feet up and five feet over in the driver seat. She must have seen me in the small side mirror over the passenger window, I reasoned. I climbed into the cab and sat in the passenger seat. Inexplicably, Hilda exploded.",

And he deplored the Lost Generation’s being used as ‘political pawns’. His total ignorance of the mechanics of Grand Apartheid explains his impatient contempt for the current turmoil on the educational scene. In ex-Communist countries it is easy to remember past constraints. In this country, which displayed all the trappings of a parliamentary democracy (albeit for whites only), one can forget that the Unholy Trinity were rather better at thought control than most Communist regimes.",

The museum is a model of what local volunteerism can accomplish, as evidenced by its Queen’s Award for Voluntary Services, equivalent to an MBE for voluntary groups. With a decidedly local bent, the diversity and depth of the displays keep me for hours. Inside this small building are a series of home life exhibits including laundry, wool spinning, knitting and weaving. One exhibit is a Preacher’s Ark, a portable wood pulpit that was toted from place to place and set up at religious gatherings. It is accompanied by written narratives of residents who attended such, as in walking sixteen barefoot miles in a day to a field filled with hundreds of believers. The fervour of the events is also captured with preachers taking on rock star status. The obligatory rocks are here, too. In addition to the standard geological samples and Neolithic utensils is the Gairloch Pictish stone. Carved with a salmon and part of an eagle in approximately 500 – 700AD, it’s particularly important because Pictish remains are scarce. The Salmon figure has been adopted as the Museum’s logo and residents are rightly proud of it.",

Here the path forks. Take the left branch.' Easy, we thought as we strode confidently onwards. It was great walking country. Rough terrain, but easy to follow tracks, through an alpine valley surrounded by cloud shrouded peaks. We ate our packed-lunch next to a walker's refuge, a deserted stone hut high on a mountain pass, with a fireplace and raised wooden ledges to accommodate the sleeping bags of long distance hikers. An eagle soared above us as we tucked into our cheese butties, swooping low, as if to assess the chance of an airborne smash and grab raid on our lunch.",

The girls dressed by an oil stove that Alabama bought for Madame; the dressing-room reeked of glue from the toe shoes warming over the thin blaze, of stale eau de Cologne, and of poverty. When Madame was late, the dancers warmed themselves by doing a hundred releves to the chanted verses of Verlaine. The windows could never be opened because of the Russians, and Nancy and May, who had worked with Pavlova, said the smell made them sick. May lived at the Y.W.C.A. and wanted Alabama to come to tea. One day, as they were going down the steps together, she said to Alabama that she could not dance any more, that she was quite sick.",

In many ways, having a jury rig succeed is often more gratifying than making a pleasant and uneventful passage or even winning a race. Rising to the challenge is a common thread that runs through a vast wardrobe of sea stories. I’ve stuck back together masts, steering gear, boat hulls, and a host of smaller items.

For what the abandoned Burridge had been singing, lustily throwing out clay preparatory to the burying, a month before, of a lady parishioner who till only a few days previously had been having her windows and boots cleaned by him, and been looking through the windows and walking about in the boots just as though she were going on for ever, and had very unreasonably and unfairly dismissed him from his post on the ground that she couldn’t see through the windows or show herself in the boots, which was nothing to do with him, but just death coming on, declared Burridge—what he had been singing were the following words, to a tune which kept time with the activities of his shovel:",

She thought, “I haven’t used my feet like this since I was—since I was a child.” She remembered that she hadn’t been happy like this since childhood. And remembering back, she remembered that, then, she had not been too happy. A child is not too happy. She had never been happy, she thought, equally in spirit and body like this. She had been happy with one, with the other, not both. She had never been happy like this, in her life. Happiness was a new garment, fitted her like her Lingburgh helmet. It was snug, fitted her like her paint-box blue rubber beach shoes. She said under her breath, “I am perfectly happy.”",

High and narrow, the coachwork was painted to mimic the graining of yellow wood and upholstered in threadbare tasselled velvet. This delightful carriage, fit for two travellers out of Jules Verne, carried us swaying through the Thracian sky and over the gorges and forests of plane trees, the rocky river beds and the scrubmantled mountainsides at an abnormal height. The ancient Thracians used to hold their mares with their heads downwind in order that the wind might put them in foal. Over which of the Rhodope passes did this invisible stallion come snorting? Every so often we passed solitary police posts and lookout platforms on stilts, each one a pedestal for an armed and helmeted soldier; reminders of the nearness and the danger of the Bulgarian frontier. Asprawl among trees and bracken, blown there by guerrilla mines, the rusty remains of carriages were gloomy mementoes of the civil war. The country shook in the noonday.",

If you were lucky – or unlucky, depending on your tastes – you might also encounter the Balinese guy who was said to actually live in these bushes, animal-like: a puckish man with long curls who made a living entirely out of selling hand jobs and blow jobs for 20,000 rupiah (two dollars) a pop.
