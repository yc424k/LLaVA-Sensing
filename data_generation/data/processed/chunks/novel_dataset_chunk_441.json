A cacophony erupted as we made our way under the arches, running after Subbu who, much to Passepartout’s despair, had been instructed to come with us to the platform. Whether this was a display of Imthiaz’s diligence in his surrogate role or his lack of faith in our ability remained unclear, though my suspicions leant strongly towards the latter. Indian stations are not designed for running. An assault course lay between us and Subbu, who was winding deeper and deeper into the sea of boxes, briefcases and body parts. We ducked and wove around the slalom of wooden carts wheeled by men with no sense of urgency, strings of hand-holding children, hobbling dogs, stacked hessian sacks, Aavin milk stands, nose-pickers, watersellers, booksellers and red-shirted porters. Subbu now stood by our train, under a digital sign reading B2, his face powder dry, as we bent double, sweat running down our bodies.",

And that was the last we saw of him, as he had high-tailed it back to his home far from Nairobi. When I explained that the petty cash tin was empty and we no longer had an office messenger, I expected anger or at least indignation from my volatile boss, but he simply shrugged his shoulders and remarked: ‘Poor bastard, what can you expect? Too much temptation for a poor man. Who can blame him? The amount isn’t going to affect our lives, but I hope it will make a difference to his.’",

If you looked at them they turned into squab faces smeared with green.\nEvery night, when Jenny had gone away with the doll and the donkey, you hunched up the blanket and the stiff white counterpane to hide the curtain and you played with the knob in the green painted iron railing of the cot. It stuck out close to your face, winking and grinning at you in a friendly way. You poked it till it left off and turned grey and went back into the railing. Then you had to feel for it with your finger. It fitted the hollow of your hand, cool and hard, with a blunt nose that pushed agreeably into the palm.\nIn the dark you could go tip-finger along the slender, lashing flourishes of the ironwork. By stretching your arm out tight you could reach the curlykew at the end. The short, steep flourish took you to the top of the railing and on behind your head.\nTip-fingering backwards that way you got into the grey lane where the prickly stones were and the hedge of little biting trees. When the door in the hedge opened you saw the man in the night-shirt. He had only half a face. From his nose and his cheek-bones downwards his beard hung straight like a dark cloth. You opened your mouth, but before you could scream you were back in the cot; the room was light; the green knob winked and grinned at you from the railing, and behind the curtain Papa and Mamma were lying in the big bed.\nOne night she came back out of the lane as the door in the hedge was opening. The man stood in the room by the washstand, scratching his long thigh. He was turned slantwise from the nightlight on the washstand so that it showed his yellowish skin under the lifted shirt. The white half-face hung by itself on the darkness. When he left off scratching and moved towards the cot she screamed.\nMamma took her into the big bed. She curled up there under the shelter of the raised hip and shoulder. Mamma's face was dry and warm and smelt sweet like Jenny's powder-puff. Mamma's mouth moved over her wet cheeks, nipping her tears.\nHer cry changed to a whimper and a soft, ebbing sob.\nMamma's breast: a smooth, cool, round thing that hung to your hands and slipped from them when they tried to hold it. You could feel the little ridges of the stiff nipple as your finger pushed it back into the breast.\nHer sobs shook in her throat and ceased suddenly.",

    "target_paragraph": "“Oh—eh—how are you?” said Seamus Malone. He extended a clammy hand, his pale-red lips twisted in a ghastly attempt at a friendly smile. And in this smile there was something that was likewise pitiable, something that spoke of a genuine warmth, a genuine instinct for friendship down below the whole tortured snarl of his life, something really engaging that peered out for just an instant behind the uncontrollable distemper of his face. It was there beneath all his swarming hatreds, jealousies, his self-pity, his feeling that life had somehow betrayed him, which it had not done, and that his talents had not had their due, which they had and more, and that infamous charlatans, fools, ignoramuses, dolts, dullards, mountebanks of every description were being acclaimed as geniuses, surfeited with applause, fatted-up with success, lavished-over with all the honied flatteries, the adoring cajoleries, the sickening adulations of a moronic populace which should have been his! his! his!—no one’s but his, great God!—if there was an atom of truth, of honor, of character, intelligence, and fair-dealing in this damnable, accursed, imbecilic Judas Iscariot of a so-called world!",

Still, despite their circuitous route, they were getting closer to the island. But the pain in Mamen’s leg, jostling along on the sled, was almost unbearable.

She sketched lightly, upon the blank vista down which they walked, the little white house and the tremulous old lady rising from behind her tea-table to greet her with faltering words about ‘my son’s friends’, and was on the point of asking Ralph to tell her what she might expect, when he jerked open one of the infinite number of identical wooden doors, and led her up a tiled path to a porch in the Alpine style of architecture.

With a new sense of awe he looked at the frank forehead, serious eyes and gay innocent mouth of the young creature whose soul's custodian he was to be. That terrifying product of the social system he belonged to and believed in, the young girl who knew nothing and expected everything, looked back at him like a stranger through May Welland's familiar features; and once more it was borne in on him that marriage was not the safe anchorage he had been taught to think, but a voyage on uncharted seas.",

Some people I wanted to meet near Glacier Bay were out of town for the week, so I headed to Sitka first. Since the southbound Marine Highway ferry wasn’t due back in Skagway for several days, I flew out on one of Alaska’s many small subregional carriers. Shortly after eight, I checked out of my hotel and walked five minutes to the airport. I rummaged through the collection of paperbacks that accumulates at every small transportation hub in Alaska. I waited for the pilot to come by, glance down at his clipboard, and ask for me by name. I climbed onto the wing of the four-seater after the other passenger, who was carrying a Jack Russell terrier, and squeezed into the copilot’s seat. I had a nice chat with the pilot about his days flying for the navy in Iraq while I took in the mountains and glaciers of Lynn Canal in reverse. By nine thirty I was sitting down to breakfast in Juneau, awaiting the twice-a-week ferry to Sitka.",

Often, I found them assembled in serene fascination on a sidewalk while a couple posed for a photo, or an Australian haggled with a vendor, or a Cadillac drove up to a foreigner’s hotel.

The sets were stepladdering—each one bigger than the last. It was at least ten feet now. The other guys were somewhere out the back—not in sight. I decided to catch the very next wave I could and go in. I found a nice medium-sized wave, possibly the first of a set. I caught it, shaky with relief. Then I managed to fall off.

Then he wrung its neck. In every other ceremony the throat is cut. The supposedly dead bird was placed upon the signature, but after what seemed like a full minute, even with its broken thighs, it leaped in its death agony and crashed into me.

What, I wondered, had brought all this late-Victorian wealth to Inverness, and who supported these handsome heaps today? Not far from the castle, on spacious grounds in what I suppose a developer would call a prime location, stood a particularly grand and elaborate mansion, with a wandering roofline and an abundance of turrets and towers. It was a wonderful, spacious house, the kind you could imagine riding a bicycle around in, and it was boarded, derelict, and up for sale. I couldn’t imagine how such a likable place could have ended up in such a neglected state. As I walked along, I lost myself in a reverie of buying it for a song, doing it up, and living happily ever after on these large grounds beside this deeply fetching river, until I realized what my family would say if I told them we weren’t after all going to the land of shopping malls, one-hundred-channel television, and hamburgers the size of a baby’s head, but instead to the damp north of Scotland.",

I was given an example of this when I passed an evening in my hotel room watching a televised football match between Burma and Malaysia.

The next day a friend asked me if I had heard about the scuffles that took place at the football stadium between football fans and riot-control police in which one policeman had been killed and a handful of people had been injured. I replied confidently that nothing had happened, explaining that I had watched the whole match from start to finish. ‘Yes,’ said my friend, ‘but who do you think controls the television channel?’ He told me he had listened to the match on his radio and knew that something was up when the programme fell silent as the commentary was temporarily taken off the air.",

The cattle clattered and skidded on the bare rock; sparks flew from the iron-shod hooves of the horses. Lagging behind, I stopped to admire a tiny spring bubbling out of the sand above the ledges, well off to one side of the trail. The water was so clear, so perfectly transparent, that only the dance of grains of sand in the bottom of the spring, where the flow came up through a fissure in the rock, revealed that it was under pressure and in motion. I took a quick drink – cool and sweet – and rode on through the blessed shade of the canyon walls; the sun had finally dropped below the rim. Life began to seem plausible again after an afternoon of doubt.",

Even the journey to the inhospitable coast was arduous; there were deaths along the way from fatigue and exposure. One man, Donald Mackay, whose two daughters were weak with disease and malnourishment, was so desperate to get them aboard a small sloop travelling to Caithness that he carried them on his back, one at a time, to the coast. He laid the first down in the open air on the beach, then walked back, and picked up the other. In this way, he walked twenty-five miles.",

It had leather fittings, a sofa and chairs, cooking facilities, even a bed?everything that a crew of four could possibly want in the way of comfort and elegance. The idea was to show that the Atlantic could not simply be crossed but crossed in style. Sikorsky was supported by a syndicate of investors who called themselves the Argonauts.",

However, at the far end of the Sadar Bazaar the ‘Karakarom [sic] General Stores’ was open. Khapalu’s most ambitious shop is run by Haji Abdul Rehman and his son Ghulam, a burly young man with light brown hair, hazel eyes and such a flair for languages that he managed to acquire intelligible English at the local school. Ghulam befriended us within hours of our arrival and today invited us to sit on the shop verandah, where a tiny fire of wood-chips was burning in half an old kerosene tin. Five passers-by who had happened to notice this hint of warmth were crouching around it, their blankets covering everything but their dark eyes, which rested on us with varying degrees of wondering friendliness. Unsteady stools were provided for us and as snow continued to swirl down Ghulam questioned me yet again about Ireland and Europe and Pakistan, which last country seems to him almost as remote as Ireland, despite its being only an hour’s flight from Skardu.",
