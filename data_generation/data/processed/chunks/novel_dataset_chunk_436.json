But the idealist subdued to vulgar necessities must employ vulgar minds to draw the inferences to which he cannot stoop; and it was easier for Lily to let Mrs Fisher formulate her case than to put it plainly to herself. Once confronted with it, however, she went the full length of its consequences; and these had never been more clearly present to her than when, the next afternoon, she set out for a walk with Rosedale.",

Between them they raised up the mattress; but their movements were unsteady, and the coat slipped to the floor, revealing the poor body in its helpless misery. Charity, picking up the coat, covered her mother once more. Liff had brought a lantern, and the old woman who had already spoken took it up, and opened the door to let the little procession pass out. The wind had dropped, and the night was very dark and bitterly cold. The old woman walked ahead, the lantern shaking in her hand and spreading out before her a pale patch of dead grass and coarse-leaved weeds enclosed in an immensity of blackness.",

The service was appalling, probably because the restaurant owners are anti-clerical. But our meal of steak, onions and chips, though not a novelty, was appetisingly cooked. The bottle of Peruvian wine I discovered yesterday in a dusty shop was quite disgusting, and it also required courage to swallow Rachel’s hard-won sponge-cake. But the symbolism of a birthday cake obviously mattered more to her than the taste. When she had retired we washed that taste away with rum and coke, an unlikely mixture to which I have become mildly addicted for lack of anything better.",

How much that poor boy must have suffered from her own exiguousness, and her marked avoidance of letting him come too close--no closer, in fact, than sometimes, before her illness, when there was still enough of it, being allowed to touch her hair. This little plump thing, bursting with young ripeness through her jumper, was real substantial flesh and blood, intensely alive, almost audibly crackling with vigour; and Fanny, looking at her, felt as if her own bones were hardly covered enough for decency, and that she was nothing but a pale ghost wandered from the rapidly cooling past, strayed into a richly warm generation to which she in no way belonged. Nor did she, confronted by the girl's abounding youth, even resent being taken for Dwight's mother. She easily might have been his mother. It would be the natural conclusion for that evidently lively young brain to come to. Besides, she was too completely sorry for him, standing there defenceless, all his fine words and eloquence silenced, to resent anything.",

It was far worse than the usual, mildly irritating discomfort one expected: it called to mind the total chaos of the Partition trains. It wasn’t a matter of finding a seat, that was a hopelessly optimistic dream. Nor was there any point in fantasizing about snuggling up in that last unused bit of luggage rack. On this occasion one simply hoped to get onto the train. Already the corridors, loos, doorways and running board were all packed.

A ragged pile of firewood looks exactly as though it is sitting on top of one of the ledges. I felt I could climb the painted ladders and walk from one home to the next.

Some were seeking the shade of the walls and under the trees of the Alameda. Horsemen spurred through, shouting; groups of sombreros set level on heads against the vertical sun were drifting away into the streets, where the open doors of pulperias revealed an enticing gloom resounding with the gentle tinkling of guitars. The National Guards were thinking of siesta, and the eloquence of Gamacho, their chief, was exhausted. Later on, when, in the cooler hours of the afternoon, they tried to assemble again for further consideration of public affairs, detachments of Montero’s cavalry camped on the Alameda charged them without parley, at speed, with long lances levelled at their flying backs as far as the ends of the streets. The National Guards of Sulaco were surprised by this proceeding. But they were not indignant. No Costaguanero had ever learned to question the eccentricities of a military force. They were part of the natural order of things. This must be, they concluded, some kind of administrative measure, no doubt. But the motive of it escaped their unaided intelligence, and their chief and orator, Gamacho, Commandante of the National Guard, was lying drunk and asleep in the bosom of his family. His bare feet were upturned in the shadows repulsively, in the manner of a corpse. His eloquent mouth had dropped open. His youngest daughter, scratching her head with one hand, with the other waved a green bough over his scorched and peeling face.",

He delegated soldiers to administer the great haciendas which he had confiscated. He manned the slaughter-house with soldiers, and sold Terrazzas’s beef to the people for the government. A thousand of them he put in the streets of the city as civil police, prohibiting on pain of death stealing, or the sale of liquor to the army. A soldier who got drunk was shot. He even tried to run the brewery with soldiers, but failed because he couldn’t find an expert maltster. \"The only thing to do with soldiers in time of peace,\" said Villa, \"is to put them to work. An idle soldier is always thinking of war.\"",

She walked slowly down the passage, running her hand along the wall beside her. She did not think which way she was going, and therefore walked down a passage which only led to a window and a balcony. She looked down at the kitchen premises, the wrong side of hotel life, which was cut off from the right side by a maze of small bushes. The ground was bare, old tins were scattered about, and the bushes wore towels and aprons upon their heads to dry. Every now and then a waiter came out in a white apron and threw rubbish on to a heap. Two large women in cotton dresses were sitting on a bench with blood-smeared tin trays in front of them and yellow bodies across their knees. They were plucking the birds, and talking as they plucked. Suddenly a chicken came floundering, half flying, half running into the space, pursued by a third woman whose age could hardly be under eighty. Although wizened and unsteady on her legs she kept up the chase, egged on by the laughter of the others; her face was expressive of furious rage, and as she ran she swore in Spanish. Frightened by hand-clapping here, a napkin there, the bird ran this way and that in sharp angles, and finally fluttered straight at the old woman, who opened her scanty grey skirts to enclose it, dropped upon it in a bundle, and then holding it out cut its head off with an expression of vindictive energy and triumph combined. The blood and the ugly wriggling fascinated Rachel, so that although she knew that someone had come up behind and was standing beside her, she did not turn round until the old woman had settled down on the bench beside the others. Then she looked up sharply, because of the ugliness of what she had seen. It was Miss Allan who stood beside her.",

I never felt precisely “placed.” Unlike Rome or London, each of which is a collection of distinct villages, Milan has neither the sense of a hub or heart from which spokes or arteries extend nor that of a patchwork quilt. This is so in spite of the fact that Milan consists of a series of concentric circles, which may conform to the lost imperial city. Concentric circles, like whirling rose windows of cathedrals, reflect the idea that the universe moves and is moved by God, and that the movement is circular and cyclical: “Day turns into night and season into season,” Georges Duby writes, “and all types of biological growth followed cyclical patterns, and their periodic repetitions had to be taken as signs of eternity.” For the walker in Milan, however, it seems merely perversity that one may get to one's destination by walking either to one's left or to one's right. No set of directions is ever issued the same way twice. No one, except for those who live in a vaguely bohemian quarter, the Brera, which looks quite French, ever says I live in such and such a neighborhood. People live in the vicinity of museums or in the vicinity of publishing houses or near the fashionable shopping streets, but one hears little of neighborhoods. . . . What happens to the concept of neighborliness when the concept of neighborhoods is eroded is an interesting question.",

Durham, indeed, was beginning to find that one of the charms of a sophisticated society is that it lends point and perspective to the slightest contact between the sexes. If, in the old unrestricted New York days, Fanny Frisbee, from a brown stone doorstep, had proposed that they should take a walk in the Park, the idea would have presented itself to her companion as agreeable but unimportant; whereas Fanny de Malrive’s suggestion that they should stroll across the Tuileries was obviously fraught with unspecified possibilities.",

The former was to be a New Delhi, the latter a new Simla, created out of the British subsidies which Amanullah’s father, Habibullah, accumulated year by year but never spent. Dar-al-Aman is joined to Kabul by one of the most beautiful avenues in the world, four miles long, dead straight, as broad as the Great West Road, and lined with tall white-stemmed poplars. In front of the poplars run streams confined by grass margins. Behind them are shady footwalks and a tangle of yellow and white roses, now in full flower and richly scented. And then at the end, O God, appears the turreted angle—not even the front—of a French municipal office, surrounded by a French municipal garden and entirely deserted. While below it, occupying the very centre of the whole four-mile vista, stands a German match factory in the ferro-concrete-farmhouse style.",

Slowly, over the course of weeks, then months, then years, he tracked down the stories of all sixty-eight people who had boarded the tug. Sometimes La Flaca went with him, riding sidesaddle on the bicycle frame. He gathered photographs of all those who had drowned and managed to get some details from their families so they would be remembered as more than just names. He found out that the youngest victim, Hellen Martínez Enríquez, who was six days shy of six months old when she drowned, had dark eyes like her father and a white birthmark on her thigh. The oldest, Manuel Cayol, was a retired steel worker whose adult children were already living in the United States when he boarded the 13 de Marzo.",

He wrote, Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. But although they espoused living in nature, at heart they were both city boys. Despite living in a cabin in the woods, Thoreau still took regular walks into town to visit his mother, who did his laundry for him. Muir, on the other hand, embodied the true transcendental ideal. He took long rambling journeys through the mountains, sometimes for days, with just a tin cup, a handful of tea, a loaf of bread, and a copy of Emerson. In fact, years later Emerson traveled to Yosemite to meet Muir. Some scholars even describe Muir’s writing as Natural Theology. As Muir wrote, Nature came straight from the hand of God, uncorrupted by civilization and domestication.”",

Sometimes it was his life with Mag, his young man’s hopes of comfort, love, and quiet peace that now had come to naught but bitterness and hate. Again his mind went groping back to older, deeper-buried sorrows. And on this day as they stood there, his mind went back, and, turning now to George and to the wind that howled there in his face, he suddenly brought forth and hurled down from that mountain top the acid of an ancient rancor, denouncing now the memory of old Fate, his father. He told his hatred and his loathing of his father’s life, the deathless misery of his own youth, which lived for him again in all its anguish even after fifty years had passed.",

Most of the spruce in this country look like pipe cleaners. The better ones look like bottle washers. Tough they may be, but they are on the edge of their world, and their trunks can grow fifty years and be scarcely an inch through. Yet here is a stand of trees a foot thick. A specimen nearly two. Pourchot says he will write in his report that there is one tree of such girth. “Otherwise, the Forest Service might think there’s timber here.”",

I found an unoccupied bunk on the upper level, shook as many fleas and lice as possible from the soiled mattress, and spread out my sleeping bag. Against the near wall was a small iron stove that supplied heat by burning dried yak dung. After sunset the temperature dropped well below freezing, and porters flocked in from the cruel night to warm themselves around the stove. Because dung burns poorly under the best of circumstances, and especially so in the oxygen-depleted air of 16,200 feet, the lodge filled with dense, acrid smoke, as if the exhaust from a diesel bus were being piped directly into the room. Twice during the night, coughing uncontrollably, I had to flee outside for air. By morning my eyes were burning and bloodshot, my nostrils were clogged with black soot, and I’d developed a dry, persistent hack that would stay with me until the end of the expedition.",

    "target_paragraph": "After having written so far, Don Martin Decoud, the exotic dandy of the Parisian boulevard, got up and walked across the sanded floor of the café at one end of the Albergo of United Italy, kept by Giorgio Viola, the old companion of Garibaldi. The highly coloured lithograph of the Faithful Hero seemed to look dimly, in the light of one candle, at the man with no faith in anything except the truth of his own sensations. Looking out of the window, Decoud was met by a darkness so impenetrable that he could see neither the mountains nor the town, nor yet the buildings near the harbour; and there was not a sound, as if the tremendous obscurity of the Placid Gulf, spreading from the waters over the land, had made it dumb as well as blind. Presently Decoud felt a light tremor of the floor and a distant clank of iron. A bright white light appeared, deep in the darkness, growing bigger with a thundering noise. The rolling stock usually kept on the sidings in Rincon was being run back to the yards for safe keeping. Like a mysterious stirring of the darkness behind the headlight of the engine, the train passed in a gust of hollow uproar, by the end of the house, which seemed to vibrate all over in response. And nothing was clearly visible but, on the end of the last flat car, a negro, in white trousers and naked to the waist, swinging a blazing torch basket incessantly with a circular movement of his bare arm. Decoud did not stir.",

In addition to being unable to identify any landmarks, knee-deep water on top of ice kept forcing McKinlay to make circuitous detours, further confusing him. He could make out steep cliffs on his left, so he knew that he must be somewhere along the eastern coastline, but the cliffs were too steep to climb. His route had taken him farther east than he wished to go, somewhere out on the ice. He thought that the water he’d encountered might be from river runoff where it met the sea near Skeleton Island, but he could not believe he’d traveled that far yet. He’d lost all sense of time and direction, and panic overtook him.",

There is a ruined shrine with a fallen idol on its summit, and it is called Tom-tom Hill because a drum used to be beaten there years ago to assemble the people or to notify them of certain times and events. From the backyard of my house the stony slope mounts steadily up to a pretty white temple in its cluster of cypresses. The temple is dedicated to Hanuman, the Monkey-headed God of Physical Power, and the worshippers are often to be seen and heard on its terrace; but I have not yet found courage to enter it, being still ignorant of customs and observances, and afraid of making mistakes. Indeed I have never even ventured close to it, but, at a discreet distance, have always dropped down the western slope of the ridge, and clambered round through the brambles beneath its walls and up again on the other side. As a matter of fact, this also is the only way of getting on, for the temple occupies the whole breadth of the ridge’s back and cannot be otherwise passed. It overlooks the town and is reached from that side by means of a long straight staircase of wooden steps which runs steeply up the eastern slope from the Rajgarh-Deori road.",
