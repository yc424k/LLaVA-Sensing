In fact, for a moment her face glowed with its look of former tenderness, but it grew grim again very quickly as she went on: \"But 'im! Not 'im!\" She was deeply stirred by this imagined threat to the ascendancy of her idol. Her lips worked tremulously, then she shook her head with a quick movement of inflexible denial and said: \"Not 'im.\" She was silent for a moment more, as if a struggle were going on between her desire to speak and the cool barrier of her natural reserve. Then she burst out: \"I tell you, sir, I never liked the look of 'im! Not that one--no!\" She shook her head again in a half-convulsive movement; then, in a tone of dark confidingness, she almost whispered: \"There's somethin' sly about 'is face that I don't like! 'E's a sly one, 'e is, but 'e don't fool me!\" Her face was now deeply flushed, and she nodded her head with the air of a person who had uttered her grim and final judgment and would not budge from it. \"That's my opinion, if you ask me, sir! That's the way I've always felt about 'im. And 'er. 'Er! She wouldn't like it, would she? Not 'arf she wouldn't!\" She laughed suddenly, the bitter and falsetto laugh of an angry woman. \"Not 'er! Why, it's plain as clay, it's written all over 'er! But a lot of good it'll do 'em,\" she said grimly. \"We know what's what!\" She shook her head again with grim decision. \"The people know. They can't be fooled. So let 'em git along with it!\"",

The sun flames red and bloody as it sets, there are old red glintings on the battered pails, the great barn gets the ancient light as the boy slops homeward with warm foaming milk. Great shadows lengthen in the fields, the old red light dies swiftly, and the sunset barking of the hounds is faint and far and full of frost: there are shrewd whistles to the dogs, and frost and silence – this is all. Wind stirs and scuffs and rattles up the old brown leaves, and through the night the great oak leaves keep falling.",

It was at this time that the Gema’a al-Islamiyya first began making the headlines with a series of murderous attacks: in April, the fourteen Coptic Christians massacred for refusing to pay protection money; in June, the same group shot down Dr Farag Foda, a secular writer who had dared to condemn the movement in print. At the same time hit-and-run attacks on foreign tour-groups began in earnest, killing eight and wounding nearly a hundred tourists. The following year, in the summer of 1993, the Islamic militants began a series of assassination attempts against the Prime Minister and two other prominent government ministers, all three of whom were wounded. In November the militants hatched a plot – uncovered in advance by the security forces – to blow up Mubarak himself.",

He did not move. It was as though he had been expecting it, waiting for it; had lain down and composed and emptied himself, not for sleep but to gather strength and will as distance runners and swimmers do, before assuming the phase of harried and furious endeavor which his life was about to enter, lying there for perhaps ten minutes while the long cries rang up from the dark bottom, as if he knew that those ten minutes were to be the last of peace. Then he rose. Still in the dark, he put on the still-damp shirt and the shoes he had just washed and from a nail behind the door he took down the new plowline still looped in the coils in which his cousin, Varner’s clerk, had knotted it two weeks ago, and left the house.",

I would never have considered a ten-day date with my mind in Australia, but here, I have the time, the need and the desire to remove the blockages of the past and find a new way of living.",

Through all these years he lived on the edge of uncertainty, never knowing his fate, with periods of relative calm inevitably broken by spasms of violence. In 1985, the FARC kidnapped his uncle, his mother’s brother, Eduardo Alzate García, then governor of Tolima. Eduardo was held naked and barefoot in the jungle for a month, threatened with death every day, then finally released, only to die days later a broken man, a victim of physical and psychological torture. Then came the ELN (National Liberation Army), a rival guerrilla force heavily influenced by Cuba and liberation theology, and by reputation much more doctrinaire and rigidly Marxist than the FARC. As far as Héctor was concerned, one Communist bandit was the same as the next, though he knew it was the ELN that established camps on the ridge above the farm. For several months the guerrillas sowed the forest with defensive rings of antipersonnel mines, which were simply abandoned when, harassed by the Colombian air force, the outlaw army eventually moved on.",

At every group we passed, Ron slowed with the window down and said “G’day” and asked if they had everything they needed in the way of information. They always did, but it seemed an unusually welcoming gesture.",

Of course, sinful places never look their best in daylight. I remember thinking even in Las Vegas that it all looked rather endearingly pathetic when viewed over a cup of coffee and a doughnut. All that noise and electric energy that is loosed at dusk vanishes with the desert sun and it all suddenly seems as thin and one-dimensional as a film set. But even allowing for this, the Reeperbahn looked tame stuff, especially after Amsterdam. I had envisioned it as a narrow, pedestrianized street packed on both sides with bars, sex shops, peep shows, strip clubs and all the other things a sailor needs to revive a salty dick, but this was almost a normal city street, busy with traffic flowing between the western suburbs and the downtown. There was a fair sprinkling of seamy joints, but also a lot of more or less normal establishments ? restaurants, coffee shops, souvenir stores, jeans shops, even a furniture store and a theatre showing the inescapable Cats. Almost the only thing that told you this was a neighbourhood of dim repute was the hard look on the people’s faces. They all had that gaunt, washed-out look of people who run funfair stalls.",

They had looked like a bunch of doughnuts, I told her, thrown onto a sea-blue baking sheet. She listened to my stories and smiled and then asked me to do some Christmas shopping for Nina, Tony and Jade. Nina came down from college, we bought a Christmas tree and decorated it in the living area of the studio. Every day, her nurse did her hair, and she insisted on sitting up for every guest, always intent on being a lady.",

He would decide with a toss of a coin on the morning of the flight. Acosta stared at him in disbelief for a long moment, then crossed the airfield and joined the Byrd team.

And because bad things always come in bunches, my mother had been hospitalised for an emergency operation for a tumour. Stunned with angst, the three of us sat in the dark apartment, waiting to find out what kind of tumour it was (benign), and to hear back from the British Home Office (the answer was No). My father, still working as a professor but with a salary made nonsensical by mega-inflation, sat in the cold kitchen filling in emigration papers. He hadn’t shaved for days, and his hair had gone grey overnight. While things unravelled in slow motion, my younger sister kept a low profile and quietly did her homework in candlelight, while I simply stopped eating in protest.",

No matter what occasion, what crisis, the women I grew up among could flat out hold forth in the kitchen, from delicate timbales and pressed chicken to steaming cauldrons of Brunswick stew. In summer, my mother and our cook, Willie Bell, went into marathons of putting up tomatoes, pickling cucumbers, stirring vats of scuppernongs for jelly. By early December they had made brandied cakes and shelled mountains of pecans for roasting. Never was our kitchen without tins of brownies and icebox cookies. Or without a plate of cold biscuits left over from dinner. I still miss toasted biscuits for breakfast. At one meal we already were talking about the next.",

The impressionable peasant leads a larger, fuller, more dramatic life than the pachydermatous king. Looking at it thus he found that life was to be seen of the same magnitude here as elsewhere.",

You sprawl face down on a sloping pavement of gneiss, pressed to the rock by the weight of your pack, and lie there for some minutes, reflecting in a distant, out-of-body way that you have never before looked this closely at lichen, not in fact looked this closely at anything in the natural world since you were four years old and had your first magnifying glass. Finally, with a weary puff, you roll over, unhook yourself from your pack, struggle to your feet, and realize—again in a remote, light-headed, curiously not-there way—that the view is sensational: a boundless vista of wooded mountains, unmarked by human hand, marching off in every direction. This really could be heaven. It’s splendid, no question, but the thought you cannot escape is that you have to walk this view, and this is the barest fraction of what you will traverse before you’ve finished.",

His days are mainly composed of a million idiot, repetitions--in goings and comings along hot streets, in sweatings and freezings, in the senseless accumulation of fruitless tasks, in decaying and being patched, in grinding out his life so that he may buy bad food, in eating bad food so that he may grind his life out in distressful defecations. He is the dweller in that ruined tenement who, from one moment's breathing to another, can hardly forget the bitter weight of his uneasy flesh, the thousand diseases and distresses of his body, the growing incubus of his corruption. This is man, who, if he can remember ten golden moments of joy and happiness out of all his years, ten moments unmarked by care, unseamed by aches or itches, has power to lift himself with his expiring breath and say: \"I have lived upon this earth and known glory!\"",

Men with bath towels around their waists and stout unlaced boots over bare feet hurried from showers to barracks; others moved briskly between the buildings, wearing regulation Army trousers scissored into frayed shorts, khaki topees and the same flapping boots. Nobody stepped off the duckboards. They appeared absurdly young, high-school age, and more absurdly cheerful. By rights they should have been suicidal. Chiggers, sunblindness, and heat-stroke. Not one tree. Not an inch of shade anywhere.",

On top of queasiness, now I would burn a painful tomato red, blister and peel, the new skin all set to burn again. “Noice umbrella too,” George said, with sympathy. Deep in a slough of self-pity, I told myself that the drowned umbrella was too much. Why, why, since I worship the sun hadn’t I been born with the right skin?

It was tender but there was no swelling that I could see. I made hot compresses but did not know what else I could do. Was it a broken bone, a torn ligament, what? The point was that Dookie could not walk. He sat in the creekbed, miserable, and refused to move. I cut him feed and brought it to him and massaged the shoulder again. I hugged him, fussed over him, and all the while I felt sick and tired and beaten. A thought was invading me which I tried to keep away. That I might have to shoot my boy, that the trip might be ended, that it was all just a stupid pathetic joke. I was glad Richard was there.",

We passed through slatternly villages, each adorned with a triumphal arch for us and a duck pond with malaria for them. No one had ever seen any white foreign devils before. The children either screamed in excitement or sobbed in fear. The adults were stony-faced, exhausted by life, and also marred and scarred by unimaginable diseases. “If only our noses don’t drop off,” U.C. murmured, after seeing one more peasant with a little red hole in a ravaged face.",
