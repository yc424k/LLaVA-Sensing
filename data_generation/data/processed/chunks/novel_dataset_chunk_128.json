Although I knew the monastery to be bursting with new recruits, the echoing monastic quiet conspired to make St Antony’s feel strangely deserted: after the bustle and noise of Alexandria and Cairo, here one could hear every shutter creak as it was blown in the wind, every snatch of whispered monastic dialogue echoing around the ancient mud walls.",

It follows the Glenmore River, which winds sinuously through a large marshland. In the far distance is Knoydart and Ladhar Bheinn. On my right is Skye. This is another world. But what is that three story stone building doing here? A small pedestrian bridge crosses the river and heads towards the stone building but the extent of the marsh and the weight of my bike argue against this shortcut. Instead, I circumnavigate the marshland and end up at the Glenelg & Arnisdale Community Hall where I learn that the stone buildings (there are multiples) are the Bernera Barracks. The English built them between 1717 and 1723 to house the force that would police the Jacobite sympathisers who lived here, pretty much everyone. The barracks are ugly and, as I am becoming a Scotophile, insulting to my new cultural sensibilities. I give them a miss.",

There were several people on the platform, all studiously avoiding each other’s gazes and standing, I do believe, on the same spot on which they stood every morning. I am pretty certain of this because, as I was standing there minding my own business, a man in a suit arrived and looked at first surprised and then annoyed to find me occupying what was evidently his square yard of platform. He took a position a few feet away and regarded me with an expression not a million miles from hate. How easy it is sometimes, I thought, to make enemies in Britain. All you have to do is stand in the wrong spot or turn your car around in their driveways—this guy had NO TURNING written all over him—or inadvertently take their seats on a train, and they will quietly hate you to the grave. Eventually a two-carriage Sprinter train came in and we all shuffled aboard. Sprinters really are the most comfortless, utilitarian, deeply unlovely trains, with their hard-edged seats, their mystifyingly simultaneous hot and cold drafts, their harsh lighting, and, above all, their noxious interior design based on orange stripes and hopelessly jaunty chevrons. Why would anyone think that train passengers would like to be surrounded by a lot of orange, particularly first thing in the morning? I longed for one of those old-style trains that you found when I first came to Britain, the ones that had no corridors but consisted of just a series of self-contained compartments, each with a pair of lushly padded facing banquette seats and a door at either end but no communication with the neighboring compartments. There was always a frisson of uncertainty and excitement as you boarded—rather like on those television game shows where the contestants have to say, “I think I’ll try door number three, Barry”—because you never knew what you would find on the other side. There was something pleasingly intimate and random in sitting in such close proximity with total strangers. You got to know things about them—their tastes in reading, their capacity for dealing with tedium, whether they slept with their mouths open—that perhaps not even their closest acquaintances knew, and then their stops would arrive and they would get off and you would never see them again.",

He gave me a cheerful greeting and, without asking why I had come or what I wanted, picked up a pair of khaki trousers that had been tossed onto one of the overstuffed chairs and asked me to sit down. He set the trousers on another chair, and he apologized for being in the middle of his breakfast, explaining that he seldom drank much but the night before he had had a few drinks and this had caused his day to start slowly. “I don’t know what’s the matter with me, but there’s got to be something the matter with me, because drink don’t agree with me anymore,” he said. He had a raw onion in one hand, and while he talked he shaved slices from the onion and ate them between bites of the chop. He was a muscular and well-built man, with short, bristly white hair, and he had bright, fast-moving eyes in a wide-open face. His legs were trim and strong, with large muscles in the calves. I guessed that he was about sixty, and for a man of sixty he seemed to be in remarkably good shape. He was actually seventy-nine. “My rule is: Never eat except when you’re hungry,” he said, and he ate another slice of the onion.",

The segments can be cut into strips and hung up to dry. The muscle fibers run the length of the fish and become more tendinous at the tail. The tastiest and most tender steaks are cut from the back, above the lateral line, and closest to the head. A couple of steaks for immediate consumption may be cut from section A across the muscle fibers. All others must be cut lengthwise so they can be hung without falling apart. The organ cavity ends at about mid-section. Aft of this, sticks can be cut below the lateral line as well as above it. In the cross section, the backbone and the bones that support the fin divide the body into quadrants, which are cut off of the bones before the flesh is sliced into sticks. A small amount of fat is found in belly steaks and in the meat attached to the pelvic and pectoral fins; I call this my fried chicken. A steak can be cut from the side of the head. The eyes with their associated muscles and fatty fluids provide moisture. The eyes, small bits of meat scraped off the head, organs, and a couple of steaks provide the first meal. The backbone, ribs lining the organ cavity, and fins are saved along with the fish sticks for later meals.",

The musicians were still playing on the terrace, they were tired out and almost falling asleep over their instruments, but when I entered the sala there remained only one couple—my aunt and Mr Visconti. I was reminded of the house behind the Messaggero where they had met after a long separation and danced together between the sofas while the prostitutes watched with amazement. They were dancing a slow waltz now and they never saw me enter, two old people bound in the deep incurable egotism of passion. They had turned off the lights, and in the big room illumined only from the terrace there rested pools of darkness between the windows. As they moved I lost their faces and found them again. At one moment the shadows gave my aunt a deceptive air of youth: she looked like the young woman in my father’s photograph pregnant with happiness, and at another I recognized the old woman who had faced Miss Paterson with such merciless cruelty and jealousy.",

Adele Anthony was working eight or nine hours a day in a Depot which distributed food and clothing to refugees from the invaded provinces; and Mrs. Brant’s name figured on the committees of most of the newly-organized war charities. Among Campton’s other friends many had accepted humbler tasks. Some devoted their time to listing and packing hospital supplies, keeping accounts in ambulance offices, sorting out refugees at the railway-stations, and telling them where to go for food and help; still others spent their days, and sometimes their nights, at the bitter-cold suburban sidings where the long train-loads of wounded stopped on the way to the hospitals of the interior. There was enough misery and confusion at the rear for every civilian volunteer to find his task.",

He said that every intelligent Indian naturally desired peace, solidarity, and social reform, and that progress was being made; but it was inevitably difficult and slow. I asked him for instances of this progress?any evidence to show the least sign of reconciliation between Mohammedans and Hindoos, and he replied that a Hindoo was now able to receive betel from the hands of a Mohammedan. That was certainly something, I said, but that it seemed to me that he, as an intelligent man in pursuit of truth, should be giving active support to the movement, not necessarily in public, but quietly at home, where charity begins. He might, for instance, in this very affair of his tonga-wallah, have given a lead, by drinking himself, let us say, from the contaminated vessel? Had not the Dewan eaten an egg?",

In contemporary society, it’s as if you’re a Yanomami warrior in the Amazons. Napoleon Chagnon lived with them off and on for years and his statistics are irrefutable. If you’re manically brave, if you’ve killed people in the constant low-level group-to-group warfare in the jungle, even if you die at twenty-five, when your reactions aren’t quite as fast as they used to be, when you’re coming of age and losing your ruthless edge, when you’ll probably be picked up by someone else’s 6-foot-long arrow and pinned back-to-trunk against a tree—even so you’ll leave six times more offspring than an ordinary husband. Because the women in the shabono, the oval, communal, stockaded, open-centred dwelling place, like a theatre—they listen very carefully to the returning hunter-warriors’ tales around the home fires. And then guess what? For the next warrior-resting week they whip the current alpha male off behind a bush and collect his sperm, fast, when no one’s looking!”",

(In the travel magazine business, this pennypinching personality was referred to, without affection, as the dirtbagger.) After initially showing skepticism at John’s application to work as a driver-cum-guide, Encounter offered him an apprenticeship. “I sold my car, had a great big booze-up, burned my bed. I had thirty or forty thousand dollars and put it all into investments that my tax man recommended. I flew out on Tuesday. Friday was Black Friday in the stock market. I lost half my money. I got the news in London, where I was sleeping on the oil-stained floor of an unheated workshop and earning thirteen pounds a week.”",

The final score was one all. Then the Police prepared to give a display of Balti folk-dancing, whereupon the spectators became much more enthusiastic and swarmed on to the pitch to form three sides of a square. Our chairs formed the fourth side and the band sat opposite us on the ground – two drummers and a flautist. The dancers emerged from the crowd in groups of two, three or four and were amusing enough but not outstanding, apart from one pair of elderly men who engaged in a mock duel with wooden swords. Two dances struck me as very Tibetan and I discovered these were specialities of the Khapalu area. All the performances were accompanied by the crowd’s rhythmic clapping and I have never before seen the Skarduites in such a lighthearted mood.",
