You’ll have to wait, she was told again and again. “By the time we get the wheelchair, my mother could be dead,” she told the government office. When she quit her job as a Coraza security guard to care for her parents, Lili went to the local office of the Ministry of Work and Social Security looking for help, but the response she got was insulting. The government worker at the office asked her if she’d ever considered taking out a self-employed worker’s license to sell candy or duro frío—homemade popsicles made with condensed milk—from the doorway of her home the way some people did.",

The ruin was Dan and Josephine Doody’s homestead, built along Burlington Northern’s Empire Builder train line before Highway 2 went in. Dan was a one of the first rangers in the park (fired later for poaching) and Josephine was a moonshiner and a “hostess” long after her husband’s death. Approaching the structure from the forested trail, you can’t see it until you’re almost in it: two stories high and rotten, a staircase topping out to a punched-through upper floor. Rusted bedsprings and tin cans with antique labels, a collapsing double-seater outhouse visible through a glassless window. You don’t even have to close your eyes to imagine miners and fishermen tipping back shots in the guestrooms, a curvy hooker doing the two-step with a top-hatted investor canvassing the Wild West. Mixed in with the present—gusty wind in the grass and the chip of red squirrels— there’s the past: twang of phantom honky-tonk, the smell of pork chops frying.",

The quayside lamps strung themselves into the distance beside the dark flow of the Waal and upstream a great iron bridge sailed northwards and away for miles beyond the river.

Another piece in the unlikely jigsaw linking the deserts of Coptic Egypt with the bleak snowfields of early medieval Scotland had fallen into place. I beamed at the Abbot, immensely pleased.",

The fact that the Ambroses had a house where one could escape momentarily from the slightly inhuman atmosphere of an hotel was a source of genuine pleasure not only to Hirst and Hewet, but to the Elliots, the Thornburys, the Flushings, Miss Allan, Evelyn M., together with other people whose identity was so little developed that the Ambroses did not discover that they possessed names. By degrees there was established a kind of correspondence between the two houses, the big and the small, so that at most hours of the day one house could guess what was going on in the other, and the words ‘the villa’ and ‘the hotel’ called up the idea of two separate systems of life. Acquaintances showed signs of developing into friends, for that one tie to Mrs Parry’s drawing-room had inevitably split into many other ties attached to different parts of England, and sometimes these alliances seemed cynically fragile, and sometimes painfully acute, lacking as they did the supporting background of organized English life. One night when the moon was round between the trees, Evelyn M. told Helen the story of her life, and claimed her everlasting friendship; on another occasion, merely because of a sigh, or a pause, or a word thoughtlessly dropped, poor Mrs Elliot left the villa half in tears, vowing never again to meet the cold and scornful woman who had insulted her, and in truth, meet again they never did. It did not seem worth while to piece together so slight a friendship.",

    "target_paragraph": "Belize had few restrictions on the foreign boats that cruised its waters, but their crews were a different matter. We had been issued standard tourist visas upon entry and were required to extend them every thirty days, for a maximum of ninety days, whereupon we would be obligated to leave the country, at least temporarily. The problem was that the only place where visas could be extended was at the main office of the Department of Immigration in Belize City. Cruisers detested this policy because so many of the best anchorages were far from the city, and there was no grace period beyond thirty days. Throw in an allowance for bad traveling weather, and it put sailors on a short leash. There were no protected anchorages near the city and there was a crime problem in the surrounding area. Though the outlying cays and atolls were quite safe, anchoring off the Fort George Hotel or near the mouth of Haulover Creek virtually guaranteed that your dinghy would be stolen when you left it tied up to go ashore. Locks were no deterrent. The boarding of anchored yachts by thieves was not especially uncommon near the city, either.",

The platform looked towards miles of hills tinged green with copper deposit. Nothing much had happened in the hills since the Inca arrived, led by Topa Inca, in the second half of the fifteenth century. They got about half way down the country, and conquered the Aymára, and probably other groups, but although they exacted tribute and influenced most of the northern and central tribes, their power was limited, and their impact on the subsequent development of the land and people minimal.",

I looked up at the ridgeline and thought of my descent into town in June 2003. I remembered how—far above the street where I now stood—I’d smelled the sweet scent of cut grass and headiness of flowering plants. I could vividly remember the deafening buzz of cicadas filling the trees, their sound nearly overwhelming that of the lawn mowers. It was the moment spring ended and summer began. I recalled the pangs of homesickness that had stabbed me in the gut. Homesickness for summer Saturdays when my dad woke me up by revving the lawn mower promptly at 9 a.m. Homesickness for cookouts on the deck where he charred the venison black—but we ate it anyway without a word of complaint along with the hot, buttery corn on the cob from our garden.",

The sea was only a few hundred yards to the east, over a low rise of moor. A few miles to the north was the Sound of Jura where, during the changes of the tides, the great Corryvreckan Whirlpool sucked and spun. Orwell fished the sea, the lochs and the rivers, and on warm days he swam in the lochs and in the Sound itself. Inside the house, he kept a peat fire burning, and he lit his rooms with paraffin lamps whose flames quickly sooted up the walls.",

The roofs of the lonely village were only half a mile ahead, and she was resolved to push beyond it, and try to reach the Mountain that night. She had no clear plan of action, except that, once in the settlement, she meant to look for Liff Hyatt, and get him to take her to her mother. She herself had been born as her own baby was going to be born; and whatever her mother’s subsequent life had been, she could hardly help remembering the past, and receiving a daughter who was facing the trouble she had known.",

My backhand technique improved, though. Esoteric questions of rail unweighting that I had never considered were suddenly illuminated in the endless screaming run under the endlessly pitching lip. I began switching rails straight off the bottom turn, keeping my outside rail, my toe rail, down on the water even as I tracked up the face, thus staying ready to bank downward on an instant’s notice, and not letting the offshore breeze get under my board and blow me up higher than I wanted to be. My board went faster than I thought a board could go. I learned to relax, to a degree, in critical positions where my instincts shouted that it was time to brace for impact. Again, it seemed that, on this wave, that last-second moment could go on for a very, very long time.",

The French Hill bomb …’ (19 June 2002: 7 killed, 50 injured.) ‘The coincidence was eerie. Two weeks before, Ben actually saw from far away the Megiddo bus attack – 17 killed and 38 injured. He said to us then, “The dead are the lucky ones.” He didn’t know his own worth. Not fazed by eight years in a wheelchair, he’s busy every day teaching fellow-victims what IT can do for them.’ Limor marvelled, as well she might, at Israel’s extraordinarily rapid recovery from that hellish five-year suicide-bombing campaign. By October 2005, 975 Israelis (mostly civilians of all ages, going about their humdrum business) had been killed by Palestinians. And 3,695 Palestinians, mostly civilians of all ages also going about their daily affairs, had been killed by the IDF.",

We started to pick up some shipping traffic once we were back in the main channel. Canal tugs and an occasional container ship passed, headed in the opposite direction. The wind had started to fill in from the north so we rolled out the jib and gained enough speed to make our seven-knot reading seem a little more plausible. Soon, we entered the northwest end of Gaillard Cut. It was easy to see why the cut had caused so much grief during construction of the canal. The unstable composition of the earth here had caused numerous landslides that had resulted in long delays and much loss of life. Ultimately, the cut had to be redesigned and the slope angled at a much more shallow grade, resulting in the long cutback seen today. It meant that much more dirt had to be removed than had originally been planned for, but there was no other option.",

Unfortunately his seat was in the adjoining carriage, away from ours, which would make it difficult to shuffle people around. Scouring the numbers on the walls, I arrived at seat 41. It was occupied by a Sikh gentleman sitting cross-legged and picking at his foot. A mound of dead skin sat at the side of one heel and he looked up and fixed me with a pair of bloodshot eyes. An attempt at bartering would be futile. Harpal Singh, 61, was the last person in the world who would fancy sleeping top-and-tail with Ed and I doubted Ed would want to share his makeshift chiropody clinic.",

Gold-painted leather projections, like tongues of fire, protrude from her headdress. She wears white gloves with long fingernails, red-white-and-black striped pants, a white waistcloth, and a shirt sporting fringes of black hair. One can hardly imagine a more horrible-looking creature. She speaks in the ancient Javanese Kawi, with its peculiar whining tones, and between speeches she issues loud grunts. Her gestures and demeanor are threatening and hostile, and she periodically throws her head back and lets loose a great, shaking cry of laughter.",

Amid the melee of a shift change, I asked the way to Tuke Ward and arrived, hair askew and weaving slightly, ten minutes late. The charge nurse, a friendly fellow of early middle years, welcomed me warmly, told me where I’d find tea and biscuits and cleared off. I scarcely ever saw him after that. Tuke Ward was inhabited by long-stay male patients in a state of arrested insanity who, mercifully, seemed to look entirely after themselves. They fetched their own breakfasts from a wheeled cart, shaved themselves, made their own beds after a fashion, and, while I was momentarily engaged in a futile search for antacids in the staff loo, quietly departed. I emerged to find, to my confusion and alarm, that I was the only person left on the ward. I wandered puzzled through the day room, kitchen, and dormitories, and opened the ward door to find an empty corridor with a door to the world standing open at its far end. At that moment the phone in the ward office rang.",

Sure enough, there was Kuraluk, paddling along slowly, towing what was clearly a small walrus behind the kayak. “We danced with joy,” Chafe remembered of the moment. He went to the cook fire and set the bird bones aside. Auntie started fresh pots of water, and the others hustled down to the shoreline to meet Kuraluk. Soon he paddled up, beaming with pride. Though it was a young walrus, it weighed about seven hundred pounds and required all hands to haul it up a strip of grounded ice and onto shore, dragging it by its short tusks over the icy gravel bar. Kuraluk set to butchering it on the spot to avoid having to drag the heavy carcass any farther. He cut off the broad, oar-shaped front flippers, then the fan-shaped rear flippers. As Kuraluk sliced through the thick, brown, leathery skin, he paused to sharpen his skinning knife, remarking that it had taken five shots in the head to kill the animal.",

It took Columbus thirty days to make it around the cape, hence the name. Hence the name – Thanks and Goodbye. Having to head 300nm east meant that they needed northerly or northwesterly winds for the run, and that meant playing the fronts, which he knew was far from an exact science. Compounding the problem was that you would lose a day getting down the river to Livingston. With a day run to Livingston, a three day run to the cape and fronts coming every three days, the odds were that you would encounter the very blustery passage of one of them somewhere along the way. Another problem was that you couldn’t wait in Livingston for a weather window. It was an open roadstead. And, Tres Puntas wasn’t an option.",

The inhabitants of the city were turned out of the gates to starve in the countryside outside; and even after the city’s Hindus were allowed to return, Muslims remained banned for two whole years.

Shyly, I ask this fisherman where I should eat tonight, and I leave our conversation clutching yet another little piece of paper, directing me to a little restaurant with no name, where—as soon as I sit down that night—the waiter brings me airy clouds of ricotta sprinkled with pistachio, bread chunks floating in aromatic oils, tiny plates of sliced meats and olives, a salad of chilled oranges tossed in a dressing of raw onion and parsley. This is before I even hear about the calamari house specialty.",

That was where we were to end our march, though I didn’t know it then.

Now, as his eye goes down the print, what a procession tramps through the corridors of his brain, orderly, quick-stepping, and reinforced, as the march goes on, by fresh runnels, till the whole hall, dome, whatever one calls it, is populous with ideas. Such a muster takes place in no other brain. Yet sometimes there he’ll sit for hours together, gripping the arm of the chair, like a man holding fast because stranded, and then, just because his corn twinges, or it may be the gout, what execrations, and, dear me, to hear him talk of money, taking out his leather purse and grudging even the smallest silver coin, secretive and suspicious as an old peasant woman with all her lies. Strange paralysis and constriction—marvellous illumination. Serene over it all rides the great full brow, and sometimes asleep or in the quiet spaces of the night you might fancy that on a pillow of stone he lay triumphant.",

As the evening progressed I could sense the balance tipping in favour of the latter group, with older art-lovers bowing out and the youngsters becoming drunker. While the party in the atrium downstairs grew louder, the galleries upstairs got quieter. A minute passed and I was left almost alone with the Avercamp, accompanied only by a tall young man with a polar explorer’s beard and a black sweatshirt emblazoned ‘TOO DUMB FOR NEW YORK, TOO UGLY FOR AMSTERDAM’. He had his flies undone; I wasn’t sure whether it was by accident or was a new fashion I hadn’t heard of yet. We stared silently at the painting together for a few seconds, and then wordlessly went our separate ways.",
