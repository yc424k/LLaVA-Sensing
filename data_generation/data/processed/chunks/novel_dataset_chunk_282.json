    "target_paragraph": "Dan was trying to get to Effie through a gap in the group formed by the Manistys and two young subalterns, Mark's friends. Each time he did it Mrs. Draper stopped him by moving somehow so as to fill the gap. He gave it up at last, to sit by himself at the bottom of the room, jammed into a corner between the chimney-piece and the rosewood cabinet, where he stared at Effie with hot, unhappy eyes.\nSupper. Mamma was worried about the supper. She would have liked to have given them a nicer one, but there wasn't enough money; besides, she was afraid of what Uncle Victor would think if they were extravagant. That was the worst of borrowing, Mark said; you couldn't spend so much afterwards. Still, there was enough wine yet in the cellar for fifty parties. You could see, now, some advantage in Papa's habit of never drinking any but the best wine and laying in a large stock of it while he could.\nMary noticed that Papa and Dan drank the most. Perhaps Dan drank more than Papa. The smell of wine was over all the supper, spoiling it, sending through her nerves a reminiscent shiver of disgust.\nMark brought her back into the dining-room for the ice she hadn't had. Dan was there, by himself, sitting in the place Effie had just left. Effie's glass had still some wine in it. You could see him look for the wet side of the rim and suck the drops that had touched her mouth. Something small and white was on the floor beside him. Effie's pocket-handkerchief. He stooped for it. You could hear him breathing up the scent on it with big, sighing sobs.\nThey slunk back into the drawing-room.\nMark asked her to play something.\n\"Make a noise, Minky. Perhaps they'll go.\"\n\"The Hungarian March.\" She could play it better than Mamma. Mamma never could see that the bass might be even more important than the treble. She was glad that she could play it better than Mamma, and she hated herself for being glad.\nMark stood by the piano and looked at her as she played. They talked under cover of the \"Droom—Droom—Droom-era-room.\"\n\"Mark, am I looking too awful?\"\n\"No. Pretty Minx. Very pretty Minx.\"\n\"We mustn't, Mark. They'll hear us. They'll think us idiots.\"\n\"I don't care if they do. Don't you wish they'd go? Clever Minx. Clever paws.\"\nMamma passed and looked at them. Her face shrank and sharpened under the dropped wing of her hair. She must have heard what Mark said. She hated it when Mark talked and looked like that. She hated it when you played her music.\nBeethoven, then. The \"Sonata Eroica\" was bound up with \"Violetta,\" the\n\"Guards\" and \"Mabel\" Waltzes and the \"Pluie des Perles.\"",

    "target_paragraph": "Katharine turned the ring round once more, and gave it back to her aunt without speaking. And while she turned it round her lips set themselves firmly together, and it seemed to her that she could satisfy William as these women had satisfied their husbands; she could pretend to like emeralds when she preferred diamonds. Having replaced her ring, Lady Otway remarked that it was chilly, though not more so than one must expect at this time of year. Indeed, one ought to be thankful to see the sun at all, and she advised them both to dress warmly for their drive. Her aunt’s stock of commonplaces, Katharine sometimes suspected, had been laid in on purpose to fill silences with, and had little to do with her private thoughts. But at this moment they seemed terribly in keeping with her own conclusions, so that she took up her knitting again and listened, chiefly with a view to confirming herself in the belief that to be engaged to marry someone with whom you are not in love is an inevitable step in a world where the existence of passion is only a traveller’s story brought from the heart of deep forests and told so rarely that wise people doubt whether the story can be true. She did her best to listen to her mother asking for news of John, and to her aunt replying with the authentic history of Hilda’s engagement to an officer in the Indian Army, but she cast her mind alternately towards forest paths and starry blossoms, and towards pages of neatly written mathematical signs. When her mind took this turn her marriage seemed no more than an archway through which it was necessary to pass in order to have her desire. At such times the current of her nature ran in its deep narrow channel with great force and with an alarming lack of consideration for the feelings of others. Just as the two elder ladies had finished their survey of the family prospects, and Lady Otway was nervously anticipating some general statement as to life and death from her sister-in-law, Cassandra burst into the room with the news that the carriage was at the door.",

The clouds, warm now, sun-spotted, sweep over the hills, leaving gold in the water, and gold on the necks of the swans. Pushing one foot before the other, the cows munch their way across the field. I feel through the grass for the white-domed mushroom; and break its stalk and pick the purple orchid that grows beside it and lay the orchid by the mushroom with the earth at its root, and so home to make the kettle boil for my father among the just reddened roses on the tea-table.",

And guess what? There were no grounds—just acres and acres of parking lot, stretching away to an unseen horizon like a great inland sea. A couple of hundred yards away was the perimeter fence of the Opryland Amusement Park, but there was no foot access to the park from the hotel. The only way of getting there, I discovered by inquiring, was to purchase a $3 ticket and board an air-conditioned bus for a forty-five-second ride to the front gate.",

Thus refined, the medicine passed to Central Asia and into the syllabuses of the universities of Samarkand and Tashkent. Thence it was finally brought to India in the thirteenth century by refugees fleeing Genghis Khan—at about the same time as Abelard was lecturing to his students at the new university of Paris.",

Fortunately, his mother was close to Father Francisco Cadena, a kindly and learned mentor who saw her son as destined for the clergy. Thus, with the church fronting the costs of transport, William found himself leaving La Jagua every morning well before light, only to return each afternoon in time to gather firewood, which he sold to his neighbors in order to repay the village priest and buy food for his family. As the best source of wood was the remnant forest on the far side of the Magdalena, William’s small negocio implied a daily adventure, one that continued for several years. With a machete hanging from his neck, he would swim across the river, eyes alert for water snakes and jaguarundí. On his return, he would bundle the wood, securing it with rope to make a small raft, which he rested upon while going home, floating across the river with the current, peacefully watching the nighthawks and parrots as they darted across the evening sky.",

Once they’re dried and clothed he lets the children perch on his knees, takes his clay pipe from his mouth and any music that is in him comes forth. His voice is deep and his songs are various: Welsh folk songs, racy and ribald songs, rollicking sea shanties. Song is vital to Thomas: he is involved almost from the start in the English folk-song revival led by Cecil Sharp. He publishes Poems and Songs for the Open Air, an anthology of walking ballads and airs. Folk songs and footpaths are, to his mind, both major democratic forms: collective in origin but re-inflected by each new singer or walker. Radical, too, in their implicit rebuke to the notion of private property. 10He admires ‘Sumer Is Icumen in’ more than anything by Beethoven. In his poem ‘The Path’ he will write of an old track to school through the woods that ‘wind[s] like silver, trickles on’. It is smudged by moss and leaf-fall, but kept open by the feet of children. The path is a riverbed and the children the water, running ‘the current of their feet’ over it.",

The three concentrations of monuments at Las Mesitas are all connected by a trail that leads down to the Lavapatas, a beautiful mountain stream, broad and perfectly clear, that flows over a smooth bed of dark stone. Every surface is decorated with intricate motifs, images of snakes, lizards, and monkeys, depictions of human forms, and abstract designs that serve also as channels that lead the water into square pools carved deeply into the rock, allowing it to tumble over effigies, or cleanse the surface of stones. A lovely covered bridge crosses the stream, providing a perfect vantage over the entire site. From this elevated perspective, the many designs and patterns, shapes and troughs, curious when seen from the shore, suddenly fuse into one glorious celebration of the sacred, the living essence of life, pure water flowing over the spiritual dreams of these ancient men and women, whoever they were.",

An insulting name for a rattlesnake, which may explain the Faded Midget’s alleged bad temper. But the name is apt: he is small and dusty-looking, with a little knob above each eye – the horns. His bite though temporarily disabling would not likely kill a full-grown man in normal health. Even so I don’t really want him around.

It comes but once to the sons of earth, but wherever it comes, though they be buried in some ship’s dark hold, they know that they have met the sea. For it is everything that the earth is not, and in that moment men know the earth as their mother and friend; they feel the great hull in the dark plunge down into the heaving waste, and instantly they feel the terrible presence of miles of water below them, and the limitless, howling, mutable desert of the sea around them.",

It seemed placed so strategically close to the table. As I wondered whether to tell Ko Ye what I was thinking, he grinned at me through a cloud of cigarette smoke. I decided that I was becoming excessively paranoid. A few days earlier I had lost one of the notebooks in which I had recorded my interviews with people I had met in Burma. Though I had taken care never to mention people’s real names, and had invented such an elaborate code for places and events that I sometimes had difficulty deciphering them later, its loss was deeply unsettling. I turned my hotel room inside out to search for it, and eventually found it exactly where I had hidden it: behind the toilet cistern.",

This was mostly a journey to the farmhouse on the slopes above the vale, to inquire how the advanced cows were getting on in the straw-barton to which they were relegated. For it was a time of the year that brought great changes to the world of kine. Batches of the animals were sent away daily to this lying-in hospital, where they lived on straw till their calves were born, after which event, and as soon as the calf could walk, mother and offspring were driven back to the dairy. In the interval which elapsed before the calves were sold there was, of course, little milking to be done, but as soon as the calf had been taken away the milkmaids would have to set to work as usual.",

The day’s meagre rain-ration, a brief mid-afternoon downpour, served to lay the dust but can’t have done much for growth.

But when she expected the crowd to thin out, the waterfront remained jammed with people lined up as far as she could see. Was the carnival already being set up? The heat was stifling, and she thought it would be cooler by the water, but there were so many people she couldn’t get close. She crossed to the other side of the street and ran into more crowds.",

And she began to hate the power by which she held him. It was not thus they had once walked together, free in mind though so linked in habit and feeling; when their love was not a deadening drug but a vivifying element that cleared thought instead of stifling it. There were moments when she felt that open alienation would be easier, because it would be nearer the truth. And at such moments she longed to speak, to beg him to utter his mind, to go with her once for all into the depths of the subject they continued to avoid. But at the last her heart always failed her: she could not face the thought of losing him, of hearing him speak estranging words to her.",
