One can imagine a draughtsman twiddling arcs and marguerites with his compass and elaborating them for fun in vast symmetrical tangles – only to push them aside with a sigh. It is the high-spirited audacity of their materialization that turns everything to wonder. Hans was telling me as I gazed how Count Thurn and a party of Protestant nobles had tramped under these vaults on the way to their fateful meeting with the councillors of the Holy Roman Emperor, all in full armour: the word ‘armour’ suddenly offered a solution. It seemed, all at once, the apt analogy and the key to everything here. The steel whorls and flutings, those exuberant wings of metal that adorned the plate-armour of Maximilian’s Knights! Carapaces which, for all their flamboyance and vainglory, withstood mace-blows and kept out arrows and the points of swords and lances. In the same way the flaunting halls and the seven hundred rooms of this castle have maintained thousands of labyrinthine tons of Kafka masonry against fire and siege for centuries. These vaults and these stairways were concave three-dimensional offshoots of the Danubian breakout, and shelter for Landsknechts. Altdorfer’s world!",

The couple who owned the store trained me and, having picked up danger signals from local authorities, fled Hawaii for the Caribbean, leaving me to run the place along with the draft dodger, one of whose names was Dan. It was a terrific store for its size. Its fiction, poetry, history, philosophy, politics, religion, drama, and science sections were lively and thorough, with room for only single copies of most titles. Every book ever put out by New Directions or Grove—my favorite publishers in those days—seemed to be there. And we could get almost any title we didn’t have in a matter of days, on special order. All this stock and capacity were courtesy of the big store in L.A.",

Though separated by the river, I was opposite Czechoslovakian territory already; I planned to wheel left into the Republic and attack Hungary later on from the flank. In reality I was even closer than that: I was wandering across a field when a man in uniform began shouting from the dyke-road overhead. Where the devil did I think I was going? It was the Austrian frontier post. ‘You were walking straight into Czechoslovakia!’ the official said reproachfully as he stamped my passport. I left the eagles and the red-white-red road barrier behind. The next frontier, after a stretch of no man’s land, was closed by a barrier of red, white and blue. Another rubber-stamp was smacked down by a broad-faced Czechoslovak official with the Lion of Bohemia on his cap. ‘My fourth country,’ I thought exultantly.",

But this was in the middle of the saturnalian summer, when everything is topsy-turvy, and golf tournaments start at midnight, and three-year-old toddlers caper around till one in the morning each night (or one at night each morning).

I got up, opened the van door, walked to the passageway. As I stepped out onto it, my awareness of space expanded enormously: our vagon was sitting by itself in a vast, irregularly lighted train yard. This must be Magdagachi. In half a minute the khozyain joined me, looking a bit rusty from the entertainments of his journey, and confirmed that we had arrived. Suddenly a beam of light swung down on us, backed up by a resounding diesel noise. Behind the light I could just make out, by shading my eyes, a train engine’s massive form. Out of the brightness, stepping onto the coupling at the engine’s front, the engineer appeared.",

Brilliant colours, bold patterns and high-quality 100% cotton are turned into works of art by our design team.’ Alas! my trip to Malawi had to be incomplete; the Karonga showroom was closed – naturally enough, this firm’s workers having sparked off the unrest.

    "target_paragraph": "The following morning began like all the rest here. I made coffee before sunrise and walked along the bayfront. The faint light of dawn illuminated the still water upon which floated various sailboats. A high-speed ferry boarded passengers bound for Tampa, across the bay. I walked past the marina of a fancy hotel, said “buenos dias” to a group of Hispanic workers waiting for their workday to start, then out to a park where I stretched and tried to meditate as the sun rose. People rode by on expensive bicycles, walked their dogs, jogged by. St. Petersburg is a clean city with a beautiful waterfront. Parks abound and the buildings are all across the street from the water. A long sidewalk runs along the waterfront, connecting various parks and marinas. I’ve never stayed anywhere urban with a nicer place to walk in the mornings.\nAt first light, I was back aboard Sobrius removing tape from the brightwork (varnished wood, “bright” from the high-gloss varnish which reflects the sun’s damaging rays). Some of the tape was very hard to remove because the varnish and epoxy had hardened over it, and I vowed to remove tape daily while the varnish is still wet in the future. To this day there are still pesky bits of blue or green tape hiding around the shining varnished teak on the toerails of my little ship.\nNext I reinstalled the varnished handrails and admired their beauty in their new coats of varnish and epoxy. I set them in 3M 4000 caulk but struggled with the screws that fastened them to the coachroof. I should have drilled these holes out first, as varnish had gotten in them and made them smaller in diameter. This caused the wood around them to crack when I drove the screws back in, and as I write these words, this still need to be repaired. A sailboat is a never-ending maintenance job - a labor of love to the sailor, or a dread to the landlubber who owns a sailboat and neglects maintenance.\nI also pulled out all of the many screws around the sliding hatch in the companionway (this is the entrance into the cabin) and reset them in fresh caulk, thus sealing up another source of leaks.\nToday Al, the broker who sold me the boat, was kind enough to take me to Sam’s club and let me use his membership to purchase new batteries for Sobrius. I selected AGM (absorbed glass mat) batteries because they seemed modern and cool, and because they don’t require adding water – they are permanently sealed. This makes them a bit safer because in the event of a capsize, if the batteries were thrown about the cabin the AGM batteries would not spill battery acid all over the inside of the boat. Really, who wants to be burned by flying battery acid when their sailboat is upside down and rolling under a huge wave? Not me.\nUnfortunately, I neglected to read the amp-hour rating on the batteries before I bought them, and they were only rated at 55, which meant that I needed to go back to Sam’s to get a third battery; my electrical budget required at least 150 amp-hours of battery power. Luckily Al was kind enough to take me there again (Thanks Al!). In the future, I need to overcome the urge to just get a purchase over with and instead take the time necessary to read everything pertinent on the product, like the amp hours on a battery.\nAfter installing the three batteries, I began putting cleats and screws, which I had removed in order to varnish the wood, back on the rails. I bedded them all in 3M 4000 caulk, which is messy stuff. One must have paint thinner and a roll of paper towels on hand when using 3M 4000! I also reinstalled the tiller, which shined in the sun, revealing the gorgeous grains of the golden teak.\nI also added two cleats by the mast to accommodate the headsail downhaul (which I would need the next day) and the spinnaker halyard.",

(Jones, who said that he could usually sense within a few hours when someone had smuggled liquor into Shishmaref, did have a single-occupancy jail cell at his disposal; on busy nights like New Year’s Eve, the better-behaved drunks were allowed to sit with him in his office.)

The men are larger here and, compared to the small, slight average Indian males, seem like big bears with their bushy beards and broad shoulders. Most wear kurta shirts with baggy pants in dusty brown. The women wear the Indian salwar suits in polyester with baggy cuts—none swirl a sari and some are veiled. When the eyes of a veiled woman look at me I smile, but it’s an awkward transaction because it’s impossible to know if she is smiling back. Within moments, I notice a different smell, the spicy vegetarian sweat of India is replaced with a stronger, denser meaty smell of a nation that loves its flesh (bar pork, of course).",

Once, however, she was so ill-advised as to whip a spaniel that had torn one of her silk stockings (and it must be said in justice that Favilla had few stockings and those for the most part of drugget*) within an inch of its life beneath Orlando’s window. Orlando, who was a passionate lover of animals, now noticed that her teeth were crooked, and the two front turned inward, which, he said, is a sure sign of a perverse and cruel disposition in woman, and so broke the engagement that very night for ever.",

    "target_paragraph": "Three years earlier hardly anyone outside Congress had even heard of him. He was simply the junior senator from Ohio. By background and temperament he was a small-town newspaper proprietor, and that was about as far as his talents should have carried him. His nomination as a presidential candidate was one of the great astonishments of the age. It came about only because delegates to the 1920 Republican Party convention in Chicago grew hopelessly deadlocked over a slate of poor candidates and, after four days of indecision in the midst of a merciless heat wave, settled on the worst one on offer. Harding’s only obvious qualification for higher office was his handsome bearing. “He looked,” one contemporary observed, “like a President ought to look.” In nearly every other respect?intelligence, character, enterprise?he fell considerably short of mediocre. His crassness in private could be startling. The New York Times reporter Richards Vidmer confided to a friend that he once saw Harding rise from his chair in the middle of a conversation and casually urinate into a White House fireplace. For his running mate, the party selected a person nearly as obscure and even more unpromising (though at least rather more refined): Calvin Coolidge.",

The most dubious of all the beliefs behind the present Games is that this is Sydney’s chance to show itself to the world. In fact, very nearly the opposite is true. The Games are really much more a chance for Sydney to see what the world is like. For two weeks Sydney—normally the most genial and laid-back of cities—will experience situations that most of the rest of us have already: stressed and harried servers, packed airports, strained public transport systems, creeping traffic, appalling queues.",

She was still recovering. If she was strong enough, she said, she would come to walk some of the path with me, to show me a little of the way before turning back.",

    "target_paragraph": "It’s true. Every day in the Des Moines Register you can find a story about a farmer who has inadvertently torn off an arm and then calmly walked six miles into the nearest town to have it sewn back on. The stories always say, ‘Jones, clutching his severed limb, told his physician, “I seem to have cut my durn arm off, Doc.”’ It’s never ‘Jones, spurting blood, jumped around hysterically for twenty minutes, fell into a swoon and then tried to run in four directions at once,’ which is how it would be with you or me. Farmers simply don’t feel pain – that little voice in your head that tells you not to do something because it’s foolish and will hurt like hell and for the rest of your life somebody will have to cut up your food for you doesn’t speak to them. My grandfather was just the same. He would often be repairing the car when the jack would slip and he would call out to you to come and crank it up again as he was having difficulty breathing, or he would run over his foot with the lawn-mower, or touch a live wire, shorting out the whole of Winfield but leaving himself unscathed apart from a ringing in the ears and a certain lingering smell of burnt flesh. Like most people from the rural Midwest, he was practically indestructible. There are only three things that can kill a farmer: lightning, rolling over in a tractor, and old age. It was old age that got my grandfather.",

The snow on the mountains to the north melted and the exposed rock looked bleached and eroded. On the cool parkland of the foothills the firs became darker blobs of green. The poplars on the lake lost their fresh greenness and the willows scattered spinning leaves in high wind. The reeds became so tall they curved, and when the wind blew they swayed and tossed like waves. The lotus leaves rose crinkled and disordered out of the water, thrust up on thick stalks. Then, like blind tulips, the lotus buds appeared, and a week later opened in explosions of dying pink. In the garden the Californian poppies and the clarkia grew straggly and were pulled out; the French marigolds, which had taken the place of the pansies, thickened and put out buds. The petunias in the shade of the dining-room wall were failing; they, like the geraniums, had been discoloured and weighted down with distemper from the painters’ brushes. The godetias were at their peak: a mass of whipped colour, white and pink and pale violet. The sunflowers, seedlings when we arrived, were so tall, their leaves so broad, I could no longer look down into their hearts to examine the progress of the star-shaped buds. The dahlias put out one small red bloom, a touch of vivid colour against the green of reeds and willows and poplars.",

The coffin-bearers wore black gloves on their thin arms, and reminded me of Mickey Mouse. The organist struck up. Mourners moved up the aisles and into the dark-wood pews. High in the north-east Cairngorms, the quartz of the granite shone in the light, and the mica of the granite flashed. Foam in the pools of the Avon, and alder leaves turning in eddies. I walked to the front of the church where the coffin was waiting, an arrangement of gentians, heather and delphiniums on its pine lid, and tucked a sprig of creeping azalea into the heart of the bouquet.",

Burroughs found the village nearly as enchanting as the surrounding countryside: frame cottages with small gardens, grassy lanes instead of streets (the island had neither horses nor wheeled transport of any kind), and a shop with a large sign reading CHICAGO STORE, where he purchased some fresh eggs.",
