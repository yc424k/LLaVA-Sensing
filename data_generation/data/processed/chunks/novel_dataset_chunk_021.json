Clara’s moors were fine enough. The Phoenicians slept under their piled grey rocks; the chimneys of the old mines pointed starkly; early moths blurred the heather-bells; cartwheels could be heard grinding on the road far beneath; and the suck and sighing of the waves sounded gently, persistently, for ever.",

I watched Harris walk toward them across the flats, a distance he covered in less than ten minutes. When the clouds closed in a moment later, cutting off my view, he was within sixty feet of the tents, maybe closer. I didn’t see him again after that, but I was certain that he’d reached the security of camp, where Chuldum and Arita would doubtless be waiting with hot tea. Sitting out in the storm, with the ice bulge still standing between me and the tents, I felt a pang of envy. I was angry that my guide hadn’t waited for me.",

Each day takes a character description from each of these two lists. (These lists are given later in the chapter.) These 17 character descriptions are accompanied by a descriptive name. One of them, for example, is Laku Api, which means \"like fire\" and a person with this characteristic would be expected to be volatile and hot-tempered. Some are contradictory, and are thus never paired. For example one could not pair Laku Air, \"as water,\" a person who has very correct behavior, with Tunggak Semi, \"flower stem,\" from the second list, which portends a person who is conceited, arrogant, and belligerent.",

They phoned the number, had an awkward chat, and soon a stone-faced white guy arrived to drive me to the flat, which was indeed in this complex. This was an unpopular move. He’d rented a whole block and now secretly sublet it for far more, which owners, of course, do not like. I didn’t know, and later apologised to the receptionists.

The Waimanu day had begun; and it was odd to think that through the long summer years days dawned like this, and that the people of the valley grew grey and old in shrimping and sewing and kalo baking. All Waimanu shook hands with me, the kindly \"Aloha\" filled the air, and the women threw garlands over us both. I could hardly induce my host to accept a dollar and a half for my entertainment. From the dizzy summit of the pali, where the sun was high and hot, I looked my last on the dark, cool valley, slumbering in an endless calm, the deepest, greenest, quaintest cleft on all the island.",

We selected a simple three-hour food-and-vibratorless package, then drove in and up a level, and parked directly in front of the door to our room, which is how telos always work. There are never any lobbies, in order to eliminate the possibility of an awkward run-in. Oscar and I walked into our blackwalled, mirrored-ceilinged room, and thoroughly enjoyed our bed with a radio built into the headboard. “Your Body Is a Wonderland” was playing, unfortunately, but other than that, it was all I hoped it would be, complete with free toothbrushes and condoms, and a polite phone call five minutes before our time was up.",

Canoe songs, shark songs, and fishing songs were sung to the dipping of the paddles, all joining in on the swinging choruses. Once in a while the cry Mao! was raised, whereupon all strained like mad at the paddles. Mao is shark, and when the deep-sea tigers appear, the natives paddle for dear life for the shore, knowing full well the danger they run of having their frail canoes overturned and of being devoured. Of course, in our case there were no sharks, but the cry of mao was used to incite them to paddle with as much energy as if a shark were really after them. \"Hoe! Hoe!\" was another cry that made us foam through the water.",

Some forty or fifty people were going to bed. The thump of jugs set down on the floor above could be heard and the chink of china, for there was not as thick a partition between the rooms as one might wish, so Miss Allan, the elderly lady who had been playing bridge, determined, giving the wall a smart rap with her knuckles. It was only matchboard, she decided, run up to make many little rooms of one large one. Her grey petticoats slipped to the ground, and, stooping, she folded her clothes with neat, if not loving fingers, screwed her hair into a plait, wound her father’s great gold watch, and opened the complete works of Wordsworth. She was reading the ‘Prelude’, partly because she always read the ‘Prelude’ abroad, and partly because she was engaged in writing a short Primer of English Literature—Beowulf to Swinburne—which would have a paragraph on Wordsworth. She was deep in the fifth book, stopping indeed to pencil a note, when a pair of boots dropped, one after another, on the floor above her. She looked up and speculated. Whose boots were they, she wondered. She then became aware of a swishing sound next door—a woman, clearly, putting away her dress. It was succeeded by a gentle tapping sound, such as that which accompanies hair-dressing. It was very difficult to keep her attention fixed upon the ‘Prelude’. Was it Susan Warrington tapping? She forced herself, however, to read to the end of the book, when she placed a mark between the pages, sighed contentedly, and then turned out the light.",

    "target_paragraph": "Today, Bova is sparsely inhabited, although the numbers swell in the summer with many flocking to wander the ancient streets, hike in the environs of the Aspromonte Mountains and to partake in the bounty of its local culinary products. Oddly, a disproportionately large steam locomotive occupies a sizable space in a small piazza. Ironically, its placement honors the railroad for bringing work to its inhabitants, who then moved to the coast and populated the budding Bova Marina, ultimately leaving the older municipality unoccupied and neglected. Wandering through the town and ascending to its peak, we passed several churches, numerous dilapidated houses, a handful of dwellings beautifully renovated and an excellent example of a typical Bova house, a two-story structure made of stone with a substantial, arched-bricked entranceway. The ruins of a Norman castle are at the summit, from which there is a magnificent view of the surrounding countryside.",

His tall form, as though robbed of its substance, hovered noiselessly over invisible things with stooping and indefinite movements; his voice, heard in that remoteness where he could be glimpsed mysteriously busy with immaterial cares, was no longer incisive, seemed to roll voluminous and grave — mellowed by distance.",

Once, in the early days of the Great Struggle, a young man—she had smiled at him in mistake for someone more trustable—had followed in a taxi, hard on her motor, and flushed with wine, glory and the firm conviction that all women in that lurid carnival had become common property, had burst into her door from the public stairs … She had overtopped him by the forehead and before a few minutes were up she seemed to him to have become ten foot high with a gift of words that scorched his backbone and the voice of a frozen marble statue: a chaudfroid effect. He had come in like a stallion, red-eyed, and all his legs off the ground: he went down the stairs like a half-drowned rat, with dim eyes and really looking wet, for some reason or other.",

He’s one of the few people who’ve spent more time flipping through the Harriman Alaska Series than I have. Glacial behavior is an excellent indicator of slight changes in climate. The thousands of photos Molnia had collected demonstrated overwhelmingly that Alaska’s glaciers have retreated in the past century. A few, like the Johns Hopkins in Glacier Bay and the Hubbard, near Yakutat, showed growth, though. What did it mean if glaciers were both advancing and retreating?",

He was filled with terror and anger against them because they were able to live, to thrive, in this horrible depression that sickened him.",

Farther on a pair of mule deer started from the brush and bounded obliquely through the beams of my lights, raising puffs of dust which the wind, moving faster than my pickup truck, caught and carried ahead of me out of sight into the dark. The road, narrow and rocky, twisted sharply left and right, dipped in and out of tight ravines, climbing by degrees toward a summit which I would see only in the light of the coming day.",

You’re afraid of all kinds of irrational things like this when you’re alone at night. Has anything ever happened? No. Now just keep walking. I focused on the repetitive sound of my footsteps crunching on the gravel and the tiny spot of illuminated ground from my headlamp a few feet ahead. Just then, I heard a faint rustle to my right?a movement I didn’t recognize. It was accompanied by a strong scent?not fecal matter or rotting carcasses?just the overwhelming odor of wild animal. I fought the rising panic that comes in the presence of an unseen predator by counting my breaths.",

We would spend a few minutes walking up and down the air-conditioned aisles as she admired the goods, carefully examining a bottle of organic shampoo or reading the ingredients on a box of chocolate-covered almonds. She would tell me how wonderfully convenient the supermarket was, how it had everything you could possibly need from all over the world. And she would remind me how there had been nothing like this in Burma during Ne Win’s time. She saw the supermarket as a sign of progress for the country. Yet we never had to queue at the checkout counter, because she never bought anything. She couldn’t afford to shop in the supermarket and, like most Burmese housewives, purchased all her supplies from the open-air stalls at her local wet market.",

Doors are opened and tables spread for any stranger arriving in a village; this surely spikes the guns of mendicancy as a skilled profession. The few beggars one does meet are pathetically amateur and innocuous; an old woman out of luck, a down-and-out whose modest demands are made with little conviction; sometimes a jovial old card with breath like a blow-lamp, a bloodshot wink as he points thirstily down his throat and a mock salute as he dives, clutching his winnings, into the nearest drinking-hell for his fifteenth ouzo of the morning; each dawn finds him, to the despair of his dear ones, snoring in a different doorway: the sort of figure, in fact, that we could all become. There is nothing to set against the rest of the Mediterranean, no competition with the infernos of Naples and Palermo. The only real professionals are the gypsies. Their single-mindedness overrides flight and rebuff with a patient erosion of whispers and plucked sleeves that exalts their takings from alms to danegeld. Where and how did the Kravarites deploy their skill?",

With lazy cat-warmth she smiled on all the world.",

But no sooner had the captain sailed away than the whale-boat dropped to pieces. It was his fortune, some time afterwards, to be wrecked, of all places, on that particular island. The Marquesan chief was ignorant of rebates and discounts; but he had a primitive sense of equity and an equally primitive conception of the economy of nature, and he balanced the account by eating the man who had cheated him.",

Then he emerged once more, carrying a big double-ended feed-basket, and retreated into the gloom where the parti-colored rumps of the horses were now ranged quietly along the feeding-trough. Mrs Littlejohn appeared once more, on the veranda this time, carrying a big brass dinner bell. She raised it to make the first stroke. A small commotion set up among the ponies as the Texan approached but he began to speak to them at once, in a brisk loud unemphatic mixture of cursing and cajolery, disappearing among them. The men at the door heard the dry rattling of the corn-pellets into the trough, a sound broken by a single snort of amazed horror. A plank cracked with a loud report; before their eyes the depths of the hallway dissolved in loud fury, and while they stared over the doors, unable yet to begin to move, the entire interior exploded into mad tossing shapes like a down-rush of flames.",

His demeanor surprised me; unlike most American men his age he spoke softly and rarely cursed. The other backpacker wore a white baseball hat, his locks of California-blonde hair tucked neatly around his ears. “I might go, too, but I might have to go back to America, for work,” he said with great sadness. The two backpackers, those twenty-something men whom earlier I loathed as they sat quietly in our hotel lobby, turned out to be good fun after all. They were intelligent and polite and suffered the same disease as me: wanderlust. Our conversation turned to prior travels. The four of us recited our travel histories like a game of Boggle, checking off countries we had visited. As each one spoke, the others chimed in:",

The driver dropped me off opposite Madiba’s private retirement home, a red-brick bungalow built in 1992, standing alone on the veld. The casual passer-by wouldn’t give it a second glance; it resembles the homes of countless middle-income whites. Nothing indicates its owner’s identity – until, as you approach, two policemen emerge from a gateway in the eight-foot brick wall. Agreeable policemen, pleased to have this break in the monotony of guarding an empty house – ‘Sometimes Madiba comes here to rest but he has little resting in his life.’ Proudly they told me the Eastern Cape government has plans to put Qunu on the tourist map ‘as part of an “In the Footsteps of the President” initiative’. Then they allowed me to wander around the paved forecourt and little garden where a few adolescent shrubs struggle against the drought. If I wanted to take photographs, that would be R5 per shot …",

Visibility drops to nil, forcing the driver to slow to a crawl, a torment for any Colombian. Then, quite unexpectedly, a gust of wind clears the mist to reveal the first signs of the páramo, a vast treeless expanse of vegetation that is one of Colombia’s great natural wonders.",

This wayfarer is clad in blackened sheepskins, with the usual assortment of beads and amulets, silver pouch, silver flint case, silver dagger. Demanding a smoke, he laughs loud in disbelief when I say that I have none, and raises his dagger toward my throat in demonstration of my fate, were he but given to low banditry.

She said no more, but Delia divined in her the stirring of that obscure opposition which, in the crucial moments of Tina’s life, seemed automatically to manifest itself. She could not understand why Char-lotte should at times grow so enigmatic and inaccessible, but she saw no reason why this change of mood should interfere with what she deemed to be her own duty. Tina must long for her guiding hand into the new life as much as she yearned for the exchanges of half-confidences which would be her real farewell to her adopted daughter. Her heart beating a little more quickly than usual, she rose and walked through the open window into the shadowy drawing-room. The moon, between the columns of the veranda, sent a broad light across the rows of chairs, irradiated the lacedecked altar with its empty candlesticks and vases, and outlined with silver Delia’s heavy reflection in the pier-glass.",

Left-wing guerillas, prompted by the extreme poverty that was being ignored by the government, started fighting the military forces. Through the 70s and 80s, the government waged war against its people, commanding executions and abductions. Some 200,000 civilians were killed or “disappeared.” The military led massacres of entire villages of indigenous Mayan people. In recent years, some of those leaders are now being tried for genocide by the Guatemalan government. (End of history lesson.)",
