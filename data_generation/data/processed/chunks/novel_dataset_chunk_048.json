His early experiences of walking are suburban: Wandsworth Common, Wimbledon Common. From a young age, too, he is a noticer. He keeps a journal of natural events. He remarks the date of the opening of the year’s first violets, he plots the location of birds’ nests, he records encounters (a heron taking an eel; a sparrowhawk’s berserk pursuit of a starling) and phenomena (clouds that hang like pudding bags in the sky, heat mirages). He’s a collector, too, mostly of flowers and eggs. He shins up trees to reach nests, always leaving one egg to encourage another clutch.",

Instead of becoming an extra or a bit player like many other old stars, she had shown excellent business sense and had opened a callhouse. She wasn’t vicious. Far from it. She ran her business just as other women run lending libraries, shrewdly and with taste.",

To the Nepalese Machendranath Rath Jatra is one of their most important religious festivals and this deity is very sacred, very powerful and very easily angered; yet here that subdued sense of reverence which we cultivate towards things sacred is quite unknown, and fear, worship and gaiety flow together as inseparable parts of daily life. Only for a brief, solemn moment, while they show homage, pray and make offerings, do people withdraw from the joyous tumult around them – and when they rejoin it they appear even happier after ‘making puja’.",

Setting up meant that the usual quiet time, when all the guests were out of camp, was suddenly filled with frantic activity. The one spare Land Rover, a decrepit and spluttering machine called the Skorokoro (which means “too old to work” in Shangaan), would be loaded with firewood, lanterns, and a chef named Wusani, whose bulk always made the aging suspension creak ominously. Wusani particularly disliked these bush dinners, as one afternoon after being dropped off she was unpleasantly surprised. Shortly after she lit the cooking fire, a lion roared, according to her description, “closer to me than a baby is to its mother.” Lions often walked in the soft sand of the dry riverbed that flowed beside the Bush Camp to enjoy the shade, or maybe to startle an antelope that had been lulled to sleep by the cool and tranquility of the surrounds. This lion was not hunting, or it would not have roared, but that didn’t make it any less terrifying for Wusani.",

Outta the water. Holding my ground, I focused on Pop’s image, asking, What do you have to teach me? He hung there. I moved forward, my thighs entering the chill. His ghostly visage stared at me. I took another step. Pop’s face seemed to shift, his head cut and bruised, like Syd’s. Another step. The water wrapped around my chest. I dove—Pop’s image vanishing like a fleeting ghost, washed away by the cool pure water. Swimming out strongly, I stroked hard for a small islet about a hundred yards offshore—my body warming to the effort. Twice my left leg threatened to cramp up in the cold, but I eased through it and soon reached the rocky outcropping. Climbing onto a large promontory, I stood dripping in the warm sun. “I did it!” I whooped, the icy water streaming off my head.",

Long before the New Testament was penned it had sunk into an obscurity from which the Ottomans failed to rescue it until the end of the nineteenth century. Then, as their administrative centre for the Negev, it acquired one notable building, a splendid Governor’s mansion. When General Allenby’s cavalrymen arrived in October 1917 it was a large village, mainly Bedouin. In 1948 it was captured again, after an Israel versus Egypt battle. Since the 1960s it has become Israel’s fourth-largest city, a dusty, dishevelled place raised in such a hurry no one could spare the time to tidy up. Many millions of dollars have bred an industrial park dominated by Intel. And development continues; on every side cranes swing across the hot blue sky, dangling their cargoes of prefab slabs. While waiting for the kibbutz bus I ambled aimlessly; there is nothing to aim for, apart from the Negev Palmach Brigade Memorial, celebrating that 1948 conquest.",

He followed the others into the frosty darkness again. Beneath his feet the ground was already stiffening; overhead the sky was brilliant with stars. He stumbled a little behind the crowding backs until Rafe opened a door into a separate building, and stood aside until they had entered. This room was filled with warmth and a thin blue haze pungent with cooking odors, in which a kerosene lamp burned steadily on a long table. At one end of the table was a single chair; the other three sides were paralleled by backless wooden benches. Against the further wall was the stove, and a huge cupboard of split planks, and a woodbox. Behind the stove two negro men and a half grown boy sat, their faces shining with heat and their eyeballs rolling whitely; about their feet five puppies snarled with mock savageness at one another or chewed damply at the negroes’ static ankles or prowled about beneath the stove and the adjacent floor with blundering, aimless inquisitiveness.",

Here, with no gentle transition, was the true West, with mountain ranges trailing their long blue-and-purple skirts, right-angled mesas standing sharply against the great sky, and under our wheels arid, yellow ground that bristled here and there with grudging grayish shrubs. Tumbleweed moved with us, the tangled combings of a giant caught in the wind. I felt lightheaded, and no doubt was, for Albuquerque, which we were approaching, is five thousand feet high. Jane, too, seemed to be affected. Again she pounded my knee, laughing with triumph as we swooped around a hairpin turn, saying, \"Well, we did it!\" After a pause, she added, \"I bet we'll have stacks of mail waiting,\" but for once I didn't let this worry me. Any mail waiting for us now had come such a long way that it was bound to have cooled off.",

It was a beehive of activity this morning, especially along the main business routes, where many of the buildings retain much of their original colonial Caribbean charm, though modern structures encroach relentlessly. Jomo angled the pimpmobile into an empty space alongside one of the busier streets. We followed as he climbed out of the car and did a rolling strut down a covered sidewalk, gold chain, medallion, rings and watch flashing. Helper, decked out in similar fashion, followed behind, as if guarding our rear flank. We walked in the shade of old pastel storefronts with canopies supported by columns splotched with overlapping layers of peeling paint: chalky pinks, greens and blues. Cool, stale air drifted from the open doorways of dim old general stores and variety shops and competed with the heat rising off the street’s black tarmac. The market was up ahead at the end of the block.",

At this point I happened to look at the roof of the mosquito net, and through the white gauze, spotted indistinct dark shapes which seemed to be moving. Using a bamboo chair as a makeshift step ladder, I elevated myself to a level where I could see the top of the net, which contained a couple of hundred ants, hurriedly marching in all directions around the net's surface. My powers of deduction told me that the roof was the likely source of our unwanted visitors, and I peered into the shadows of the thatch.

None of the mule team had drunk a drop, and they all looked queasy. Justo in particular wore the facial expression of a man who’d eaten some bad shellfish, and the others were having a laugh at his expense. John called everyone together and demanded that each man drink a bottle of water into which he mixed an electrolyte powder. The packets looked like something the Red Cross might hand out in Africa; their label said that the elixir had been formulated for babies suffering from cholera.",

Unwrapping it back in my hotel room, I crumbled the contents across a leaf of cigarette paper. The pale green buds were sticky with resin and redolent of rotting fruit. I rolled a joint, smoked it down to nothing, rolled a second fatty, and smoked nearly half of that one, too, before the room began to spin and I stubbed it out.",

Slight they may be, but vivid and genuine, merely because the power to break them is within the grasp of each, and there is no reason for continuance except a true desire that continue they shall. When two people have been married for years they seem to become unconscious of each other’s bodily presence so that they move as if alone, speak aloud things which they do not expect to be answered, and in general seem to experience all the comfort of solitude without its loneliness. The joint lives of Ridley and Helen had arrived at this stage of community, and it was often necessary for one or the other to recall with an effort whether a thing had been said or only thought, shared or dreamt in private. At four o’clock in the afternoon two or three days later Mrs Ambrose was standing brushing her hair, while her husband was in the dressing-room which opened out of her room, and occasionally, through the cascade of water—he was washing his face—she caught exclamations, ‘So it goes on year after year; I wish, I wish, I wish I could make an end of it,’ to which she paid no attention.",

On our way down we tried hard to buy some but nobody would sell, at any price, and we both sensed anti-gringo vibes. In Huanta – an attractive pueblo, architecturally if not humanly – we paused for rice and mutton stew. But I can never enjoy a meal when Juana has nothing. Soon we were climbing out of the valley between acres of Alf, yet here too nobody would sell. As the light faded we left all crops behind, and all hopes for Juana’s supper. Briefly we considered theft, but couldn’t quite overcome our inhibitions. This site, on the edge of a stony, crudely ploughed stubble-field of sticky clay, offers our mula only sparse grass, growing along a damp ditch between tent and road. Rachel, ever optimistic, gathered fuel by torchlight and I attempted the fire ceremony. But everything wetly resisted a whole box of matches so we’ve had no celebratory hot drink.",

The sun became extraordinarily hot because the motor car had stopped outside Mulberry’s shop window; old ladies on the tops of omnibuses spread their black parasols; here a green, here a red parasol opened with a little pop. Mrs Dalloway, coming to the window with her arms full of sweet peas, looked out with her little pink face pursed in inquiry. Everyone looked at the motor car. Septimus looked. Boys on bicycles sprang off. Traffic accumulated. And there the motor car stood, with drawn blinds, and upon them a curious pattern like a tree, Septimus thought, and this gradual drawing together of everything to one centre before his eyes, as if some horror had come almost to the surface and was about to burst into flames, terrified him. The world wavered and quivered and threatened to burst into flames. It is I who am blocking the way, he thought. Was he not being looked at and pointed at; was he not weighted there, rooted to the pavement, for a purpose? But for what purpose?",

Finally, eleven hours of scrambling and five challenging abseils later, shattered and exhausted, our team walked into camp just as daylight began to fade. My heart was full of pride. For months we had been visualizing this challenge, most of us had never rock climbed before and some of my teammates even had to overcome their paralysing fear of heights.
