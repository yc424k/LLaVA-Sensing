On bucket-dump days and limpid still mornings, otters floated behind the Whaler on their backs, tails poked out of the water like a whale’s fluke, poised in what resembled nothing so much as a friendly wave. Luxuriously thick, otter fur can have up to a million hairs per square inch. It’s spiky when wet, but despite constant immersion, otters never look soaked. A sea otter seems complex, its whiskered face dear enough to inspire children’s plush toys, yet inquisitive, as if it doesn’t miss a trick. An otter isn’t all cuddles. On the hunt, it smashes the exoskeletons of crabs and urchins, and rips apart a sea lion carcass with ferocity. Two young males were observed having “rough sex” with a dead baby seal, eating it when finished. (Such natural history rarely makes it into the toy store.)",

Loneliness, far from being a rare and curious circumstance, is and always has been the central and inevitable experience of every man. Not only has this been true of the greatest poets, as evidenced by the huge unhappiness of their published grief, but now it seemed to George to apply with equal force to all the nameless cyphers who swarmed about him in the streets. As he saw them in their strident encounters with each other, and overheard their never-varying exchanges of abuse, contempt, distrust, and hatred, it became increasingly clear to him that one of the contributing causes of their complaint was loneliness.",

The sun was fully out now, and barely a wisp of the early-day mist survived. The clay dried fast on my legs, crisping the hairs and tightening my skin so that I felt kiln-fired – a mud man. To my joy three avocets rose from the salt marsh and flew screeching in circles above us, before rocketing back down into the sea lavender. I thought of the curlew I had seen in numbers out on this coast earlier in the year, and about how the paths of birds and animals were really the oldest ways of them all: aerial migration routes, bringing geese to this shore from Siberia, peregrines from Scandinavia, scored invisibly into the sky over millennia and signed by magnetic forces. Staggering recent research into avian navigation has revealed that, by means of retinal proteins called cryptochromes, birds can actually see magnetic fields. Magnetic force-structures are perceived as darker or lighter forms, which are superimposed on the conventionally visible landscape, and so help to guide the birds to their destinations.",

Night air atop the passes and peaks cooled rapidly and rushed downslope?I shivered as these katabatic winds washed over me. My pace became a crawl and I cried in frustration after following cairns far off the trail and onto a jut of land above Helen Lake. I was at a dead-end viewpoint. The trail was on the other side. I scrambled down the rocks and forded the thigh-deep outlet. The fear of falling into the black, cold water gripped my stomach and knotted it. I just wanted to be away from this landscape of snow, water, and rock. Pulling out my phone, I turned on the Halfmile app?walking while staring at the screen to ensure I didn’t veer too far from the trail again.",

In all the fields there are small stone towers containing shells deposited as offerings in which incense is burnt when a storm approaches. Many villages actually have regular weather-makers. These are monks with a reputation for special skill in managing the weather. For the purposes of their magic they blow on conchs, which make a vibrating sound. In many of our mountain villages the church bells are rung when a storm is approaching, and the effect of these conchs can be compared to the effect of the vibration of the bells. But of course Tibetans do not recognise any physical explanation—for them all is magic and spells and the sport of the gods.",

He did not want to tidy the guest room and find bedsheets and warm the soup and make fresh garri for them. He wanted them to leave right away. Or, if they would not leave, he wanted them to shut their filthy mouths. He wanted the radio announcers to be silent too, but they were not. They repeated the news of the killings in Maiduguri until Ugwu wanted to throw the radio out of the window, and the next afternoon, after the men left, a solemn voice on ENBC Radio Enugu recounted eyewitness accounts from the North: teachers hacked down in Zaria, a full Catholic church in Sokoto set on fire, a pregnant woman split open in Kano. The newscaster paused. “Some of our people are coming back now. The lucky ones are coming back. The railway stations are full of our people. If you have tea and bread to spare, please take it to the stations. Help a brother in need.”",

    "target_paragraph": "Some travellers had more bizarre and more specific hallucinations – an English climber on Everest in the 1930s reported giant teapots pulsating in the sky above the summit – and others more macabre ones. When Edward Whymper was lowering himself gingerly down the Matterhorn in 1865, only a few hours after three of his companions had plummeted to their deaths, he saw three crosses floating in the foggy air, one higher than the other two: a misty Golgotha marking the death of his three friends. The explanation for Whymper’s vision is now thought to be either embroidery on his part – he was known to have an elastic sense of truth – or to have been a peculiarly complex form of the so-called Brocken Spectre. The Brocken Spectre, which was first seen and described by Bouguer in Peru in 1737, is a trick of the light which occurs on bright days, when the observer is standing between the sun and a bank of mist or cloud. The observer’s shadow is cast on to the mist, and the sun is refracted by the water suspended in the air to produce halos of colour around the shadow. I have seen a Brocken Spectre only once, on the Isle of Skye. I was walking up the spine of a long, elegant ridge running north–south. The morning sun was shining on me from the east, and I suddenly noticed my shadow projected on to the damp mist below me, with a colourful nimbus. It looked like an attentive genie, scudding along on his magic carpet of mist, always preserving the same distance from me.",

At that height the wind was colossal, hurtling out of the black west, and of such strength that it was impossible to stand straight in it. We moved from rock to rock, reaching out to steady ourselves, as though on a ship’s deck in a storm. The rain was pelting now in heavy cold monsoon droplets. I took shelter behind a pair of twenty-foot tors that tilted in towards one another to form a wind-gate, and when I stepped from the shelter into the gate itself, the force of the gale was such that it pulled the flesh on my face tight and back. I remembered another gateway to another upper world: the Chalamain Gap, the granite portal that marks the northern entry to the centre of the Cairngorms.",

Hot fried eggs are especially dangerous and a prudent cook sets them aside until they seize up. The yolks stiffen to discs of yellow cardboard in a matrix of white glacé kid islanded in cold oil that must have been poured from the sanctuary lamp of a disaffected shrine, and beside them the pale prisms of fried potato form an elastic and frigid magma. So it was now: time had changed our two plateloads, the only cold things in Astakos, into collectors’ pieces of freak geology. We asked for goats’ cheese and bread; then, prising the eggs loose and fragmenting them, we covertly scattered the shards among the cats. Fifteen leapt forward; a few moments’ scrutiny dispersed them again. Their eyes were wide with disillusion. One long black cat of more commanding aspect remained behind and a suppliant forepaw touched my knee as he fixed us with a gaze of injury. A mew of desolation went up, too harrowing to be borne; a massed wail followed our departure. From my room I could hear them turning on each other in recrimination, as if each one were telling his neighbour that had he played his cards differently, all might have gone well. They too wanted lobsters.",

Standing on an abandoned stone bridge over River Moidart, I ponder riding upstream on the dead end road to find a wild camping place. The wind gathers. A howling north headwind. The only good news is that the coastal route from Castle Tioram ends here. It would, indeed, have been unpassable with the bike. I stop for a minute, decide I have plenty of energy and, totally disregarding the bad karma warning, keep going. The next seven kilometres along Loch Moidart look flat on the map.

For a hundred years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has been trying to figure out how to grow crops in Alaska, an idea that’s not as crazy as it sounds. The soil in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, north of Anchorage, is fertile and deep. Farmers in the region are known for raising beach-ball-size cabbages that thrive in its twenty hours of summer daylight. During the Great Depression, the federal government had transplanted two hundred farm families here from the Midwest, though most eventually moved back south. They may have departed too soon. During that hundred-year span, rising temperatures have greatly extended Alaska’s growing season; in Fairbanks, researchers found that the season had increased from 85 to 123 days between 1906 and 2002. Alaskans had recently voted to legalize marijuana, and there was some talk that the Mat-Su’s reputation as the state’s “pot cultivation capital” (per the Anchorage newspaper) might create more jobs.",

The babies are specially lovable, as they sit staring wide-eyed at this strange cousin who returns their fascinated wonder with interest!

He laughed, and it laughed with him, and held its hands to its sides, just as he himself was doing. He made it a mocking bow, and it returned him a low reverence. He went towards it, and it came to meet him, copying each step that he made, and stopping when he stopped himself. He shouted with amusement, and ran forward, and reached out his hand, and the hand of the monster touched his, and it was as cold as ice. He grew afraid, and moved his hand across, and the monster's hand followed it quickly. He tried to press on, but something smooth and hard stopped him. The face of the monster was now close to his own, and seemed full of terror. He brushed his hair off his eyes. It imitated him. He struck at it, and it returned blow for blow. He loathed it, and it made hideous faces at him. He drew back, and it retreated.",
