We pass giant glittering skyscrapers sitting alongside colonial wrecks stained with pigeon poo. Inside filthy flats, fans swirl above smoking men in singlets painted purple by fluorescent lights. Way past midnight the pavement pumps to the beat of beggars, bar hoppers and cricket matches. Smoky jazz clubs ooze hip, drug dealers peddle in dark corners and coconut sellers squat outside the bookstores.",

A Minnesotan like Lindbergh, he had moved to New York as a young man to pursue a career as a singer in both light and serious opera. In 1923, while walking along lower Broadway, he passed the offices of radio station WEAF. Knowing that radio stations sometimes aired recitals, he asked if there was any chance of an audition. The station manager, Samuel L. Ross, thought McNamee had the perfect voice for radio?warm and clear?so he hired him on the spot to introduce programs, read news bulletins, and occasionally sing. That autumn WEAF had the rights to broadcast the World Series between the Yankees and Giants?the first time the series had been broadcast to a mass audience. W. O. McGeehan of the Tribune was employed to provide play-by-play, and McNamee was sent along to assist him. McGeehan had no talent for broadcasting. He spoke in a flat tone and made no effort to fill the dead space between plays. During the fourth inning of the third game, he told McNamee he didn’t want to do it anymore and left. McNamee had no choice but to take over, which was something of a challenge since he knew very little about professional baseball.",

The larger problem was that there was a low bridge 100 feet downstream from the marina that we would collide with if we didn’t make our turn into the slip. We would have to sail past the end of the dock and make a quick 180° jibe in close quarters to get into the slip. The jibe was accidently executed flawlessly. It was the lack of wind and a swift current that started us floating backwards. I dropped the tiller, ran to the bow and tried to grab hold of one of the docked boats. I just couldn’t hold Echo in the current. As we were passing the last boat on the dock, I desperately managed to get Echo’s bow line tied onto a docked boat’s shroud lines. I climbed aboard the docked boat and pulled Echo up one boat at a time into her slip.",

Of all the aerial employments, delivering mail was the most economically secure but also the most dangerous: thirty-one of the first forty airmail pilots were killed in crashes, and accidents remained common through the 1920s. Airmail pilots flew in all weather and often at night, but with almost no support in the way of navigational aids. In March 1927, an article in Scientific American, under the heading “Invisible Beams Guide Birdmen in Flights Between European Cities,” noted admiringly how pilots in Europe could fix their locations instantly via radio beacons. Lost American pilots, by contrast, had to search for a town and hope that someone had written its name on the roof of a building. In the absence of that?and it was generally absent?pilots had to swoop low to try to read the signs on the local railroad station, often a risky maneuver. For weather reports, they mostly called ahead to railroad agents along the route and asked them to put their head out the door and tell them what they saw.",

An immense yew-tree grew near the low, dividing wall, and beneath its shade Burridge, who had inhabited the cottage during the brief period before his family increased, wanting something to sit on on summer evenings and being, when he wasn’t drinking, thrifty and resourceful, had made a seat out of a disused memorial slab, text and all. If you sat on this seat long, especially on a warm day, the green mould in the lettering came off on you, and you went about unconsciously announcing in reversed order, to those who cared to run and read, that you were not lost but gone before; and James, a natural non-interferer, was still wondering, as he had wondered when he first saw the thing fitted with rustic wooden arms and a back which plainly showed the use it was put to, whether he ought to take some firm sort of line about it and have it removed on the ground of its profanity, or merely pretend he hadn’t yet noticed it.",

Ferramonti, the Calabrian camp located in a village called Tarsia in the province of Cosenza, was originally for non-Italian Jews, but eventually housed Italian Jews, anti-Fascists and non-Jews of other nationalities. Inspired by a photograph of a group of costumed prisoners putting on The Broken Pitcher, the playwright used a play-within-a-play as a thread around which the characters’ individual stories were woven. Minimalist scenery consisting of eight moveable wooden sections that transformed themselves from barrack walls to bunk beds to lecterns created an evocatively desolate backdrop for the actors’ rehearsals and the pensive discussions amongst the members of the camp’s small theatrical group.",

    "target_paragraph": "After the incessant tensions and hatreds of Israel, the glib self-righteousness of the settlers and the bleak despair of the Palestinians, Alexandria feels refreshingly detached from the troubles of the Middle East; indeed it feels detached from the Middle East altogether. The cafés with their baroque mirrors and gleaming tables have a vaguely French or Viennese air to them, while the façades of the townhouses with their stained tempera and shuttered windows are strikingly Italianate. But, if anything, the city feels Greek. Alexandria was, after all, founded by a Greek and remained a Greek-dominated town until the 1950s, when Nasser expropriated the Greeks’ banks and businesses and expelled the families who owned them. The Jews, the French and the English were thrown out at the same time, leaving the city – always something of a European expatriate exiled on the coast of Africa – a cold cadaver, its magnificent art deco buildings still intact but emptied of the men and women who built and owned them, a city ‘clinging to the minds of old men like traces of perfume on a sleeve: Alexandria the capital of Memory’.",

This hardly discernible path, which Mingmar had never used before, was so steep that for the first hour we were not really walking, but pulling ourselves up through long thick grass (there were no trees and few shrubs), using our hands as much as our feet. Soon Mingmar had been left far behind and I was alone, feeling like a lizard on a pyramid and rather proud of my newly-acquired ability to follow the illogic of an almost non-existent track. Often I stopped to rest and look round, and unhopefully I took a few photographs, knowing full well that my unique incompatibility with cameras made the effort a waste of money. Moreover, this incompatibility was now being aggravated by an aversion to the falsification of mountain photography. In such surroundings even the most expertly-wielded camera cannot help but lie, and once the reality has been seen the preservation of fragments seems futile. Also it distresses me to break up visually the wholeness of a Himalayan landscape in an effort to see it as a series of ‘good pictures’. So I soon freed myself from my camera and surrendered to the purity of the light, the foaming strength of the already distant river, the heaving complex of mountains on every side and the tantalising cleft that leads to Tibet, drawing one’s eye to that ultimate glory of snow-peaks blazing coldly along the near horizon.",

As our eyes adjusted to the dim light, the floor, ceiling, and every wall came alive with a fantastic assembly of figures fully worthy of Hieronymus Bosch. Crafted from totumo wood, rock, bone, and mud, and inspired by the maestro’s love of the river, every sculpture had a story to tell. A drunk fisherman holding two bocachicos and a bottle of rum. An enchanted forest full of riparian life—caimanes, tigrillos, and birds. Bogas working their canoes. Dangling from the ceiling was a school of bagre, an iconic Magdalena fish today facing extinction. Every work of art served as a living metaphor; each played a role in the pageant play that was the story of Villafañe’s life. One piece showed a man leaving his home, only to be followed on the river by a hungry caiman. He heads for land, only to be met by a jaguar. He climbs a tree, only to come face-to-face with a deadly poisonous snake.",

It was nibbling the road with that air of hopeless indecision characteristic of lost horses, vacantly looking up now and then as if in search of some kind person to take it home. Having wasted half an hour trying to effect this kindness, during which our own horses were goaded into a lather while the truant remained as cool, as vacant, and as helplessly innocent as before, we drove the brute into the gorge.

Worzel!” he said, putting both hands to his forehead and releasing them, into the air, a gesture repeated, fast, several times, a very effective signal, which meant what? Exactly? Please—release me from this insanity, perhaps, something like that… “Worzel! Worzel!” he repeated, with a huge smile on his broad, open, healthy young face. “Stop your vegetables! Stop your verbiage! Go on—fuck off back to your field of turnips!”",

My abrupt transition from one end of Cuba to the other spotlit the ‘two Cubas’ image: the allegedly more Caribbean-flavoured Oriente and the more (let it be said in a whisper) US-flavoured Occidente. In 1859 Anthony Trollope foresaw Havana becoming ‘as much American as New Orleans’. Being ignorant of the rest of the Caribbean, I wouldn’t know myself about Oriente’s flavour but Pinar del Rio’s country dwellers are noticeably less outgoing than the Sierra Madre campesiños. They also seem less racially mixed and their fellow-Cubans tend to depict them as backward, slow-thinking, bucolic. However, tobacco farming requires immense skill and slow-thinking doesn’t mean unintelligent – or I hope it doesn’t. (My own thoughts move at snail’s pace, hence literary festivals and suchlike unnerve me; I think of the appropriate thing to say ten minutes after it would have been appropriate.)",

Inside were forty students working quietly around rectangular tables, each one wearing maroon shorts, a white blouse, and a blue neckerchief signifying their membership in the Union de Pioneros José Martí, or Communist Youth League. They appeared to be in the third grade. Their spacious room was lined with bookshelves, a world map, and a poster of thumbnail sketches of select Sierra Maestra rebels. Above the blackboard hung a black-and-white framed photograph of Che Guevara smoking a cigar. (The pledge Seremos como el Che—We will be like Che—is recited by schoolchildren every morning.) Their teacher looked on from a three-legged stool, her own leg wrapped in an enormous white cast unraveling at the seams. Noticing us in the doorway, she beckoned us in, as if travelers often appeared there, wringing their hands uncertainly. The students watched, wide-eyed and excited, as we walked to the front of the room and piled stickers, notebooks, pens, and pencils onto a table. Then I looked at Machi and she looked at me. What now?",

They seemed to drive roads back to the very beginning of the world, on either side of which the populations of all times and countries stood in avenues, and by passing down them all knowledge would be hers, and the book of the world turned back to the very first page. Such was her excitement at the possibilities of knowledge now opening before her that she ceased to read, and a breeze turning the page, the covers of Gibbon gently ruffled and closed together. She then rose again and walked on. Slowly her mind became less confused and sought the origins of her exaltation, which were twofold and could be limited by an effort to the persons of Mr Hirst and Mr Hewet. Any clear analysis of them was impossible owing to the haze of wonder in which they were enveloped. She could not reason about them as about people whose feelings went by the same rule as her own did, and her mind dwelt on them with a kind of physical pleasure such as is caused by the contemplation of bright things hanging in the sun. From them all life seemed to radiate; the very words of books were steeped in radiance. She then became haunted by a suspicion which she was so reluctant to face that she welcomed a trip and stumble over the grass because thus her attention was dispersed, but in a second it had collected itself again. Unconsciously she had been walking faster and faster, her body trying to outrun her mind; but she was now on the summit of a little hillock of earth which rose above the river and displayed the valley. She was no longer able to juggle with several ideas, but must deal with the most persistent, and a kind of melancholy replaced her excitement. She sank down on to the earth, clasping her knees together, and looking blankly in front of her. For some time she observed a great yellow butterfly, which was opening and closing its wings very slowly on a little flat stone.",

I asked if they were Indians, or mixed blood. No, they are coolies! Their hair, full grown, and the usual dress of the country which they wore, had not suggested to me the Chinese; but the shape and expression of the eye make it plain. These are the victims of the trade of which we hear so much. I have met them everywhere, the newly arrived in Chinese costume, with shaved heads … I must inform myself on the subject of this strange development of the domination of capital over labour. I am told there is a mart for coolies in Havana. This I must see, if it is to be seen.’",

This is when groundwater is heated by magma?essentially, a steam eruption without the lava injection. The resulting hydrothermal activity created a series of spectacular, bubbling, sulphuric acid pools that are extremely acidic and salty. Arata, one of our local Afar guides, showed us springs that had not been there just a week ago, explaining to us that Dallol is constantly changing and very unstable. For our safety, he urged us to follow his footsteps with precision, lest we fall through the porous rock into one of the acidic springs. I was absolutely mesmerized. I had never seen anything like this in all my travels. The ground was covered by a crust of salt and solidified black lava with unearthly, luminescent pools of yellow and green, steaming acidic vapour, bubbling up like a cauldron, and just inches below us toxic gases seeped through the ground we were walking on and choked the air with a pungent smell.",

I used to be pretty generally unsympathetic about ecclesiastical structures hectoring visitors for funds, but then I met the vicar of the University Church of St. Mary the Virgin in Oxford—the most-visited parish church in England—and learned that its three hundred thousand annual visitors between them deposit a miserly £8,000 in the collection boxes, since which time I have mellowed considerably. I mean to say, these are glorious structures and deserve our grateful support. But Salisbury, I must say, takes things a good step beyond what I would call discreet solicitation.",

(Seemingly bears always go for the jugular vein.) Luckily the poor chap lost consciousness at this stage and the bear, presuming him dead, made off. Soon after, he came to and dragged himself home, where his wife bathed and bandaged the appalling gashes. But it was then too late to begin the long walk to the hospital, so the patient spent a night of agony before setting out at dawn with his friends’ assistance. One is repeatedly astounded by the powers of endurance of these frail-looking peasants.

The trail zigzagged down rugged steps of rock, forcing me to watch my footing—but I refused to slow my pace, thundering on. Passing a father and daughter hiking up, I asked them if they’d seen Kydoime, but they hadn’t. The daughter said they’d stopped for lunch, so they might have missed her. Down, down, down, I trod—until at last the slope leveled out at a wide river crossing below a tumbling falls. The water was shallow, with rocks lining the side for safety, so I pushed on—barely stopping long enough to admire the magnificent cascade or think about the fact that I was actually walking through a waterfall!",

For four hundred miles through Virginia, the Blue Ridge is essentially a single long fin, only a mile or two wide, notched here and there with deep, V-shaped passes called gaps but otherwise holding generally steady at about 3,000 feet, with the broad green Valley of Virginia stretching off to the Allegheny Mountains to the west and lazy pastoral piedmont to the east. So here each time we hauled ourselves to a mountaintop and stepped onto a rocky overlook, instead of seeing nothing but endless tufted green mountains stretching to the horizon, we got airy views of a real, lived-in world: sunny farms, clustered hamlets, clumps of woodland, and winding highways, all made exquisitely picturesque by distance. Even an interstate highway, with its cloverleaf interchanges and parallel roadways, looked benign and thoughtful, like the illustrations you used to get in children’s books in my boyhood, showing an America that was busy and on the move but not too busy to be attractive.",

They complained, I think, that Amah, the second headman, favoured the Bande carriers; they didn’t do their share of the water-carrying. They asked that Amah should cease to be second headman. The fight went on a long while and I was glad to be a little drunk. But I slept badly; what Daddy had told me in Sierra Leone came back now when my nerves were tired with the marches and the squabble. I imagined all night that leeches were falling on my face.

These processions are especially spectacular and photogenic. There may be two or three in a single afternoon, each led by several little girls, dressed in the finest traditional clothing that money can buy. The members enter the temple as a group, and their offerings, all stacked in the area in front of where prayers are said, make a lovely sight.",

School let out, we were broke, and all I wanted, despite my earlier pledge to step off the seasonal treadmill, was to get back into the woods. To let my brain release, feel my body’s rhythm become primary again. And so, when the applications we’d filed in mid-winter “just in case” resulted in job offers, Gabe and I accepted. Instead of West Glacier, the town of Cordova. Instead of the NPS, the US Forest Service. A new crew, new foreman, mountains and water we’d never laid eyes on.",
