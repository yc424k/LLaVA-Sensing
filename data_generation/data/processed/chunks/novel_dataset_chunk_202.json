The hours between dinner and bedtime were always difficult enough to kill, and the night after the dance they were further tarnished by the peevishness of dissipation. Certainly, in the opinion of Hirst and Hewet, who lay back in long armchairs in the middle of the hall, with their coffee-cups beside them, and their cigarettes in their hands, the evening was unusually dull, the women unusually badly dressed, the men unusually fatuous. Moreover, when the mail had been distributed half an hour ago there were no letters for either of the two young men. As every other person, practically, had received two or three plump letters from England, which they were now engaged in reading, this seemed hard, and prompted Hirst to make the caustic remark that the animals had been fed. Their silence, he said, reminded him of the silence in the lion-house when each beast holds a lump of raw meat in its paws. He went on, stimulated by this comparison, to liken some to hippopotamuses, some to canary birds, some to swine, some to parrots, and some to loathsome reptiles curled round the half-decayed bodies of sheep. The intermittent sounds—now a cough, now a horrible wheezing or throat-clearing, now a little patter of conversation—were just, he declared, what you hear if you stand in the lion-house when the bones are being mauled. But these comparisons did not rouse Hewet, who, after a careless glance round the room, fixed his eyes upon a thicket of native spears which were so ingeniously arranged as to run their points at you whichever way you approached them. He was clearly oblivious of his surroundings; whereupon Hirst, perceiving that Hewet’s mind was a complete blank, fixed his attention more closely upon his fellow-creatures. He was too far from them, however, to hear what they were saying, but it pleased him to construct little theories about them from their gestures and appearance.",

The coach soon left us far behind. Pretty soon, the barrenness of the land gave way to spiny, hostile vegetation,—the cactus and the mesquite. We strung out along a deep rut between the gigantic chaparral, choked with the mighty cloud of alkali dust, scratched and torn by the thorny brush. Sometimes emerging in an open space, we could see the straight road climbing the summits of the rolling desert, until the eye couldn’t follow it; but we knew it must be there, still farther and farther again. Not a breath of wind stirred.\nThe vertical sun beat down with a fury that made one reel. And most of the troop, who had been drunk the night before, began to suffer terribly. Their lips glazed, cracked, turned dark blue. I didn’t hear a single word of complaint; but there was nothing of the lighthearted joking and rollicking of other days. José Valiente taught me how to chew mesquite twigs, but that didn’t help much.",

The waltz music took the words ‘calling and answering each other’ and flung them out; but as it repeated the same rhythm again and again, it coarsened them, it destroyed them. The dance music interfered with everything. At first exciting, then it became boring and finally intolerable. Yet it was only twenty minutes to one.",

The hexagonal-shaped enclosure seems to go on and on, the jungle exploding around and inside it, vibrant green with red and orange lobster-claw petals. Trees shoot upwards, mahoganies and gringo trees, strangler figs, spiky ochoo trees, striped bamboo, walking and huicungo palms, banana plants, lemon and mandarin trees, spreading carpets of flat and bulbous spicy seeds across the swamp. The whine of mosquitoes is unreal, the temperature scalding. It smells sweet, wafting on bursts of heat. I follow a path about six metres wide around the outside of the fence. Ru’s lying down, his handsome, strong head pressed against the side. He’s thinking about pawing the ground again, trying to dig his way out. It’s never far from his mind. But when I start to move, he watches with half an amber eye. It’s only when I reach the first corner and I’m almost out of sight that he gets up. I feel rather than hear his muscles bunching.",

And the situation was rendered none the less complex by the attitude of Miss Wilberforce herself. She was a Tartar. She felt that all men's hands were against her. She used her tongue to good purpose and, at a pinch, her teeth and claws. The policemen of Nepenthe could bear witness to that fact. Drunk, she had a perfectly blistering flow of invective at command. Sober, she was apt to indulge in a dignified bestiality of logic that cut like a knife. It was only in the intermediate stage that she was affable and human. But to catch her in that intermediate stage was extremely difficult. It was of such very brief duration.",

The cries of the senseless beasts rang in her ears high and low in the air, as they ran from tree-trunk to tree-top. How small the little figures looked wandering through the trees! She became acutely conscious of the little limbs, the thin veins, the delicate flesh of men and women, which breaks so easily and lets the life escape compared with these great trees and deep waters. A falling branch, a foot that slips, and the earth has crushed them or the water drowned them. Thus thinking, she kept her eyes anxiously fixed upon the lovers, as if by doing so she could protect them from their fate. Turning, she found the Flushings by her side.",

They seemed to know we were the dusty caravaners who had trudged past the afternoon before, and we were well stared at” In the church, too, an imposing lady in the pew in front of us sat sideways in her corner and examined us with calm attention through her eye-glass both before the service began and during it whenever the sitting portions of the ritual were reached. She was, we afterwards discovered, the lady of the manor or chief lady in the place, and it was in one of her fields we were camping. We heard that afternoon from the farmer that she had privately visited our camp the evening before with her bailiff and his dogs and observed us, also with the aid of her eye-glass, over the hedge as we sat absorbed round our supper, doubtful whether we were not a circus and ought not instantly to be moved on. I fancy the result of her scrutiny in church was very satisfactory. She could not fail to see that here she had to do with a gentleman of noble birth, and the ladies of the party, in pews concealing their short skirts but displaying their earrings, were seen to every advantage. I caught her eye so repeatedly that at last, quite involuntarily, and yielding to a natural instinct, I bowed—a little, not deeply out of considerations of time and place. She did not return my bow, nor did she after that look again, but attended during the rest of the service to her somewhat neglected devotions.",

A moment later she vanished, having stepped on to our roof, from which a lot of liquid could be heard cascading into the Mekong. Bertie raised his head, registered his wife’s absence, lowered his head. Doubtless he was feeling battle-weary. For the next ten minutes Bessie paced the roof, excitedly talking to herself – so loudly that her voice though not her words could be heard between hammer blows. On the way back she faltered and for a moment was hanging between the two craft, a hand clinging to each roof, her feet seeking a hold on No. 127. As I moved to help she made it, unaided, and half fell on to my bedding – still talking to herself. Or rather, I now realized, still talking to Bertie …",

The\ncity ran very low upon the ground in street after street of diminutive\ntwo-storied houses. Each house was joined on to the next, porch to porch\nand bow window to bow window, alternating in an endless series, a\nmachine-made pattern that repeated; a pattern monotonous and yet\nfantastic in its mingling of purple, white, and red. Each had the same\nlittle mat of grass laid before each bow window, the same little\nred-tiled path from gate to front door, the same front door decorated\nwith elaborate paneling and panes of colored glass, the same little\nmachine-made iron gate, the same low red wall and iron railing and\nprivet hedge; so indistinguishably, so maddeningly alike were all these\ndiminutive houses. Each roof had the same purple slates, each roof tree\nthe same red earthwork edging it like a lace; the same red tiles roofed\neach porch and faced each gable and the space between the stories. Only\nwhen your eyes became accustomed to the endless running pattern could\nyou trace it clearly, grasp the detail, note that every two bow windows\nwere separated by one rain pipe, every two porches sustained by one\npillar, one diminutive magnificent purple pillar, simulating porphyry\nand crowned with a rich Corinthian capital in freestone, the outline of\neach porch being picked out and made clear and decisive with woodwork\npainted white. Then, and not till then, did you see that the\nall-important detail was the porphyry pillar, for it was as if every two\nhouses sprang from it as two flowers from one stem.",

In Japanese baseball, however, I felt that something more complex must be going on. For in baseball, Japan had taken over not just an American prop but an American rite, a living drama, a healthy slice of the All-American Pie. More than designer jeans or Burger Kings or the Beach Boys, baseball occupied a special place in the American imagination. It was, in a sense, the story that America told itself about what it could be, its rose-tinted image of an Unfallen garden where all races worked together and heroes walked tall on sunlit patches of green, while families watched the rites of innocence over hot dogs and Cokes on a never-ending summer’s afternoon. Baseball was in many ways a repository for certain cherished aspects of the American Daydream.",

    "target_paragraph": "Then in 1995 Aum Shinrikyo gained sudden notoriety when it released extravagant quantities of the nerve gas sarin into the Tokyo subway system, killing twelve people. In the investigations that followed, it emerged that Aum’s substantial holdings included a 500,000-acre desert property in Western Australia very near the site of the mystery event. There, authorities found a laboratory of unusual sophistication and focus, and evidence that cult members had been mining uranium. It separately emerged that Aum had recruited into its ranks two nuclear engineers from the former Soviet Union. The group’s avowed aim was the destruction of the world, and it appears that the event in the desert may have been a dry run for blowing up Tokyo.",

    "target_paragraph": "This whole incident illustrates some of the typical hazards met with in the world of Tibetan officialdom. One can’t help feeling on occasions that there must be powerful motives, of which we are completely ignorant, behind certain baffling and apparently stupid Tibetan attitudes. Actually we know too little about these people even to begin to understand why they act and speak as they do. In the present case there could be alternative (or complementary) reasons to the one already suggested as an explanation of Mrs Tsiring Dolma’s unco-operativeness. For instance, Tsiring Thondup may be an Incarnate Lama (it’s strongly rumoured that some of our children are) or there could be other grounds, more convincing than his orphan state but unimaginable to us, why he should not be moved to Simla. But the Tibetans, maintaining their traditional xenophobic policy, are always reluctant to clarify these situations. This is especially regrettable when so many of us are anxious to be given the opportunity to understand and would be willing, where possible, to adjust our demands to their outlook.",

At 11 a.m. Margaret dropped Jennifer and me at a junction on the Soweto Highway, about a mile from the FNB stadium. There was little ‘normal’ traffic; today the SAP limited it throughout the PWV area. Many other pedestrians coming from Soweto were crossing the dusty littered veld and the two elderly white females – arriving on foot! – were regarded with much curiosity, some friendliness, no hostility. Turning left onto a dirt road, we passed a grove of ancient plane trees – stately giants – and between them glimpsed the Rand’s oldest ‘residential area’, a short nameless street of seven little red-brick houses belonging to Crown Mines. This isolated (perhaps forgotten?) hamlet remained ‘mixed’ – Coloured and white – throughout the apartheid era.",

These are drab little notices, impersonal, nobody claiming that they will do this or that if elected; nor are there any canvassing visits, posters, leaflets, loud-hailers, rallies, telephone calls or TV appearances. At no stage is money involved; the state provides the A4 notices. Winning or losing does not evoke the same emotions as in our world. Losing may be a personal disappointment – but no cash has been wasted. Winning is taken calmly, and not as Step One to prosperity; Cuba has no greasy pole on the political field. (I wouldn’t know about the joint-venture field.) Those elected (who may be anything from lawyers and street-sweepers to factory hands and professors) continue in their jobs while working as unpaid public representatives. In local government only the president, vice-president and secretary of each municipal assembly – officials elected by the delegates – receive salaries. Twice a year, at accountability sessions, delegates must listen to planteamientos (suggestions and complaints of local importance) and representatives found unsatisfactory by their constituents may be ‘recalled’ (sacked) and replaced in what we would call a by-election. Municipal delegates are responsible for the day-to-day running of their neighbourhoods. They organise mini-brigades to build houses for the community, maintain organoponicos to feed the community, oversee local schools, polyclinics and factories – and participate, if trade unionists, in the planning and management of their enterprises. They are on duty twenty-four hours a day seven days a week and may be approached at any time by any constituent with any sort of problem from a family row to a burst water main.",

In 2010, when I needed a morning off from debriefing police torture victims in Tijuana, I knew a wave, a glossy left, just across the border, and that was where I ran. In 2011, I was in Madagascar with a team of reptile experts who were trying to stop poachers from driving a rare, golden-shelled tortoise into extinction. The team members could talk turtles, snakes, and lizards all day, all night. They could bushwhack, it seemed, indefinitely through killing heat if they thought a good specimen might be hiding under a rock out there. I realized at some point that Selya and I were much the same, minus the science and conservationism, about surfing. We could talk waves until any nonsurfers in earshot, starting with our wives, fled in horror. We did it on surf runs, over surf mags and videos, at sidewalk cafés on Broadway, trading shots of tequila, which Selya called “loudmouth soup.” The topic was inexhaustible, in our view, its finer points effectively infinite. In Madagascar, my companions decided to launch yet another expedition to see yet another tortoise, and I bailed out, going off the clock in a coastal town called Fort Dauphin, where I found a board—a beat-up but serviceable 6'6\"—and surfed myself to exhaustion in rowdy, wind-ripped waves for three days until they returned.",

Rather than going straight to the sentinel tree, Wayra plonks herself down in what seems to be her favourite spot in the middle of the runner. As if she knows she’s not walking today and she wouldn’t want to, even if she could. Her spot is a little dip of grass between a tall, nimble tree with bark that smells of baked pepper and a patch of knee-high young patuju. It is so well cared for, raked meticulously every day by Jane, that it looks like a garden. Wayra’s garden. She rolls onto her side, belly blindingly bright, and looks straight at Jane. Wilderness hangs off her. She might disappear. I’d believe it if I blinked and the rope was gone, she was gone. I make to move forwards but I can’t, the force around her pushing me backwards without my feet even moving. But Jane walks straight up to her. Wayra doesn’t hiss or grumble. The wild smell fades, dissipates, flows and then grows even stronger. Jane ducks her head, leans her face down. And the two of them sit cheek-to-cheek, forehead-to-forehead. I have stopped breathing. We’ve spent five days in the boiling heat and humidity being bitten to shit by mozzies just so we can watch this angry, stubborn cat sleep no more than ten minutes from her cage. I’d assumed that was it. That’s what this month would be.",

Over the previous few years, I’d been experimenting with my own barefoot revival. I’d walked five miles across the White Peak in Derbyshire: over waterworn limestone that felt glassy as marble, up terraces of wiry grass littered with the striped shells of snails, over hilltops of thistly pasture and at last down on a warm footpath to a river, in one of whose bankside pools I gratefully bathed my feet.* In the Black Mountains of Wales I walked for most of a summer’s day along paths of Old Red Sandstone, worn to an ultra-fine grade of dust that was soft as rouge powder. I spent half a day barefoot on the chalk downs and beech woods of south Cambridgeshire with Matt, an archaeologist friend. Early on, we both picked up on our feet a blackish tree-sap or resin, tar-like in texture. The resin acted as a sampler of the ground over which we walked – as the wax in the bottom of a lead-line samples the seabed – and we both acquired a layer of seeds, dust and leaf fragments on our soles. And in Essex’s Epping Forest, wandering through glade and shade, I began to feel the changes of habitat underfoot: the different plants that populated each zone according to the available light, and the different temperatures of the leaf-litter. Then I trod on a holly leaf, and in trying to get away from the holly leaf I trod on a sprig of hawthorn, and so I spent five minutes tweezering bits of the forest from my heel.",

    "target_paragraph": "Among serious writers of fiction, only Sinclair Lewis enjoyed robust sales in the summer of 1927. Elmer Gantry was far and away the bestselling fiction work of the year. A satire on evangelist preachers, it was roundly condemned across the nation, especially by evangelist preachers. The fundamentalist firebrand Billy Sunday, apprised of its content, called on God “to strike Lewis dead,” which doesn’t seem terribly Christian of him. The Reverend C. S. Sparkes of the Congregational Church of Sauk Centre, Minnesota, Lewis’s own hometown, bitterly contrasted Lewis with the saintly Charles Lindbergh, saying that Lewis possessed a mind “that is dead?dead to goodness and purity and righteousness,” while Lindbergh was “clean in mind and soul.”",
