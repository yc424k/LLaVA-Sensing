Allegedly the Group Areas Act spared this Muslim district because the authorities recognized its potential as a ‘picturesque’ tourist attraction. But Bo-Kaap is not merely picturesque; it has that indefinable quality usually defined as ‘character’. The district covers less than a square mile. Some streets run level along the side of Signal Hill, intersecting with other vertical streets which climb and climb until one is level with the sheer, gaunt, upper slopes of Table Mountain – from here Cape Town’s city centre ‘developments’ look like Lego constructions. All these narrow cobbled streets are lined with one-storey, narrow-fronted, flat-roofed terraced houses on high stoeps, painted in contrasting colours. Many date from the 1780s and have family names engraved over the main entrance. Some are in a sad state of disrepair, others have recently been restored.",

It felt colder, much colder down there. My feet, heavy with boots and crampons, kicked in emptiness, until I realized this might dislodge me and I let them hang, toe-downwards, and spread my arms out across the snow, in the upper world. There was a sensation of unknowable depth beneath me and I was gripped by a terrible vertigo. It was the same feeling as when, aged thirteen, I stepped from the brink of a yacht into sea several miles off the coast of Corsica, where the charts showed a submarine trench of 4,000 feet. The water was clear, tinged with blue. My brother and I dropped two silver centimes and with scuba masks watched their slow bright tumble, head over tail, for what seemed like hours through the water. Suddenly I was seized with panic, with the fear of losing my buoyancy and tumbling helplessly downwards after the coins. I had to be pulled from the water by my father, who cupped me under my armpits and lifted me out in one fluid movement, trailing a tail of sea water.",

The good news is, there’s a second entrance a few miles downwind, the Avatoru Pass, which is rumored to have much gentler currents. Since it’s referred to as the “easy pass” in our guidebook, selecting a point of entry into the lagoon seems like a nobrainer to me.",

They rooted around and found some dry clothes and helped him into them, covering his feet with dry woolen socks. As Chafe sipped his third cup of tea, they began to exchange stories. Chafe lay back onto some skins and listened quietly. After they’d become separated, Munro said, he and Clam had spent a little time looking for him, but because Clam had been soaked to the neck, and since they had none of the food, they knew their only chance was to hurry back to Shore Camp as quickly as possible.

The day before he was taken—raging—to the hospital, he told his companion to pick the hot red peppers growing in the backyard and berated her, hoarsely and loudly, for handling them carelessly. He scolded me, too, though the peppers were a gift to me, for not knowing how to grow or pick them—and this I found bracing.",

The wheezy elderly man opposite me wore a fox-fur jacket and sat with his multi-ringed hands elapsing a gross pot belly. His younger swarthy companion – sitting beside me – had compressed lips and blood-shot eyes and carried an expensive camera. Both feigned to ignore me and as friendship seemed unlikely to burgeon I applied myself to note-taking – in between trying to catch and hold the waitress’s attention. Here was no over-manning and that solitary, sweating young woman had a forgivably anti-human glint in her eye.",

If a single instance is of use in framing a theory, it may be said that the minutes between nine-twenty-five and nine-thirty in the morning had a singular charm for Mary Datchet. She spent them in a very enviable frame of mind; her contentment was almost unalloyed. High in the air as her flat was, some beams from the morning sun reached her even in November, striking straight at curtain, chair, and carpet, and painting there three bright, true spaces of green, blue, and purple, upon which the eye rested with a pleasure which gave physical warmth to the body.",

This was a peculiarly stressful time for the pro-democracy intellectuals, as day by day the ominous design of the election campaign became clearer. In friends’ flats I saw for myself the manipulation of public opinion through the Front’s complete control of the national television service. By 20 May I was sufficiently expert with my crutches to tour six polling-stations, in and near Cluj. Voting was indeed ‘fair’, as elsewhere in Rumania – apart from minor incidents. During the previous two months a campaign of systematic intimidation – ranging from subtle threats to lethal physical violence – had ensured that an outwardly honest ballot would give the Front a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly and make Iliescu President with 86 per cent of the votes. There was no need for ballot-rigging, so effective had been the mind-rigging of the electorate.",

Above which canyon? Hanging out, yes, but in which current?” He laid his right hand gently on one of the stubby gear-sticks. He glanced at the radar-screen on which the freed windscreen-wiper went round and round and, far from pitching into panic, he seemed to grow further into his alpha-male equilibrium. “I’m sorry, Redmond, forgive me, but you must understand, it’s a terrible thing at sea—it’s the one big sin, it’s a crime really, among sailors, it’s not right, to leave your bridge unmanned. I know, I know, your poncy round-the-world yachtsmen and-women do it! But then that’s who they are, what they’re like, all alone, showing off, and if we run them down we get the blame! But the fact is they’re not the only ones, because sodding great tankers do it too! Can you imagine that? You’re registered in Liberia or whatever, there’s no law out at sea, so you stick it on autopilot, just like a round-the-world-twice yachtswoman, and you go to sleep! Can you imagine that?

We were deep in the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, in what looked to be primeval forest, but Harry said that homesteading had actually been attempted in the area starting in the 1920s. “Some ranchers came here and saw all this grass and thought it would be a good place for cattle,” he said. Livestock and bears don’t mix, for obvious reasons. Several cattle ranchers pushed for the complete eradication of bears. In 1963, Alaska’s governor approved a secret program to deal with the perceived problem. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game mounted a semiautomatic rifle onto a Piper Super Cub, which patrolled for bears. When a target animal was spotted, the pilot circled above until the copilot could get a clean shot. One rancher recalled, “If a bear hid in the alders, firecrackers were dropped in the bushes and the bear would come running out.” The aerial slaughter ended a year later, but a few ranchers still raise cattle on Kodiak, which, as Harry notes in his book, with typical understatement, “has proven to be a challenging enterprise.”",

We resisted the temptation to stop for more pictures and picked up the pace in order to reach camp before nightfall. Upon arrival, our individual tents would still need to be set up, and our preference was not to do this exercise in total darkness. As soon as the tents were up, those who still had some energy would do their best to ‘de-sand’ and treat blisters and other sores. Since showers were not an option, we freshened up by using wet wipes in the privacy of our tents. By day two, I had given up trying to brush the sand out of my hair, which had turned into a matted, straw-like mass. But it didn’t matter, I was loving every minute of this beautiful and unique experience with my team.",

We had run out of food the night before, and had been planning a run to Lahaina, the nearest town, which was twelve miles away, for provisions. That plan was postponed indefinitely. We scavenged for nutrients—gnawing old mango rinds, scraping out soup cans, choking down bread previously rejected as moldy. We grabbed our boards and jogged around the point, screaming “Fuck!” and hooting nervously at each gray set that passed the headland, darkening on the final turn into the bay.",

Or, I can go left which is a short way to Salen and the Salen Hotel. The dilemmas are that the weather is predicted to be continued cold and windy. Going right means terrific scenery but a headwind and winter camping. Alternatively, I have been warned both in Oban and Mull that left, the dual lane carriageway between Craignure and Salen, is not safe for cyclists. It is putatively very hilly and even the most experienced cyclists avoid it. But, “left” means a welcome tailwind. I also can’t reconcile the OS contours with “hilly” since it appears to run along the coast and be flat. I decide to let the fates decide.",

Words for one poem, then for the other, continued to surge up, mingling, confused and exciting, in his half-awakened brain. Sometimes he lingered on one for the sake of its own beauty, and suddenly a new poem would bud from it, as if the word had been a seed plunged into the heated atmosphere of his imagination. Disconnected, unmeaning, alluring, they strung themselves out on one bit of paper after another, till he threw down his pen and buried his rumpled head in his hands. Through his dream he heard a knock, and started up. It was Mrs. Tracy coming in with a cup of coffee. He mustn’t mind about having slept so long, she told him at once--it was the best thing for him, after his illness and the long journey. “Sleep is the young people’s best doctor,” she said with one of her sad smiles. “But you didn’t eat much last night, and you’d better drink this coffee right off, while it’s hot. It won’t keep you from wanting your dinner by and by, I hope.” She put the tray down beside him while he stammered his excuses, and went on, in the same friendly tone, with a glance at the litter of paper at his elbow: “If you’ve got any work to get through, I guess you’ll be cooler down on the back porch than here; there’s a little breeze from the river. We always get one of these heat waves in June.”",

How many times have you been married? Do you have a car? And can you drive across the King Fahd Causeway?” The causeway was the highway built in 1986 between Saudi and the island of Bahrain. It is linked by several islands in the middle. We traveled that road frequently since Bahrain was our bolt-hole for parties, drinking, fun and great haircuts. These questions were the trademark of many single women who were longing for more freedom and looking for males who could facilitate that.",

So it struck me as odd the way the twin-engine whumped down, hitting hard onto the strip and not bouncing back up like a light aircraft should. It taxied over, and the pilot shook his head at me through his window.",

It made for rough going, especially as William and I were both wearing cheap rubber boots, the same as those commonly used by campesinos and long ago adopted by the FARC. The thin soles provided no protection from the rocks, forcing one to pay attention to every step, disrupting the rhythm and slowing the pace. It made you wonder how guerrilla armies managed to move as they did, with such an impediment. I remarked to no one in particular that if all that cocaine money had been used to equip the cadres with decent boots, the outcome of the war might well have been different. William’s face revealed that even the thought of a FARC victory was something too terrible to joke about.",

The sinuous path cut through a rainforest of spruce and hemlock to reach a waterfall. “Just one thing?there was a bear spotted yesterday, so you’ll really need to bring bear spray.” She held up a small can that looked like a miniature fire extinguisher and contained weaponized chili pepper extract. “It’s fifty dollars for the can, and I’m sorry you’re not allowed to take it on an airplane,” she said.",

    "target_paragraph": "The papers strove hard to portray Ruth Snyder as an evil temptress. “Her naturally blonde hair was marcelled to perfection,” wrote one observer tartly, as if that alone confirmed her guilt. The Mirror dubbed her “the marble woman without a heart.” Elsewhere she was called “the human serpent,” “the ice woman,” and, in a moment of journalistic hyperventilation, “the Swedish-Norwegian vampire.” Nearly all reports dwelt on Ruth Snyder’s deadly good looks, but this was either delusional or selectively generous. By 1927, Ruth Snyder was thirty-six years old, plump, haggard, and worn. Her complexion was blotchy, her expression an iron scowl. Franker commentators doubted that she had ever been attractive. A reporter for The New Yorker suggested: “No one has yet satisfactorily analyzed the interest that attaches to Ruth Snyder.… Her irresistible charm is visible only to Judd Gray.” Gray, with his heavy round glasses, looked improbably wise and professorial, and much older than his thirty-five years. In photographs he wore an expression of perpetual startlement, as if he couldn’t believe where he now found himself.",

Its base was littered with brown rubble and its sides, curving steeply, carried what looked like black tidemarks. But this was not rubble or grey shingle; this was old snow, gone the colour and texture of earth. Down one side of the valley the line of pilgrims, going and coming, stretched; and there, far away, they were crossing the ice bed, mere specks, robbed of all but the brightest colour, distinguishable only by their movement from the rubbled surface of the snow. Here was a mountain, there a valley and a river: the geography of these ranges was simple, easily grasped. But one had brought to them the scale of a smaller, managed world, and it was only at times like these, seeing a line of men swiftly diminished within what seemed a small space, that one realized what distances these Himalayas held.",

Many times during the years of desperate confinement and labour on the book I had thought of it with intense longing, as men in prison, haltered to all the dusty shackles of the hour, have longed for the haunted woods and meadows of Cockaigne. Many times I had gone back to it in my dreams--to the sunken bell, the Gothic towns, the plash of waters in the midnight fountain, the Old Place, the broken chime, and the blonde flesh of secret, lavish women. Then at last came the day when I walked at morning through the Brandenburger Tor, and into the enchanted avenues of the faery green Tiergarten, and found that Fame had come to me. It was May, and I walked below the blossoms of the great horse-chestnut trees, and felt like Tamerlane, that it was passing fine to be a king and move in triumph through Persepolis--and be a famous man.",

His mental attitude towards Sir Herbert Street and his American employer was not tinged with the faintest cloud of disrespect; for van Koppen, indeed, he cherished a liking which bordered on affection. He detected in the astute American what nobody else could detect—an element of childlike freshness and simplicity. As far apart, in externals, as two distant trees whose leaves are fluttering on either side of some tangled forest, he yet felt that their roots were interwoven below ground, drawing common life and nourishment and sympathies from that old teeming soil of human aspirations. Nor was he vainglorious of his achievement. His superiority over the art-expert he took as a gift of the gods. Vanityi was abhorrent to his nature. He was not proud but glad—glad to have been able to reconquer his legitimate social position; glad, above all things, to have forged a link with the past—a key to admit him into the fellowship of Lysippus and those others whose august shades, he opined, were even them smiling upon him. The Locri Faun was his handiwork. He was \"entitled to dine well,\" as he had told Denis. That was what he now purposed to do. One master-stroke had repaired his fortunes. It sufficed. Nothing overmuch. Count Caloveglia knew the story of Polycrates, the too-fortunate man. He knew what lies in wait for the presumptuous mortal whoo oversteps the boundary of what is fair and good.

    "target_paragraph": "III\nMorning. As he awoke he perceived drowsily that the room had at the same moment become dense with sunlight. The ebony panels of one wall had slid aside on a sort of track, leaving his chamber half open to the day. A large negro in a white uniform stood beside his bed.\n“Good-evening,” muttered John, summoning his brains from the wild places.\n“Good-morning, sir. Are you ready for your bath, sir? Oh, don’t get up—I’ll put you in, if you’ll just unbutton your pyjamas—there. Thank you, sir.”\nJohn lay quietly as his pyjamas were removed—he was amused and delighted; he expected to be lifted like a child by this black Gargantua who was tending him, but nothing of the sort happened; instead he felt the bed tilt up slowly on its side—he began to roll, startled at first, in the direction of the wall, but when he reached the wall its drapery gave way, and sliding two yards farther down a fleecy incline he plumped gently into water the same temperature as his body.\nHe looked about him. The runway or rollway on which he had arrived had folded gently back into place. He had been projected into another chamber and was sitting in a sunken bath with his head just above the level of the floor. All about him, lining the walls of the room and the sides and bottom of the bath itself, was a blue aquarium, and gazing through the crystal surface on which he sat, he could see fish swimming among amber lights and even gliding without curiosity past his outstretched toes, which were separated from them only by the thickness of the crystal. From overhead, sunlight came down through sea-green glass.\n“I suppose, sir, that you’d like hot rosewater and soapsuds this morning, sir—and perhaps cold salt water to finish.”\nThe negro was standing beside him.\n“Yes,” agreed John, smiling inanely, “as you please.” Any idea of ordering this bath according to his own meagre standards of living would have been priggish and not a little wicked.\nThe negro pressed a button and a warm rain began to fall, apparently from overhead, but really, so John discovered after a moment, from a fountain arrangement nearby. The water turned to a pale rose colour and jets of liquid soap spurted into it from four miniature walrus heads at the corners of the bath. In a moment a dozen little paddle-wheels, fixed to the sides, had churned the mixture into a radiant rainbow of pink foam which enveloped him softly with its delicious lightness, and burst in shining, rosy bubbles here and there about him.\n“Shall I turn on the moving-picture machine, sir?” suggested the negro deferentially. “There’s a good one-reel comedy in this machine to-day, or I can put in a serious piece in a moment, if you prefer it.”\n“No, thanks,” answered John, politely but firmly. He was enjoying his bath too much to desire any distraction. But distraction came. In a moment he was listening intently to the sound of flutes from just outside, flutes dripping a melody that was like a waterfall, cool and green as the room itself, accompanying a frothy piccolo, in play more fragile than the lace of suds that covered and charmed him.\nAfter a cold salt-water bracer and a cold fresh finish, he stepped out and into a fleecy robe, and upon a couch covered with the same material he was rubbed with oil, alcohol, and spice. Later he sat in a voluptuous chair while he was shaved and his hair was trimmed.\n“Mr. Percy is waiting in your sitting-room,” said the negro, when these operations were finished. “My name is Gygsum, Mr. Unger, sir. I am to see to Mr. Unger every morning.”\nJohn walked out into the brisk sunshine of his living-room, where he found breakfast waiting for him and Percy, gorgeous in white kid knickerbockers, smoking in an easy chair.",

He woke to the fact on the morning of his arrival, staring down from his hotel window on a street she would perhaps walk through that very day, and over a limitless huddle of roofs, one of which covered her at that hour. The abruptness of the transition startled him; he had not known that her mere geographical nearness would take him by the throat in that way.

Breakfast was the one satisfactory meal in East Africa though I will never comprehend the theory and practice of cold toast. There were a few other guests in the dining room but aside from murmuring good evening, if glances met, conversation did not occur. Talk at the tables was carried on in whisper voices. The general tone was that of a deadly respectable English provincial hotel. Inside, you hardly knew you were in Africa; outside the night sky told you exactly where you were.",

    "target_paragraph": "At the Lower Nursery, where we lived, some 600 children from one to eight years old were packed into five rooms. Two of these rooms had been recently built, but already the dormitory roof leaked so badly that during the monsoon umbrellas were needed when walking through it. The second new building had been designed as a recreation hall, with a stage for dancing, but because of overcrowding it was now used as another dormitory. It had no beds, which horrified some visitors, though in fact the children were perfectly happy and comfortable sleeping in rows on the wooden floor of the stage. Beds are not essential for Tibetans and can actually be a nuisance where bed-bugs abound; the wood-panelled walls of the old bungalow which formed the nucleus of the camp were swarming with them and unfortunately they soon solved their overpopulation problem by emigrating to the new rooms and to our bungalow.",
