We went through that with every item. Even an aluminum cookset offered considerations of weight, compactness, thermal dynamics, and general utility that could occupy a mind for hours. In between there was lots of discussion about hiking generally, mostly to do with hazards like rockfalls, bear encounters, cookstove explosions, and snakebites, which he described with a certain misty-eyed fondness before coming back to the topic at hand.",

But in Limbo one just floats around: he has not roots—not even hellish roots!—he is tossed about upon a sea of doubts; he doesn’t know where he is; or where the end or the beginning of anything is!",

We followed a bellman up an elevator and through a long, winding hallway to our room where we found a palatial, albeit junior, suite outfitted with marble floors, high-definition television, lounge chairs, writing desk, and a king-sized bed dressed in fine linens. Teresa brewed a cup of tea and met me outside, on our private balcony, where we enjoyed the scenery. Our balcony overlooked several acres of landscaped gardens and walking paths. Shade trees, palms, beach umbrellas, and waterfront bars lined a sprawling swimming pool. In the distance, past the elegant, open-air restaurants, and beyond the artificial beach of imported sand, the Red Sea shimmered like a sheet of turquoise under the blazing sun. Teresa sipped her tea and scribbled in her journal, while I looked to the sea and wondered how far it was to Saudi Arabia.",

She would sit, engulfing a chintz-covered armchair, chins wobbling, and while describing her golden Quetta days and the breaks for the Simla season, she would quietly drink me under the table. She had pickled herself, and this was the secret of her great longevity. Before luncheon, sipping at glass after glass of very strong gin and Dubonnet, nibbling at Bombay Mix, she would sink into paroxysms of giggles from which it might take five minutes to disentangle her. Then without warning her head would suddenly drop to one side, and she would fall fast asleep, snoring loudly. Often she would not wake until teatime. She got my telegram, and wrote a letter home thanking me for it in large, spidery writing, but I never saw her again. She died a fortnight after I returned, and at her funeral they draped a Union Jack over the coffin. As the body left the church they played ‘Land of Hope and Glory’.",

I see my sister in prayer again later that same day—when she drops to her knees in the middle of the Roman Forum, clears away some litter off the face of the soil (as though erasing a blackboard), then takes up a small stone and draws for me in the dirt a blueprint of a classic Romanesque basilica. She points from her drawing to the ruin before her, leading me to understand (even visually challenged me can understand!) what that building once must have looked like eighteen centuries earlier. She sketches with her finger in the empty air the missing arches, the nave, the windows long gone. Like Harold with his Purple Crayon, she fills in the absent cosmos with her imagination and makes whole the ruined.",

The air seems to hang around the edges of her cage, weighty and expectant. Bursts of leaves are already wet, oozing with moisture, and dripping onto the floor. She’s curled up. She looks so small. Folded, almost nothing more than a lump of fur. But the dappled sunlight catches her eyelashes, betraying her. There’s dried blood on her nose, and that cut on her side has stained her fur dark brown. Her skin is stretched so tightly over her bones she looks skeletal, her ribs like sticks. She’s Wayra but not. She’s a parallel Wayra that has slipped in from another place. I cannot believe this is the same cat I left behind. She was happy. She was safe. Fuck, she wanted to be free. And now she’s this. I press my forehead hard against the fence.",

But best of all we loved the chocolate eclairs. Mr Flying Chicken would have been proud of us. At a small corner table at the back of Minim’s a low-budget appendage to Yves St Laurent’s new Peking Maxim’s, we spent one of the happiest afternoons of the whole journey. We drank small porcelain cups of espresso coffee and ate our way through the café’s entire patisserie shelf: fourteen chocolate eclairs in three hours. When the café closed, we stumbled out into the cold night air, bloated, ill and guilty. We had spent more money in three hours than we had in the previous three weeks.",

If all went well, we would picnic in a park on the river and tour ancient churches all afternoon. The four-mile hike across town would take all day so we packed a bag with supplies: apples liberated from the breakfast buffet, map from the Hilton, Lonely Planet Egypt from AUC, and bottles of water from a nearby street vendor. I rummaged through my backpack for a clean T-shirt and coated myself in sunscreen. Teresa draped a scarf around her head and topped it with an oversized sun hat. Wherever we went that day, we would stand out like the sorest of thumbs, but Teresa didn’t care. “Let’s go,” she said.",

He gunned the motor and we shot across several lanes of cars and trucks and buses and scooters. Their drivers blared their horns and flashed their headlights, but none of them slowed for a moment. Certain that we were about to die, I reached over and squeezed Teresa’s hand, but she hadn’t noticed our near-death experience at all. Instead, she stared through the window and up toward the heavens. I followed her gaze and found something far more interesting than the imminent threat of death by taxi. There was an odd glow on the horizon. It looked a bit like an eclipse – just an orange corona around a silhouette of nothingness. Our driver shouted, “Pyramid!”",

Over these, and lost to the eye gazing in from the outer light, the mouths of the same animals could be heard busily sustaining the above-named warmth and plumpness by quantities of oats and hay.

We crossed the plaza, between the sphinxes, and marched through the pylons, through the courtyards, among headless statues, around the lake, and past the scarab beetle. When we returned to the Great Hypostyle Hall, at the end of our second tour, we found three groups in the shade of the columns. Each of the foreigners wore the unofficial uniform of tourists in Egypt: backpack, shorts, tank top, sunglasses, hat, camera, sunburn, sweat, and bottle of water. From the accents, we guessed the groups were Russian, Dutch, and Japanese, and each group was led by a middle-aged Egyptian tour guide fluent in the languages de rigueur. The children squatted on the plinths or leaned against the columns and rested their bare skin against the cool stones. The adults rocked on their heels, fanned themselves with pamphlets, and tried to listen to their guides. If their guides were half as good as Mohamed, then they were in for a long afternoon.",

I also enjoy the innocence. When I watch an Indian movie I am thirteen again, dreaming that one day a handsome prince will run to me over fields of flowers and, while my long hair flies back in the wind, he will get down on one knee and profess undying love until the end of the world. The soppy lyrics and high passion are all rather adolescent, full of frottage and foreplay. A man and woman may get so close a piece of paper wouldn’t fit between them, but they shall never kiss, let alone have sex. Indians would be too offended and actresses would lose their reputations. The women lose their careers soon enough—after they marry, most find it hard to get roles because Indian men don’t want to see them on screen lest they lust after another man’s wife.",

Just such a reclamation has occurred in the so-called ‘zone of alienation’: the region of north Ukraine that was placed off-limits after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. In Pripiat, the town in which the Chernobyl workers were accommodated, silver birch now throng the empty streets and court-yards. Flower meadows of exceptional botanical diversity have grown up through the paving stones. Forests of pine and willow have populated the city’s outskirts, through which run wolf packs of up to 200 animals. Moose, deer, lynx and boar pad through the city’s suburbs. Black storks nest in its chimneys, bats in the empty houses, and kestrels in the unused window boxes. The cooling ponds of the Chernobyl plant itself are now filled with catfish up to six feet long.",

I handed out payments, we shook hands?firmly with Mateo, softly with Julian?and the rest of us took seats in the Toyota, except for Juvenal, who climbed in the back among the bags and fell asleep. “Good luck, Papi!” Mateo shouted into our dust, waving as we drove off.",

He had not been back since Christmas, and it was the first time he had seen the new hôtel which his step-father had bought, and in which Mr. and Mrs. Moffatt had hastily established themselves, a few weeks earlier, on their return from a flying trip to America. They were always coming and going; during the two years since their marriage they had been perpetually dashing over to New York and back, or rushing down to Rome or up to the Engadine: Paul never knew where they were except when a telegram announced that they were going somewhere else. He did not even know that there was any method of communication between mothers and sons less laconic than that of the electric wire; and once, when a boy at school asked him if his mother often wrote, he had answered in all sincerity: “Oh yes—I got a telegram last week.”",

Then, either because he wanted to see the little numbers pass again, or because he thought he had better leave the camera as he found it, he had tried to reverse the spool, and found, to his dismay, that the screw would not turn that way. He had forced it until it bent; but behind the little red window nothing had moved. Then in terror he had dropped the camera and run to tell the cook, who had boxed his ears.",
