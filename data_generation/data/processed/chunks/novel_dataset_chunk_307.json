There are few complaints, whether of body or soul, that a Japanese bath will not help ease. It is simply a question of separating the functional from the hedonistic. You do not take a Japanese bath in order to wash. You wash before you get into the bath, thus freeing yourself from the obligation of doing anything in the tub itself but wallowing, reviving, gossiping with your neighbors, drowsing, humming, listening to the evening rain.",

It seems every Hindu is free to create and follow his own unique religion, choosing his own gods and methods of worship. The gods of non-Hindus are respected and Hindu gods are generously shared. A young boy called Anu walks me back to my camp and gives me some options for puja. I can look to Hanuman for energy, Varuna (the god of water) if I want rain, Lakshmi (Vishnu’s consort, the goddess of wealth) if I need money and Saraswathi (Brahma’s consort, the goddess of knowledge) if I have an exam coming up. Ganesh (the elephant god and the child of Shiva and Parvati) can be called on when starting a new journey or venture and Vishnu, Rama or Krishna if I want purity of spirit.",

To the north the river emerges from tightly packed mountains and after a few miles it disappears into more tightly packed mountains. Phiangdang stands some way off Route 6, downstream from the bridge, and is a two-street muang – short streets. Yet it is important as the only market centre between Xam Nua and Muang Kham, a small town far away in Xieng Khouang province. And it has a police station, a shabby two-roomed breeze-block bungalow opened once a month (or so) when a policeman comes from Muang Kham. On my arrival people seemed unsure about how to deal with a falang who had not emerged from a four-wheel-drive or a helicopter. But friendliness burgeoned as I wandered around in search of a mechanic, demonstrating Hare’s problem. Understandably, cycling is not part of the Phiangdang way of life; there is virtually no level ground, nor are there any gentle slopes, within a radius of fifty miles. However, it was suggested that one young man, a resident government official from Vientiane, might be able to help – but he wouldn’t be around until sunset.",

Between Nepalese procrastination and Tibetan laziness the whole operation is taking ten times as long as it should and today it was possible to move only half the camp from badly leaking tents into less badly leaking bamboo shelters. I suspect that in this case the Tibetans’ laziness is a form of passive resistance; these nomads obviously prefer the seclusion of their traditional tent life, however inadequate the available tents may be, to the sort of communal existence they will have to endure in the new shelters – and as someone who values privacy far more than comfort I secretly sympathise with them. Having never experienced the persistent damp of a monsoon season they don’t yet realise that their removal to less unsuitable accommodation is literally a matter of life or death – especially as many of them are already in a weakened condition because of the debilitating heat of this valley and an ill-balanced diet.",

The sensation of a multilingual community all working, studying and living in harmony had a magical quality I still long for: that sense of the entire world united and working together in a harmonious and common purpose. While this sounds idyllic and altruistic, were there moments where cultural intelligence was lacking, respect missing and friction emerging between differing lifestyles? Oh yes, but when they did arise, for the most part all kids, parents and faculty learned to accentuate the positives, focus on the shared interests and take a deep breath and practice some mindfulness. The constant practice of returning to those values kept the entire system on track. Somehow the multicultural community articulated a high value on raising well-adapted, highly educated global citizens designed to perpetuate a multicultural world that works for all. From the hiring and training of teachers to curriculum and school policy development, a high intention was placed on turning out kids who would consider themselves global citizens. The kids themselves naturally developed an intention to make the world function better. Diversity and inclusion were baked into the entire experience.",

    "target_paragraph": "Ivan takes after his father in a lot of ways. Jorge’s constant affection with Monica reminds me of Ivan, and there’s a distinct resemblance in their features too. Jorge has the striking looks of an actor, with his thick mane of salt-and-pepper hair and his brawny body. He has the same intense eyes as Ivan. Jorge doesn’t speak a lot, but he listens carefully and chimes in when it’s important. He talks the way he cooks: slowly selecting words to form precise sentences. His careful English is limiting, so most often he chooses to speak in Spanish, which Ivan translates for me. He doesn’t offer the same service for his mother, though. Monica fills space with chatter, throwing the odd Spanish word in the mix. Ivan scorns her when she slips. “Ma. It’s not ‘berenjena,’ it’s ‘eggplant,’ ” he snaps. “Speak in English, otherwise Torre can’t understand you.”",

Around them, in the chaparral, camped nine thousand men without shelter, each man’s horse tied to the mesquite beside him, where hung his one serape and red strips of drying meat. From fifty cars horses and mules were being unloaded. Covered with sweat and dust, a ragged trooper plunged into a cattle-car among the flying hoofs, swung himself upon a horse’s back, and jabbed his spurs deep in, with a yell. Then came a terrific drumming of frightened animals, and suddenly a horse shot violently from the open door, usually backward, and the car belched flying masses of horses and mules. Picking themselves up, they fled in terror, snorting through wide nostrils at the smell of the open. Then the wide, watchful circle of troopers turned vaqueros lifted the great coils of their lassoes through the choking dust, and the running animals swirled round and round upon one another in a panic. Officers, orderlies, generals with their staffs, soldiers with halters, hunting for their mounts, galloped and ran past in inextricable confusion. Bucking mules were being harnessed to the caissons. Troopers who had arrived on the last trains wandered about looking for their brigades. Way ahead some men were shooting at a rabbit. From the tops of the box-cars and the flat-cars, where they were camped by hundreds, the soldaderas and their half-naked swarms of children looked down, screaming shrill advice and asking everybody in general if they had happened to see Juan\nMoñeros, or Jesus Hernandez, or whatever the name of their man happened to be.... One man trailing a rifle wandered along shouting that he had had nothing to eat for two days and he couldn’t find his woman who made his tortillas for him, and he opined that she had deserted him to go with some —— of another brigade.... The women on the roofs of the cars said, \"Valgame Dios!\" and shrugged their shoulders; then they dropped him down some three-days-old tortillas, and asked him, for the love he bore Our Lady of Guadelupe, to lend them a cigarette. A clamorous, dirty throng stormed the engine of our train, screaming for water. When the engineer stood them off with a revolver, telling them there was plenty of water in the water-train, they broke away and aimlessly scattered, while a fresh throng took their places. Around the twelve immense tank-cars, a fighting mass of men and animals struggled for a place at the little faucets ceaselessly pouring. Above the place a mighty cloud of dust, seven miles long and a mile wide, towered up into the still, hot air, and, with the black smoke of the engines, struck wonder and terror into the Federal outposts fifty miles away on the mountains back of Mapimi.",

Seeing her in Lagos, in brief meetings at the hotel, he had not realized that hers was a life that ran fully and would run fully even if he was not in it. It was strangely disturbing to think that he was not the only occupant of her world, but stranger still was how her routines were already in place, after only a few weeks in Port Har-court. Her work came first; she was determined to make her father’s factories grow, to do better than he had done. In the evenings, visitors?company people negotiating deals, government people negotiating bribes, factory people negotiating jobs?dropped by, parking their cars near the entrance to the orchard. Kainene always made sure they didn’t stay long, and she didn’t ask him to meet them because she said they would bore him, so he stayed upstairs reading or scribbling until they left. Often, he would try to keep his mind from worrying about failing Kainene that night; his body was still so unreliable and he had discovered that thinking about failure made it more likely to happen.",

His attitude towards girls had always been cold and scornful: he regarded their cajoleries and enticements with a fishy eye and with a vast Jewish caution and suspiciousness, and he laughed scornfully at anyone who allowed himself to be ensnared. Like many people who feel deeply, and who are powerfully affected by the slightest and remotest changes in their emotions, he had convinced himself that he was a creature whose every action was governed by the operations of cool reason, and accordingly now that his feelings were powerfully and romantically involved in thoughts about several of these warm and luscious-looking Jewish wenches, he convinced himself that he ‘cared only for their minds’ and that what he really sought from them was the stimulation of intellectual companionship. Accordingly, the love-letters which this great-nosed innocent now wrote to them, and read to Eugene, were extraordinary and unwitting productions of defence and justification.",

The doors opened and other figures leaped out, red-robed like the rest. They had candles blazing on top of their heads, on the backs of their hands and planted on their feet. They joined the dancing and marched off with the band. These turned out to be honorary members, who partake in the dancing only until a further degree is conferred upon them. The honorary members are those who are in sympathy with the society, but for one reason or another are not yet fully initiated. The group moves on with the little coffin being carried in the very middle of the procession. It is brilliant with candles. This was the soul about which everything moved.",

As she sat there, among photogravures of Botticelli Virgins and etchings of English cathedrals, she could not immediately remember why she had come, and looked with a kind of detached curiosity at the volumes of memoirs and sermons on the table at her elbow, at the perpendicular Gothic chairs against the wall, and the Morris armchairs which had superseded them. She had not been in a rectory sitting-room since the committee meeting at the Merrimans’, on the day when she had received Anne’s cable. Her lapse of memory lasted only for a few seconds, but during that time she relived with intensity the sensations of that other day, she felt her happy heart dancing against the message folded under her dress, she saw the southern sun gilding the dull faces about the table, and smelt the violets and mimosa in Mrs. Merriman’s vases. She woke again to the present just as an austere parlour-maid was requesting her to step this way.",

Vocal instant replays and noisy exultation are not unknown in surfing, but they’re subject to a strict code of collective ego control. Young surfers sometimes misunderstand this part of the surfing social contract, and brag and browbeat each other in the water, but they generally cool it when older surfers are in earshot. The usual crowd at Ocean Beach was older than most—in fact, I couldn’t remember ever seeing a teenager out on a big day—and the unwritten limits on garrulity among strangers here were correspondingly firm. Those who exceeded them were shunned. Those who consistently exceeded them were hated, for they failed to respect the powerfully self-enclosed quality of what other surfers, especially the less garrulous, were doing out here.",

It was a pleasant park in a wooded valley, quite empty on this fine morning. I walked for perhaps an hour along a network of winding paths through trees and over wooden footbridges, but I failed to find the AT, so I returned to the car and pushed on, along a lonely highway through the dense flying leaves of Michaux State Forest and on to Pine Grove Furnace State Park, a large recreation area built around a nineteenth-century stone kiln, now a picturesque ruin, from which it takes its name. The park had snack huts, picnic tables, and a lake with a swimming area, but all were shut and there wasn’t a soul about. On the edge of the picnic area was a big dumpster with a sturdy metal lid that had been severely—arrestingly—mangled and dented and half wrenched from its hinges, presumably by a bear trying to get at park garbage. I examined it with the deepest respect; I hadn’t realized black bears were quite that strong.",

For the rites of Japanese baseball, however orchestrated, were lovely in their lyricism. When the fans scattered pieces of colored paper or rice into the night air, it looked as if fireflies were lighting up the darkness. In the middle of the seventh inning, the crowd chose not to sing “Take Me Out to the Ball Game,” but let off flares, scarlet and mysterious, into the sky. And after the final out, spectators sent rainbowed streamers fluttering out onto the field that streaked the air with their brightness. The teams in the Japanese leagues were not called Dodgers or Expos or Astros; they were Dragons, Swallows and Carp. And the song the Tiger fans were singing was called, quite beautifully, “When the Wind Blows Down from Mount Rokko.”",

There’s not a whiff of road rage. Kumbh Mela pilgrims squat beside their vehicles, beckoning boys with steaming glasses of chai and touts selling fluffy toys, cotton candy and roasted peanuts in newspaper cones. A train trundles past, a conveyor belt of bulging human cargo; a row of men ride the roof cheering and waving, their faces flashing ecstatic grins.",

I walked out of the city by way of a water meadow to North Hinksey and onward toward Boar’s Hill through an area called, with curious indecisiveness, Chilswell Valley or Happy Valley. It had rained in the night and the heavy clay soil stuck to my boots and made the going arduous. Soon I had an accumulation of mud that doubled the size of my feet. A bit farther on, the path had been covered with gravel, presumably to make the going easier, but in fact the gravel stuck to my muddy boots so that it looked as if I were walking around with two very large currant buns on my feet. At the top of Boar’s Hill I stopped to savor the view—it’s the one that led Matthew Arnold to pen the oft-quoted lines about “dreaming spires,” and it has been cruelly despoiled by those marching electricity pylons that Oxfordshire has in greater abundance than any other county I know—and to scrape the mud from my boots with a stick.",

But through all these moods, Campton began to see, there ran the life-giving power of a reality embraced and accepted. George had been; George was; as long as his father’s consciousness lasted, George would be as much a part of it as the closest, most actual of his immediate sensations.

    "target_paragraph": "For an hour we were walking through the hot, dusty, litter-strewn, fume-poisoned city. In the centre a large area had been cordoned off for a Communist Party demonstration; at least 3,000 enthusiastic student-types were hoping to hear impassioned speeches but it was rumoured that the speakers had been arrested on their way from Lima and Cuzco. Hundreds of police, wearing full riot gear and brandishing machine-guns, stood between the demonstrators and the surrounding spectators. Several senior officers were patrolling the nearby streets, idly toying with their revolvers and warning people not to join the demonstrators as there was going to be trouble. These hard-faced nasties were quite unlike the ‘village bobbies’ we’ve been meeting. Our arrival infuriated them and they curtly ordered us to leave Huancayo at once. For the first time, I was aware of being in a dictatorship – and not liking it. Some gene to do with the liberty of the individual took over, and for the next half-hour we dodged about on the edge of the demo., pretending not to understand the increasingly irate officers. They were urban types, and clearly afraid of Juana, so they never came too close. Amongst the crowd there was much sympathy for the demonstrators, not because they were communist but because they were brave enough to defy the junta. Yet the fact of such a demonstration being allowed to assemble – even if the speakers were arrested – and the other fact of gringoes being able to ignore police orders with impunity, indicate that this Peruvian dictatorship is not among the world’s worst. Indeed, Peruvian governments, whether civilian or military, and however deplorable by our standards, have traditionally been among the more humane Latin American régimes.",
