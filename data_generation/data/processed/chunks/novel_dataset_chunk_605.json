He was knackered like, he didna mind it was there, he stood on a slack cable, flat on the deck, aye, one of the warps—and ping! they go as they tighten, ping! And Davy—he’s shot 20 feet in the air, Bryan says 30, and bosh! Right over the side! Man overboard! But Davy kept his head, he’s a lifeboatman, they’re trained for it. And we all panicked, but Bryan yells: ‘To the ramp!’ So we all run aft and fall down the ladders and Davy swims to the ramp and Bryan throws a rope and we haul him in—and he’s alive!”",

Hamas lacked the wit to see that this plan, being a dud, would soon have come off the rails without assistance. For some time the IDF had been slavering to launch Operation Defensive Shield and the Park Hotel atrocity provided ideal PR cover. That colossal bomb injured hundreds including a close friend of Limor’s, seventy-six-year-old Clara Rosenberger who had survived 3½ years in Auschwitz. Shrapnel killed the friend sitting beside her and severed her own spinal cord. Limor said, ‘From the armpits down she’s paralysed – must stay in a care home. A cruel end for one of the most energetic oldies I’ve ever met – active for all sorts of good causes.’",

There is no coming or going; it is seventeen miles from the nearest settlement, and looks across a desert valley to Mauna Loa. Woody trailers, harsh, hard grass in tufts, the Asplenium trichomanes in rifts, the Pellea ternifolia in sand, and some ohia and mamané scrub in hollow places sheltered from the wind, all hard, crisp, unlovely growths, contrast with the lavish greenery below. A brisk cool wind blows all day; every afternoon a dense fog brings the horizon within 200 feet, but it clears off with frost at dark, and the flames of the volcano light the whole southern sky.",

A big white curtain: you could draw it across the room and shut them out.\nShe lay awake, thinking of her mother, crying now and then; thinking of Roddy and Dan. Mysterious, measured sounds came through the open window. That was the sea. She got up and looked out. The deep-walled garden lay under the window, black and clear like a well. Calais was over there. And Paris. Mr. Jourdain had written to say he was going to Paris. She had his letter.\nIn bed she felt for the sharp edge of the envelope sticking out under the pillow. She threw back the hot blankets. The wind flowed to her, running cold like water over the thin sheet.\nA light moved across the ceiling. Somebody had waked her. Somebody was putting the blankets back again, pressing a large, kind hand to her forehead. Miss Lambert.",

The taxation imposed by the first two hundred miles of it is already depriving the peasants of their only luxuries, tea and sugar. But its purpose is a question of psychology rather than economics. For the modern Persian it is the symbol of national self-respect; it provides at last a fresh diet for that unconquerable vanity which has subsisted during two thousand years on the exploits of Darius. To us, after all we have suffered at the mercy of the internal combustion engine, the grunt of steam seemed as companionable and old-fashioned as the rattle of a four-wheeler.

How vast and dark it must be tonight, lying exposed to the wind; and in all this great space it was curious to think how few the towns were, and how small little rings of light, or single glow-worms he figured them, scattered here and there, among the swelling uncultivated folds of the world. And in those towns were little men and women, tiny men and women. Oh, it was absurd, when one thought of it, to sit here in a little room suffering and caring. What did anything matter? Rachel, a tiny creature, lay ill beneath him, and here in his little room he suffered on her account. The nearness of their bodies in this vast universe, and the minuteness of their bodies, seemed to him absurd and laughable. Nothing mattered, he repeated; they had no power, no hope. He leant on the window-sill, thinking, until he almost forgot the time and the place. Nevertheless, although he was convinced that it was absurd and laughable, and that they were small and hopeless, he never lost the sense that these thoughts somehow formed part of a life which he and Rachel would live together.",

But no crow would have flown in the enormous loop that I had followed, and when I plotted the route and stepped it out with dividers, the total came to a great deal more than half; not that this meant much: the rest of the journey was sure to take an equally tortuous course. I knocked off the miles for the trip on the Rhine-barge and the lifts I had taken in bad weather and found that the distance I had actually slogged on my two feet was seven hundred and fifty miles. The journey had lasted sixty-two days, and when I had struck out the halts of more than one night and divided the distance by the time, the average worked out at twelve miles a day. Bearing in mind a few marches from daybreak till long after dark, but conveniently forgetting the times I had merely strolled to the next village, I was a little disappointed. I had imagined it was far more. But I was delighted with everything else. I never tired of recapitulating the journey. I had crossed three parallels of latitude and eleven meridians and moved over from the North Sea – still called ‘the German Ocean’ on old maps – to a minute-line of longitude running from the Baltic to the south-east Adriatic. Even looked at from the moon – so the terrestrial and celestial globes suggested – the distance covered would have been as discernible as the Great Wall of China.",

It took him eight months, longer than it takes most people, and I don’t think he’d seen anybody for the last several weeks. When he came off he was just a trembling wreck. I had his wife with me. She’d come to meet him, and he just fell into her arms and started weeping. Couldn’t talk at all. He was like that all the way to the airport. I’ve never seen anybody so relieved to have anything done with, and I kept thinking, ‘Well, you know, sir, hiking the Appalachian Trail is a voluntary endeavor,’ but of course I didn’t say anything.”",

I ploughed forward, with 4-wheel-drive engaged, and our bonnet fully submerged beneath the fast-flowing water. It was at this point that I looked toward the far bank and noticed that the Italian's Land Rover had a snorkel – a device used to elevate the air intake above the water line, therefore preventing moisture from entering the engine. As it dawned on me that our Ford Ranger unfortunately didn't share this feature, I felt the front of the vehicle begin to rise in the current, and drift in the direction of the river's flow. I panicked and did the worst thing possible and accelerated. I just wanted to get onto dry land as quickly as possible, via the shortest route to the far bank. With the water lapping around the bottom of our windscreen, we reached the far side, and again I pressed hard on the accelerator. With engine screaming, we emerged from the water and hit the steep slope at speed. There was a huge bang and our wheels span as we struggled to clear the incline.",

We wondered if it came from a chimney or a burning house, but when we got near we saw it was the steam rising from hot springs. We were soon gazing at a scene of great natural beauty. A number of springs bubbled out of the ground, and in the middle of the cloud of steam shot up a splendid little geyser fifteen feet high. After poetry, prose! Our next thought was to have a bath. Our young couple disapproved, but we did not let that deter us. The water was boiling when it came out of the ground, but it was quickly cooled to a bearable temperature by the frosty air. We hurriedly turned one of the pools into a comfortable bath-tub. What a joy it was! Since we had left the hot springs at Kyirong we had not been able to wash or bathe. But, sitting now in water that was almost boiling, the temperature of the air was so low that our wet hair and beards became frozen stiff in an instant. In the brook which flowed out of the hot springs there were a lot of good-sized fish. We hungrily debated how to catch them—we could have boiled them easily enough in the spring—but we found no way, and so, much refreshed, we hurried on to catch up with the caravan.",

    "target_paragraph": "Soaring over Murillo, not twenty miles to the west, is the Nevado del Ruiz, a volcano that has been active for two million years. What makes it especially dangerous is the impact that hot gases and lava can have on summit glaciers. When the mountain erupts, icefields melt, generating massive flows of water, ice, pumice, and other rocks, which mix with clay to form lahars, massive rivers of mud that race down the flanks, achieving speeds of up to sixty miles per hour. The laws of physics dictate that the size of the stones and the amount of debris that such a flood can move is directly proportional to the square of the velocity of the water. Thus if the flow’s velocity quadruples due to the rush of meltwater from the summit icefields, the amount of debris that it can carry multiplies sixteen-fold. The upper slopes of the Nevado del Ruiz, with an incline of twenty to thirty degrees, serve as a virtual launchpad. As a lahar descends, eroding soil, dislodging rocks, swallowing vegetation, it becomes ever larger and more powerful, its destructive force only increasing with distance from the eruption.",

In 1856, Hiram II and his wife, Clara (a pair who, judging from their photograph, rivaled his parents as the least fun couple ever to sail the South Seas), embarked for the Gilbert Islands, a string of Pacific specks midway between Hawaii and Australia, where two island clans were engaged in a bloody war over control of the archipelago.",

As he himself had ironically pointed out, almost everyone, apparently, had read his books and no one had bought them. In these books, just as in his social manner, he tried to mask his shyness and timidity by an air of weary disdain and by the intricate artifice and circumlocution of an elaborately mannered style.",

The Keralan people are beautiful, with big round bodies, wide smiles and dark skin. The women wear jasmine flowers in their hair, muumuu dresses and bright saris, and the men, all hail the men!

In the scruffy foyer a Coloured girl booked me in for two nights by computer. (Why by computer, in a hotel obviously down on its luck?) Then a gigantic noisy lift, imported from the US in 1890, took us to the second floor where a startled-looking part-Griqua woman wordlessly pointed to the un-grand wing, its corridors uncarpeted. Each door displays a warning notice: ‘This room does not form part of the registered and graded premises’. Most doors have been damaged in an interesting way, either kicked in or attacked with some heavy sharp instrument. Their handles and locks also bear the marks of violence – has there been a police raid? I peered into several rooms. All were like my own, with filthy walls (one prefers not to analyse the source of the filth), radios and light-fixtures long since torn from the walls above the twin beds, frayed towels wrapped around the pillows in lieu of pillow-slips, the only furniture splintered plywood dressing-tables, their mirrors forcibly removed. The hand-basin taps and communal lavatories at the end of the corridor are waterless. My small window won’t open and, after dark, unfamiliar very small insects race around the floor – to and fro, in a demented sort of way. But the bed, surprisingly enough, seems free of wildlife.*",

The only other person skiing at the resort that day was the mayor of Severobaikalsk, he said. In between runs, Sergei and the mayor had talked. Sergei said the mayor was rather discouraged with life. The mayor had told him that Severobaikalsk now had very few jobs, and the railroad, the only employer of consequence, had begun to cut back and lay people off, and many people were trying to move away. (I could believe that, having seen signs advertising apartments for sale all over town.) The reason nobody else was skiing was that almost everybody in Severobaikalsk is old, the mayor said. He told Sergei that Severobaikalsk was dying.",

This profilaktorii had doctors’ offices, a clinic, pools for hydropathy, an exercise room, a cafeteria, and quiet bedrooms, a few of which it rented to travelers when vacancies opened up. I’ve almost never stayed in a more restful place. Its atmosphere was calm and soothing, with a kind of low hum, like a test pattern on TV; even the entrees in the cafeteria were peaceful, down to the mild cream sauce on the cutlets and the vaguely sweet tapioca dessert. You couldn’t walk in the profilaktorii door without the lady security person telling you softly to stop and take off your coat and hat—as if all troublesome rustling must be left outside. And right next to the building, just below the window of our room, the train yard of BAM’s Severobaikalsk station gently sighed and creaked and rattled with trains moving back and forth all night.",

Flowering hot-house trees in tubs were banked round the walls, the shining marble pillars were wreathed about with vines and garlands, and overhead gay lanterns had been strung to illuminate the scene with their gentle glow. The whole effect was that of an open clearing in a forest glade upon Midsummer Night where Queen Titania had come to hold her court and revels.",

As they readied to hoist the anchor, he put the ratchet handle into the anchor windlass and began ratcheting the chain in eight links at a time with each push and pull. He had a few feet in when the ratchet mechanism jammed. Try as he may, he wasn’t able to get it working. He was able to let chain out but was unable to get the ratchet to engage to retrieve it. Gillian was at the helm, waiting for his commands. He walked back to the cockpit and explained the problem. He knew it wasn’t easily fixable. He would have to unbolt it from the bowsprit and then break it down to get at the gear mechanism. He figured half a day – maybe longer.",

    "target_paragraph": "If gold first drew them to settle here, the country itself is what kept them—the rivers, the mountains, this immense wild range lying open to anyone who could meet its climatic terms. In their first mining season on Squaw Creek, they made expenses and then some. After that, because of slow-melting stream ice, they barely made expenses. That is when they would have left if gold had been all they wanted, but they had chosen the country in the way that someone else would choose a career. Sense of place registered higher with them than a sense of accumulating wealth. They went to work at almost anything that might support them, and tried to stay where they were. They first lived in Circle Hot Springs, a clump of buildings around a natural phenomenon that fogged the winter air with warm steam and coated the spruce with ice. Central was eight miles away. It appealed to them because it was “less junky than most Alaskan towns.” It was scarcely a town at all, had never had a school or a church—just a few cabins around the T in the road where a spur went off to the Springs. They took on the local mail run. They cut and sold cordwood and lumber. They ran the roadhouse for a year and a half. They shot wolves for the bounty, which was fifty dollars. The price of fur was too low at first to make other animals worth trapping, but as the price went up their lines went out, and fur eventually became their primary source of money. Meanwhile, Ed went off to construction jobs—a month here, six weeks there. In Arctic Alaska, in winter, he helped build stations of the DEW line. He built oil-drilling platforms in Cook Inlet and rigs on the North Slope. He was gone, in aggregate, no more than three months a year. Since 1970, the family has lived almost wholly on the possibilities of the country, and Ed has gone out for work only twice.",

Humboldt’s scientific eye embraced the entire universe of nature. He wrote of plants, birds, insects, and strange mammals. As an astronomer, he traced the trajectories of planets and stars; as a cartographer, he mapped rivers, most notably the Magdalena; as a surveyor, he measured the height of mountains, including Chimborazo, Ecuador’s crown jewel, an ice-clad volcano that soars farther from the center of the earth than any summit on the planet. Humboldt was among the first to appreciate the biological complexity of wetlands, cloud forests, and páramos; to study the dynamics of climate and ocean currents; and to record the effects of elevation and topography on the dispersal of flora and fauna, observations that marked the beginning of the academic discipline of biogeography. Before the advent of photography, every landscape had to be captured in a sketch, an artistic portfolio of watercolors and oils that grew with every mile covered, each new horizon embraced by the expedition. Humboldt was simply, as Charles Darwin would write, the “greatest scientific traveler who ever lived.”",

Curiously enough, visibility seemed to have increased, as if the rank sunless jungle of cypress and willow and brier, instead of increasing obscurity, had solidified it into the concrete components of trunk and branch, leaving the air, space, free of it and in comparison lighter, penetrable to vision, to the mare’s sight anyway, enabling her to see-saw back and forth among the trunks and the impassable thickets. Then he saw the place he sought—a squat, flat-topped, almost symmetrical mound rising without reason from the floorlike flatness of the valley. The white people called it an Indian mound. One day five or six years ago a group of white men, including two women, most of them wearing spectacles and all wearing khaki clothes which had patently lain folded on a store shelf twenty-four hours ago, came with picks and shovels and jars and phials of insect repellant and spent a day digging about it while most of the people, men women and children, came at some time during the day and looked quietly on; later—within the next two or three days, in fact—he was to remember with almost horrified amazement the cold and contemptuous curiosity with which he himself had watched them.",

That quarter was designed in the last century by the Masons, who performed the odd stunt of blocking the view of Saint Peter’s from all but a single street in the whole section; it was not the center of their world and they put real genius into ignoring it.",

    "target_paragraph": "Luckily for Kingsford Smith, he and his men were in an area with plentiful fresh water and some adequate if unappealing sources of food (mud snails mostly). However, because the plane’s radio was broken, they had no way of telling the outside world where they were. When news of the disappearance reached Sydney, two of Kingsford Smith’s associates, Keith Anderson and Bob Hitchcock, decided to mount a rescue. In the little Kookaburra they took off from Mascot Airport in Sydney, flew by stages to Alice Springs, and finally set off from there on what was supposed to be the final leg early on the morning of April 12, 1929. Soon afterward, while crossing the parched emptiness of the Tanami Desert—the area that Allan and I had skirted in the car on our drive from Daly Waters to Alice Springs—the engine began to sputter and backfire and they were forced to make an emergency landing in the desert. In their haste to depart they had packed no food and only three liters of water. Unlike Kingsford Smith, they landed in a place that offered no succor.",
