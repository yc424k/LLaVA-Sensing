My friend, he tried not to drink and in this terrible heat got kidney failure and died. The same with the others. It’s not possible to have your new ideas about health and our old ideas. If my friend drank dirty water he would be here with me today. Maybe he would have some small problem with his stomach but he would be alive. In my village everyone drinks dirty water. There is no other water. But this year, because of the drought, the only water for the abakhweta was very muddy – with a smell. So the well-educated wouldn’t drink it. All who died were university students. The uneducated drank and were safe.’",

She might offer to write notes for her mother, who was upstairs plunged in her visiting-list; or look in on Lita, who was probably asleep after her hard gallop of the morning; or find her father, and suggest going for a walk. She had not seen her father since lunch; but she seemed to remember that he had ordered his new Buick brought round. Off again—he was as restless as the others. All of them were restless nowadays. Had he taken Lita with him, perhaps? Well—why not? Wasn’t he here to look after Lita? A sudden twitch of curiosity drew Nona to her feet, and sent her slowly upstairs to her sister-in-law’s room. Why did she have to drag one foot after the other, as if some hidden influence held her back, signalled a mute warning not to go? What nonsense!

A family near me unpacks an aluminium tiffin box from one of their overstuffed baskets and pours pungent curry-drenched rice on to torn-off sheets of newspaper.

An elderly woman on a nearby plot, with sprigs of fresh white jasmine pinned in her hair, gazes out at the endless line of dani palms, her head resting against the rusting iron rail. Another cry shatters the silence: ‘Mohinghaaaa-aaaaaa!’ A vendor emerges from the lower deck and ladles out steaming noodles from an earthenware pot cocooned in rags for warmth. A young girl follows carrying aloft a rattan tray stacked high with chopped watermelon, each red triangle buzzing with flies. Out on the river, hulking dark rice barges and wooden canoes heavy with unripe bananas sail slowly past.",

He was said to have turned them down because he would need more space to do the job properly, but other artists were available. The sober-minded editorial writers around the country were all remarking that with Giuliano’s death there had been closed a “sorry chapter” in Sicilian history, also in postwar Italian history; it was the end of a period, fortuitously marked at the same time by the withdrawal, at last, of Allied bank notes; the disruptions of war had finally run their course. But they seemed to have reckoned without certain factors, though it was true that there was a slight lull in banditry; just for one thing, they were overlooking the donkey carts. The chief character in the sad chapter, being removed from all practical inconveniences, was already off on a new career, in legend; and in Sicily, as one of the Rome newspapermen on the case put it, “all of life is a legend.”",

But after nearly a month beneath the endlessly damp skies of northern Europe, I longed for sunshine. It was as simple as that. I wanted to walk down a street in shirtsleeves, to sit out of doors with a cappuccino, to feel the sun on my face. So it was with only the odd wrenching spasm of guilt that I abandoned my planned itinerary and bounded with a single leap across 1,500 miles of Europe.

Sometimes he came running across the garden to greet me, beaming with happiness and holding out his hand. In spite of my warm feelings towards him and the fact that he called me his friend, I always took care to show him the respect due to the future king of Tibet. He had charged me to give him lessons in English, geography and arithmetic. In addition I had to look after his cinema and keep him conversant with world events. He had my pay raised on his own initiative, for though he was not yet constitutionally entitled to give orders, he had only to express a wish for it to be executed.",

Once we were under the lancets of St Vitus’s Cathedral, a second conviction began to form. Prague was the recapitulation and the summing-up of all I had gazed at since stepping ashore in Holland, and more; for that slender nave and the airy clerestory owed spiritual allegiance far beyond the Teutonic heartland, and the Slav world.

Animals have been arriving in Suci for some weeks now, and the place is looking like a regular zoo. The lontars specify that certain species of animals native to Bali should, if possible, be sacrificed. I don't know how many species are required, but the committee did a pretty fair job, by their own count rounding up 85 species. The animals arrived during the days of preparation and were put in cages and boxes and left in the outer, less sacred, part of Suci. The pilgrims always stopped by to have a look.

Beside her stood a handsome little boy of five, dressed in furs, his eyes bright and intelligent, his complexion the color of copper. It was Fanny and Alex. Stefansson reached out to embrace them, but Fanny lurched forward and took hold of his collar and shook him, scolding him for being away so long and for not sending money as he’d promised. He reached into his pockets and feebly handed her a wad of crumpled bills, and then they walked on together toward the village, Fanny still berating him, her arms flailing, and the little fellow trotting along beside them.",

Nearby their daughter-in-law was shelling apricot kernels while a granddaughter – aged nine but smaller than Rachel – knitted a balaclava for her baby brother; she was using home-made wooden needles, so progress was slow. Balti females of all ages are ceaselessly industrious. Tiny girls wash clothes in icy streams, and spin wool or knit while sitting on sunny roofs laughing and chatting. Opposite our friends’ roof half-a-dozen young women were struggling to mend a primitive loom which hung from the next roof up, where several men sat weaving wicker pannier baskets. As always, animals and poultry scampered or flew from roof to roof, being formally abused by everyone but never ill-treated. And amidst the goats and sheep, and the newborn kids and lambs, and the coy hens teasing randy cocks, wandered innumerable human young with bare bottoms and runny noses. I could have sat there happily for hours but the object of the exercise was to repay hospitality, not to receive it, so having presented our little gift of biro pens we stayed only briefly lest a meal might be prepared for us.",

Then, a year’s study of the lean, clear precision of Caesar, the magnificent structure of the style – the concision, the skeleton certainty, deadened by the disjointed daily partition, the dull parsing, the lumbering cliché of pedantic translation:",

She was a few years older than I, and married, but not happily. We had caught a glimpse of each other at Count Jenö’s, and danced with improvised abandon on the noisy evening when Dinah and the Gypsy songs had tangled in mid-air; and I couldn’t stop dogging her footsteps. During the hunt, she leaped barefoot about the rocks as nimbly as an ibex, hair flying. As it turned out, she was just as rash and impulsive as I was supposed to be, and prompted, I think, by amused affection on her side and rapt infatuation on mine, a light-hearted affinity had sprung up in a flash. The feast went on late, and abetted by woods and nightfall and the remote part of the forest we had wandered to, all barriers broke down; and we weren’t sure where we were until at last we heard our Christian names being called, and ran to the assembly point where horses were being saddled and traces run through. On the return journey they had to brake hard on the steep grass rides and the lamps slotted on either side of the carriages shed a joggling beam on the tree-trunks.",

Orlando’s reverence for print had a tough job set before it, but drawing her chair to the window to get the benefit of what light might filter between the high houses of Mayfair, she tried to come to a conclusion.",

I try to stand as often and as long as possible, but my legs have badly atrophied and hang from my hips like threads with little knots for knees. There was a time when three hands could not encircle my thighs; now two will do, and nicely at that. My chest and arms have thinned but remain fairly strong due to the exercise demanded by survival. How the body steals heat or food from one part to lend to another, how it compensates for deprivation by shutting down all but the essential systems, how it possibly can keep this wreck running in this demo-derby of flesh, is all beyond me, amazing, almost amusing.

I started to laugh, and cry a little, all alone on the sand, and snapped pictures from a distance, a stepkid paparazza. Was this what my family looked like?

The winters and summers are mild and the pace of life is about one cup of coffee shy of comatose. Its location on the Intracoastal Waterway, the ICW, as well as the ocean would give us plenty of opportunity to learn to sail. It was rich in history and boating traditions. It was practically free of hurricanes. We would need a small apartment for the time that Quest was on the hard and then dockage when the big day arrived when we would splash Quest. Just one year and we would be on our way to the Caribbean.",

California Street, especially at high tide, was hard on boards. The basic ingredients of a ding-repair kit were polyester resin, catalyst, fiberglass cloth, and a block of polyurethane foam, but I slowly accumulated a workbench full of tools and supplies: saws, files, brushes, a power sander, all grades of wet and dry sandpaper, masking tape, acetone. I could do hot coats, gloss coats, quick-and-dirty overnight jobs, or patches so painstaking they became invisible. The elaborately inlaid fin on my beloved Sweet was always getting battered on rocks, and so I built up, over many nights in a cold garage, an inch-wide “bead” of fiberglass strands around its outer edge to protect it. It was the memory of similar labors, I believe, and the desire not to repeat them, that caused surfers to enlarge their reputations among other beachgoers as madmen by sprinting across sharp rocks after lost boards, unconcerned about damage to their feet.",

My favorite example: the Pink House sits across the street from a classic Southern diner festooned with a Space Age–style silver sign that says FONDREN in looping, cursive font. The rain has returned, stopping and starting outside the windows, interrupting Tyler’s train of thought, seeming to remind us that we are still subject to the whims of the state in this zone of relative safety.",

She’d met the angel beyond the bright light and refused to follow. She’d come back unable to speak. Unable to write. To do much of anything. But she’d come back willing to work to regain those things that were lost. I blinked again. I could feel her presence near me—even though she was hundreds of miles away. I knew that every day I’d been walking she’d been in therapy. Fighting her own body. Relearning everything she’d once known how to do, unrelenting in her determination. I was not there to see it, but I could sense it. I could always perceive this woman of my blood and bone no matter how far apart we were. She was the most stubborn woman I knew.
