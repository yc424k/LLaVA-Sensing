Weaving between Cambuur’s defenders, he looked set to score but was brought down by a clumsy tackle just outside the box. The referee reached into his pocket for a yellow card to wave at the guilty Cambuur player and the crowd around me came to life, singing and shouting and holding both arms aloft as if they were about to do the YMCA. A Feyenoorder stepped up to take a free kick and the whole stadium began clapping rhythmically, a metronomic thump echoing through the stadium like a heartbeat, building to a crescendo until the ball bounced harmlessly off a defending wall of yellow. The Cambuur fans on the other side of the glass screen began to jump up and down, and my seat shook as if I were riding a horse in an earthquake.",

But the bookcases were closed with gilt trellising, and when Paul reached up to open one, a servant told him that Mr. Moffatt’s secretary kept them locked because the books were too valuable to be taken down. This seemed to make the library as strange as the rest of the house, and he passed on to the ballroom at the back. Through its closed doors he heard a sound of hammering, and when he tried the door-handle a servant passing with a tray-full of glasses told him that “they” hadn’t finished, and wouldn’t let anybody in.",

    "target_paragraph": "For him there was safety in the direction which the talk had taken. His emphasis might come from feelings more personal than those science roused in him, but it was disguised, and naturally he found it easy to expound and explain. Nevertheless, when he saw Katharine among the orchids, her beauty strangely emphasized by the fantastic plants, which seemed to peer and gape at her from striped hoods and fleshy throats, his ardour for botany waned, and a more complex feeling replaced it. She fell silent. The orchids seemed to suggest absorbing reflections. In defiance of the rules she stretched her ungloved hand and touched one. The sight of the rubies upon her finger affected him so disagreeably that he started and turned away. But next moment he controlled himself; he looked at her taking in one strange shape after another with the contemplative, considering gaze of a person who sees not exactly what is before him, but gropes in regions that lie beyond it. The far-away look entirely lacked self-consciousness. Denham doubted whether she remembered his presence. He could recall himself, of course, by a word or a movement—but why? She was happier thus. She needed nothing that he could give her. And for him too, perhaps, it was best to keep aloof, only to know that she existed, to preserve what he already had—perfect, remote, and unbroken. Further, her still look, standing among the orchids in that hot atmosphere, strangely illustrated some scene that he had imagined in his room at home. The sight, mingling with his recollection, kept him silent when the door was shut and they were walking on again.",

This strip, beyond the meadow and its fringing trees, is covered with coarse grass and stones and little shells. Clumps of wild fruit trees scattered about it here and there look as if they knew what roughing it is like. The sea washes over it in winter when the wind is strong from the east, and among the trees are frequent skeletons, dead fruit trees these many seasons past, with the tortured look peculiar to blasted trees, menacing the sky with gaunt, impotent arms. After struggling along this bit, stopping every few minutes to shake the shells out of my shoes, I came to uneven ground, soft green grass, and beautiful trees—a truly lovely part at the foot of the southern hill. Here I sat down for a moment to take the last shells out of my shoes and to drink things in. I had not seen a soul since the bathing girls, and supposed that most of the people staying at the inn would not care on hot afternoons to walk over the prickly grass and shells that must be walked over before reaching the green coolness of the end. And while I was comfortably supposing this and shaking my shoe slowly up and down and thinking how delightful it was to have the charming place to myself, I saw a young man standing on a rock under the east cliff of the hill in the very act of photographing the curving strip of land, with the sea each side of it, and myself in the middle.",

The only portable food I could find in the chai stalls of Nilt were dried apricots and more of that hard yellow cake, which I did not think was enough to fuel a day’s walk.

Naturally such practices made me extremely uncomfortable and angry, and I had constantly to correct him for them. But even apart from this, I do not much enjoy these excursions ‘to converse upon natural objects in Hindi,’ for his mind is always busy with his own affairs and countless plans by which he can make use of me. I do not blame him for this, of course; being English and a friend to His Highness I am an influential person, and I suppose he would be thought a fool if he did not make the most, while he could, of the opportunities afforded him as my tutor.

The peaceful English countryside seemed, in fact, particularly tranquil. It was dawn, the grass was powdered with a light frost, and the air was brighter than it would be later. The noise had stopped. Everything was familiar; nothing was terrible. I saw the old rosebush at the top of the path leading into the woods. I couldn't see any animal or bird. It was too early even for the cheerful grating of the rooks that nest in the trees on the hill. Still, I knew I hadn't dreamed that noise. I had never had a dream that real.

On the way, I encountered a young couple coming towards the edge. They asked me if I’d had any luck and I told them all about how the fog had parted for a few seconds. They looked crushed. They said they had come all the way from Ontario. It was their honeymoon. All their lives they had wanted to see the Grand Canyon. Three times every day for the past week they had put on their moonboots and honeymoon winterwear and walked hand in hand to the canyon’s edge, but all they had seen so far was an unshifting wall of fog.",

He could feel his breath warming his nose a little, could almost see the pale smoke of it as he breathed; could feel the inhalation chilling his nostrils again. It seemed to him that he could feel the planks of the ceiling as they sloped down to the low wall on Buddy’s side, could feel the atmosphere packed into the low corner, bitter and chill and thick, too thick for breathing, like invisible slush; and he lay beneath it.… He was aware of the dry ticking of shucks beneath him and discovered so that he was breathing in deep troubled draughts and he wished dreadfully to be up, moving, before a fire, light; anywhere, anywhere. Buddy lay beside him in the oppressive, half-congealed solidity of the chill, talking in his slow, inarticulate idiom of the war. It was a vague, dreamy sort of tale, without beginning or end and filled with stumbling references to places wretchedly pronounced—you got an impression of people, creatures without initiation or background or future, caught timelessly in a maze of solitary conflicting preoccupations, like bumping tops, against an imminent but incomprehensible nightmare.",

Struggling by her side, Helen was suddenly overcome by the spirit of movement, and pushed along with her skirts wrapping themselves round her knees, and both arms to her hair. But slowly the intoxication of movement died down, and the wind became rough and chilly. They looked through a chink in the blind and saw that long cigars were being smoked in the dining-room; they saw Mr Ambrose throw himself violently against the back of his chair, while Mr Pepper crinkled his cheeks as though they had been cut in wood. The ghost of a roar of laughter came out to them, and was drowned at once in the wind. In the dry yellow-lighted room Mr Pepper and Mr Ambrose were oblivious of all tumult; they were in Cambridge, and it was probably about the year 1875.",

The ramp, rather; it was made so the Pope could go upstairs in the summer palace on muleback, and from the outside looks like an abandoned grain chute; inside it is nicked, battered, windy, unvisited. The ornament is minimal: rising orders of capitals, on the Colosseum formula; the simplest edging to bind the rough brickwork of the floor strip, under a plain iron railing. The rest is proportion, a balance so delicate of the parts of the spiral that as you walk up or down or even standing still you are taken into a development of volumes that seem capable of turning themselves into their equivalents in music and leaving you in the air. It seems inevitable but was not; in the imitations the whole idea becomes an expense and a fanciness; the parts stick; the flow is lost.",

    "target_paragraph": "When we first decided to make this tree island our home, thousands of green branches had reached for the sky in a tangle of undergrowth. Now drought had gutted its luxuriant thicket, and its trees were gray and leafless. But here was the bush that the lions Muffin and Moffet always marked, and there was the old fireplace that had warmed our lives for more than two thousand nights. The lions of the Blue Pride had ransacked camp many times, pulling bags of flour, mealie-meal, and onions out of the trees around the kitchen boma—an open enclosure of grass and poles.\nDuring our absence another couple had used the camp while studying desert antelope, but they had departed more than six months ago. The same faded tents lay draped across their poles, their flysheets ripped and tattered by cheeky desert storms. One side of the tent that held our lab and office had collapsed, and a small pool of rainwater from the recent shower lay bellied in its canvas. Mark planted the tent back on its poles, gingerly drew back the flaps, then with a stick chased a spitting cobra from inside. In the sleeping tent, the packing-crate bed sagged under the weight of a sodden mattress, and the tent floor was caked with mud.\nThe kitchen boma, with its thick, shaggy thatch roof, was still standing at the other end of camp. Inside were the cutting board Dolene had given us, the fire grate Bergie had made for us, and the blackened water kettle, scarred by the teeth of hyenas who had pirated it so often.\nI looked around hopefully for the yellow-billed hornbills, those charismatic, comic birds with whom we had shared the island during every dry season. But I didn’t see any. The recent light rain must have lured them back to the woodlands to mate, as it did every rainy season.\n“Look who’s here!” Mark exclaimed. I whirled around to see a Marico flycatcher fluttering to a branch ten inches from Mark’s head. It immediately began shaking its wings, begging for something to eat. I slipped away to the cool-box in the truck and returned with a piece of cheese, one of the Marico’s favorite snacks. I tossed a few bits to the ground at our feet. Without hesitation the bird swooped down, stuffed its beak with cheddar, and flew to the other side of camp.\nUnloading boxes and trunks of supplies from the truck and the plane, we began the enormous job of cleaning and unpacking. Mark built a fire with some scraps from the woodpile, while I washed mud, spiderwebs, and a mouse’s nest from the table in the kitchen boma. We made tea and laid out a lunch of bread, cheese, and jam on the table.\n“We’ve got to start looking for lions right away,” Mark began as soon as we sat down. April was supposed to be the end of the wet season, but according to the rain gauge only two inches of precipitation had fallen instead of the usual fourteen. Although this was enough to fill the water holes, it would evaporate in a few days. Soon the lions would be following the antelope away from the valley to their dry-season areas; we had to find and radio collar them before they left, so that we could monitor their movements with the radio receivers in the airplane and truck.\nEven before our departure in 1980, the lions of the Blue Pride were already roaming over more than fifteen hundred square miles, and as much as sixty miles from their wet-season territory, in search of widely scattered prey. After four more years of drought, who could say where they were or whether they were still alive. They had led us to exciting new scientific discoveries: that they could survive indefinitely without water to drink—obtaining moisture from the fluids of their prey—and that their social behavior was different from that of other lions who lived in less harsh environments. We were anxious to continue our research for many years, and to determine how the die-off of tens of thousands of antelope had affected the lions. Their radio collars would have failed long ago; finding them would be a long shot. But if we could locate even a few, we could document not only their longevity and their ability to survive drought, but also their range sizes and the changes in pride composition during such periods.\nWorking feverishly that afternoon, we pulled everything out of the sleeping and office-lab tents and scrubbed the mud-caked floors. An elephant shrew with two babes clinging to her backside had to be gently evicted from her nest in the bottom drawer of the filing cabinet, and we found another snake behind the bookcase. While I continued with the cleanup, Mark prepared the darting rifle and radio collars for the lions.\nLate in the afternoon, Mark carefully excavated our “wine cellar,” a hole dug long ago under the thick, scraggly ziziphus trees. We had buried a few bottles in 1980, to drink on our return. The spade clanked against glass, and Mark pulled up a Nederburg Cabernet Sauvignon 1978. Sitting on the dry riverbed at the edge of camp, we watched the huge sun rest its chin on the dunes as we sipped red wine by the fire. Slowly Deception Valley faded away in the darkness.",

Almost she was lost, stepping back and back into the pages of some familiar rhythm, now this is the forest of Arden. Almost her long legs were bound in Elizabethan trunkhose and almost in her hand, under her hand was a silver chain which almost she was about to drop about the throat of George, of Orlando kneeling, wear this for me one out of suits with fortune.",

I never wrote the article, but I still think about itwhat he had found, what he had to say. The fact was this: they die younger in Glasgow than they do in other cities. They die younger in Glasgow than in Liverpool or Manchester or Belfastall deindustrialized British cities, with similar histories and demographics and patterns of deprivation. They die younger, in all social classes, and younger than expected even when adjusting for unhealthy behaviors. They die younger in Glasgow, and no one really knows why. This “excess mortality” as the researcher defined it, was more generally known as “the Glasgow Effect.”",

I drank alone, putting quarters into the jukebox, playing the same five songs over and over until the barmaid yelled angrily, “Hey!

I relied on a great deal of aid from my ex-wife, Frisha Hugessen, my good friend Chris Latchem, and a host of others. The design was unusual, though not at all radical. We took pains to create a handsome, meticulously constructed cold-molded craft, excellent in light airs and well-balanced and forgiving in heavy weather. Solo became much more than a boat to me. I knew her every nail and screw, every grain of wood. It was as if I’d created a living being. Sailors tend to feel that way about their boats. Chris and I gave Solo a harsh thousand-mile shakedown cruise from Annapolis to Massachusetts through late-fall gales. By the spring of 1981, I was ready to follow in Manry’s wake.",

The tea shop’s stools and tables—painted strawberry red—were tucked around the tree’s roots. On a wooden plank hung above the bubbling kettles, a Burmese sign read, ‘The Golden Banyan Tree Tea Shop’. Sitting on one of the stools, I had a panoramic view of the murky, fast-flowing waters of the Irrawaddy. The water was relatively low, and on either side of the river there were wide sandbanks like beaches. The several brightly coloured longyi that had been laid out to dry on the sands looked like an enormous patchwork quilt lining the river.",

    "target_paragraph": "It is difficult for us to understand how drastically the idea of the Ice Age rewrote the nineteenth-century world-view. It affected almost every scientific discipline – natural history, chemistry, physics – and obliged the rethinking of much of anthropology, natural history and theology. More immediately, familiar landscapes had suddenly to be looked at with very different eyes. In Llanberis in Wales, in Windermere in the Lake District, in the Cairngorms or in Switzerland, the evidence of the passage of the Ice Age could now be seen: scooped corries, U-shaped valleys, gigantic boulders, and the blade-like ridges which had been sharpened by glacial action. John Ruskin, in the fourth volume of Modern Painters, described how in the Alpine valleys ‘there are yet visible the tracks of ancient glaciers … the footmark, so to speak, of a glacier is just as easily recognisable as the tracks of a horse that had passed along a soft road which yet retained the prints of its shoes’. Ruskin’s image – the glacier as a horse, the hard mountain as a soft road – made the ancient superbly immediate; collapsed the deep past into the familiar present.",

So each night I tear off the old day from the calendar, and screw it tight into a ball. I do this vindictively, while Betty and Clara are on their knees. I do not pray. I revenge myself upon the day. I wreak my spite upon its image. You are dead now, I say, school day, hated day. They have made all the days of June—this is the twenty-fifth—shiny and orderly, with gongs, with lessons, with orders to wash, to change, to work, to eat. We listen to missionaries from China. We drive off in brakes along the asphalt pavement, to attend concerts in halls. We are shown galleries and pictures.",

It flowed under the great bridge; Hungary replaced Austria on its southern strand; then the plains to the south and the east spread the water in a shallow fan. These sudden lowlands, the antechamber to the puszta, had seduced the river into breaking loose. Flood and marsh expanded and streams wandered away in branching coils which an invisible tilt of the plain always guided back to their allegiance; and at each return, as though to atone for their truancy, the deserting streams brought a straggle of new tributaries with them. The flat islands of meadow and pasture retreated into the distance with the ampleness of counties. Snow striped the landscape still and the patches of grass between the stripes were beginning to revive again in sweeps of green. Brooks divided field from field and the trees that marked their windings were feathery with a purplish haze of buds. Spinneys of mist surrounded the barns and the manor-houses, and the copper domes of faraway parishes flashed back the light above these changing woods. The ice had all but thawed. The gleam beyond the film of rushes on the river had grown scarce. But the retreat of the racing cloud-shadows turned the streams from lead to steel and from steel to bright silver.",
