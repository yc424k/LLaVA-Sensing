The old nursery with its strip of rag carpet had been a sewing room for Mrs. Rennenstocker since the day when the sewing machine first stood where the dollhouse used to. Mrs. Rennenstocker was always at the sewing machine, the light was always just about to fall above the Farrand forest . . . “Ain’t you happy to be having all these nice things?” “Oh, yes, Mrs. Rennenstocker.

A part of the fleet of Augustus was shattered against these very rocks in the year 34. Gold and silver galore must be lying under the waves in those narrow three miles; anchors and chains, too, and rusty implements such as were used on one memorable occasion when the great medical school of Salerno was flourishing; flourishing and yet envious; envious of the fame of the mineral waters of Pozzuoli which attracted travellers away from their own town–for the waters, you perceive, cured patients gratis, while the Salerno doctors used to send in heavy bills–so envious, that certain rich and well-reputed physicians of that school, to wit, Sir Antoninus Sulimella, Sir Philippus Capograssus, and Sir Hector de Prochyta, after taking counsel how to remedy this vexatious state of affairs, decided that it was no time for half-measures.",

During one rest pause, Rachel spotted a two-inch stick insect, thin and angular, his brown and green colouring perfectly matching the striped leaves of his perch. When we looked carefully, we detected several more in that area. This climb was a real lung-buster but the reward was proportionate to the effort – an incomparable view of the Cordillera Blanca when suddenly, after many ‘false summits’, we reached the ultimate puna and were facing the highest mountain range in Peru. Across a wide, shallow valley rose the snow-burdened mightiness of a long line of serrated summits, the two highest peaks just below 20,000 feet. All morning we had met no one and here on this immense sloping plateau – sun-warmed and snow-cooled, vividly green beneath a strongly blue sky – I had the illusion of having actually left the inhabited world, as though we were now on another planet. Behind us, the vastness beyond the Pomabamba valley – which had so awed us during the climb – was hidden by that long rock-wall through which our path had just found a way.",

In the village square, a Lenin statue, silver from head to foot, strode forward into space. We stopped first at the old cemetery, where Zoya had been doing historical work with the eventual goal of restoration. Again, cows disinclined to move loitered here and there. The village had once had a large Jewish merchant population, Zoya told us. Many of the inscriptions on the headstones in the cemetery were in Yiddish.

Long before anyone else Mark knew what had happened and he told it with malicious glee because he hated Reeves. Reeves with the chiefs had gone down to the limit of the road to meet the President, but the President had slipped quietly up by other paths to Kolahun and arrived at an empty compound: the horns and the shouts were Reeves’s party returning as quickly as they could to Kolahun. So I sent Mark off with a letter to the President asking for an interview, and while I and my cousin sat at supper, Mark dramatically returned, bursting in at the door, holding himself poised at the entrance with his hand raised, before he delivered the reply, stuck in a cleft stick, that the President had already moved on from Kolahun to Voinjema. You could tell that he was dramatizing the whole affair, he had persuaded himself that he had escaped by the skin of his teeth from the wicked DC.",

There was no window in front, but a square hole in the door was glazed with a single pane, through which red comfortable rays now stretched out upon the ivied wall in front.

He does not use a particular technique, such as a grid system for periodic checking. Day after day, he just watches the woods. He can see hundreds of square miles of the pinelands, but even small amounts of smoke will quickly attract his eyes. “If a fire starts, it is like someone put a new chair in my living room,” he explains to people who visit his tower. “I see it right away.” He has seen a lot of fires, for the Pine Barrens are particularly flammable, as woodlands go, and they are the scene of some of the most spectacular forest fires that occur in the United States.",

In addition they had every fruit that the place and time afforded: hot crusty apple, peach, and cherry pies, encrusted with cinnamon; puddings and cakes of every sort; and blobbering cobblers inches deep.",

The open ocean lay before me. There was nothing in the way with the exception of Vatu Leile, a miserable little island that persisted in poking up through the sea some twenty miles to the west-southwest— just where I wanted to go. Of course, it seemed quite simple to avoid it by steering a course that would pass it eight or ten miles to the north. It was a black night, and we were running before the wind. The man at the wheel must be told what direction to steer in order to miss Vatu Leile. But what direction? I turned me to the navigation books. \"True Course\" I lighted upon. The very thing! What I wanted was the true course. I read eagerly on:",

Victoriously, he trod the neck of doubt as if it were a serpent: he was joined to the earth, a part of it, and he possessed it; he would be wasted and consumed, filled and renewed eternally; he would feel unceasingly alternate tides of life and dark oblivion; he would be emptied without weariness, replenished for ever with strong joy. He had a tongue for agony, a food for hunger, a door for exile and a surfeit for insatiate desire: exultant certainty welled up in him, he thought he could possess it all, and he cried: ‘Yes! It will be mine!’",

The animals are flighty now, and so I stalk them with more care, rounding the mountain and crawling upwind to a tussock within sixty yards of the small rise where they stand at attention, staring the wrong way. Now and then, a head turns in my direction; I stay motionless, and they do not flare. The creatures are so very tense that even the heavy horns bristle with life. No muscle moves.

It didn’t upset you?”\n\n“I was a little afraid. But it’s all right now that you’ve come back. Lunch is ready, and mother is waiting. Shall we go in?”",

A mile or so ahead, on Topes de Collantes’ highest ridge, loomed a monstrous edifice of incomparable ugliness. Perhaps to do with hydroelectricity? Or a factory? Or a high-security jail? That mile was ‘as the crow flies’. Where the road dipped, before a final climb, the edifice disappeared. An hour later, around a sharp bend, its ten storeys loomed above the road, approached by scores of wide steps, stretching the whole length of that dominant ridge. It presented a curiously blank façade despite rows of small, square, close-together windows. Nothing indicated that this is the Kurhotel, built by Batista in 1936 as a luxury TB sanatorium and given spa hotel status when the Revolution had eradicated the disease. In Trinidad I borrowed an Eyewitness Guide and was diverted to find this Batista souvenir, which had so raised my blood-pressure, described as an ‘anti-stress centre’.",

Her wrists were doll wrists. They had no feeling. George was right. “I mean Fayne Rabb left half an hour ago. She wouldn’t wait.” An imperceptible tightening about her doll wrist made her conscious of some slight awkwardness in her emotion. Her emotion so furnace cold, was pulsing as if the furnace had been lit and was waiting for pulse and beat and warmth of fires that were not. Little fires in corners of rooms were her electric odd emotions. George got me loose, lifted, as it were, a tangle; mama knotted to Minnie and Gart to Gart. The web of Gart on Gart and Minnie (though the summer is always worse in any family) were lifted by George but she had been too tired to run and shout. She hadn’t cared to, simply. She had run and shouted at the sight of Fayne . . . had run to far hills, and found foothold on odd continents. Stones were pulsing beneath thin sandal soles and her feet were shod in purple. “Sometimes exaltation makes a curtain open.” “What’s all this, Hermione?” George had dropped her wrist. He had turned to the piano. “Why don’t you ever any more play anything?”",

On these, they beat such drumming as I have never heard, every sound different, very fast, very complex. (The musicians were tight too.)

I told him about a graduation ceremony I had attended at a university near Rangoon. I had been invited by a friend whose daughter had just been awarded a master’s degree in English literature. Her daughter spent the sweltering morning cloaked in a nylon black gown, posing with friends and family for countless photographs. As I wandered among the crowd I tried to chat to some of the students, and was surprised to discover that few of the English-literature graduates actually spoke any English. Tha Win Kyi clapped his hands together triumphantly, ‘You see?’ he said.",

Then I wrung the socks out, lavished triple antibiotic ointment on the painful, red blister, and slid the socks back on. I hoped the antibiotic would do its job and keep me free from infection. Ready to hike again, I returned to the AT and hustled across the slippery planks of the boardwalk over the Swamp River. I continued weaving through pastures, across bogs adorned with cattails, and along muddy dirt trails as the sun played peekaboo with me. Rain would fall, pause just enough to nurture false hope, and then fall again even harder. I reached the eerily quiet environs of Nuclear Lake and tried to hurry around it. I couldn’t jog now that I had three days of food on my back, but I was happy the trail was flat and easy. In 2003 I’d been shot at—or so it had seemed since the sound was so loud—as I’d rounded the head of Nuclear Lake. Back then I’d hit the ground and army crawled a short distance in the dirt before jumping to my feet and running my little heart out. Today I was too weary—not to mention sore—from my flight across Connecticut to move any quicker than a brisk walk. The area had been deemed safe for public use after the plutonium research facility was closed, but it remained ominous to me. I was grateful to be past it and moving steadily away.",

This visual impression is followed at once by my recognizing that I am seeing my wife sitting there, her head sharp against the blue of the late-afternoon sky, the blue of the sea.\nShe turned and smiled, that familiar smile that over the years I had grown to see as both welcoming and forgiving—marred now, as always when she was unsure or unhappy, by a wrinkling of the upper lip, tiny folds that constrained her wide smile.\n“Hello, there,” she said, words she used indicating a camaraderie she affected only when she felt unwelcome. “I was in the neighborhood, just passing by,” she continued, laughing to indicate that this was a friendly joke. Laughing again at her own laughter, she again showed her uncertainty. At such times she always laughed too much.",

My world sparkled with newfound contentedness and my feet were light, despite the heavy physical lassitude that consumed me. Roots and rocks that had once been impediments were now familiar instruments of maturation. Climbs that were foes were now allies. Here in the southern Appalachians, I felt the hourglass flip over as I drew closer to where Anish was born—confronting the mountains that had once challenged, enthralled, and created her—a woman with new perspectives of power and intimacy. If there was a way to return to the womb, I was doing so now. Winding my way ever southward, I was also going backward, toward Carter Gap shelter where I first signed my name as Anish. And from there, even farther to Springer Mountain the place where, one sunny day in May of 2003, Heather Anderson walked into the Appalachian Mountains—and never walked out.",

She was gone! She was gone! Not a doubt of it. Nobody could have helped. They repeated the same words over and over again as though they couldn’t stop themselves. Never doubted she would go. The lights were gone. No mistake. The lights were gone. Couldn’t expect anything else. She had to go. . . . He noticed that they talked as though they had left behind them nothing but an empty ship. They concluded she would not have been long when she once started. It seemed to cause them some sort of satisfaction. They assured each other that she couldn’t have been long about it — “Just shot down like a flat-iron.” The chief engineer declared that the mast-head light at the moment of sinking seemed to drop “like a lighted match you throw down.” At this the second laughed hysterically. “I am g-g-glad, I am gla-a-a-d.” His teeth went on “like an electric rattle,” said Jim, “and all at once he began to cry. He wept and blubbered like a child, catching his breath and sobbing ‘Oh dear! oh dear! oh dear!’ He would be quiet for a while and start suddenly, ‘Oh, my poor arm! oh, my poor a-a-a-arm!’ I felt I could knock him down. Some of them sat in the stern-sheets. I could just make out their shapes. Voices came to me, mumble, mumble, grunt, grunt. All this seemed very hard to bear. I was cold too. And I could do nothing.

There was an Appalachian Trail notice board there. Although it had been only about ten days since the two women were murdered in Shenandoah National Park, there was already a small poster appealing for information. It had color photographs of them both. They were clearly photos taken by the women themselves along the trail, in hiking gear, looking happy and healthy, radiant even. It was hard to look at them, knowing their doom. It occurred to me, with a small inward start, that had the two women lived they would very probably be arriving in Harpers Ferry just about now, that instead of standing here looking at a poster of them I could be chatting with them—or indeed, given a slight alteration of luck and fate, that it could be them looking at a poster of me and Katz looking trail-happy and confident.",

Now most of the young associate those activities with an organized (by someone else) Adventure Holiday. Or, if not travelling in a group, they look for commercial campsites providing hot showers, cooking and laundering facilities, electricity and ‘security’. Camping used to mean finding a level spot where you could put up your tent, preferably within reach of firewood and running water. This, I gather, is now known as ‘camping wild’ and generally regarded as a life-endangering form of eccentricity. Which clearly it isn’t or I and thousands like me wouldn’t still be around.",

How mixed our passions are, and how elastic must be the word that would cover any one of them! Amherst's, at that moment, were all stained with the deep wound to his self-love.",

McGuire opened his old leather case, squinted at the needle, and loaded it. Then, the cigarette still plastered on his fat lip, coiling smoke, he walked over to the bed and even as Gant raised his fear-bright eyes to him, he took him by his stringy arm, and grunting ‘All right, W.O.’, he plunged the needle in above the elbow. Gant moaned a little, and relaxed insensibly after the needle had gone in: in a few minutes his eyes grew dull, and his great hands loosened in their clutch.",
