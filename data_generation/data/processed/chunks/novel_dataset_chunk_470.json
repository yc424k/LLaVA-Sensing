He had the others range nearby and collect as much driftwood as they could gather, piling it high.

The stick was ludicrously outsized—it must have been twelve feet long—and so rotted that it fell in half just from being picked up. As I ran, it lost another half, and another, until finally it was no more than a soft spongy stub—it would have been like defending myself with a loaf of bread—so I threw it down and picked up a big jagged rock in each hand, and quickened my pace yet again. The dogs now seemed to be moving parallel to me, as if they couldn’t find a way through, but at a distance of no more than forty or fifty yards. They were furious. My unease expanded, and I began to run a little faster.",

Basically, a seat with four extending legs, each with a small wheel, designed to support a non-walking child and encourage it to use its legs to propel itself. For the first time, I was freed from the confines of cot or pushchair and was able to move when I wanted and where I wanted, to explore the outer limits of our house and garden. The transformation in my character was pronounced and immediate. The mewling, cantankerous cot-bound fatty, became a happy, laughing toddler scooting around at high speed in his Mothercare chariot. My parents realised I wasn't actually a bad baby, I was a bored one. Once I was able to move freely, I was happy. Something that remains true to this day.",

We camped and cooked and made our fires in the open, whatever the weather, while the nomads could find shelter and warmth in their heavy tents. But if we looked as if we had come down in the world, our wits were not blunted and our minds were continually occupied. Very few Europeans had been in these regions and we knew that everything we observed might have a value later on. We still thought then that we should be returning to civilisation within a measurable time. Common dangers and struggles had linked us in a close bond of companionship; each knew the others’ virtues and failings, and so we were able to help one another in times of depression.",

The thought of these vast stacks of books would drive him mad: the more he read, the less he seemed to know – the greater the number of the books he read, the greater the immense uncountable number of those which he could never read would seem to be. Within a period of ten years he read at least 20,000 volumes – deliberately the number is set low – and opened the pages and looked through many times that number. This may seem unbelievable, but it happened. Dryden said this about Ben Jonson: ‘Other men read books, but he reads libraries’ – and so now was it with this boy. Yet this terrific orgy of the books brought him no comfort, peace, or wisdom of the mind and heart. Instead, his fury and despair increased from what they fed upon, his hunger mounted with the food it ate.",

Now one wonders why anyone ever expected (if they did) Africa’s new nations to function smoothly. In 1960 Harold Macmillan told the South African parliament, ‘This African national consciousness is happening everywhere. The wind of change is blowing through this continent and, whether we like it or not, this growth of national consciousness is a political fact.’ But the political fact was anti-colonialism rather than ‘national consciousness’. After a generation of independence, young Africans who make ‘patriotic’ noises seem to be merely striking a pose, to go with their blue jeans and bubble-gum.",

With drowsy wonder she remembered this time yesterday, and the afternoon at Hampton Court, when she had raced–yes, actually raced–about the gardens, propelled by Christopher’s firm hand on her elbow and keeping up with his great strides, laughing, talking, the blood quick in her veins, the scent of spring in her nostrils, the gay adoring words of that strange young man in her ears. Mr. Lambton must be about Christopher’s age, she thought. Yet to Mr. Lambton she was merely some one, perhaps more accurately something, to be placed carefully in a chair out of a draught and then left. Which of them was right? It was most unsettling. Was she the same person to-night as last night? Was she two persons? If she was only one, which one? Or was she a mere vessel of receptiveness, a transparent vessel into which other people poured their view of her, and she instantly reflected the exact colour of their opinion?",

It is with these greasy crumbs, slobbered over napkins, and little corpses that we have to build. Always it begins again; always there is the enemy; eyes meeting ours; fingers twitching ours; the effort waiting. Call the waiter. Pay the bill. We must pull ourselves up out of our chairs. We must find our coats. We must go. Must, must, must—detestable word. Once more, I who had thought myself immune, who had said, “Now I am rid of all that”, find that the wave has tumbled me over, head over heels, scattering my possessions, leaving me to collect, to assemble, to heap together, summon my forces, rise and confront the enemy.",

A bell chimed behind them, and Richard raised his head. Then he opened his eyes which wore for a second the queer look of a short-sighted person’s whose spectacles are lost. It took him a moment to recover from the impropriety of having snored, and possibly grunted, before a young lady. To wake and find oneself left alone with one was also slightly disconcerting.",

Now Varuna began careening downwind at a fast clip. The taffrail log was broken, and although I didn’t know the exact figures on how fast we were going, we were hauling. I screamed to Dinghy and Mimine, “Hey, you guys, come and see how fast we’re going! At this rate, we’ll be in Pago Pago in seven more days!” Dinghy took a peep out of the companionway just as a wave scuttled playfully into the cockpit, landing a couple of drops on his nose. “Nope, I don’t like it. I don’t like it at all,” he seemed to say and spun 180 degrees back to bed.",

Many of our buses had indeed vanished, for whatever reason, and the consequent mêlée was soon out of the marshals’ control – a wild struggle to board each vehicle, with little consideration given to geriatrics. Yet there was no ill-temper involved, just impatience – which is odd, given the black attitude to time. Everyone shouted and sang and laughed while pulling and shoving and elbowing each other out of the way. Several slim youths climbed in through windows, grinning triumphantly, and many swarmed onto the roofs. There was no room, on the way home, to unfurl our flag. At breakfast next morning my minders seemed abstracted. (As usual, breakfast was one slice of bread and marge and a cup of herbal tea.) Then abruptly Lucretia told me that I must move to another shack, some distance away. When I registered reluctance, being so very happy chez Blossom, Georgina said, ‘They know you’re here, they say they’ll torch the place if you stay.’",

The men make the top their open-air locker room; they strip down to their undies and disappear behind a frothy lather, then reemerge bared brown again by the strong jet of cold on their backs. Below them, small nude boys do cannonballs; hugging their knees to their chests, they leap into the deepest pool, scoring splashes and screaming with joy. They then hop out and run up shivering to jump again. They soak a young girl on the lowest level; she ignores them as she concentrates on washing her baby brother. She soaps him up, pulls his hands above his head and dunks him; he comes up spluttering but never screaming. Around her, women lather, pummel and slap saris, shirts and suits against the concrete. They carry sodden heavy loads on their heads, hang the clothes on the nearest tree and return to fill the buckets with water. They’ll wash at home, hidden. In many parts of rural India women are forbidden to even defecate in daylight, let alone wash in public.",

The view into the wave, the islands beyond. The rough sand, the soft air. The deadly snakes, the dadakulachi, were a rarity now. I felt delivered to a pampered new world. There was cold beer. There were chairs. There was a helicopter landing pad where the fishermen had once stacked dry wood for signal fires. I wondered what little Atiljan, who had slept in a nest of green leaves, was doing now. Was he a fisherman with kids of his own? Most of the workers at the resort were villagers from Nabila, but only one or two were ethnic Indians. Fiji’s democracy had been smashed by a series of military coups mounted by ethnic nationalists from the Fijian side. Ethnic Indians had been turned into second-class citizens. The Tavarua resort had curried favor with the military regime by staging a professional surf contest at a time when Fiji’s sporting links to the world had been largely severed by international sanctions. When I asked a gentle young bartender from Nabila what she thought about the government’s moves against democracy and ethnic Indians, she shyly said that she supported the government. “They are for the Fijians,” she said.",

There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.",

He had never been there, really.\nShe had gone out to look for him. The road kept on curling round like a snake, bringing her back and back to the white gate of the Farm.\nWhen she got through the gate she stepped off the field on to the low bridge over a black canal. The long, sharp-pointed road cut straight as a dyke through the flat fields, between two lines of slender trees, tall poles with tufted tops.\nShe knew she was awake now because the light whitened and the wind moved in the tree tufts and the road felt hard under her feet. When she came to the village, to the long grey walls with narrow shutters, she knew John was there. He came down the street towards the canal bridge. A group of women and children walked with him, dressed in black. Dutch women. Dutch babies. She could see their overalls and high caps and large, upturned shoes very black and distinct in the white light. This was real.\nThey pointed their fingers and stared at her with secretive, inimical faces. Terror crept in over the street, subtle, drifting and penetrating like an odour.\nJohn's face was happy and excited; that was how she knew him. His face was real, its happiness and excitement were real. But as he passed her it changed; it turned on her with a look she didn't know. Eyes of hatred, eyes that repudiated and betrayed her.",

The moss and fungus that I thought would never stop growing ceases, curls up, is sucked back into the dirt, leaving only cracked leaves and sticks to cover a hard, hot and parched earth. I’m approaching the end of my three-month extension. It’s September. I think I might miss my flight back to England. I’ve already told my parents I’m thinking about staying longer. They’re trying not to be too worried, I think, when I tell them I have no plans to book another flight, when I tell them I’ve overstayed my visa, when I say it’s fine. They can hear how happy I am.",

A broad rock-cut path, worthy of the Romans, and probably built to allow ships to be drawn on land, ascends part of the way: the rest is rather a dangerous climb. A precipitous crag, inaccessible to invaders; all the summit built over and the limestone chiselled smooth in certain tracts where a sentinel may have paced. I suspect that this fortress dates from 1532, for in that year a native of Sorrento received the grant of all three islets on the condition that one of them should be fortified. It looks as if no inspector had been sent down from head-quarters to see that the work was properly done: a jerry-built affair-King Robert’s tower will long outlast it.",

Mathias arrives, followed by two young Frenchmen and a Frenchwoman, who introduce themselves as André Monternot, the anesthesiologist’s husband, and Michel and his girlfriend Nanou. They carry an enormous picnic basket, just in case I don’t feel up to accompanying them to dinner, but I can’t wait to get going. I think I can get across about a hundred feet of open ground by myself, so we make for Mathias’s car.

For years I’d been trying to fix up a trip for my mother, but every time I was about to make our reservations, fighting would break out again, or some political convulsion would yank the country back into the darkness, behind the creepers. The area around Angkor is still not entirely safe—2.6 million land mines remain unexcavated there, I was told, and it could take twenty years at least to find them all—and the political situation is still as changeable as the wind. But now, for the first time since 1969, there were direct flights to Siem Reap (the provincial town four miles from Angkor Wat) from Bangkok, allowing you to bypass the tumult of the rest of Cambodia. And, as of the last day of 1997, the Raffles International Group of Singapore had reopened the restored Grand Hotel d’Angkor, a sumptuous French colonial palace built in 1929, and now a luxe homage to the nostalgia of Indochina, all wicker chairs and slowly turning fans and teak paneling, a vision of Banana Republic chic.",

Once this was a typical small-town hotel, its two rows of bedrooms overlooking a wide lawn. Now everything is ramshackle. And the lavatory is inaccessible; one has to find the person with the key – and who is that? At any given moment, where is s/he to be found? When those questions prove unanswerable I use my mug as a jerry and tip it out the window, as did many London citizens in the seventeenth century to Pepys’s distress. Here no distress is caused, only astonishment on the part of adjacent livestock: hens, geese, goats and a pathetically lean cow. I’m writing this with my room door open and a hen and ten fluffy chicks have just wandered in to hoover the floor – expecting, and finding, numerous crumbs left by the last occupant. In Mount Fletcher, with fowl busily pecking around my bedroom floor and that cow scratching her neck against my windowsill, I feel more at ease than I ever could in a dorp hotel. Also, R30 covers the cost of supper, room and breakfast, for which one pays at least R130 in ‘South Africa’.",
