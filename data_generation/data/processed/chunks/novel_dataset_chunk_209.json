They had been one twenty years ago, when the wide-fronted building, with its long rows of windows, was the dominating house in Morfe village. Rowcliffe was now the dominating man in it. He had given the old place back its own.\nAnd he had spent any amount of money on it. He had had all the woodwork painted white, and the whole house repapered and redecorated. He had laid down parquet flooring in the big square hall that he had made and in the new drawing-room upstairs; and he had bought a great deal of beautiful and expensive furniture.\nAnd now he was building a garage and laying out a croquet ground and tennis lawns at the back.\nHe and Mary had been superintending these works all afternoon till a shower sent them indoors. And now they were sitting together in the drawing-room, in the breathing-space that came between the children's hour and dinner.\nMary had sent the children back to the nursery a little earlier than usual. Rowcliffe had complained of headache.\nHe was always complaining of headaches. They dated from his marriage, and more particularly from one night in June eight years ago.\nBut Rowcliffe ignored the evidence of dates. He ignored everything that made him feel uncomfortable. He had put Gwenda from him. He had said plainly to Mary (in one poignant moment not long before the birth of their third child), \"If you're worrying about me and Gwenda, you needn't. She was never anything to me.\"\nThat was not saying there had never been anything between them, but\nMary knew what he had meant.",

We shiver in the gray air and look across to a blur of beings chanting for the godly games to begin. Akhara bodyguards in white G-strings ensure that the sadhus get to touch the divine waters before the inferior—they form a barrier across the sand and those who try to break it are belted hard on the head.

Daniel Muir’s dogmatic Christianity held that God had created man in his own image and given him dominion over the fish of the sea, the fowl of the air, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. John Muir always had a weakness for animals; as a boy, he’d accidentally choked a cat to death while attempting to remove a bird trapped in its mouth. “Nature’s object in making animals and plants might possibly be first of all the happiness of each one of them, not the creation of all for the happiness of one,” he reasoned. To Muir, nature was not humankind’s servant. Nature and God were one. Within a year of settling in California, in 1868, he’d already formulated what would become the core of his philosophy: “When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.”*",

I didn’t bother to explain to Doug why blowing that horn needlessly could be an imposition to someone trying to sleep five feet behind him. But the thought reminded me of a time when I was a schoolchild in a bus full of kids, and many of us had made that same motion. That trucker had smiled at us and gently shook his head, ‘No.’ He pointed a thumb to the closed curtains of his truck’s sleeper bunk. He had then set one hand on his cheek and tilted his head in a gesture of sleeping.",

The trip was the polar opposite of our Harmony Jet experience, and worth only a bare description. The bus, like the station, was modern and clean and perfectly comfortable. I counted eight other passengers, all Egyptian, plus the driver and a steward. The steward showed us to our seats and chatted with us for a few minutes. We stopped at El Gouna along the way and picked up another couple. Then the steward distributed snack boxes to each of the passengers. The box included pastries and bottled water and toiletries. Other than that, the ride was quick and quiet. Teresa admired the Red Sea for several hours, while I admired the half-built apartment blocks that lined the coast for hundreds of miles. The bus dropped us at Midan Abdel Moneim Riad, near Hilton Ramses, and we walked over the river, to the Novotel where we had stayed a couple weeks earlier.",

For two days, Akka and Varuna stayed tied together, drifting along with all the garbage in the Indian Ocean. We were wallowing in the center of converging currents 100 miles off the coast of India and the filth was revolting. Black oils covered the surface and garbage floated every 100 feet. Not only did we stop diving into the water, I didn’t even want to wash my hands in it. Rather we pulled the boats together and jumped back and forth. The filth that mired us?sludge, bags, plastics, styrofoam, dishwashing-liquid bottles, flip-flops and wrappers?coated the hulls of the boats with a thick black film. Olivier and I lamented how any sea life could survive such appalling pollution. Indeed, here the ocean seemed completely barren of life and the scene was sad enough to make one cry.",

This was a broad, modern boulevard, more American than European. It was lined with sleek glass and chrome office buildings, but the central grass strip was scrubby and uncared-for and the few benches where you could rest had syringes scattered beneath them. As I moved further into the city the buildings became older and rather more pleasing, but there was still something lacking. I paused to consult my map in a tiny park on a pleasant residential street near the cathedral square and it was depressingly squalid ? grassless and muddy, with broken benches, and pigeons picking among hundreds of cigarette butts and disused tram tickets.

The unsteady phantom of terror behind his glassy eyes seemed to stand still and look into mine wistfully. “They turned me out of my bunk in the middle watch to look at her sinking,” he pursued in a reflective tone. His voice sounded alarmingly strong all at once. I was sorry for my folly. There was no snowy-winged coif of a nursing sister to be seen flitting in the perspective of the ward; but away in the middle of a long row of empty iron bedsteads an accident case from some ship in the Roads sat up brown and gaunt with a white bandage set rakishly on the forehead. Suddenly my interesting invalid shot out an arm thin like a tentacle and clawed my shoulder. “Only my eyes were good enough to see. I am famous for my eyesight. That’s why they called me, I expect. None of them was quick enough to see her go, but they saw that she was gone right enough, and sang out together — like this.” . . . A wolfish howl searched the very recesses of my soul. “Oh! make ‘im dry up,” whined the accident case irritably. “You don’t believe me, I suppose,” went on the other, with an air of ineffable conceit. “I tell you there are no such eyes as mine this side of the Persian Gulf. Look under the bed.”",

But some lady with fair hair and silver ornaments had said, Lucy said, about the entrée, was it really made at home? But it was the salmon that bothered Mrs Walker, as she spun the plates round and round, and pushed in dampers and pulled out dampers; and there came a burst of laughter from the dining-room; a voice speaking; then another burst of laughter—the gentlemen enjoying themselves when the ladies had gone. The tokay, said Lucy, running in. Mr Dalloway had sent for the tokay, from the Emperor’s cellars, the Imperial Tokay.*",

Try the same method with thinly sliced onions, adding a teaspoon of brown sugar to the balsamic and letting the onions slowly carmelize.

The cart sways incompetently from side to side. Now one wheel sticks in the rut, and at once innumerable natives in loin-cloths swarm round it, chattering excitedly. But they do nothing. Time seems endless, ambition vain. Over all broods a sense of the uselessness of human exertion. There are strange sour smells. An old man in a ditch continues to chew betel and to contemplate his navel. But now, behold, Percival advances; Percival rides a flea-bitten mare, and wears a sun helmet. By applying the standards of the West, by using the violent language that is natural to him, the bullock-cart is righted in less than five minutes. The Oriental problem is solved. He rides on; the multitude cluster round him, regarding him as if he were—what indeed he is—a God.’",

Then my friends and I set about transforming the doma into a studio space by removing the oven and capping the well. I put in a long table where I could do calligraphy, and mount and back paintings. The other rooms of the house had ceilings, but the doma, in order to allow smoke from the oven to escape, was open all the way up to the rafters, like Chiiori. But the rafters were so crammed with lumber and old sliding doors that it was impossible to see them. We carried out the detritus, and swept down one hundred and fifty years of accumulated soot, enough to fill ten large garbage bags. In doing so, a wide expanse of rafters and crossbeams magically appeared. This airy room is now my workspace.",

Everyone insisted she would be wasting her money because lake Elementeita’s water is saline, as is the water on all the neighbouring properties.\nAfter the geologists had been and the necessary permits were obtained, they drilled. What they found was the largest flowing fresh water river imaginable, and no one could believe their eyes as the water gushed out.\nWe clustered around the borehole and when the pump was turned on, the water did indeed shoot out in a powerful fountain, cool and pure and sweet.\nThere were goats under and also up in the branches of acacia trees, birds everywhere, and a fenced area where a gang of African ladies were weeding and digging with hoes. James explained that they were preparing a patch where he was going to grow turf to cover the rest of the land where Vivien’s house would be built.\nAs well as the two resident dogs, there were a couple of sleek puppies wriggling and running around. ‘Where did these dogs come from?’ she asked James.\nHe waved a hand vaguely and said, ‘The woman who lives over there – she’s gone to Nairobi for a few days and asked me to look after them.’",

A yak’s head was nailed above every door. There was a wooden mosque, with carved windows of latticework. Its open door had several different kinds of carving around the frame, and as we passed by I could see a corbelled wooden roof and carpets glowing on the floor within. The narrow lanes were white with fallen apricot blossoms, from the orchards that were everywhere. A small river ran through the village, delicate bridges arching over it at intervals.",

Their poems speak eloquently of a passionate and precise relationship with nature, and of the blend of receptivity and detachment which characterised their interactions with it. Some of the poems read like jotted lists, or field-notes: ‘Swarms of bees, beetles, soft music of the world, a gentle humming; brent geese, barnacle geese, shortly before All Hallows, music of the dark wild torrent.’ Others record single charmed instants: a blackbird calling from a gorse branch near Belfast Loch, foxes at play in a glade. Marban, a ninth-century hermit who lived in a hut in a fir-grove near Druim Rolach, wrote of the ‘wind’s voice against a branchy wood on a day of grey cloud’. A nameless monk, responsible for drystone walling on the island of North Rona in the ninth century, stopped his work to write a poem that spoke of the delight he felt at standing on a ‘clear headland’, looking over the ‘smooth strand’ to the ‘calm sea’, and hearing the calls of ‘the wondrous birds’. A tenth-century copyist, working in an island monastery, paused long enough to scribble a note in Gaelic beside his Latin text. ‘Pleasant to me is the glittering of the sun today upon these margins.’",

These are sinister and supernatural figures, gods from the underworld perhaps, who hover in space, or dance, or stand solidly planted on two feet carrying weapons – a club or sword.

Settling at a heavy inn-table, thawing and tingling, with wine, bread, and cheese handy and my papers, books and diary all laid out; writing up the day’s doings, hunting for words in the dictionary, drawing, struggling with verses, or merely subsiding in a vacuous and contented trance while the snow thawed off my boots. An elderly woman came downstairs and settled by the stove with her sewing. Spotting my stick and rucksack and the puddle of melting snow, she said, with a smile, ‘Wer reitet so spät durch Nacht und Wind?’ My German, now fifteen days old, was just up to this: ‘Who rides so late through night and wind?’ But I was puzzled by reitet. (How was I to know that it was the first line of Goethe’s famous Erlkönig, made more famous still by the music of Schubert?) What, a foreigner? I knew what to say at this point, and came in on cue: … ‘Englischer Student … zu Fuss nach Konstantinopel’ … I’d got it pat by now. ‘Konstantinopel?’ she said. ‘Oh Weh!’ O Woe! So far! And in midwinter too. She asked where I would be the day after, on New Year’s Eve. Somewhere on the road, I said, ‘You can’t go wandering about in the snow on Sylvester-abend!’ she answered. ‘And where are you staying tonight, pray?’ I hadn’t thought yet. Her husband had come in a little while before and overheard our exchange. ‘Stay with us,’ he said. ‘You must be our guest.’",

There are also several restaurants and a few shops. Buildings sit at the very edge of the rocky banks, water laps at their foundations. The northern half of the island houses the Mövenpick. The barracks were built in the 1960s, to house thousands of workers from the nearby dam project. Years later, when the dam was finished, the government sold the barracks and the land to a hotel developer. Then came the tower, and the villas, and the shade trees, and the lawns, and a high, stone wall stretched from east to west across the island to keep the southern neighbors from enjoying everything, or anything, the resort has to offer.",

He thought they might have some old news clippings about the Harriman visit. They didn’t, but they did have something just as good: original hardbound copies of the first two volumes of the Harriman Alaska Series, published in 1901. Harriman had paid to have Edward Curtis’s gelatin silver prints reproduced as photogravures, giving them a rich, almost tactile texture. The most inviting of them was identified as Footpath Along Indian River, Sitka. I walked the mile from St. Michael’s down to the end of the main waterfront road, which terminated at the Sitka National Historical Park.
