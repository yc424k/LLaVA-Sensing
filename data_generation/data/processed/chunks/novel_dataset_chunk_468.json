    "target_paragraph": "Yet despite his popular success, Gumercindo, like many artists, survives on the edge, struggling to make ends meet. Kind and generous, warm and open to his many musician friends, he nevertheless lives alone, and there are times, he readily admits, when he lacks the will to carry on. Perhaps, as Martín later suggested, we simply caught him on a bad day, but rarely have I known a Colombian to indulge in such despair, openly and in front of strangers, as if cast adrift in a miasma of existential misery and helplessness so powerful as to overwhelm pride. His music, perhaps not surprisingly, echoes his dark moods, suggesting that his depression, so evident as we spoke, was less ephemeral than a real affliction. His lyrics speak of rivers of grief, forgotten and abandoned, with corpses kept afloat by vultures, mountains that burn as the sun scores the sky and looks down on the homeless as they walk alone in sorrow, seeking shelter in settlements shattered by war.",

And the lady—what was she doing there? No lady ever came to the house, yet this one had certainly got in, because Minnie had seen her getting out, and you can’t get out, she reasoned, if you haven’t first got in. The front door bell hadn’t been rung, though, or Minnie would have answered it. How she had got in Minnie couldn’t think. All she knew about her was feet—tiny ones, with high heels—going down the steps, and very thin legs like a child’s, and a back being helped by the master—funny to see him helping anybody—into the taxi.",

I looked down at my dusty trail running shoes rhythmically striking the ground. When I looked back up, the tree was the side of a mountain again. I squinted. Now, a tree.

This extraordinary panic of sounds, combined with the ‘evening’ twitter of bewildered birds and the unique, greenish half-light, evidently aroused within me some deep racial memory, and for an instant, at the precise moment of total eclipse and estrangement from our whole source of life, I felt as my own that primitive fear which was then dominating the whole of Nepal.",

    "target_paragraph": "Our wanderings had ended under a clock tower in the old Ghetto, where the hands moved anti-clockwise and indicated the time in Hebrew alphabetic numbers. The russet-coloured synagogue, with its steep and curiously dentated gables, was one of the oldest in Europe; yet it was built on the site of a still older fane which was burnt down in a riot, in which three thousand Jews were massacred, on Easter Sunday, 1389. (The proximity of the Christian festival to the Feast of the Passover, coupled with the myth of ritual murder, made Easter week a dangerous time.) The cemetery hard by was one of the most remarkable places in the city. Thousands of tombstones in tiers, dating from the fifteenth to the end of the eighteenth century, were huddled under the elder branches. The moss had been scoured from the Hebrew letters and the tops of many slabs bore the carved emblems of the tribes whose members they commemorated: grapes for Israel, a pitcher for Levi, hands raised in a gesture of benediction for Aaron. The emblems on the other stones resembled the arms parlant which symbolize some family names in heraldry: a stag for Hirsch, a carp for Karpeles, a cock for Hahn, a lion for Löw; and so on. A sarcophagus marked the resting place of the most famous bearer of the name of Löw. He was Rabbi Jehuda ben Bezabel, the famous scholar and miracle-worker who died in 1609. His tomb is the most important memento of Prague’s involvement with the supernatural, for it was the Rabbi Löw who constructed the many-legended robot-figure of the Golem, which he could secretly endow with life by opening its mouth and inserting slips of paper on which magic formulae were inscribed.",

We could hear gun shots close by and were told to remain in the ground floor of our home, as a safety precaution. I felt anxious because my father was away on a business trip in Tokyo at the time and was unable to return home to us because Manila International Airport was shut.

The creature’s beautiful light brown hide stirred less than an arm’s length away behind the slats in the trailer’s side while the cow shifted weight and moved restlessly.

Between these delights are several bureaux de change, and a glass-walled triangular protuberance called Internet Service, and unalluring souvenir shops and a prayer room for Muslims. Oil-rich tourists are valued and much in evidence, pushing mega-trolleys piled high with electronic goods. It was quite a relief to come upon the John Bull Pub, very authentic with ‘Traditional Ales, Fine Wines & Spirits’ in elegant golden script above a splendidly carved mahogany bar. Here were polished wooden tables, handsome chairs with velvetish green or crimson seats, an agreeably patterned carpet and dim lighting. Glancing at my watch, I did a swift calculation – 11.30 p.m. London time, not an improper hour for a beer.",

Some of them joke, finding comic relief in the camera’s busily taking pictures that no one will ever see. Others stoke a furnace of fear. Fear becomes sustenance. Its energy feeds action. I must be careful. I fight blind panic: I do not want the power from my pumping adrenalin to lead to confused and counterproductive activity. I fight the urge to fall into catatonic hysteria: I do not want to sit frozen in fear until the end comes. Focus, I tell myself. Focus and get moving.",

Many of the streets are lined with enormous pine trees and a glorious garden of lawns and lavishly blooming rose bushes stretches in front of the mosque. There were no restrictions about me visiting this mosque (without a camera) and it is so very beautiful that I felt it compensated for the Meshed frustration. I sat on the shady side of the enormous courtyard for almost an hour, enjoying the mosaics and the gold of the brickwork glowing against the blue sky. It was very peaceful there with no sound or movement except for a myriad twittering martins swooping in and out of the cool, dim passages between the hundreds of pillared archways. Meshed is probably as beautiful but it would be difficult to surpass this. The predominant colour here is blue of all shades, with yellow, black, pink, brown, green and orange tiles blended so skilfully that from a certain distance a façade or minaret looks as though made of some magic precious metal for the colour of which there is no name. Also, quite apart from its colouring, the proportions of the whole vast series of buildings are superb.",

Warmer temperatures and shifting ice were grinding the ridges down, crumbling them to pieces as the ice twisted and shattered beneath them. He could hear the distant rumbling as they disintegrated, and he hoped this movement presaged open seas and the arrival of a ship. But he knew in his heart that it was too soon. He thought of Munro and Maurer and Templeman at Rodger’s Harbor and wondered how they were faring. Someone should try to get there to check on them, but he doubted anyone had the strength. He certainly didn’t. They’d need more food before such an attempt. They needed more food soon, period, or it was over for them all. “We can stand a bit yet,” he wrote, “but let us pray something will turn up before things get too bad.”",

But now, with one day down and another to go, I was beginning to feel stranded and fidgety, like someone at the end of a long period of convalescence. At least, I reflected optimistically, the unseasonable two inches of snow that had brutally lashed East Anglia, causing chaos on the roads and forcing people to battle their way through perilous snowdrifts, some of them as high as their ankletops, had mercifully passed this corner of England by. Here the elements were benign and the world outside the dining room window sparkled weakly under a pale wintry sun.",

Team sports were effectively out of the question for students opposed to the war—the coaches were the most rock-ribbed members of a generally conservative, pro-war faculty and administration, and they were not shy about ragging on kids they suspected of being commies. I had two English teachers, Mr. Jay and Mrs. Ball, who changed my life’s course by introducing me to the difficult pleasures of Melville, Shakespeare, Eliot, Hemingway, Saul Bellow, Dylan Thomas, and, most devastatingly, James Joyce. I saw now, in Ventura, the snotgreen sea, the scrotumtightening sea. The hobos from the old fairgrounds at C Street now came scuttling out of Dubliners. I became, in my own mind, Stephen Dedalus, privately sworn to silence, exile, cunning. (Regrettably, my hero was afraid of the ocean.) Los Angeles was a pallid stand-in for Ireland.

I leapt streams, passed over sponge-bogs of sodden peat, soft cushions of haircap mosses. There were big standing groves of green juniper, alders, rowans and the odd dark cherry. The pines, with their reptilian bark, gave off a spicy resinous smell, and their branches wore green and silver lichens of fantastical shapes: antlers, shells, seaweeds, bones, rags. Between the trees grew heather and bracken. I climbed a whippy rowan, scattering its orange berries in all directions, and a tall old birch that shivered under my weight near its summit.",

A bit more at ease, I turned my attention to my surroundings. These were Russian women as I’d never seen them before. Gone were their pretensions of appearing dignified or regal: They were massaging packets of salt into each other’s pores, examining one another’s cellulite, swapping beauty secrets, gossiping about jobs, kids, and lovers. Naked as they were, not a one sucked in her stomach, electing instead to let them spill out with freedom. I managed to give up makeup and hair dryers in college, but that was one level of emancipation I hadn’t yet achieved. I always sucked in. As I gazed at the room full of round, extended bellies, I thought about the heavy helpings of butter, jams, honey, and creams that Elena and Nadezhda shamelessly smeared on their food while I allowed myself only the paltriest smidgen and decided that being at peace with one’s naked body must be the highest degree of self-liberation. I looked around another minute or so, gathering up the courage, before cautiously letting out my stomach, too.",

After making an example of half a dozen tiresome persons by having them quietly stabbed or shot—nothing was ever proved against him though everybody knew it was his work—he experienced no further opposition in his political career. Morena never threatens, they say; he performs. A safe man! From a timorous Liberal Government, his avowed enemies, he extorted the title of Commendatore; not because he attached any value to such outward distinctions but because, like a true Camorrista, he never lost an opportunity of showing that he could do what he pleased with everybody, Government included. It was an open secret that the next vacant portfolio of Justice would be at his disposal. All this of course was years and years ago.",

    "target_paragraph": "Congress gave the agencies—gave the Secretary of the Interior—up to seven years to study and to present the case for each selection among these national-interest lands. Personnel began moving north. Pat Pourchot, for example, just out of college, had taken the Civil Service examination and then had wandered around the Denver Federal Center looking for work. He had nothing much in mind and was ready for almost any kind of job that might be offered. He happened into the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation. Before long, he was descending Alaskan rivers. He had almost no experience with canoes or kayaks or with backpacking or camping, but he learned swiftly. John Kauffmann (a friend of mine of many years) had been planning new Park System components, such as the C.&O. Canal National Historical Park and the Cape Cod National Seashore. Transferring to Alaska, he built a house in Anchorage, and soon cornered as his special province eight and a third million acres of the central Brooks Range. When confirmed by Congress, the area will become Gates of the Arctic National Park. It is a couple of hundred miles wide, and is east of the Salmon River. For five years, he has walked it, flown it, canoed its rivers —camped in many weathers below its adze-like rising peaks. Before he came up here, he was much in the wild (he has been a ranger in various places and is the author of a book on eastern American rivers), but nonetheless he was a blue-blazer sort of man, who could blend into the tussocks at the Metropolitan Club. Unimaginable, looking at him now. If he were to take off his shirt and shake it, the dismembered corpses of vintage mosquitoes would fall to the ground. Tall and slim in the first place, he is now spare. After staring so long at the sharp, flinty peaks of the central Brooks Range, he has come to look much like them. His physiognomy, in sun and wind, has become, more or less, grizzly. Any bear that took a bite of John Kauffmann would be most unlikely to complete the meal.",
