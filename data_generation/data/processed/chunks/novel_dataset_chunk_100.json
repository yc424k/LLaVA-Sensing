I got the idea to do an article on remarkable coincidences and sent off a query letter to one of these publications, which expressed serious interest and promised payment of $500 if published—a sum of money I could very handily have done with. But when I came to write the article, I realized that, although I had plenty of information about scientific studies into the probabilities of coincidence, I didn’t have nearly enough examples of remarkable coincidences themselves to give the article sufficient zip or to fill fifteen hundred words of space. So I wrote a letter to the magazine saying I wouldn’t be able to deliver and left it on the top of my typewriter to post the next day. Then I dressed myself in respectable clothing and drove to work at The Times.",

He said it was maca, an old Andean energy drink made from a root that grows at high altitudes. After one mugful, he sat up straighter and started speaking more clearly. (I later learned that maca has a reputation for being stimulating in other ways. In the United States it’s marketed as “organic Viagra.”) Thus fortified, he walked into town to get a sense of how serious the local strikers were about enforcing the paro on the second day. To my great relief, the fervor had cooled a bit and we were able to hire a car to take us to KM 82 to start the hike. There we met our team of six porters, who would be carrying everything we needed on their backs? tents, cooking gear, even a portable toilet. (Regulations now limit each porter’s burden to fifty-five pounds, but I wondered if wages were prorated to reflect the nature of one’s burden.) We introduced ourselves, and they hoisted their loads, each the size of a small bookcase, and walked rapidly away.",

    "target_paragraph": "By 1980 the peasants’ official income was 40 per cent lower than the workers’ and their pensions and social security benefits were only half (occasionally two-thirds) that of the rest of the population. In the mid 1980s fierce new laws threatened them with starvation; until then, they had been free to dispose of the produce of their family plots and of any sheep they might be running on uncollectivised hillsides. When a drastic reduction in plot size was combined with a compulsory production structure, surpluses – in the unlikely event of there being any – could only be sold at fixed low prices. Black marketeering penalties were increased and Securitate officers swarmed through the villages demanding from each household its bureaucratically determined and often wildly unrealistic quota. As always, the poorest suffered most. One elderly widow, living alone and too rheumaticky to cultivate her plot, instead kept a cow on it. In February 1989, when no milk came for lack of fodder, she felt such terror that the wretched animal was sacrificed – tethered one night on the railway track. Costin noted a connection between the effectiveness of state terrorism and the potential victim’s relative wealth. ‘By ’89,’ he said, ‘even fairly high-up Party and Securitate officials were very hungry and as the laws became more hard they were often enforced more softly – if you knew how to deal with officials and had something to sell. Because that old widow had nothing to sell, she would have been punished – very cruelly, as an example to others. And as proof that the Securitate locally were doing their duty, supervising quotas – though often they weren’t! She was not a stupid woman to be so frightened.’",

They organise themselves in designs so large that they are best witnessed from the vantage of a falcon or an airman. At Dungeness, the shingle is arranged into giant floreate blooms. Orford forms itself in long parallel ridges, each of which marks a time when a storm cast up thousands of tonnes of gravel along the shore, and fattened the spit. These ridges are the stone equivalents of growth rings in a tree trunk. Aerial images of Blakeney show it to possess the complex beauty of a neuron: the long stem of the spit, and to its leeward a marshland that floods and emerges with every tide - a continually self-revising labyrinth of channel and scarp.",

The damp was inside the walls and the carpets were full of cigarette ash and old sorrows.",

It was so bad it was worth every penny. Actually it was so bad it was worth more than we paid. For the next thirty-five minutes we proceeded through a series of rooms where we watched homemade dummies, each with a frozen smile and a mop of hair that brought to mind windblown pubis, reenacting various scenes from the famous Kelly shoot-out in a random and deliriously incoherent way. Occasionally one of them would turn a stiff head or jerk up a forearm to fire a pistol, though not necessarily in synch with the narrative. Meanwhile, around each room lots of other mechanical events were taking place—empty chairs rocked, cupboard doors mysteriously opened and shut, player pianos played, a figure of a boy on a trapeze (and why not?) swung back and forth amid the rafters. Do you know those fairground stalls where you fire a rifle at assorted targets to make an outhouse door swing open or a stuffed chicken fall over? Well, this reminded me of that, only much worse. The narrative, insofar as it could be heard above the competing noises, made no sense at all.",

I told him I knew several people who drove twice that daily in New York. He was mortified, but supposed that it was necessary due to NYC’s high cost of living. “You’d probably pay two thousand dollars a month for an apartment like they have on TV, right?” He was not comforted when I told him that amount might rent you a nice parking space in Manhattan.",

A magnificent chandelier cast its rays over the driveway and a marble staircase that led up to the lobby. Soft music whispered to us from speakers hidden overhead. The courtyard was beautiful, like a country estate in Victorian England. On any other day, we might have spent an hour admiring the flora and architecture, but our driver was in a hurry. He helped Teresa with her bag and wiped the windshield with a rag while he waited for me to pay him. I wanted to hurry, but couldn’t. My extremities were numb from the cramped quarters and bumpy ride. I struggled with the door handle and pried myself from the seat, out the door, and onto the pavement. After a few uneasy steps, I wobbled over to our driver and counted off twenty-five dollars – enough for the ride and a fair tip, or so I thought.",

Our guide slipped behind at the first village we reached; and I could feel every root and stone through my gym shoes. The carriers whom we had taken on at Bassa Town and who had asked to come with us failed half-way and I couldn’t use my hammock at all. It was typical of the Bassa tribe to promise and then to fail. I developed a bitter dislike of the very appearance of Bassa men, the large well-covered bodies, the round heads, the soft effeminate eyes. The Coast had corrupted them, had made them liars, swindlers, lazy, weak, completely undependable. But it was from the Bassa tribe, and from the Vais, whose territory, too, touched the decadent sea-board, that the governing class recruits new members. To the criticism that the native has no hand in the administration, the American-Liberian will point to Bassa and Vai men in the Government departments, Bassa and Vai Commissioners and clerks.*",

Egg Island and Royal Island rise from the water to port. The contrast between this and the open ocean, which is all I have seen for the past seven days, is dramatic. It’s also a stark contrast to Mattapoistett and Gloucester Point. I have travelled from winter to summer in only one week.\n​I call the customs office, but get no answer. It’s New Year’s Day, so I assume they are closed. We turn in to Royal Island Harbor and circle around, scouting out the anchorage. A large trawler sits in the south cove, but nobody is in the north cove, where we circle. I select a spot in 11 feet of water with sand on the bottom, ease the throttle to neutral, move to the bow, and with gloved hands, I let the Vulcan, the new Dr. Spock, slowly descend to the bottom. I hold the chain and let it out slowly as we drift backwards. When the little blue indicator strings tell me 75’ are out, I set the anti-chafing gear and cleat off the 3/4” nylon rode. We are here, and here is good.\nLocation: 25.5157º N, 76.8434º W\n​I strip out of the clothes I’ve worn for I don’t know how many days now and put on my red trunks, which I have not worn since leaving Florida in October. I put on the mask and hang the ladder over the side and leap into the water, which is gloriously cool and I feel clean as soon as I hit it. I swim to the anchor and push Dr. Spock deeper into the sea floor, which consists of sand with a smattering of grass.\n​The world around me feels like home, a giant swimming pool of water that spans the entire Earth, full of more creatures than any of us can imagine. I am one of those creatures, back in my element, arrived from afar, warm and wet and cold all at once, reunited with my first love, happy in my new home.\n​Standing on the deck of my vessel that has carried me here all the way from Massachusetts, I rinse with a bottle of fresh water and dry off, then lay down for a long and well-deserved nap, reminding myself that we are at anchor. I sleep without my alarm turned on and without being fully dressed and without my lifejacket on for the first time in seven days.\n​Hours later I awake, not in a panic, but refreshed and smiling. I take Little Flower out for a sunset cruise around the anchorage, thus fulfilling a second dream, to sail in my rowing and sailing dinghy around the islands at which I anchor the big boat.",

He greeted me with a vague smile, shook hands, signed and stamped a sheet of paper (my permit), locked the 1,000 kip fee in a little tin money-box and took himself off to a meeting. (‘What about?’ I wondered.) Mr Thongsa then filled in the long document which allowed me to spend a week in Houaphanh. Next, he said, I must register with the police and show them my permit. I protested that I had already registered with the police at the airport and produced a chit to prove it.

Some people look upon marriage as a short cut that way, but it has been known to fail. Separation, which was the means that chance offered to Gabriel Oak by Bathsheba’s disappearance, though effectual with people of certain humours, is apt to idealize the removed object with others – notably those whose affection, placid and regular as it may be, flows deep and long. Oak belonged to the even-tempered order of humanity, and felt the secret fusion of himself in Bathsheba to be burning with a finer flame now that she was gone – that was all.",

If I had lace needing of repair, I could place it on a Catherine wheel, where it is spun in to a nun to mend. Two of the convents have chapels, strangely modernized. On down the hill, I encounter Severini again in a mosaic at San Marco; if I climb this street, I’m on a Crucifixion trail he designed. A series of stone-enshrined mosaics traces Christ’s progress toward the Crucifixion and then the Deposition. At the end of that walk (on a hot day I feel I’ve carried a cross), I’m at Santa Margherita, a large church and convent. Inside, Margherita herself is encased in glass. She has shrunk. Her feet are creepy. Most likely, a praying woman will be kneeling in front of her. Margherita was one of the fasting saints who had to be coaxed to take at least a spoon of oil every day. She shouted of her early sins in the streets. She would be neurotic, anorectic today; back then they understood her desire to suffer like Christ. Even Dante, it is believed, came to her in 1289 and discussed his “pusillanimity.” Margherita is so venerated locally that when mothers call their children in the park, hers is the name most often heard. A plaque beside the Bernada gate (now closed) proclaims that through it she first entered the city in 1272.",

The phone line was so bad that I could barely hear the kindly professor I spoke to ? he appeared to be talking to me from the midst of a roaring blizzard; I imagined a door banging open and swirling snow blowing into his frail and lonely hut somewhere out in the wilds ? but I did catch enough to gather that the only reliable time to come was now, in the depths of winter, before the sun rose again in late January. This was a very good year for Northern Lights, as it happened ? something to do with intense solar activity ? but you needed a clear sky to see them, and in northern Norway this could never be guaranteed.",

We grilled them on sticks, ate with our fingers, and washed the meal down with green coconut milk. Bob inspected our supplies. He was not impressed with our unused fishing gear.

I knew that I was not yet finished for good, that my anger, my sadness and my shame would all creep back eventually, escaping my heart, and occupying my head once more. I knew that I would have to keep dealing with these thoughts again and again until I slowly and determinedly changed my whole life. And that this would be difficult and exhausting to do. But my heart said to my mind in the dark silence of that beach: “I love you, I will never leave you, I will always take care of you.” That promise floated up out of my heart and I caught it in my mouth and held it there, tasting it as I left the beach and walked back to the little shack where I was staying. I found an empty notebook, opened it up to the first page—and only then did I open my mouth and speak those words into the air, letting them free. I let those words break my silence and then I allowed my pencil to document their colossal statement onto the page:",

At six thousand feet, it was in fact ideally situated between fertile highlands and the abundance of the tropical lowlands, and readily serviced by both, along trails that in mere days traversed an altitudinal range of more than ten thousand feet, a rarity in Colombia. Low and easily accessible passes lead to the Ríos Caquetá and Putumayo to the south and east, the Cauca and Patía to the west, and to the northeast the Guaviare, which ultimately reaches the Orinoco. Heading south, the same trails that carried us across the Macizo, as well as other routes leading across Puracé to the Cauca Valley, continue all the way to the Ecuadorian frontier and beyond. In no way isolated, San Agustín was the locus of a complex and extensive network of trade routes that spanned all of southern Colombia.",
