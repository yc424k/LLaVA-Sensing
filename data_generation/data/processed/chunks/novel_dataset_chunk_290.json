To come from Guangzhou down the Pearl River a century ago was to move from one world to another. Guangzhou was still a pestilent walled city of narrow lanes and stinks (‘Phew!’ grumbled Kipling. ‘I want to get back to the steamer’). Hong Kong was equipped with all the conveniences of steam, gas, electricity, telegraphs and artillery. The virtuoso Peak tram clambered up the mountainside, the double-decker electric trams trundled along the foreshore below.",

    "target_paragraph": "Joseíto went back to repairing furniture, but money remained tight. He and Adriana had a second daughter, and they routinely skipped meals so the girls had enough to eat. He worked when he had orders and spent a lot of time walking the streets, looking for discarded items he could reuse. He often came back empty-handed and, without anything to do, plopped on the sofa in the front room, the only one with a window, watching TV or listening to music on his cell phone, the one luxury he considered a necessity. He adored the Cuban American singer Willy Chirino. A line in one of Chirino’s ballads had special meaning for him. The song “La Jinetera” told the story of a prostitute who meets her boyfriend on the Malecón. It was banned in Cuba for a long time, but he had found a pirated copy. Sometimes, when nothing was going right for him, he listened to it. The line he liked so much that he memorized it was “el partido que parte a quien no lo alababa,” the party—referring to the Communist Party of Cuba—that cut off those who didn’t praise it.",

We were not alone in our appreciation. Hardly had the bus driver turned off the ignition than the Tibetan passengers and Chinese soldiers began throwing themselves headlong out of the vehicle like Kurosawa warriors storming a castle. Exercising skills refined at every rest stop, they stampeded off in the general direction of the desk, pushing each other to the floor, throwing elbows as they cleared their path, shouting, squabbling, shoving, spitting. Safely protected on the far side of the barricade, the hotel authorities serenely extended forms into the air. These the racing hordes grabbed and began filling out with desperate speed. The minute they were finished, the enthusiastic guests fought their way to the next line, where they handed in their forms and received others in return. These too they filled in speedily, before rushing off to another queue where they were assigned their rooms. In a fourth line, they paid up.",

The statue closed the avenue as the Arc de Triomphe closes the Champs Élysées; I expected some further avenue beyond, but when I reached the statue I found the hero sat on his horse in a waste of mud at the furthest limit of the town. No strollers came so far, and the road went no further. Only a starving dog, like a skeleton from the Natural History Museum, picked his way timorously across the dirt and the rain pools towards me and San Martín. I began to walk back.",

Perhaps if I hadn’t been a bit drunk I’d have stayed, but the idea I thought I had lost, that one ought to stick to time-tables, came up again in the Parisian air, and I was a little uneasy, too, lest the schoolmaster should have sent a quick messenger to the French Commissioner and that we might find ourselves under arrest—the French colonies are very carefully preserved. So I refused to stay. Before we went I photographed the girl, but she wouldn’t be taken as she was, insisted on putting on her best dress for the picture: the chief would not be photographed. By that time two men had to support him. He followed us a little way out of the village, sleepily imploring us to stay, until we were out of earshot.",

The tide was low, and we walked across the sand to a smaller island and our first house, a wooden one built on a spit of land permanently blasted by a brutal wind.

In the midst of all these tombs of Empire, the Burmese went calmly about their daily rounds. On Thirlmere Avenue, monks in burgundy robes stood in line for buses. Thick-spectacled old Indian gentlemen, with folded brollies and ancient briefcases under their arms, waited to cross Windsor Road. In the Landsdowne area, schoolchildren in spotless white shirts and bright blue skirts sauntered, satchels swinging, homeward down muddy lanes.",

Even when he’s not around, they continue. They’re thoroughly neat, cleaning up as they go: no buried telephone this time. Franco, who has glistening black, almost animal eyes, is the strongest. Although he’s slight, he has that wiry strength that seems to come more from will than from muscle. I watch him lift a square stone that served as a bottom step for the back stairway. When I marvel, he shows off a bit and hoists it to his shoulder. Even Emilio, whose job it is to haul, actually seems to enjoy what he’s doing. He looks perpetually amused. Hot as it is, he wears a wool cap pulled down so far that his hair all around sticks out in a ruff. He looks to be around sixty-five, a little old for a manovale, manual laborer. I wonder if he was a muratore before he lost two fingers. As they lift out the hideous tile and a layer of concrete, they find a stone floor underneath. Then Franco lifts some of these stones and discovers a second layer of stone floor. “Pietra, sempre pietra,” he says, stone, always stone.",

Each wave that breaks on the raft echoes through the tubes and sounds like a blast from a shotgun going off next to my ear. The wind catches the water catchment cape, snaps it up and down, rips its buttonholes wider, and tries to tear it away. During the night conditions become wilder. Watery fists knock Ducky back and forth. I huddle athwartships, getting as far forward as I dare in an effort to stay dry while also trying to keep the stern down. Although the front of the canopy gives a little better protection, dryness is still relative. The back of the canopy is little more than a stretched rag. Wave crests fall on it and drain through onto my face, stinging my eyes and pouring into my sleeping bag. I continually wipe the water off the floor and the canopy, but everything is soaked in no time.",

The elephants were grazing around twenty feet from the edge of the track ahead of us, and initially seemed untroubled by our arrival. I was careful to approach slowly, to ensure that they'd seen us, and we wouldn't be surprising them. I made sure I didn't rev the engine and drove at a steady pace towards them. In other words, I did everything right. It was therefore a shock as we drew closer, to see a large female turn to look in our direction, toss her huge head and trumpet loudly, before charging towards us. In a mock charge, the elephant will flap its ears and raise its head, in order to appear as threatening as possible. On this occasion, the ears were pinned to the side of the head, which was lowered towards the ground. All indicators that this was no bluff calling exercise - this was one very pissed-off elephant.",

Vietnam has very much the feel of the coming thing, the next “little dragon,” tomorrow’s hot destination: a perfect locale, indeed, for the kinder, greener, post-cold war nineties. And it is already beginning to become a crossroads of the fashionable: in my hotel in Hanoi, an assistant producer from Paradis Films was bargaining over a suite for Mme. Deneuve (acting in one of the three feature-length French motion pictures being shot in the country at the time); when I went to the Cao Dai church in Tay Ninh, the name above mine in the visitors’ book was that of Gough Whitlam, former prime minister of Australia. And one night in Saigon, walking through a street so crowded one could hardly move, I bumped, quite literally, into two colleagues from New York.",

Neither spoke to the other or to me. Silently the German gave me a tin plate. Silently, after dinner, he led me to the barn and pointed to a pile of sheepskins.",

I’d some equity built up in my condo and could always find a part-time job as a legal assistant or something. I just might be able to make that work. But would I still wanna go into law? Working as a paralegal had shown me the tainted underbelly of that industry, and I couldn’t imagine spending the rest of my life writing legal contracts. But what else could I do? Literature was cool, but it didn’t pay—even Pop had quit that—and I was no philosopher. Maybe I could go back to journalism? That’d been way better than law. Journalism would let me make a difference by writing about political corruption or social inequity. And researching an article was like being the detective in a mystery novel—uncovering the facts, then presenting them step by step to the reader. Pop always said I had a talent for writing. Maybe I should go back to that?",
