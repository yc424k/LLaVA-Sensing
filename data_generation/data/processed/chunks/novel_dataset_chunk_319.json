The wonderful letters from Daddy, Jade and of course Luc. The Bailey’s Irish Cream and even Mommy’s hair. I have definitely left something wonderful behind, and when I return it will all be so different. I love Luc, Daddy, Mommy, Jeri, Nina, Tony, Jade and my friends. My ship is so small and the ocean so immense. Never ending, always another horizon. But God has given me his own special present: a beautiful sunny day. I love my crazy family and wish I could hear them laughing, fighting, anything. I try to imagine the sounds of voices, cars and living. But I am content with the rush of water, the wind, the leaks. Thank you, God, for life.”",

The Plumers will try to prevent him from making it. Wells and Shaw and the serious sixpenny weeklies will sit on its head. Every time he lunches out on Sunday—at dinner parties and tea parties—there will be this same shock—horror—discomfort—then pleasure, for he draws into him at every step as he walks by the river such steady certainty, such reassurance from all sides, the trees bowing, the grey spires soft in the blue, voices blowing and seeming suspended in the air, the springy air of May, the elastic air with its particles—chestnut bloom, pollen, whatever it is that gives the May air its potency, blurring the trees, gumming the buds, daubing the green. And the river too runs past, not at flood, nor swiftly, but cloying the oar that dips in it and drops white drops from the blade, swimming green and deep over the bowed rushes, as if lavishly caressing them.",

Moving away from the raw intensity of this country, with its mixed threat and beauty, I felt flat and emptied. I wanted to stay. But my route, snaking north-west, would meet the main Silk Road at the shrine city of Meshed, and there it was festival time.\nWe eased out into semi-desert, under a sky lit by no visible sun. The woman in front of me exchanged her burka for a full-length Iranian chador, leaving her face exposed and pale, and the man next door took off his black-and-white keffiyeh linked to Ismail Khan, and stuffed it in his bag. The border belonged to Kabul now. We moved fast down the road asphalted by Ismail Khan for the customs dues he would no longer see. Outside, the air filled with sand, and the horizon levelled to a dove-grey mist. The villages seemed deserted under their cracked domes.\nThen, with a noise like pebbles rattling in a tin, our bus broke down. Patiently the passengers got out and sat along the kerbside, careless of mines. Some walked into a village across the road, as if to meet friends; others slept; while the driver and his henchman sprawled beneath the chassis for the long, accustomed business of repair.",

I ride on a road that surely floods in bad weather since the waterline is two metres to my left. Up ahead is a metropolis. New York City compared to what I am used to. First stop, the Gairloch and Loch Ewe Action Centre (GALE), also a Tourist Information Centre. It’s a new building with lots of “stuff:” information brochures, souvenirs, displays, places to sit, and very helpful people. Also, great views of northern Skye. Nirvana. Even though there is a McColl’s shop next to us, I am still not at the central business district which has a second shop. I pass Gairloch Heritage Museum on my way to the centrally located campground. Crocodile Creek Wilderness Store, with the long beach across the street, is buried in beach toys for sale. The beach is empty. Up the small rise and, voila, the main event. The main street is a series of stone shops, mostly white, selling all manner of things. Lastly, praise be the Lord, is Mountain Coffee Company with the elixir of life. Hillbillies, a bookstore, is conjoined. I am too overwhelmed with all this goodness to sample it tonight. I head up Minol Road to Gairloch Holiday Park, score a picnic table and walk to the hot shower, taking in the panoramic view of Gairloch Loch.",

He started plodding north from tidewater in February, but his enthusiasm fizzled on the lower reaches of the Ruth Glacier, still thirty miles from the peak, so he aborted the attempt and retreated to Talkeetna.

Groups of us went to dinner afterwards and introduced ourselves by offering both our name (someone else’s idea) and a graphic description of our penis (my idea), which set off an evening of drunken laughter and foul jokes. One evening, everyone walked to the beach and settled into tiered seats to watch transgender women and hijras lip-sync, dance and rumble to classic Bollywood songs as the sun went down. In stark contrast to the throbbing, sexually suggestive songs I’d heard at Japanese drag queen shows, these were the most heartbreakingly mournful melodies I’d ever heard, based on epic Urdu poetry. Throngs of big-toothed kids – some of them homeless – drifted in, bunched up alongside me and wriggled in their seats, dancing. They knew all the words and sang along, even to the sad ones. Especially to the sad ones.",

He wished he had been an architect. He stood with his back pressed against the shop trying to get the whole of the Cathedral clear. But it was difficult with so many people passing. They knocked against him and brushed in front of him. It was the rush hour, of course, when City men were making for their luncheons. They were taking short cuts across the steps.

Inside was lined with polished white wooden tables lit with plump candles, and a reassuring quota of tourists floated around, which meant that there would be bland food on the menu.

Though not cold-natured, he was rather bright than hot – less Byronic than Shelleyan; could love desperately, but his love more especially inclined to the imaginative and ethereal; it was an emotion which could jealously guard the loved one against his very self.

After two southern winters, with roses blooming all the time, this bleakness and this touch of frost in the ringing morning goes to my soul like an intoxication. I am so glad, on this lonely naked road, I don't know what to do with myself. I walk down in the shallow grassy ditches under the loose stone walls, I walk on the little ridge of grass, the little bank on which the wall is built, I cross the road across the frozen cow-droppings: and it is all so familiar to my feet, my very feet in contact, that I am wild as if I had made a discovery. And I realize that I hate limestone, to live on limestone or marble or any of those limey rocks. I hate them. They are dead rocks, they have no life—thrills for the feet. Even sandstone is much better. But granite! Granite is my favourite. It is so live under the feet, it has a deep sparkle of its own. I like its roundnesses—and I hate the jaggy dryness of limestone, that burns in the sun, and withers.",

With some markets, I take a deep breath, gird my loins and stride apprehensively into the fray, wondering how long my limited energy will last. Not here. Here I wander in and am ready to enjoy admiring things.” There is nothing like this in Bangkok.",

On looking into the place it occurred to her that she had seen it by daylight on some previous occasion, and that what appeared like an impassable thicket was in reality a brake of fern, now withering fast. She could think of nothing better to do with her palpitating self than to go in here and hide; and entering she lighted on a spot sheltered from the damp fog by a reclining trunk, where she sank down upon a tangled couch of fronds and stems. She mechanically pulled some armfulls round her to keep off the breezes, and closed her eyes.",

Torre becomes torreone, the name of our part of Cortona, where a great tower must have stood once. Minestrone, then, always is a big soup. Days of the sun in Leone (Leo): Solleone—big sun. Dog days we called them in the South. Our cook told me the name was because it was so hot that dogs went mad and bit people and I would be bitten if I didn’t mind her. Eventually, I was disappointed to find the name only meant that Sirius, the dog star, was rising and setting with the sun. The science teacher said Sirius was twice the size of the sun and I thought, secretly, that somehow the heat was augmented by that fact. Here, the expanded sun fills the sky, as in the archetypal child’s drawing of house, tree, and sun. The cicadas are in the know—they provide the perfect accompaniment to this heating up. By dawn they’re hitting their horizon note of high screech. How a finger-sized insect can make such a racket only by vibrating its thorax, I don’t know. As they tune up to their highest pitch, it sounds as though someone is shaking tambourines made from the small bones of the ear. By noon, they’ve switched to sitars, that most irritating of instruments. Only the wind quiets them; perhaps they must hang on to a limb and can’t clutch and vibrate at the same time. But the wind seldom blows, except for the evil appearance now and then of the scirocco, which gusts but doesn’t cool, while the sun roars. If I were a cat, I would arch my back. This hot wind brings particles of dust from the African deserts and deposits them in your throat. I hang out the clothes and they’re dry in minutes. The papers in my study fly around like released white doves, then settle in the four corners of the room. The tigli are dropping a few dry leaves and the flowers suddenly seem leached of color, although we have had enough rain this summer that we have been able to water faithfully every day. The hose pulls water directly from the old well and they must feel blasted at the end of the hot day by the rush of icy water. Perhaps this has exhausted them. The pear tree on the front terrace has the look of a woman two weeks overdue. We should have thinned the fruit. Branches are breaking under the weight of golden pears just turning ruddy. I can’t decide whether to read metaphysics or to cook. The ultimate nature of being or cold garlic soup. They are not so far apart after all. Or if they are, it doesn’t matter; it’s too hot to think about it.",

Dark-haired and bright-eyed, she is petite, and as trim as he. They have one child, Barbara, whose advance upon the years of secondary education has presented a dilemma to the Borgs. They feel that the supervised high-school work available to her in Eagle is more than a match for academic programs elsewhere, but they worry that she will be deprived socially, that she will suffer for lack of activities with others. Yet to leave the country in search of a high school is to give up what they have here. “I’ve got the most secure economic situation in Eagle,” he says. “I’ve got it made here. To move means cashing it in, means starting all over again.” A boarding school is not, apparently, in the conversation, but how about a high school in Anchorage or Fairbanks, where she might be able to live with friends?",

It’s wonderful for a few days or weeks, but I don’t think I’d want to do it for years. Van travel suits me well because you can cozy up inside together if you want, but you also have the option to step outside and hike up a mountain, walk around a city, surf in the ocean, swim in a river – the experiences are endless. But those three magical days among the islands are powerfully tempting, if we could one day solve our seasickness.",

By way of healing the rusty fester of the poisoned dart she sought the face that all day long she had been seeking. Preening and peering, between backs, over shoulders, she had sought the man in grey. He had given her a cup of tea at a tennis party; handed her, once, a racquet. That was all. But, she was crying, had we met before the salmon leapt like a bar of silver … had we met, she was crying. And when her little boy came battling through the bodies in the Barn ‘Had he been his son,’ she had muttered … In passing she stripped the bitter leaf that grew, as it happened, outside the nursery window. Old Man’s Beard. Shrivelling the shreds in lieu of words, for no words grow there, nor roses either, she swept past her conspirator, her semblable, the seeker after vanished faces – ‘like Venus’ he thought, making a rough translation, ‘to her prey …’126 and followed after.",
