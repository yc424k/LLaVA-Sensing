    "target_paragraph": "When the nation awoke in August 1923 to find that Harding was dead and the obscure Coolidge was president, most were dumbfounded. Some had stronger feelings. Oswald Garrison Villard, editor of The Nation, wrote: “I doubt if it [the presidency] has ever fallen into the hands of a man so cold, so narrow, so reactionary, so uninspiring, so unenlightened, or who has done less to earn it than Calvin Coolidge.” Yet most people found themselves quickly warming to Coolidge, almost in spite of himself. The nation grew fond of his peculiarities and often exaggerated them in anecdote. His most celebrated trait was his taciturnity. An oft-told story, which has never been verified, is that a woman sitting next to him at dinner gushed, “Mr. President, my friend bet me that I wouldn’t be able to get you to say three words tonight.”",

At noon on the 108th day of my walk I had all four-fifths of a kilometer of it to myself, and the elevator attendant on the Shimonoseki side was so delighted at having a foreign patron that he waived the twenty-yen fee I owed him. I emerged on the last of my three Japanese islands to find trams rumbling along the roads, office workers playing volleyball in a car park, and small dusty palm trees doing their best to enliven one of the grimmest, clangiest, and therefore most prosperous industrial complexes in the country.",

The temperatures dipped into the high teens, caking the ship’s rigging with a veneer of hoarfrost.

Flatbed trucks waited at the side of the road for the loader to deposit the sixteen-by-sixteen squares of tundra onto their beds, whereupon drivers transported the mats to predetermined sites on the VC complex, backing up mounded dirt hills and contours, lifting beds and draping the mats on the ground.

If I were genteel poor and wasting, I would come to a pensione here to die a genteel death, tea among the almond orchards and the olive trees. Wagner and Ibsen liked it here, and Homer did, too. What I like is to go to the Public Gardens, the Villa Comunale, close to but away from the souvenir center of town; there it is cool and orange-scented and steps lead down to the sea, and Italians swim in it, it is not fashionable, and in the peaceful outdoor café ENGLISH TEA is advertised.",

Boy, being a limping ibex sure is exhausting. Maybe getting devoured wouldn’t be so bad. Now that I was not recovering from general anesthesia, I could focus on what was important: Levi was a six-foot-four, white-blond, blue-eyed Viking.

My journeys on that once mysterious and beckoning trail had led me back here—to the older, wiser Appalachians and to the summit of Mount Katahdin. The wet, forested trail before me now was so unlike the dry, expansive Pacific Crest it was laughable. So possibly was my intent: to hike the AT faster than any other self-supported thru-hiker ever had. Just as on the PCT, I would have no crew, no support. When I made my way down the trail, I would be on my own: reliant on the boxes I had shipped to myself and purchases I would make along the way, able to accept only spontaneous kindness from strangers—trail magic. This time, though, I hoped to melt into the sheer numbers of AT hikers and not draw attention to my personal pilgrimage.",

It is an enclave, actually, with several roads, off the western end of Northern Lights Boulevard, which is a principal Anchorage thoroughfare, a neon borealis. Walter Hickel lives in the enclave, on Loussac Drive, which winds between curbs and lawns, neatly trimmed, laid out, and landscaped, under white birches and balsam poplars. Hickel’s is a heavy, substantial home, its style American Dentist. The neighbors’ houses are equally expensive and much the same. The whole neighborhood seems to be struggling to remember Scarsdale. But not to find Alaska.",

The customs people had obviously cut the tape and then stuck the flaps back into the little USPO box. She opened the flap and a little package wrapped in my sister’s characteristic style slipped out along with a small card. So, I paid the lady and went around to the box area, because the security glass didn’t allow for more than a thick envelope. The postal worker turned the big hand crank to open the door and placed the little box of an inch in height and a six-inch width into a space that could have held a medium-sized refrigerator. Walking away with package in hand after the first attempt, I had apparently met with success on my visit. For a simple deposit the secretary had spent almost three hours there with her grandmother a few days earlier. On that occasion, the other side of the building was full of people and the mail division hardly had any clients.",

In our early years of marriage, he and I often carpooled the seven miles from our mountain home above Boulder, Colorado, down to our office in town. The first seven miles of that drive dropped steeply, winding around multiple hairpin curves to the junction with Boulder Canyon. We’d enter my car as a happily married couple setting off for work together. From there, things went downhill in all conceivable ways. First, he’d change my carefully adjusted seat so his hands could grasp the steering wheel like a Formula 1 race car driver: left hand at nine o’clock, right hand at three o’clock, arms comfortably flexed at the elbows. Feeling the thrum of the engine and the crunch of gravel as we began our 3,000-foot descent, Bernard handled the car as if he were driving a Ferrari.",

She was Heidi Bradner, an American photographer, and the reason her clothes and camera parts were wet was that she had come over from St. Lawrence Island with the Yupiks in the storm. While Tanya and the Californians drank tea and vodka in the kitchen, Heidi Bradner and I sat in the hall and she told me about the voyage. About ten days before, she had gone over to St. Lawrence Island from Nome to take pictures for a French magazine. When time came to leave, the Yupiks offered her a ride to Provideniya. She had doubts about their boats and so chose the most seaworthy-looking whaleboat and most competent-looking crew she could find. The group of boats hadn’t gone halfway across when the storm hit, with rain, fog, and eight-foot waves. Boats began to get separated from one another. None of the Yupiks had radios or GPS equipment, she said, because Russian bureaucracy makes it hard for Yupiks to own or use them.",

The offices stood silent, empty, sterile, but they also seemed to have a kind of lonely expectation of the life that soon would well up swiftly from the streets to fill and use them. In the eerie light, with the cross street still bare of traffic and the office buildings empty, suddenly it seemed to Mr. Jack as if all life had been driven or extinguished from the city and as if those soaring obelisks were all that remained of a civilization that had been fabulous and legendary.",

Weather permitting (as it usually did), I enjoyed an early hill walk, following goat paths or donkey tracks through olive groves enhanced by pink-tinged boulders, diversely eroded. I rarely met anybody; the locals fear the settlers. As a newcomer, I made a fool of myself by asking Mahmoud, ‘Why don’t the children play on the hills? They’ve such a superb space only ten minutes away!’ Someone less gentlemanly would have laughed at my dumbness. Mahmoud quietly replied, ‘Certain settlers attack first and ask questions later. You too must take care. Walk far from their fences.’ During the olive-picking season villagers need protection – not provided by the IDF – and the presence of brave Internationals, picking with them, does reduce violence. From Mount Jarzim’s crest eight settlements are visible, their red-tiled roofs clustered on hilltops. The apartheid roads and IDF checkpoints and security barriers left Nablus a city besieged.",

The rest of the group regarded us with some amusement, and referred to us as 'the honeymooners.' Their assumption that we eschewed the organised tours to indulge in romantic in-room entertainment, couldn't have been further from the truth. We immersed ourselves in Beijing, enjoying the culture shock and strangeness of the City. Watching commuters perform tai-chi at daybreak, or pensioners' evening ballroom dancing sessions in a suburban square felt uniquely Chinese and totally foreign to us. However, on one occasion, a craving for western food saw us hunting for China's first Hard Rock Café, in the north of the city. Again, the Rough Guide map misled us, and we arrived after a gruelling two hour walk. Hungry for burgers, we were dismayed to see the dining tables being packed up at 8.30pm, as the restaurant became a Chinese disco. We soon had to forget our rumbling stomachs, as we became the dance partners of choice for a room full of Chinese New Romantics, and spent the night being repeatedly forced onto the dancefloor like two hungry, performing bears.",

In the background I could hear the purr of the river—content to go wherever gravity pulled it. I sighed and wandered around in the woods until I found a suitable campsite. After pitching my tent, I crawled in and jotted down my mileage for the day on my spreadsheet before eating dinner. Then I lay back—staring at the patterns of light and shadow dancing on the translucent fabric of my tent. Unlike the river, I was far from content. I was resigned. I was nowhere near my goal of fifty miles per day. And now I was sitting on a riverbank on a sunny evening when I should have been cruising along the mellow terrain south of here. But the greatest lessons from setting an FKT on the PCT had been about mindfulness and acceptance. Over those long, dusty miles I’d found peace in the knowledge that I couldn’t control the wildness around me, but instead learned to become part of it—accepting what it was and wasn’t. I closed my eyes and focused on those lessons instead of an uncrossable river flowing by.",
