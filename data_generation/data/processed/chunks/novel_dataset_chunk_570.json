The State Department warned us to avoid travel in central Egypt. The towns of Beni Suef, Asyut, and Sohag were strongholds of the Muslim Brotherhood, and they were especially risky, they said. The Egyptian government agreed. Buses with more than four foreign passengers were required to arrange a police escort. We were the only two foreigners on the bus that day, and we had no security at all.",

Such was the crush that Acosta’s collarbone may in fact have been broken by the jostling crowds. It was then in any case that he first noticed pain. The car that was supposed to take them to the Hotel Continental wouldn’t start, so the mob pushed them there, shouting joyously as they went. “Women jumped on the running board and threw their arms around us and kissed us until our faces were daubed with red,” Balchen went on. “Gendarmes flung up their arms in despair at controlling the traffic, and elbowed their way through the crowds to the car and begged for autographs themselves.”",

I could still hear the traffic and the horns, but, from that height, the sound was almost interesting, like a neighbor’s wind chime. I looked down at the apartment blocks that surrounded the hotel. The buildings were about eight or ten stories tall, and they were all covered in grey dust, like someone framed the city in daguerreotype. Then I noticed the rooftops. I had never seen so many satellite dishes in one place. They were like barnacles on an old ship. They covered every inch of every roof within sight. I could have spent all day on that balcony, studying the cityscape, but Teresa had other plans. She wanted to find lunch and visit the Egyptian Museum that afternoon. I closed the balcony door and drew the curtains.",

    "target_paragraph": "One of the biggest feast days of the year in Cuba had always been Nochebuena, when the centerpiece of the traditional Christmas Eve feast was a piglet or a pork loin, slow roasted with garlic and bitter orange. The tradition continued even after Fidel outlawed Christmas. No matter how they were prepared, grapefruit skins and banana peels could never substitute for the roast pork, so inventive Cubans searched for alternative ways of getting what they wanted. In SP79, families discovered that the rear balcony of every apartment, with its small sink, running water, and a floor drain, made a suitable place to raise a pig. Families bought piglets when they weighed just a few pounds and carried them up to their balconies where they were fed scraps and grew reasonably fat. One of Cary’s neighbors had a pig so well behaved it could be walked down the stairs to graze outside. Most never enjoyed such freedom and spent their entire lives crammed into their balcony pens. Cary and Pipo had their own pig that Oscar, still a toddler, named Ponka. When the time came for Ponka to fulfill its destiny, Cary concocted a pleasant tale for Oscar, telling him that a farmer had brought them a Nochebuena dinner, and in exchange, he took Ponka to his big farm in the countryside and let him run free.",

The glasswork was going well but we were going to need some metal parts for the rudder’s heel attachment. There was no chance of having anything fabricated on the island, but I had an idea.",

Each shanty on average is ten feet by ten and home to five or six people. Down the centre of each lane runs a shallow trench filled with a trickle of water and things you don’t want to see or step in. There are no services in Kibera—no running water, no rubbish collection, virtually no electricity, not a single flush toilet. In one section of Kibera called Laini Saba until recently there were just ten pit latrines for 40,000 people. Especially at night when it is unsafe to venture out, many residents rely on what are known as “flying toilets,” which is to say they go into a plastic bag, then open their door and throw it as far as possible.",

But to a play answering precisely to this description, they will flock in their thousands. They will be moved to tears and enthusiasm by situations which, in a novel, they would find merely ludicrous. They will let pass, and even fervidly admire, language which any one with the slightest feeling for the use of words would shudder to see in print.",

His lank black hair is plastered to his head, his button-down shirt rumpled and spilling out of his trousers. This is the British organizer himself, veteran competitor of many a ruthless rally. Also veteran of too many crashes, as his stiff walk attests. His small eyes shrewdly scan the crowd for a long, silent minute before he says, “Each one of you must give thought to what you’re doing here.” He pauses for effect. “Are you going for a gold medal, and will you do all you can to make your start time every morning from here to Paris? If so, we salute you.” His voice is pompous and aggressive. “Mind though. If a bronze is OK with you, there’s nothing wrong with that. No shame there. That’s why we made them!” He laughs loudly at his own joke and appears to hitch up his trousers, though perhaps he’s rubbing his aching back. “We suggest you discuss this with your team mate. Be in agreement on how you’re going to run, because the bronze means simply that you clocked out here in Beijing, clocked out again in St. Petersburg, and crossed the finish line in Paris. So talk it over. Make your decision now, not when you get in trouble down the road.”",

Behind the men rose the façade of a Coptic church.\n\n‘These are village guards,’ explained Mahmoud. ‘Come on. If you want to do an interview, make it quick.’",

    "target_paragraph": "He had reached his hotel. He crossed the hall, with its mounds of reddish chairs and sofas, its spike-leaved, withered-looking plants. He got his key off the hook. The young lady handed him some letters. He went upstairs—he saw her most often at Bourton, in the late summer, when he stayed there for a week, or fortnight even, as people did in those days. First on top of some hill there she would stand, hands clapped to her hair, her cloak blowing out, pointing, crying to them—She saw the Severn* beneath. Or in a wood, making the kettle boil—very ineffective with her fingers; the smoke curtseying, blowing in their faces; her little pink face showing through; begging water from an old woman in a cottage, who came to the door to watch them go. They walked always; the others drove. She was bored driving, disliked all animals, except that dog. They tramped miles along roads. She would break off to get her bearings, pilot him back across country; and all the time they argued, discussed poetry, discussed people, discussed politics (she was a Radical then); never noticing a thing except when she stopped, cried out at a view or a tree, and made him look with her; and so on again, through stubble fields, she walking ahead, with a flower for her aunt, never tired of walking for all her delicacy; to drop down on Bourton in the dusk. Then, after dinner, old Breitkopf would open the piano and sing without any voice, and they would lie sunk in armchairs, trying not to laugh, but always breaking down and laughing, laughing—laughing at nothing. Breitkopf was supposed not to see. And then in the morning, flirting up and down like a wagtail in front of the house . . .",

The wonky, optimistic shops and hotels; the straight-backed people in ragged clothes, the colourful pyramids of fruit and vegetables, the slogans on buses and lorries, the boda bodas, the goats and chickens.\nThat evening we retired early and began emptying our suitcases of all the things we no longer needed that could be useful for others – clothing, shoes and toiletries. Vivien had suggested we ladies brought panty liners in case we were ever in need of potty stops while out in the bush on drives. As I have a long-range tank, I’d had no need of them, and was about to put the unopened packets in the bin. ‘Oh my goodness, no!’ she shrieked. ‘Haven’t you any idea how precious these are to girls here? Most of them can’t afford sanitary protection. These are such a luxury for them.’ How little I still understood about life there.\nWe entered that limbo time zone when you are sitting around waiting to leave, half wanting time to stand still, the other half urging it to speed up, and then it was mid-afternoon and Kamara was waiting to drive us to the airport. I was determined not to cry, but my face was rigid as we climbed into the Land Cruiser for the last time. Just before we left, Dedan came over. ‘You have forgotten something,’ he said, handing me my hat. Oh Dedan, what are we going to do without you?",

Blue sheep do not run from man like that even when driven.",

Half of their family had stayed behind. Eaten away by homesickness, three years later Nevzat’s people loaded up the carts again and travelled back, against the lodos. But their house in the Rhodope was occupied by others. So, for the third time, they made the long journey east, through the dark Rhodope passes once used by the Romans and across the Thracian plains, and this time the moist strangeness of Strandja enfolded them for good. One day, Nevzat’s grandfather came back from grazing the animals and found his young wife crying in her garden in Paspalovo. Why are you crying?",

Fokker vehemently denied this. Jumping out of a crashing plane was not possible, he said. “Maybe Byrd was excited and imagined this,” Fokker wrote with pained sarcasm in his autobiography. Surviving film footage of the crash, which is both brief and grainy, shows the plane landing roughly, tipping onto its nose, and flopping onto its back, all in a continuous motion, like a child doing a somersault. Fokker, like the other occupants, could have done nothing but brace and hold on.",

They’d march forward for a time, and then come to another lead. It was tedious, tiring, and slow. And the winds and snow had kept on, so that as Bartlett surveyed their gear, “everything was white; boxes, bags, sleeping-robes, all the objects, in fact, were blended into the one dead tone.” But they had to get it all across. The present lead was wider than Bartlett would have liked, but there was some young ice jutting outward toward the other side, with tongues of drifted snow forming a sort of bridge, and Bartlett had an idea. He remembered a technique for crossing leads he’d seen as a boy working with Newfoundland whalers. First, he tied a rope around Kataktovik’s waist so he could pull him out if he fell in. Then he took tent poles from the sled and, because Kataktovik was lighter, had him walk as far out on the young ice with the poles as he could. Kataktovik lay the tent poles across, spanning the open water. Slowly and carefully, Kataktovik got down on his belly and crawled, slithering across the tent poles and snow bridge to the other side.",

Actually it is only when stationary that one is aware of the sun’s power, whilst moving there’s no sensation of it being ‘too hot’. I believe it’ll be the same in Afghanistan, before becoming intolerably hot in Pakistan and India. (I feel I’ve earned a few months of perfect weather!)",

I shed my pack and slumped heavily against a tree, astounded by the scale of my tiredness. The view was lovely—the rolling swell of the Cohutta Mountains, brushed with a bluish haze the color of cigarette smoke, running away to a far-off horizon. The sun was already low in the sky. I rested for perhaps ten minutes, then got up and had a look around. There was a bronze plaque screwed into a boulder announcing the start of the Appalachian Trail, and nearby on a post was a wooden box containing a Bic pen on a length of string and a standard spiral notebook, its pages curled from the damp air. The notebook was the trail register (I had somehow expected it to be leather bound and funereal) and it was filled with eager entries, nearly all written in a youthful hand. There were perhaps twenty-five pages of entries since the first of January—eight entries on this day alone. Most were hurried and cheery—“March 2nd. Well, here we are and man it’s cold! See y’all on Katahdin! Jaimie and Spud”—but about a third were longer and more carefully reflective, with messages along the lines of “So here I am at Springer at last. I don’t know what the coming weeks hold for me, but my faith in the Lord is strong and I know I have the love and support of my family. Mom and Pookie, this trip is for you,” and so on.",

One stands in the sun, a row of old men with brass instruments; they know three European tunes, and are accompanied by two young men behind, who strike every beat on the triangle and drum. The other sits lackadaisically on a dais under a tree and plays Indian music on a guitar, various drums, and a small harmonium.

My new friend did not appear to grasp the system.

He would veer out of the way at the last possible instant and then hang out of the window shouting abuse at the passing driver, before being shrieked back to the next crisis by me and his wife.
