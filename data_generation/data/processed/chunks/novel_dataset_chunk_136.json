By the time Jang-bu and the pack ponies appeared, toward eight last evening, a cold rain was falling, and at noon today it is still raining hard. This morning the ponies broke loose in the storm, and their owner is out hunting them over the mountains; perhaps they have run back to Yamarkhar. My bedding is soaked by the mud puddle in the foot of my tent, which is pitched on a slant for want of flat terrain. With luck there will be sun to dry the gear before we climb up higher: I am cold already. All this rain must be snow at Jang La, three days away, but we are committed to this route; it is too late to retreat, to attempt to go around by the Jamoson-Tscharka route, or to fly to Jumla, even if new permits could be obtained. GS calls out through the rain, “We have to get across that pass, even if it takes a week—otherwise, we’re finished.”",

The oil people think in terms of decades, to keep the oil flowing, and the climate scientists think in terms of centuries and the global damage the oil is doing and will do. I never saw the bubbles of methane rising in sheaves from the thawing sea floor along Siberia’s Arctic coast, as documented by scientists from the University of Alaska in 2008. The amount of methane in permafrost in Siberian lakes is said to be ten times as much as the earth’s atmosphere holds now; I never saw climate scientists lighting methane bubbles effervescing from a lake, though scientists do that sometimes. As a heat-trapping gas, methane is twenty times more potent than carbon dioxide; I never saw a Siberian lake where the stream of methane bubbles from the thawing permafrost on the bottom created a roiling action that kept the lake from freezing throughout the winter, though I’ve read that happens, too.",

None of the good-humoured, slow-witted staff speaks English, but they all try – rather unsuccessfully – to be helpful.

There is a flickering to order; gathered details are sealed by the stamp of the anterior. The land itself, filled with letters, words, texts, songs, signs and stories. And always, everywhere, the paths, spreading across counties and countries, recalled as pattern rather than as plot, bringing alignments and discrepancies, elective affinities, shifts from familiar dispositions.

Founded in 1541, nestled in the foothills of the cordillera just west of Honda, Mariquita is perhaps best remembered as the tropical town where Spanish viceroys set up their court every season to escape the cold and damp of Bogotá. It was also the place where Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada went to die in 1574. Impoverished and alone, his body swollen with leprosy, the conqueror of the Muisca passed away in disgrace, quite unaware that in time his body would be interred in the Cathedral in Bogotá and that he would be honored, in memory, as the founder of Colombia’s capital city. In Mariquita, he is remembered today by a rather forlorn statue, recumbent in a cloister protected with chicken wire in the corner of a church, a bearded and armored soldier staring into the heavens with eyes the color of robin’s eggs.",

Until recently, he had been an avocational parachutist, patterning the sky in star formation with others as he fell. He had fifty-one jumps, all of them in Colorado. But he had started waking up in the night with cold sweats, so—with two small sons now—he had sold his jumping gear. With the money, he bought a white-water kayak and climbing rope. “You’re kind of on your own, really. You run the risk,” he was saying. “I haven’t seen any bear incidents, for example. I’ve never had any bear problems. I’ve never carried a gun. Talk to ten people and you get ten different bear-approach theories. Some carry flares. Ed Bailey, in Fish and Wildlife, shoots pencil flares into the ground before approaching bears. They go away. Bear attacks generally occur in road-system areas anyway. Two, maybe four people die a year. Some years more than others. Rarely will a bear attack a person in a complete wilderness like this.”",

Simon, from Durham University in Britain, had first visited Thailand a couple of months ago and had now returned, he said, with a sly smile, for no reason at all really, and for how long, he didn’t know. An Indian who was entwined in the snack bar with a couple of local ladies told me, rather shyly, that he had collected photos and tapes of almost a thousand Bangkok girls as souvenirs of his annual visits. A black man from the South Bronx explained that he was here on an extended R and R break from the pro basketball league in Australia. “People come here for different things,” explained a male nurse from San Francisco. “Some people come for the temples. Some people come for the deals. Some people come for the sex.” He pronounced this last with such disgust that I was moved to ask what he had come for. “Girls,” he said, hardly pausing. “Fourteen-, fifteen-year-old girls. I’ve already been to Sri Lanka and Korea, but this is the best place to find them: the girls are real fresh here, straight from the hills.” Noting my look of bemusement, he went on to explain himself. “Look,” he began earnestly, “I’m forty-two years old. I’m losing some hair. I could lose a little weight here and there. I’m not getting any younger. But I don’t want no thirty-five-year-old woman. I want to marry a girl who’s twenty-two, twenty-three at the most. In America, none of them girls are gonna look at me. But here—here it’s different.”",

I kicked at the base of her chosen boulder with the toe of my boot. It didn’t budge. Reba dug around the edges with the pick mattock until she exposed a corner enough to ram the tip of the rock bar beneath. She pushed the bar downward and forced the rock up and out of its bed. Though the tool was self-explanatory, its mechanical principles obvious to any dummy, there were little tricks, smarter ways of use. Through trial and error, I learned to reef a rock upward with hardly any effort, jam rocks beneath it to hold it at an apex, and reposition. You could move a rock forward by sliding the bar under the front corner and rowing it along. You could jack a boulder up high so that it would flip over and move itself. You tried to choose a rock uphill of your work site: one flip could start a fast tumble and all you had to do was step out of the way. I grew fond of the rock bar. I was small and it was elegant. Together, we approximated strength, which I coveted more than a milkshake on day six of a hitch.",

At that time, too, our hearts were somewhat perturbed; things had happened; there had been wars and assassinations of kings, and it was feared, by the simpler sort, that retribution was due. A sultry afternoon was drawing to its close, and I had been observing a small cloud that emerged above the sky-line. It was round as a disc, of ruddy hue, and in texture so compact and un-ethereal as to appear solid. Slowly it grew, and never changed its shape; an hour passed; it gradually expanded into a monstrous peony upon the firmament and, instead of drifting as clouds do, seemed rather to be pushed forwards mechanically from behind the scenes. Its uncommon shape and colour, its spasmodic growth, began to attract attention; we herded together and found ourselves watching its movements not without uneasiness. Suddenly, after an unusually vigorous jerk, the cheering sun was effaced, blotted out behind the curtain, leaving the world in a dim roseate fog. The change was disquieting, and there fell upon us the hush of an eclipse. Then it rained in big, warm drops. I looked at my hand - blood!",

Nearby, a cloud of dust indicated that shepherd boys were already leading their flocks back home for the night, and we slid down the glacis and walked over to the old arched bridge which spanned the Orontes. In the evening cool the women of the town were doing their washing in the river and the handles of their basins flashed in the sun.

We watched the civil defence lecturer ring the cities of Europe to show the zones of total and partial destruction. We saw the zones bump one against the other leaving no space in between. The instructor wore khaki shorts. His knees were white and knobbly, and we saw it was hopeless. The war was coming and there was nothing we could do.",

No matter which way we turned, or how quickly we walked, the chants followed us. We turned another corner, and jogged down a narrow road. That road carried us to the edge of Tahrir. Soldiers stood guard on the mound and on the sidewalks around the traffic circle. Teresa panicked. She stepped off the curb and into traffic. I followed her, but we couldn’t find a path between the bumpers and fenders. We were caught between lanes of harried drivers. A young Egyptian man joined us in the traffic. “You have to walk like an Egyptian,” he said. I thought of the Bangles song and desperately wanted to laugh. By then, Teresa was already halfway across the square, and I could barely keep pace with her. We jogged over the bridge, away from Garden City, away from Saad Zaghloul, and away from Tahrir. Back in our room, I locked the door, turned on the air conditioner, and drew the curtains. Teresa hid in the bathroom and cried.",

Looking out over the immense forest, Smith went on to say, “One of our problems is that you can’t get people to believe that this area is as big as this. They can’t believe that you could come down here and build a fifty-one-square-mile airport and not have a structure problem-not even one building visible from here to the horizon. Bear Swamp Hill is in the terminal-service area, where the planes would come in and unload. I can just see those supersonic transports coming in here now. Gorgeous! And when they take off, you can get them out over the ocean before they break the sound barrier. Here comes Flight 424, which left London one and a half hours ago. Brisbane is five hours away.”",

And as Banks moves through the ruins of the city, more than ever subject to the foreigner’s inability to tell friend from foe, or to see the larger picture, some of the dialogue sounds as if it had been mugged up from some black-and-white film about stiff upper lip. “ ‘Now, look here,’ ” Banks tells a dying Japanese soldier (after attending to his wounds with his trusty magnifying glass), “ ‘I don’t want any of that nonsense. You’re going to be fit as a fiddle in no time.’ ” The soldier, whom Banks takes to be his old friend Akira, grunts and, recalling his distant son, says, “ ‘You tell him. I die for country. Tell him, be good to mother. Protect. And build good world.’ ” Sometimes, here, it is only the Japanese who don’t sound Japanese.",

It was from Gillian. That was quick, he thought. One of ten pages it said, so he was going to get the info he had requested. The last page dropped into the tray, and he collected them and started absorbing the technical install instructions for the Monitor wind vane. There was a photo of one installed on Pacific SeaCraft Mariah, just like Lone Eagle. Reading all of the install instructions raised almost as many questions in his mind as it answered.",

And most important, Hall said, “It’s an American audience. Probably eighty or ninety percent of the potential market for guided expeditions to Everest and the other Seven Summits is in the United States. After this season, when my mate Scott has established himself as an Everest guide, he’ll have a great advantage over Adventure Consultants simply because he’s based in America.

Here we stopped on the following morning to water our horses, for our road now led us far from the river. A low line of rocky hills, the Jebel ?amrin, borders the west bank for several hours’ journey. It runs crosswise over the desert and the river cuts through it by the Fet?ah gorge. The hills drop sheer into the stream, leaving no space for a path, and caravans are obliged to skirt the western slopes, where there is little water and no settled population, though we saw a few encampments of the Deleim far out in the desert. The cups and hollows of the plain were filled with a scanty growth of grass. We rejoiced over the unwonted sight as if each blade were a separate benediction, and Fattu? began to calculate the sums we might save on provender when the horses could be pastured every evening on fresh herbage.",
