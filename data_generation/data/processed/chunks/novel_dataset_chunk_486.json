My silk legs rub smoothly together. The stones of a necklace lie cold on my throat. My feet feel the pinch of shoes. I sit bolt upright so that my hair may not touch the back of the seat.

There was a “café” on the square that consisted of four plastic tables and a folding table “bar” in front of someone’s house. We stopped for a drink with the three locals who sat out front, and ended up getting a little samba lesson on the quiet square. At one point, I went inside to use the bathroom, and I had to walk through the living room, where a little girl and her grandmother slept on couches in front of the TV.",

The Port of Spain celebrations are touted as the world’s second largest, behind only the massive festivals of Rio de Janeiro. A huge part of Carnival in Trinidad is the costume contest, especially the competition for Carnival King and Queen. A particularly extravagant costume, meaning one that will be competitive for the top prize, can cost several months wages, prompting local banks to offer loans for the express purpose of designing and constructing Carnival costumes. The buildup and preparation for the celebration lasts for months, culminating in a massive three-day blowout before Ash Wednesday. The festival combines elaborate costumes with dance, music, rum, beer and generalized partying with a strong undercurrent of reckless sexuality. Music is a huge feature. Steel pan band competitions, including massive orchestras composed entirely of steel pan drummers, are held in the weeks leading up to Carnival, with the finals held on Saturday before the main event. Other music represented includes the distinctively Trinidadian styles of Calypso and Soca.",

It impressed the popular imagination. In the popular imagination Mrs. Levitt was now inextricably mixed up with the Ballinger affair. Public sympathy was all with Ballinger, turned out of his house and forced to take refuge with his wife's father at Medlicott, forced to trudge two and a half miles every day to his work and back again. The Rector and Major Markham of Wyck Wold, meditating on the Ballinger affair as they walked back that night from the Town Hall, pronounced it a mystery.\n\"It wasn't likely,\" Major Markham said, \"that Ballinger, of his own initiative, would leave a comfortable house in Sheep Street for a damp cottage in Lower Wyck.\"\n\"Was it likely,\" the Rector said, \"that Waddington would turn him out?\"\nHe couldn't believe that old Waddington would do anything of the sort.",

For themselves, they didn't live right in town; they were in barracks somewhere outside, but they often got in for an afternoon at the Club. Dar was pretty quiet, just at the moment, they admitted—\"Your American depression has hit it, you know. It's very hard on trade and shipping\"—but still, it was good enough. I asked about hotels, and one of the men told me that there was only one but that I'd find it quite satisfactory. \"A very decent little pub, as a matter of fact,\" he said. \"A widow woman runs it—Mrs. Blenkinsop. Her husband was in trade out here for years, and when he died she decided she'd try to go it alone, so she opened this hotel and she's made a good job of it.\"",

Apart from a few farms and spiky church towers puncturing the horizon, the landscape was almost completely featureless. The high dikes blocked the view from the river, and behind them lay not much to see anyway. I reread a page from a 1920s travel book that I had copied into my notebook: ‘The stranger who cycles this way is unfortunate, but if he does it again he is a fool; the more especially as there is absolutely no interest on the way.’ Another historical traveller had been even more succinct, proposing a mathematical formula to summarise the landscape in these parts: ‘[grass + water]’. For me, the scenery conjured up memories of a favourite book from my childhood, long before I ever set foot in the Netherlands: The Cow Who Fell in the Canal. Some twenty-five years after my parents read me the book, I could still remember almost every word.",

Afterwards I found that they never do get up it, but arrive home from the exactly opposite direction along a fair road which was the one any but an imbecile driver would have brought us. We reached our destination by, so to speak, its back door; and we were still standing on the top of the hill doing what is known as getting one’s wind, for I am not what would be called an ill-covered man but rather, as I jestingly tell Edelgard, a walking compliment to her good cooking, and she herself was always of a substantial build, not exaggeratedly but agreeably so—we were standing, I say, struggling for breath, when some one came out quickly from a neighbouring gate and stopped with a smile of greeting upon seeing us.",

They had blue shades that served rather to concentrate than to disperse the overhead crude yellow. The French, Paddy said, swarmed down here from Brittany. All those sensitive blue eyes in pale yet weathered faces, she judged, were Bretons. Paddy had told her in London, there were many French here. Monte Carlo.",

A dozen tents dotted the forest and meadow, so I searched the perimeter for a vacant spot. The only protected one I could find was a tiny space inside a triangle of trees. I nestled my tent into it and, even though it touched branches and the trunks, I was sheltered from the rising wind.

The storm that blew in the week before was still with us. The seas were up and the wind was blowing twenty knots from the north-west. Testing the water maker while within the protection of the jetties would give it a fighting chance to keep the intake below the waterline. I went below and started up the system. In three minutes a stream of fresh water was issuing from the test valve. It was absolutely wonderful. I brought a glass of water to the cockpit.",

One was slim paperback called A Guide to Rocks and Crystals, and it provided descriptions and photographs of hundreds of different stones, whose resonant names I would roll round my mouth – red and green serpentine, malachite, basalt, fluorspar, obsidian, smoky quartz, amethyst – until I had learned them. I spent hours beachcombing on the Scottish coast, not for the serendipitous discoveries of the tide-line – the single flip-flop which had leapt off a passing liner, the neon globe of a fishing-float or the vulcanized corpse of a jellyfish – though these were certainly wonderful, but for the rocks which cobbled the beaches. Crunching across that geological pot-pourri with my guide in hand, I swooped upon stone after stone, gathering them up and stashing them in a canvas shoulder-bag I carried, where they clunked and squeaked against each other. It felt like being given free range in the world’s finest sweet-shop: I could never quite believe I was allowed to take the stones away. I lugged them home, arranged them in troughs on the window-sill and kept them glossy and sleek with water.",

Helen looked at her with interest. They had moved out into the garden, where the tea was laid under a tree, and Mrs Flushing was helping herself to cherry jam. She had a peculiar jerking movement of the body when she spoke, which caused the canarycoloured plume on her hat to jerk too. Her small but finely cut and vigorous features, together with the deep red of lips and cheeks, pointed to many generations of well-trained and well-nourished ancestors behind her.",

Inside, however, there was little decoration. Just a Thai Air ashtray, a whole display of Thai Air destinations, and a life-size cardboard cutout of a Thai Air stewardess joining her hands together in the traditional Thai wai of greeting. I went into Yu-Druk Travel, but it was empty—save for a huge cardboard cutout of another Thai Air girl. I passed through a dark archway, over a plank placed above some sludge, up a narrow, unlit staircase, and past an enormous padlock, into the office of Tee Dee U Car Rental. Its main feature was a pretty picture of a Thai Air hostess bowing her respects. By eleven-fifteen on this weekday morning, a sign was already up outside Druk Consult: CLOSED FOR LUNCH 1–2:30.",

But upon learning of a fabulously rich empire to the interior, he marched to Tenochtitlan, an island metropolis of more than 100,000 people, comparable to the largest European cities of that era.",

All Selma meant to me was vague memories from the civil rights campaigns in the 1960s, when Martin Luther King led hundreds of blacks on forty-mile marches from there to Montgomery, the state capital, to register to vote. It was another surprisingly attractive town – this corner of the South seemed to be awash with them. It was about the same size as Columbus, and just as shady and captivating. Trees had been planted along the streets downtown and the sidewalks had recently been repaved in brick. Benches had been set out, and the waterfront area, where the city ended in a sharp bluff overlooking the Alabama River, had been cleaned up. It all had an agreeable air of prosperity. At a tourist information office I picked up some pamphlets extolling the town, including one boasting of its black heritage. I was heartened by this. I had seen nothing even faintly praiseworthy of blacks in Mississippi. Moreover, blacks and whites here seemed to be on far better terms. I could see them chatting at bus-stops, and I saw a black nurse and white nurse travelling together in a car, looking like old friends. Altogether, it seemed a much more relaxed atmosphere than in Mississippi.",
