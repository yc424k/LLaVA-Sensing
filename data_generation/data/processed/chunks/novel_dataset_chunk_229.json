I thought I’d memorised all seventy-five documents perfectly after one read-through, and this was not so. I’d built a picture of workaholism, empire-building in electrical engineering, dying young in his late forties of a stroke as a dry bachelor. Wrong. Going back to Markus’s death certificate showed he left a widow named Virginia Jaut, and they were living on the big Terez korut (boulevard) where they’d been for many years.",

Then at 7.40 she cell-phoned; her taxi couldn’t get through, Balata had been sealed off by a score of IDF vehicles, which explained why silence had suddenly fallen. Normally the space outside my room was noisy until about 10.00 p.m. – boys romping, men talking, laughing and shouting as they tinkered with dead cars or sat huddled around a bonfire playing cards. Even in midwinter, males tended to spend as much time as possible outside their cramped homes. The night before, Razan told me, the IDF had invaded the Kasbah: much shooting, 17 arrests, a bomb set off on the wasteland where three seventeenth-century dwellings were demolished by the Israeli Air Force in 2002. Massive explosions in confined areas are a favourite IDF terrorisation ploy.",

Between handsprings and whirligigs he delivered his message that would save the world. It was twofold. First, let suffering humanity strip off its clothing and run wild in the mountains and valleys; and, second, let the very miserable world adopt phonetic spelling. I caught a glimpse of the great social problems being settled by the city populations swarming naked over the landscape, to the popping of shot-guns, the barking of ranch-dogs, and countless assaults with pitchforks wielded by irate farmers.",

It had been snuffing out all the time in the wind but this time it went out for good because it had run out of fuel. Abdul Ghiyas rushed off and returned with a can of what I soon found, when he started to pour it into the stove, to be water, and Badar Khan, on this the only recorded time during the entire journey that he ever did anything that was not in his contract, produced another containing methylated spirits that would have blown us all to glory. Faced with the failure of the Welsh rarebit and the rapidly cooling stove I got up to find the paraffin can myself, caught the trousers of my windproof suit in the handle of the frying-pan and shot the whole lot over the rocks.",

Ah, how Lansing knew every movement of that familiar rite, even to the pucker of the brow and the pouting thrust-out of the lower lip! He was seized with a sense of physical sickness as the succession of remembered gestures pressed upon his eyes.... And the other man? The other man, inside the house, was perhaps at that very instant smiling over the remembrance of the same scene!",

I shared my carriage with an elderly couple recently retired from their factory jobs, two sisters in their mid-twenties and an exhausted-looking mother who sat with her head on the shoulder of her nineteen-year-old son. As a political debate raged, I noticed again how attentively – often respectfully – many of the older generation listened to their juniors, as though aware that National Salvation depended not on the Front but on the young. (Women, interestingly, are no less assertive in public than men: possibly a beneficial side-effect of Communism?)",

The writer has even identified all the murky paintings in the choir area. Reading the guide, I’m overwhelmed once again by all the art, architecture, history in one little hill town.

On the day the bank first opened about twenty years ago Mrs Jennie Du Pre, Colonel Sartoris’s sister, had put a tremendous great rubber plant in the corner of the lobby. It was taller than a man, it took up as much room as a privy; it was in everybody’s way and in summer they couldn’t even open the front door all the way because of it. But she wouldn’t let the colonel nor the board of directors either remove it, since she belonged to that school which believed that any room inhabited by people had to have something green in it to absorb the poison from the air. Though why it had to be that monstrous rubber plant, nobody knew, unless perhaps she believed that nothing less than rubber and that much of it would be tough and durable and resilient enough to cope with air poisoned by the anxiety or exultation over as much money as her brother’s, a Sartoris, old Colonel Sartoris’s son’s, bank would naturally handle.",

Situated within the Bwindi Forest, close to the border with Democratic Republic of Congo, Ruhija sits at two thousand metres above sea level, and consequently enjoys the damp, chilly climate we were well used to in northern England. Wandering the quiet, muddy streets, it seemed we were the only foreigners in town, and we soon attracted the attention of the villagers, including the local primary school teacher who press-ganged us into an impromptu English lesson delivered to the whole ragged, barefoot class. As usual the lesson basically entailed me drawing animals on the blackboard, and getting the kids to recite their English name, while I attempted to recreate the noise of the said animal. I've performed dozens of these lessons in African schools and can safely say that no one draws a better chalk pig than me, though my donkey impression maybe needs some work, and often leads to distressed expressions on young faces, and even occasional tears.",

It was a chance for the guides to play, racing each other over the slippery, skiddy terrain and spraying streams of mud into the air. Vivien laughed, pointing to Kamara as his vehicle fishtailed around. ‘That is what he loves,’ she smiled.\nDedan joined in the impromptu race, but I sensed a lack of commitment.\n‘Do you enjoy this?’ I asked.\n‘No,’ he replied frankly. ‘Very dirty, and can damage the vehicle.’",

About two hours after setting off, we came to a lagoon, about two acres in size, I would guess, and filled with papery reeds, fallen trees, and the bleached torsos of dead trees that were still standing. Dragonflies danced across the surface. Beyond, waiting, rose a titanic heap called Moxie Bald Mountain. But what was of immediate note was that the trail ended, abruptly and disconcertingly, at the water’s edge. Katz and I looked at each other—something wrong here surely. For the first time since Georgia, we wondered if we had lost the trail. (God knows what Chicken John would have made of it.) We retraced our steps a considerable distance, perplexedly studied our map and trail guide, tried to find an alternative way around the pond through the dense and lacerating undergrowth, and finally concluded that we were intended to ford it. On the far shore, perhaps eighty yards away, Katz spied a continuation of trail and a white AT blaze. Clearly we had to wade across.",

A few streets away, tourists buy fruit from exquisitely constructed pyramid displays, each one sculpted into intricate, filigree rosettes. More functional offerings are the pre-cut packages, with a small bag of dipping mix (sugar, salt, chilli). With my guy, minimalism rules. Gritty old card tables support fruit displayed plain and simple, straight onto newspaper, while he reads a fresh newspaper seated on a plastic beach chair. He always keeps odd bits of fruit to one side to throw in free extras if he wants. They might be from yesterday, but they’re always fine. He chucks them in as a parting shot with not exactly a wink, but a discreet nod, and a look that could come from somewhere between your guru and your granddad. He sets up when he likes and goes home when he feels like it, which is my idea of a perfect business.",

Why couldn't two unhappy people refresh each other on their way through this dusty business of life by a little talk—real, natural talk, about what they felt, what they would have liked, what they still tried to hope? And she could not help thinking that Mrs. Arbuthnot, too, was reading that very same advertisement. Her eyes were on the very part of the paper. Was she, too, picturing what it would be like—the colour, the fragrance, the light, the soft lapping of the sea among little hot rocks?

At the university next door to my compound, reveille sounded each morning at 6:00. Students had fifteen minutes to run downstairs for roll call and their daily exercise regimen. Several classes followed, which the students generally did not select themselves. Then they got shuffled into the canteen with their lunch tins and chopsticks for stir-fry and steamed rolls. Xiuxi lasted an hour and was followed by afternoon classes, dinner, and study time. Students had to be in their dorm rooms (which they shared with as many as eight others) by 10:30, and lights went out at 11:00, no exceptions. On Fridays, they tidied their rooms for weekly inspection. Administrators awarded the cleanest room with 200 RMB (about $25), while the messiest residents had to pay a fine. Students also paid for the showers, which were often so crowded, they shared the spigots. Calls went through the operators who guarded the phones at the ends of every hallway, and conversations could be overheard by passersby.",
