But such excavations, to be of value, must be carried out cautiously and systematically, in order to obtain some idea of the age of the embedded remains and of their age in relation to one another, which can only be done by means of sections and photographs showing their juxtaposition with the cave deposit. And this deposit is a study in itself, for it varies greatly; in some caves it is of extremely slow growth; in others, which are more accessible to wind-drifts, vegetable matter, or materials falling from above, it is relatively rapid. To excavate a cave on these scientific lines requires a greater outlay than may be thought, without which the remains are best left to repose where they are, in expectation of some future enlightened amateur.",

There was nothing, save the wall of rocks I had made and the summit cairn, to suggest history. Nothing human. I turned east and south, straining to see if there was any flicker of light in the hundreds of miles of darkness around me.

We hadn’t seen rain since starting out at Cachora, and water levels were low. Most of the paths we’d followed thus far had been dusty mule trails. Today’s route was so far off the map that the Inca stonework was in near-mint condition. “Just think, Pachacutec and Manco probably came along this trail on their way from Vitcos to Choquequirao,” John said.",

    "target_paragraph": "It was very friendly and offhand at the coiffeur’s but very professional. Monsieur Jean, who was about David’s age and looked more Italian than French, said, “I will cut it as she asks. Do you agree, Monsieur?”\n“I don’t belong to the syndicate,” David said. “I leave it to you two.”\n“Perhaps we should experiment on Monsieur,” Monsieur Jean said. “In case anything goes wrong.”\nBut Monsieur Jean began cutting Catherine’s hair very carefully and skillfully and David watched her dark serious face above the smock that came close around her neck. She looked into the hand mirror and watched the comb and scissors lifting and snipping. The man was working like a sculptor, absorbed and serious. “I thought about it all last night and this morning,” the coiffeur said. “If you don’t believe that, Monsieur, I understand. But this is as important to me as your métier is to you.”\nHe stepped back to look at the shape he was making. Then he snipped more rapidly and finally turned the chair so the big mirror was reflected in the small one Catherine held.\n“Do you want it cut that way above the ears?” she asked the coiffeur.\n“As you like. I can make it more dégagé if you wish. But it will be beautiful as is if we are going to make it truly fair.”\n“I want it fair,” Catherine said.\nHe smiled. “Madame and I have spoken of it. But I said it must be Monsieur’s decision.”\n“Monsieur gave his decision,” Catherine said.\n“How fair did Monsieur say he wished it to be?”\n“As fair as you can make it,” she said.\n“Don’t say that,” Monsieur Jean said. “You must tell me.”\n“As fair as my pearls,” Catherine said. “You’ve seen them plenty of times.”\nDavid had come over and was watching Monsieur Jean stir a large glassful of the shampoo with a wooden spoon. “I have the shampoos made up with castile soap,” the coiffeur said. “It’s warm. Please come over here to the basin. Sit forward,” he said to Catherine, “and put this cloth across your forehead.”\n“But it isn’t even really a boy’s haircut,” Catherine said. “I wanted it the way we planned. Everything’s going wrong.”\n“It couldn’t be more a boy’s haircut. You must believe me.”\nHe was lathering her head now with the foamy thick shampoo with the acrid odor.\nWhen her head had been shampooed and rinsed again and again it looked to David as though it had no color and the water tunnelled through it showing only a wet paleness. The coiffeur put a towel over it and rubbed it softly. He was very sure about it.\n“Don’t be desperate, Madame,” he said. “Why would I do anything against your beauty?”\n“I am desperate and there isn’t any beauty.”\nHe dried her head gently and then kept the towel over her head and brought a hand blower and began to play it through her hair as he combed it forward.\n“Now watch,” he said.\nAs the air drove through her hair it was turning from damp drab to a silvery northern shining fairness. As the wind of the blower moved through it they watched it change.\n“You shouldn’t have despaired,” Monsieur Jean said, not saying Madame and then remembering. “Madame wanted it fair?”\n“It’s better than the pearls,” she said. “You’re a great man and I was terrible.”\nThen he rubbed his hands together with something from a jar. “I’ll just touch it with this,” he said. He smiled at Catherine very happily and passed his hands lightly over her head.\nCatherine stood up and looked at herself very seriously in the mirror. Her face had never been so dark and her hair was like the bark of a young white birch tree.\n“I like it so much,” she said. “Too much.”\nShe looked in the mirror as though she had never seen the girl she was looking at.\n“Now we must do Monsieur,” the coiffeur said. “Does Monsieur wish the cut? It’s very conservative but it’s also sportif.”\n“The cut,” David said. “I don’t think I’ve had a haircut in a month.”\n“Please make it the same as mine,” Catherine said.\n“But shorter,” David said.\n“No. Please just the same.”\nWhen it was cut David stood up and ran his hand over his head. It felt cool and comfortable.\n“Aren’t you going to let him lighten it?”\n“No. We’ve had enough miracles for one day.”\n“Just a little?”\n“No.”\nDavid looked at Catherine and then at his own face in the mirror. His was as brown as hers and it was her haircut.\n“You really want it that much?”\n“Yes I do, David. Truly. Just to try it a little bit. Please.”\nHe looked once more in the mirror and walked over then and sat down. The coiffeur looked at Catherine.\n“Go ahead and do it,” she said.",

The whole thing was extremely dangerous for Oliver; without adequate gloves or instruments the slightest nick in his hand could have proved fatal. In spite of my fondness for the child I was fascinated by the operation; somehow one doesn’t connect the corpse that’s being cut up with the human being one liked. After three hours’ hard work every organ had been removed and dissected, but the examination merely confirmed that Dolma had pneumonia in both lungs, an enlarged liver and intestines crammed with huge worms – which were still alive. It’s astonishing how much a body can contain: when everything was out in a big basin one could hardly believe that it had all fitted into the little space available. Oliver was very scrupulous about replacing every organ in its exact position, after I had baled bowlfuls of blood out of the torso, and then he sewed up the body as neatly as though after an operation. When we had replaced it in its little cardboard coffin he completed the ceremony by reading a short prayer for the dead from his German prayer-book.",

The first course was raw fish and poi-poi, the latter sharp and more acrid of taste than the poi of Hawaii, which is made from taro. The poi-poi of the Marquesas is made from breadfruit. The ripe fruit, after the core is removed, is placed in a calabash and pounded with a stone pestle into a stiff, sticky paste. In this stage of the process, wrapped in leaves, it can be buried in the ground, where it will keep for years. Before it can be eaten, however, further processes are necessary. A leaf-covered package is placed among hot stones, like the pig, and thoroughly baked. After that it is mixed with cold water and thinned out—not thin enough to run, but thin enough to be eaten by sticking one's first and second fingers into it. On close acquaintance it proves a pleasant and most healthful food. And breadfruit, ripe and well boiled or roasted! It is delicious. Breadfruit and taro are kingly vegetables, the pair of them, though the former is patently a misnomer and more resembles a sweet potato than anything else, though it is not mealy like a sweet potato, nor is it so sweet.",

It had a long veranda lined with chairs. That night after supper, the buckboard and team in the stable, Ratliff was sitting here with five or six other men who had drifted in from the adjacent homes within walking distance. They would have been there on any other night, but this evening they were gathered even before the sun was completely gone, looking now and then toward the dark front of Varner’s store as people will gather to look quietly at the cold embers of a lynching or at the propped ladder and open window of an elopement, since the presence of a hired white clerk in the store of a man still able to walk and with intellect still sound enough to make money mistakes at least in his own favor, was as unheard of as the presence of a hired white woman in one of their own kitchens. “Well,” one said, “I dont know nothing about that one Varner hired.

On\nthe bridge before him, in the crook of the street, were the booths and\nstalls of the night market, lit by blazing naphtha, color heaped on\ncolor in a leaping, waving flare as of torches. On either side was a\ntwisted and jagged line of houses--brown-brick, flat-fronted,\neighteenth-century houses, and houses with painted fronts. Here a tall,\nred-brick modern Parade shot up the gables of its insolent facade.\nThere, oldest of all, a yellow house stooped forward on the posts that\npropped it. Somewhere up in the sky a tall chimney and a cupola. All\nbeautiful under the night, all dark or dim, with sudden flashes and\npallors and gleams, lamplit and moonlit; and all impressed upon\nRansome's brain with an extraordinary vividness and importance, as if he\nhad suddenly discovered something new about Wandsworth High Street.",

    "target_paragraph": "Something in the general drift now has John Kauffmann on his feet and off to the river. He assembles his trout rod, threads its eyes. Six feet three, spare, he walks, in his determination, tilted forward, ten degrees from vertical, jaws clamped. He seems to be seeking reassurance from the river. He seems not so much to want to catch what may become the last grayling in Arctic Alaska as to certify that it is there. With his bamboo rod, his lofted line, he now describes long drape folds in the air above the river. His shirt is old and red. There are holes in his felt hat and strips of spare rawhide around its crown. He agitates the settled fly. Nothing. Again he waves the line. He drops its passenger on the edge of fast water at the far side of the pool. There is a vacuum-implosive sound, a touch of violence at the surface of the river. We cheer. For two minutes, we wait it out while Kauffmann plays his fish. Adroitly, gingerly, he brings it in. With care, he picks it up. He then looks at us as if he is about to throw his tin star in the dust at our feet. Shame—for our triple-hooked lures, our nylon hawsers, our consequent stories of fished-out streams. He looks at his grayling. It is a twenty-five-ounce midget, but it will grow. He seems to feel reassured. He removes the fly, which has scarcely nicked the fish’s lips. He slips the grayling back to the stream.",

As one of an extremely small number of truly feral herds in the world, it wasn’t clear how they would act. All males were left uncastrated, and allowed to live to maturity. Breeding took place freely. Such things would never take place on a farm. Without the strictures of husbandry, they were forced to improvise. Now, their social organization is almost completely unrecognizable; much of what we consider to be “cow-like” behavior, it transpires, is not necessarily their true nature.",

I slid my jumar up the fixed line with a gloved hand, rested my weight on the device to draw two burning, labored breaths; then I moved my left foot up and stamped the crampon into the ice, desperately sucked in another two lungfuls of air; planted my right foot next to my left, inhaled and exhaled from the bottom of my chest, inhaled and exhaled again; and slid the jumar up the rope one more time. I’d been exerting myself at full bore for the past three hours, and I expected to be at it for at least an hour more before taking a rest. In this agonizing fashion I climbed toward a cluster of tents reputed to be perched somewhere on the sheer face above, progressing in increments calibrated in inches.",

Wool, for instance, would find a ready market among American settlers, “to whom warme clothes shal be righte welcome.”",

    "target_paragraph": "In retrospect, the late 1970s in Kyoto were the turning point of an era. Diane, David Kidd, many of my other foreign friends and I were all living in a dream of ancient Japan, because in those days it was still possible to believe in the dream. Around Tenmangu was wilderness and rice paddies, and the streets of Kameoka were still lined with wooden houses and the big kura of saké-makers, lending it the feel of a feudal castle town. The mountains had yet to be covered with steel pylons, and the wave of concrete and plastic had yet to overtake the town. Our actions at the time may have been a bit eccentric, but they still had some air of reality. It was possible, as we sometimes did on summer nights during the seminar at Oomoto, to walk all the way through town back to Tenmangu wearing kimono and hakama (trousers). To do so today would be so divorced from modern Japanese surroundings as to seem wholly ridiculous.",

In March, a nicer, larger rental cabin up the road became available when friends moved Outside for a “real job.” We moved in, hauled boxes of books and loads of boots on sleds over the snow-packed trail to the porch. That was the winter Gabe’s job also turned more permanent, with a four-year appointment and benefits. We had just begun to think about a place of our own when the friends moving to Ohio made us another offer. They owned a piece of land on the edge of a bluff farther up Stampede, and they were thinking of subdividing, a few acres’ sale to pay it off before they moved away. Would we be interested? It was a beautiful spot, with aspen groves, mountain views, a gravel road punched in to the property’s edge. It was a place we could imagine building the house we’d begun to plan in our minds: concrete countertops, a woodstove, a south-facing porch. An outhouse of our very own. Yes, we told the friends, let’s do it. We shook hands. Another friend, a surveyor, staked the boundaries and filed the plat map at the borough office, making it, finally, our own. It was the most money we’d ever spent on anything you could touch (college was much more). A 1993 Toyota pickup was our next-most-valuable asset, and after that, a quiver of ten pairs of skis.",
