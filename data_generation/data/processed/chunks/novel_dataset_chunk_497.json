On his table too were bottles and glasses, and he now sat slumped in his chair, his eyes closed and his bald head rosy with perspiration in the glow of an electric candle. Beside him was a woman who turned and looked at Bayard with blazing and harried desperation; above them stood a waiter with a head like a monk’s, and as Bayard passed he saw that the diamond was missing from Harry’s tie and he heard their bitter suppressed voices as their hands struggled over something on the table beyond the discreet shelter of their bodies, and as he and his companion reached the exit the woman’s voice rose with a burst of filthy rage into a shrill hysterical scream cut sharply off, as if someone had clapped a hand over her mouth.",

In her innocent way she had never believed that there were any civilized settlements at all, and she had put the belief in them down to the credulity of the mountain people.\nShe turned to go up to the cabin, and, as she turned something struck her in the neck. It was a sponge, thrown by Boscoe Doldrum—a sponge soaked in whiskey from his still on the other side of the stream.\n“Hi, thar, Boscoe Doldrum,” she shouted in her deep bass voice.\n“Yo! Jemina Tantrum. Gosh ding yo’!” he returned.\nShe continued her way to the cabin.\nThe stranger was talking to her father. Gold had been discovered on the Tantrum land, and the stranger, Edgar Edison, was trying to buy the land for a song. He was considering what song to offer.\nShe sat upon her hands and watched him.\nHe was wonderful. When he talked his lips moved.\nShe sat upon the stove and watched him.\nSuddenly there came a blood-curdling scream. The Tantrums rushed to the windows.\nIt was the Doldrums.\nThey had hitched their steers to trees and concealed themselves behind the bushes and flowers, and soon a perfect rattle of stones and bricks beat against the windows, bending them inward.\n“Father! father!” shrieked Jemina.\nHer father took down his slingshot from his slingshot rack on the wall and ran his hand lovingly over the elastic band. He stepped to a loophole. Old Mappy Tantrum stepped to the coalhole.",

Instead, I held out my hand, and tried, in vain, to flag a taxi. The drivers wanted nothing to do with us. Some taxis were full, others were empty, but even then, the drivers passed by without slowing. We reached the citadel, then the harbor, then the Corniche. Miles passed under our feet. At Midan Ramla, I found a taxi caught in a circle of traffic. The driver demanded fifty pounds to take us back to the hotel – I countered with twenty, but he rolled up his window and drove away. A second driver rolled to a stop. He offered to take us home, but he, too, insisted on fifty pounds. Outrageous, I thought. A third driver pulled over. “Fifty pounds,” he said, “it’s Ramadan, very many people!” I found a fourth driver, caught at a light, and I desperately waved a twenty-pound note.",

She realized now that, as she sat in the restaurant, she had unconsciously arrived at a final decision. The discovery gave her an immediate illusion of activity: it was exhilarating to think that she had actually a reason for hurrying home. To prolong her enjoyment of the sensation she decided to walk; but the distance was so great that she found herself glancing nervously at the clocks on the way. One of the surprises of her unoccupied state was the discovery that time, when it is left to itself and no definite demands are made on it, cannot be trusted to move at any recognized pace. Usually it loiters; but just when one has come to count upon its slowness, it may suddenly break into a wild irrational gallop.",

The path to her private beach led down through a small natural amphitheatre to a wall of rock which marked the sea-boundaries – and all along it the heavy screen of wattles which were to make a wind-break shuffled and scratched. Here stood the little bamboo hut which served both as a changing room and as a summer bedroom. A lizard lay asleep on the bamboo couch looking like a Greek politician waiting for an opening. As I undressed my eye noted the empty Chianti bottle, the red fan, and the gourd dippers – they echoed those improvident and happy afternoons of two years ago; a striped towel and a Pen­guin history of Architecture, stained and cockled with sea-damp, lay on a seat fashioned from the trunk of a palm tree. They repeated, more clearly than words could, the names: ‘Pearce and Dante’. An empty bottle of Riesling with a sediment of oil in the bottom said: ‘Paddy Leigh Fermor’ (here during a tremendous freak thunderstorm we had sat, drinking wine and oiling ourselves against the sunlight we knew would follow it, while the rain slashed the slatted bamboo roof to ribbons and Paddy sang the trailing, ululating songs of the Cretan mountains, punctuating each strophe with a swig of Chianti). On a nail hung a tear-bottle … But my movements had disturbed the lizard which abandoned the couch and retired to the roof.",

Mr. Letterblair had let Mrs. Welland know that Mr. Archer had \"rendered an invaluable service\" to the whole family, and that old Mrs. Manson Mingott had been particularly pleased; and one day when May had gone for a drive with her father in the only vehicle the place produced Mrs. Welland took occasion to touch on a topic which she always avoided in her daughter's presence.",

Wet or fine, the audience would take tea there. Young men and women – Jim, Iris, David, Jessica – were even now busy with garlands of red and white paper roses left over from the Coronation.23 The seeds and the dust from the sacks made them sneeze. Iris had a handkerchief bound round her forehead; Jessica wore breeches. The young men worked in shirt sleeves. Pale husks had stuck in their hair, and it was easy to run a splinter of wood into the fingers.",

Amah and Vande were quite drunk with palm wine long before dark, and when we ourselves were sitting at dinner the waving of half a dozen torches announced the chief’s approach with the carriers’ chop. He stood there swaying in front of us between two tipsy torch-bearers, while Vande whispered in my ear, ‘Chief good man. Chief very good man,’ and his men brought up between the pointed huts, under the light of the flaming splinters, bowl after bowl of food. The carriers had never seen such a feast. Its stink reeked in the hot flyey night, the stink of fourteen bowls of chop and three bowls of meat scraps.",

They swept him upward into the faint dapplings of the morning sky, and he caught, as in a mystic vision, the meaning of beauty, the secret of poetry, the sense of the forces struggling in him for expression. How could he ever have been afraid--afraid of Laura Lou, of fate, of himself? She was the vessel from which he had drunk this divine reassurance, this moment of union with the universe. Whatever happened, however hard and rough the road ahead, he would carry her on his heart like the little cup of his great communion. . . .",

When they first visited San Agustín, their eyes went not to the ground, the burial tombs so dramatically aligned across the site, but to the horizon: the distant heights of the Macizo, the fertile hills and ridgelines that ran away to the north, the gorge that so quickly became a formidable canyon as the Magdalena cleaved the Cordilleras and began its run to the sea. The entire complex of San Agustín, they noted, consisted of hundreds of monumental statues, all anthropomorphic, sprawling across more than a thousand square miles, embracing both banks of the Río Magdalena. In aspect and scale, they might rival, as had been suggested, the great statues of Easter Island, but their symbolism was totally rooted in the Americas, the Amazon in particular. That the site was situated on the very forested slopes traversed by the Río Magdalena, the mother of all rivers, was for Reichel-Dolmatoff the key to understanding the genesis of the entire complex.",

I will let the others get out before me. I will sit still one moment before I emerge into that chaos, that tumult. I will not anticipate what is to come. The huge uproar is in my ears. It sounds and resounds, under this glass roof like the surge of a sea. We are cast down on the platform with our handbags. We are whirled asunder. My sense of self almost perishes; my contempt.

It is also far from a dangerous road. Perhaps people who travel on single lane roads are awestruck by the speed of going over forty something/hr. It is a good road, understanding that the same “run to the bushes and hide with the bike until the ferry traffic passes” rule still applies. I feel blessed by divine intervention when, without explanation, the brakes stop squealing and the phone starts working. I get to Salen so early nothing is open. All I want is tea and HEAT. I huddle in a wind-free side of a building for half an hour until The Coffee Pot opens and then fling myself into its embrace, commandeer the fireplace, and don’t move for two hours.",

(Oddly, between Gilgit and here one comes to accept jeeps – not to regard them as vile mechanical intrusions on the landscape. I suppose this is because of their daring feats in the Gorge, which earn one’s grudging respect.)",

There was a potential case of fraud or embezzlement, a lengthy prenup, a divorce, and something mysterious about one spouse-to-be loaning money to the other. Annoyingly, it was not clear if the bride loaned money to the groom or vice versa. This was Cousin Olga and her third husband, Bruno the lawyer, a year before they married. They were living in the same building, but in different flats. I was getting more curious about them all the time.",

That’s what I calls more than justice: that’s what I calls tit for tat.” It was full dark now, and ahead of her was still the mile-and-a-half walk to the poorhouse with the heavy shopping bag. But the dark would last a long time on a winter night, and Uncle Gavin said the poorhouse too wasn’t likely to move any time soon. So he said that old Het sat back on the box with the empty skillet in her hand and sighed with peaceful and happy relaxation. “Gentlemen, hush,” she said. “Aint we had a day.”",

The sustained and dazzling flickers seemed to last for an unconscionable time. The growl of the thunder increased steadily while I looked at him, distinct and black, planted solidly upon the shores of a sea of light. At the moment of greatest brilliance the darkness leaped back with a culminating crash, and he vanished before my dazzled eyes as utterly as though he had been blown to atoms. A blustering sigh passed; furious hands seemed to tear at the shrubs, shake the tops of the trees below, slam doors, break window-panes, all along the front of the building. He stepped in, closing the door behind him, and found me bending over the table: my sudden anxiety as to what he would say was very great, and akin to a fright. “May I have a cigarette?” he asked. I gave a push to the box without raising my head. “I want — want — tobacco,” he muttered. I became extremely buoyant. “Just a moment.” I grunted pleasantly. He took a few steps here and there. “That’s over,” I heard him say. A single distant clap of thunder came from the sea like a gun of distress. “The monsoon breaks up early this year,” he remarked conversationally, somewhere behind me. This encouraged me to turn round, which I did as soon as I had finished addressing the last envelope. He was smoking greedily in the middle of the room, and though he heard the stir I made, he remained with his back to me for a time.",
