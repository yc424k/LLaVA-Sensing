His trader father had two wives, one living in Namche Bazaar and the other in Lhasa. When he died Mingmar was only four and was brought up by both his mother and his step-mother, who themselves traded extensively between Tibet and India. Lhamo, his twenty-two-year-old sister, now looks after the family trading concerns and Pemba, his elder half-brother, runs one of the Tibetan hotels in Kathmandu – assisted by his own mother. This morning Mingmar bought two pounds of Tibetan cheese for her, as he always brings back a present of her favourite delicacy when he has been away on trek. So between butter for his dead mother and cheese for his live step-mother our progress was considerably slowed.",

At the urinal raised cement footprints offered the possibility of keeping your feet out of the flooding mire, but as the footprints themselves were hardly filth-free, the intention failed.

On the short walk from the train station to the river alone, I heard passers-by speak no fewer than six different languages, as well as the local Limburgish dialect of Dutch. A sign outside a café offered visitors ‘LEKKERE BROODJES, PAIN FRANCAISE, TASTY CAKES’.",

But instead of being the usual blotchy and spotted mudpack, they wore a streaky, Jackson Pollock?like mess. The wave of water had splashed them just enough to cause all the ooze to run down their rather bedraggled-looking clothing. The Americans were not much better off. While they had avoided the worst of my mud flinging, the wave that had shot over me had landed full force on the first row of seats, where they were sitting. Their hair was plastered to their faces, and the lady had the leaf of some aquatic plant behind her ear. They looked rather grim, and reading their faces gave me the impression that they did not think highly of me or the way I drove.",

There was a basket of fruit awaiting me in my brand-new room, a wicker basket for laundry, and bottles of toiletries in the bathroom. Luckily, however, Vietnam Tourism has still not quite memorized its lines. I pressed the tap and there was no hot water. I put on the TV and got nothing but static. I looked for shampoo and found I had two bottles of bath foam instead. And though the floor guards jumped up and bowed each time I walked past, they could not—or would not—read Do Not Disturb signs. Nonetheless, the hotel seemed a perfect microcosm of the new Saigon: one morning, as I walked through the lobby, it was a cacophony of saws and blowtorches and sweating laborers; by the time I returned that night, a spanking-new bar stood in one corner of the lobby, complete with tables and spacious shelves and smiling girls waiting to serve up coconut cocktails.",

His aunty had told him a little about university women. She would know, because she worked as a cleaner at the faculty of sciences during the day and as a waitress at the staff club in the evenings; sometimes, too, the lecturers paid her to come in and clean their homes. She said university women kept framed photos of their student days in Ibadan and Britain and America on their shelves. For breakfast, they had eggs that were not cooked well, so that the yolk danced around, and they wore bouncy straight-hair wigs and maxi-dresses that grazed their ankles. She told a story once about a couple at a cocktail party in the staff club who climbed out of a nice Peugeot 404, the man in an elegant cream suit, the woman in a green dress. Everybody turned to watch them, walking hand in hand, and then the wind blew the woman’s wig off her head. She was bald. They used hot combs to straighten their hair, his aunty had said, because they wanted to look like white people, although the combs ended up burning their hair off.",

Slowly I adjust to the hazy, grainy gloom and the furious whine of mosquitoes, the painful stabbing of their attack. There’s a pool just to my right. It’s a syrupy coffee black, matted with bamboo and lianas. The braided hair of sleeping giantesses. The bamboo shoots are such deep greens. They stand so straight, they could be spears, topped with fluttering ribbons. The water looks like a place where anacondas and caimans live. It’s got a swampy, sweet smell. Then the sun suddenly comes out and the pool twinkles glassily. A cascade of purple orchids scatters the mulch-covered wet ground and the smell of vanilla wafts up my nose. There’s a long, low log that hangs over the water, and I imagine Wayra lying on it, resting her cheek against the warm bark, watching the light as it catches the surface of the pool.",

It was built in the Golden Age of Mogul power when Shah Jehan ruled over most of India, all of Pakistan and great chunks of Afghanistan. Every Friday the emperor would leave his palace of pleasure and his huge harem to ride a grand elephant to this mosque. Three hundred and fifty years later I scurry along the same route—now filled with bleating goats, cages of chickens, flurries of feathers, fly-encrusted animal corpses and lepers reaching for alms. The huge red sandstone floor of the mosque is red-hot under my pale feet and the shady corner crunches with pigeon droppings. Below the stunning red and white onion dome and between the two crumbling minarets I softly give thanks. In this temple to God of magnificent proportions my desires feel insignificant, but my relief is real. I don’t care what spared Jonathan, I just feel blessed that it did.",

Through the dust and petroleum haze of the street, the foothills and slopes to the east of Mount Chokai looked as distant as they had from Kakunodate, though I knew they were less than a day away and that by tomorrow night they would lie behind me.",

By nineteen she was married. And by twenty she was divorced, her name tainted. It had been a sensational case which fairly reeked. Even at that time her conduct had been so scandalous that her husband had had no difficulty in winning a decree.",

These slopes plunge down and down to invisible, inviolate ravines – among the few remaining refuges for many European mammals. Some people find such densely forested mountains too eerie – or oppressive, or monotonous. But for me there is an enjoyable, mysterious melancholy about them, recalling the delicious childhood frisson associated with scarey fairy-tales. I rejoice that their permanently twilit depths are protected by gradients that make logging impossible, or too costly.",

Holding her trunk aloft, she searches the wind for danger. She is thirsty, as are the four young females in her family, one with an infant that gently presses his head into his mother’s flank. Weeks earlier the rains tapered off, and by now most of the water holes away from the rivers are liquid mud. The elephants have come a long way since yesterday without drinking. They hurry forward, eager to cool themselves in the river after the heat of the day. But the matriarch holds them back, perhaps remembering an earlier time when poachers had chosen such a place for their ambush. She waits, her mouth dry with fear and drought, as the little calf nuzzles her mother’s withered breast.\nAt that same moment, in Mwamfushi Village, far upstream of the elephants, another mother holds a crying infant to her flaccid breast. The stingy rains have turned the millet and maize to yellow, shriveled weeds. There will be starvation in the village this year unless the men go hunting in the park—unless Musakanya, her young husband, goes poaching.\nFor the past two weeks the family has lived on little more than n’shima, a paste of boiled maize meal dipped in a gravy made with beans. They crave meat, and Musakanya knows where to get it. He shoulders his rifle and walks down a dusty footpath that sixty miles later will end in the North Luangwa National Park. At the edge of his village, under the tree where they always meet on these expeditions, he joins Bwalya Muchisa and Chanda Seven, two friends who will poach for more than meat; they are going for ivory.",

One of the old men had long, pointed moustaches, and a thin, distinguished face; the other was more ruddy and full-fleshed and had a beard. They played quietly, bending over the old, green cloth with studious deliberation, making each play slowly. Sometimes they spoke quietly to each other, only a few words at a time; sometimes the ruddy old man’s thick shoulders would heave and tremble, and his face would flush rosily with satisfaction; but the other one laughed thinly, quietly, in a more gentle, weary way.",

She supposed that it sheltered a travelling circus which had come there for the Fourth; but as she drew nearer she saw, over the folded-back flap, a large sign bearing the inscription, “Gospel Tent.” The interior seemed to be empty; but a young man in a black alpaca coat, his lank hair parted over a round white face, stepped from under the flap and advanced toward her with a smile.",

In his dark shop with the sewing machine by the window and the spools lined up on the sill, I see a new white bicycle, a water bottle attached for long trips, nifty leather saddlebags over the back wheel. When I see him later, though, he is only in the town park, feeding three stray cats food from his saddlebags. He unwraps the scraps they are so clearly expecting. He and I are the only ones out on Sunday morning, when most people who live here are doing something else. When I gave him my pants to hem last week, he showed me a circle of photos tacked up on the back wall. His young wife with parted lips and wavy, parted hair. Morta. His mother like an apple doll, also dead. His sister. There was one of him, too, as a young soldier for the Pope, restored to youth, with black hair, his legs apart and shoulders back. He was twenty-five in Rome, the war just ended. Now fifty more years have passed, everyone gone. He pats the white bicycle. I never thought I’d be the one left.",

He knew they could not linger long here, though it was comfortable, and they could eat anything they wanted from the remaining stores of the Karluk. Fully loaded, there was no telling how long it would take to get back, so they prepared everything and lashed it securely on the sleds. Before they left, McKinlay wrote a note of their recent affairs and the current location of the main party and added it to the copper tank. As the dogs trotted away, McKinlay turned and took a last look at Shipwreck Camp. He wondered what would happen to the written record of their time there, and to the camp itself, and the thousands of articles they were leaving behind: “Would they be devoured in the ice … or … drift thousands of miles to be washed up on some Atlantic shore?”",
