    "target_paragraph": "Driving around Unalaska today is like taking a magnifying glass to one of those recycled medieval parchments on which a monk calligraphied some dogmatic drivel over a poorly erased ancient text. At first glance, one sees an industrial fishing town, with several processing plants larger than any I’d seen in Alaska. Bald eagles congregate like pigeons on stacks of enormous crab pots. Unalaska consistently ranks as the biggest fishing port in the United States, and the boats in its fleet were two or three times the size of those in places like Cordova. Cranes capable of hoisting forty-foot shipping containers towered over the docks. “That big one there came down in a gust of 175 miles per hour,” Dickrell said as we crossed from the harbor to the main island. “If you drive across this bridge on a windy day, you definitely feel the car moving horizontally.”",

Just as the boatloads of city tourists had clapped and sung on the Mogami River seventy-six days earlier in the choppy cool of the northern summer, so here in the warm autumn these salarymen clapped and sang, and the loudspeakers in their boats carried the songs of the guides and the grunts of the boatmen across the river to the highway where they were drowned by pneumatic drills.",

Then he whirled and leaped, not toward the sound but running parallel with it, leaping with incredible agility and speed among the trees and undergrowth, breaking out of the jungle in time to see, in the wan light of the accelerating dawn, the quarry fleeing like a deer across a field and into the still night-bound woods beyond.",

Every thirty feet or so there is a neat, paved driveway going fifteen or twenty yards to nowhere. There are still a few houses scattered around—all of them modest, narrow, wood-framed structures stabilized with brick buttresses—and a couple of buildings in what was once the central business district.",

Once a bear makes that cognitive leap, it will pester any humans it comes into contact with long after you have returned to civilization, aggressively if necessary.

But about halfway up the staircase, a woman in a wig tapped on Astrid’s shoulder and pointed down at my friend’s rear. And that’s when we realized that, with each step, Astrid had been stepping on the hem of her floor-length, sadly elastic-waisted skirt such that it had been yanked all the way down to her upper thighs. So thousands of Orthodox Jews who are not allowed to shake women’s hands got a view of my blond shiksa friend’s thong-clad booty. She mooned the Western Wall on Shabbat.",

It is a long, low building of only two storeys, rather insignificant from outside. It is evident that Vespasiano built it as economically as he could. For him the place was only a week-end cottage, a holiday resort, whither he could escape from the metropolitan splendour and bustle of the palace, in the market-place, a quarter of a mile away. Like all other rulers of small states, Vespasiano must have found it extremely difficult to take an effective holiday. He could not go ten miles in any direction without coming to a frontier. Within his dominions it was impossible to have a change of air. Wisely, therefore, he decided to concentrate his magnificences. He built his Balmoral within five minutes’ walk of his Buckingham Palace.",

Other Rally cars see us taking off on this new route and elect to follow us. This is one of those aspects of group behavior that I find fascinating. The people behind have no idea whether the car in front is going the right way or not. They’re all just looking for relief from the responsibility of having to understand the route book correctly on their own. Merely by the fact that we’ve made a choice, any choice, they’re willing to go the way we go. Though I’m about to yell back at them, “We don’t know where we’re going,” I decide instead to let them come. Roxanne’s earned her chance to lead.",

The forest shapes of great trees rose around him, he could hear no bird-song now, even his own feet on the path were soundless, but he always thought he heard the sound of someone walking in the wood before him. He stopped and listened: the steps were muffled, softly thunderous; they seemed so near that he thought that he must catch up with the one he followed in another second, and then they seemed immensely far away, receding in the dark mystery of that gloomy wood. And again he stopped and listened, the footsteps faded, vanished, he shouted, no one answered. And suddenly he knew that he had taken the wrong path, that he was lost. And in his heart there was an immense and quiet sadness, and the dark light of the enormous wood was all around him; no birds sang.",

In those days he had none of the brittle manner and pompous assurance that were to characterise him later, after he had risen to greatness. His hair, which was afterwards to turn a dead and lifeless sandy colour, had glints of gold in it then, his cheeks were full and rosy, he had a bright and smiling face, and it was always briskly and cheerfully--\"Good morning, Mr. Joyner!\" or \"Good morning, Mr. Shepperton!\"--when a customer came in. He was friendly, helpful, courteous, eager to please, and withal businesslike and knowing. He also dressed neatly and was known to be supporting his mother. All these things made people like him and respect him. They wanted to see him succeed. For Jarvis Riggs was a living vindication of an American legend--that of the poor boy who profits from the hardships of his early life and \"makes good\".

Many of the valleys appear at first to be empty: dry hills whose pale rocks are scattered like lumps of feta cheese amongst the scrub-gorse. But as you wind your way down the slopes, under the weak light of a winter sky, forms begin to take shape: the stone roof of a steading hidden by a small cypress grove, the domes of an abandoned caravanserai, the minaret of a ruined mosque, the gently rolling slopes topped by newly harvested olive groves. It is a familiar Mediterranean picture; the same carefully polled olive slopes form the background to a hundred Tuscan paintings, and nearly a millennium before that, to the landscape mosaics of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus.",

I know I had\nnothing to do with Jevons's melancholy. The fat proprietor and his wife\n(who smiled at us by way of encouragement in our passages to and fro\nbefore their bureau), these thralls of Jevons's odd fascination, had\nconfided to me that he had been much worse the day before I came. The\npoor gentleman could neither eat nor sleep; other guests in the hotel had\ncome upon him wandering by himself at strange hours on the quays.

Then I stepped over to the landing gear, the thick posts that hold up the front of a trailer when no truck supports it. I pulled out the handle that rests alongside the trailer when the rig moves down the road. Clicking the mechanism into place, I spun the handle in a circle about forty times until the posts and their square footrests gradually lifted from the ground far enough to drive without scraping them against the pavement.",

A shower fell with an abrupt whispering sound all round the boat, and Decoud took off his hat, and, letting his head get wet, felt greatly refreshed. Presently a steady little draught of air caressed his cheek. The lighter began to move, but the shower distanced it. The drops ceased to fall upon his head and hands, the whispering died out in the distance. Nostromo emitted a grunt of satisfaction, and grasping the tiller, chirruped softly, as sailors do, to encourage the wind. Never for the last three days had Decoud felt less the need for what the Capataz would call desperation.",
