Those people have really increased the voltage of the fence.” If the message was to me, then it was, “You bastard. That hurt!” In any case, after she communicated her message, she turned and walked back into the bush.",

The host, an eager Egyptian man in a black, button-up shirt and apron, showed us to a table near the windows. The lights were off, and the bright sun illuminated the dining room through large windows and a set of French doors. The black-and-white tiled floor sparkled in the sunlight, and the off-white walls were sparingly decorated with photographs of famed actors. The area by the front door was filled with a sectional sofa and two matching chairs around a coffee table; a smoking lounge of sorts. Two mature British women sat there and talked at an older Egyptian fellow. He listened patiently, but rarely spoke, while the three of them chain-smoked. The rest of the dining room was filled with a half dozen tables covered in red and black table clothes, and a few coolers with bottled drinks lined the wall. Other than the cigarette smoke, it was a very charming restaurant. What we didn’t know, and really couldn’t know, was that while we walked around Luxor that day, there had been another series of rolling brown outs, and the restaurant still had no power when we sat down.",

The Englishman in the jungle, with his dinner jacket—that proverbial figure—had nothing on them. The mining men weren't in dinner jackets, but they had put on white coats and neckties, and the meal moved solemnly on and on. Mr. de Blank led the conversation along stilted lines—the weather, the Depression, European royalty. Mr. Vandevell listened, assenting where assent was needed. The talk was so slow that between sentences one could hear noises from outside, the singing and laughing in the African quarter. But I listened to none of it—neither to Mr. de Blank nor to the merriment out-of-doors. I was concentrating on the food. Each time the servant appeared with a fresh course, I held my breath for fear he might drop the dish before it was served. Except in my dreams, I had forgotten food was like this, juicy and savory; I had forgotten that white people really ate anything besides dry chicken and drier rice. My whole being was obsessed with the delightful sensation of eating.",

It was not anybody’s room, and the faint scent of cheap cosmetics and the few feminine objects and the other evidences of crude and hopeless efforts to feminise it but added to its anonymity, giving it that dead and stereotyped transience of rooms in assignation houses. The bed had not been disturbed. On the floor lay a soiled undergarment of cheap silk a little too pink, from a half open bureau drawer dangled a single stocking. The window was open. A pear tree grew there, close against the house. It was in bloom and the branches scraped and rasped against the house and the myriad air, driving in the window, brought into the room the forlorn scent of the blossoms.",

The small airport buildings, drably utilitarian, seemed much preferable to the Rich World’s equivalents. But rumour had it that Singaporean ‘aid’ was soon to be invested in Wattay’s ‘development’. Why? An airport waiting area only needs check-in desks, chairs and lavatories. Wattay also had a grubby little restaurant serving breakfast (noodle soup) at dawn.",

Carmela pokes her head out of the curtained opening to give directions, in Italian and English, to tourists whose flagging footsteps she is alert to hear; Carmela is forty-four, and her son Marco is four—she issues many instructions to Marco, too—and with what is left of her attention, she snips my hair. I have searched for years in New York for a hairdresser I could bully as effectively as hairdressers bully me, and now I am being bullied in Venice by Carmela, whose hair—Anna Magnani, circa 1945—is exactly what I would like mine not to look like. She says she wants me to look moderna. After the brushing and the teasing and the gelling I grow drowsy under the hair dryer; I jerk awake when I remember that I have missed making the Stations of the Cross. My hair is black. It is not supposed to be black. . . . My concierge, to whom in my tardy zeal to join the processional I apply, tells me that he is “not informated” on these matters. Then he asks me if I am Irish. Then he asks me if I have a brother who is a priest, a sister who is a nun. These questions disturb me. He cannot take his eyes off my hair; perhaps he thinks I have had it colored black in honor of the most solemn day of the liturgical year, which I have spent—to ridiculous effect—with Carmela's brushes and gels.",

But the warm welcome was mostly a measure of the town’s isolation; Mompox knew little of the political intrigues and twisted betrayals that had determined his fate and that of La Gran Colombia. Many momposinos, Bolívar discovered, did not know that he’d been forced from office and no longer served as their president. Those who had betrayed him now held the reins of power in Bogotá. While he had been lost on the river, his enemies had destroyed his legacy. La Gran Colombia had broken into fragments, with Venezuela, Ecuador, and Colombia formally proclaiming independence. In the streets, they were burning his effigy and cursing the Bolívar name. Once revered as liberator, now reviled as oppressor, he understood that his betrayal was complete. They pushed on for the sea, leaving the sons of America, as Bolívar wrote, free to destroy each other. His words were prophetic. After fourteen days on the river, they disembarked at Barranca Nueva, where a dusty track carried them by mule to the coast and, ultimately, Cartagena. A letter awaited, and Bolívar learned that an assassin had killed his favorite general, Sucre, the soldier he loved as a son. Now there was nothing left for him in life but death.",

Wandering ships of the far-flung fleet might sail in from Trincomalee, from Singapore, from Sydney; often foreign warships came too, and were ceremonially welcomed by the Victor Emmanuel whatever the current state of diplomatic relations.",

Here Dr Haslem – a remarkable woman who has been running this hospital for the past thirty years – told us that Juliet could return to Dharamsala on the following day, if she avoided overwork for another week. (It was, I noted, accepted that she would have to overwork once her convalescence had ended.) Then Juliet joined us; she looked pale and tired, but was obviously determined to persuade all concerned that she was again in perfect health. When we had been introduced Jill explained that I was coming to Dharamsala to work under her. I had been slightly apprehensive about this moment, in view of my total ignorance of medicine, but Juliet’s welcome at once reassured me.",

Also their food. They give some official parties where plainly they are unhappy; but what they do is stick together, always. Hardly seen by other European residents. No Americans in Cameroun except them, and I think no U.S. business interests. The English diplomatic staff who wind up affairs of British Cameroun are two people.

I noticed the bewildered stare of locals who, without doubt, had never before seen such an errant car—in this archetypal city of bicycles. As always happens in such situations, not one but a group of Dutch policemen (who were busy giving other cars parking tickets) witnessed the last phase of my incredible feat. One of them approached the car and, after seeing my foreign license plates, gave me a big smile and said: “I see you come from far away!” We then started talking about my travels as well as my impressions of Amsterdam. After a couple of minutes of friendly and warm conversation, and before the policeman addressed the issue himself, I told him I knew that I was illegally parked, but that I was waiting for my friend to pick up our laundry, and that it wouldn’t take long. He smiled and said, “No problem. Take your time, but don’t stay here all day!” No ticket, no arguments, no stress. Not even a single reference to my several traffic violations earlier. Just human understanding, a warm smile, connection, and caring.",

The heavily outnumbered away fans made their own impressive racket on the other side of the glass screen. In the stands below us, Feyenoord fans began working themselves up for kick-off, waving red-and-white scarves in the air. The man next to me finished his stroopwafel and joined in a lusty rendition of Queen’s ‘We Will Rock You’ with adapted Dutch lyrics that I couldn’t decipher over the din of the crowd.

Upon the glazed surface a highlight lay. He shifted the photograph until the face came clear. He stood before it, looking at the sweet, inscrutable face which looked in turn at something just beyond his shoulder, out of the dead cardboard. He was thinking of the grape arbor in Kinston, of summer twilight and the murmur of voices darkening into silence as he approached, who meant them, her, no harm; who meant her less than harm, good God; darkening into the pale whisper of her white dress, of the delicate and urgent mammalian whisper of that curious small flesh which he had not begot and in which appeared to be vatted delicately some seething sympathy with the blossoming grape.",

I would turn up in mid-term: once, at our cottage at Dodford, a tiny thatched village under a steep holt full of foxgloves (and, indeed, full of foxes) with a brook for its one street, where she was simultaneously writing plays and, though hard up, learning to fly a Moth biplane at an aerodrome forty miles away; once, at Primrose Hill Studios near Regent’s Park, within earshot of the lions in the Zoo at night, where she had persuaded Arthur Rackham, a neighbour in that cloister, to paint amazing scenes – navigable birdsnests in a gale-wind, hobgoblin transactions under extruding roots and mice drinking out of acorns – all over an inside door; and more than once at 213 Piccadilly, which we moved to later, where a breakneck stair climbed to a marvellous Aladdin’s cave of a flat overlooking long chains of street-lamps and the acrobatic sky-signs of the Circus. I would be hangdog on the doormat, flanked by a master with a depressing tale to unfold. Though upset, my mother was gifted with too much imagination and humour to let gloom settle for long. Nevertheless, these reverses filled me for the time being with suicidal despair.",

I lie on my belly on the edge of the dune, back to the wind, and study the world of the flowers from ground level, as a snake might see it. From below the flowers of the penstemon look like flying pennants; the sunflowers shake and creak from thick green hairy stalks that look, from a snake’s viewpoint, like the trunks of trees.",

He plodded onward, trying always to keep the dark outline of cliffs and shoreline on his left. At least that told him he was heading north. Hours passed and he found himself plowing through deep, wet snow. He squinted through searing eye pain and thought he could see the dim outline of a cape, a dark promontory. Cape Waring? The soles of his feet alternately burned and went numb, and he feared he’d frozen them badly.",

Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away.

Inside I was a mixture of emotions and excitement—feeling like I had just stepped off a precipice and was flying through the air unsupported.

According to a legend dating back to the eighteenth century, a band of shipwrecked Neapolitan sailors had carved this small church out of a sandstone grotto in homage to the Madonna of Piedigrotta for having saved their lives. A long staircase leads down to the church from the road above. Sitting directly along the water on a narrow strip of beach, the main entrance has been given a stone façade, while the sides still have the natural exterior—a cave-like appearance with twentieth-century iron bars over the bare window openings. Stepping inside, I was struck with a primitive mysticism as well as by the dampness expected of such a location.",

Italy seems endlessly alluring to me—why not, at this point, consider the opening of The Divine Comedy: What must one do in order to grow? Better to remember my father, the son of my very literal-minded, penny-pinching grandfather. “The family motto,” he’d say, “is ‘Packing and Unpacking.’ ” And also, “If you can’t go first class, don’t go at all.”",
