The day’s activities had coated me with sweat and dust but, alas, Nairobi was then drought-stricken; only the guest-house kitchen had water, drawn from some distant source by two donkeys.

    "target_paragraph": "A grizzly, no slower than a racing horse, is about half again as fast as the fastest human being. Watching the great mound of weight in the blueberries, with a fifty-five-inch waist and a neck more than thirty inches around, I had difficulty imagining that he could move with such speed, but I believed it, and was without impulse to test the proposition. Fortunately, a light southerly wind was coming up the Salmon valley. On its way to us, it passed the bear. The wind was relieving, coming into our faces, for had it been moving the other way the bear would not have been placidly grazing. There is an old adage that when a pine needle drops in the forest the eagle will see it fall; the deer will hear it when it hits the ground; the bear will smell it. If the boar grizzly were to catch our scent, he might stand on his hind legs, the better to try to see. Although he could hear well and had an extraordinary sense of smell, his eyesight was not much better than what was required to see a blueberry inches away. For this reason, a grizzly stands and squints, attempting to bring the middle distance into focus, and the gesture is often misunderstood as a sign of anger and forthcoming attack. If the bear were getting ready to attack, he would be on four feet, head low, ears cocked, the hair above his hump muscle standing on end. As if that message were not clear enough, he would also chop his jaws. His teeth would make a sound that would carry like the ringing of an axe.",

Nor did anyone appear, or make the slightest sound, as we walked along the narrow paths between the compound stockades: but all the time I was aware of being watched from every side.",

Their village lies well west of the Indus, their luxurious, brand-new city-house stands on a hilltop, in the shadow of an old fortified dwelling. From its flat roof we looked down on level farmland, and the evergreen trees of the National Park, and a wide stretch of reddish, fissured wasteland which daily becomes more fissured as earth is removed for making bricks. At the end of a November which had provided no winter rains the land looked ominously parched, yet our friends’ new garden was an exuberant, improbable dazzle of colour. Like most peoples of Central Asian stock, the Pathans are ardent gardeners: an unexpected and disarming trait in a race of warrior tribesmen. Equally unexpected is their interest in poetry, though even today the majority are illiterate. Pushtu is a rich, flexible language and over the past three or four centuries almost every tribe has produced a major poet, whose descendants or followers are still highly regarded.",

Her test was that when she was away from him she forgot him and had affairs with other boys. Warren found this discouraging, especially as Marjorie had been making little trips all summer, and for the first two or three days after each arrival home he saw great heaps of mail on the Harveys' hall table addressed to her in various masculine handwritings. To make matters worse, all during the month of August she had been visited by her cousin Bernice from Eau Claire, and it seemed impossible to see her alone. It was always necessary to hunt round and find some one to take care of Bernice. As August waned this was becoming more and more difficult.",

In fact, I’d been studying photos and information for months. It was the Kozma Street Cemetery. It had to be. This was to be one of my first stops, with the Cemetery List.

An intelligent young man, he has been grievously disillusioned by listening to daily Lima gossip about government mismanagement and corruption. He informed us that ninety nine per cent of Peru’s wealth is owned by one per cent of the population: an exaggeration horribly near the truth. I asked if he had ever considered joining a political movement to help clean up the scene. He shrugged. ‘There is no place in politics for an honest man. I was sad when my job went because I would have got on and made nice money for my children’ – he kissed his elder son’s head. ‘But maybe it is better for them to grow up in the sierra where people are honest. It is another world here. No one will trick you. And like Maria said, we have just enough food if we have no big drought. And we will try to have no more children, so these two can have what there is. But here it is not easy to get medicines for that.’",

Then they slapped gigantic ONLY TOGETHER! stickers on the thousands of billboards, banners, and posters that featured the presidential hopeful and mayor-elect. Finally, they beefed up their scare tactics, running documentaries of Communist atrocities back-to-back on the television networks. The man of the hour, however, was nowhere to be seen. Yeltsin’s aides contended he had a cold and was tired; the press suspected another heart attack (which turned out to be true). Regardless, Yeltsin didn’t give the media that boosted him into office so much as a press statement when he won the July runoff by fourteen points. The oligarchs who made his victory possible were paid in kind with even larger media holdings and privatization deals for refineries, oil wells, and factories, but not a word of thanks was uttered to the voters who elected him to office.",

In any case, I knew exactly what would be up there—low lighting, a reception area with a padded bar, twangy Asian music, tables covered with glasses of lager and stainless-steel plate warmers. I couldn’t face it. In the end, I engaged in a desperate session of eenie meenie minie mo on a street corner and opted for an Indian.

Long-pig is the Polynesian euphemism for human flesh; and these descendants of man-eaters, a king's son at their head, brought in the pigs to table as of old their grandfathers had brought in their slain enemies. Every now and then the procession halted in order that the bearers should have every advantage in uttering particularly ferocious shouts of victory, of contempt for their enemies, and of gustatory desire. So Melville, two generations ago, witnessed the bodies of slain Happar warriors, wrapped in palm-leaves, carried to banquet at the Ti. At another time, at the Ti, he \"observed a curiously carved vessel of wood,\" and on looking into it his eyes \"fell upon the disordered members of a human skeleton, the bones still fresh with moisture, and with particles of flesh clinging to them here and there.\"",

Bucharest seems not to be feeling its fair share of post-revolutionary euphoria. Too many people look trapped in their own day-to-day miseries, plus perhaps personal grieving for people dead or injured – and/or acute anxiety about the future. Yet many others are in a political fever, or as though drunk on Freedom of Speech. Up and down the wide boulevards, or in Metro stations or shop queues, strangers suddenly form groups to debate – loudly – what should or should not be done, and by whom and how and where and when: with ‘when’ often the most crucial issue. Riveting though confusing for me, hearing so many differing views vigorously expressed. English-speaking students always appear, eager to translate. These groups, sometimes swelling to small crowds, are mixed: all sorts and ages and both sexes. Four more people have begged me to send them a ‘book about democracy’. Among the youngsters, especially, there’s a healthy apprehension about this country’s having suddenly been pushed off, in a frail vessel, onto a rough political sea – and without a compass.",

Some Cuban historians argue that the local troops didn’t need help; others regard this as an open question no longer worth debating. In any event, having delivered the coup de grâce, the invaders ignored Cuba’s military and civilian leaders, made their own arrangements with the Spaniards and presented themselves to the world as victors entitled to set up a military dictatorship. During the next four years Washington’s Men in Havana controlled Cuba’s political scene. Their puppet-in-chief was Thomas Estrada Palma, lately resident in the US where he hobnobbed with agents of the administration particularly interested in Cuba’s economic future. Estrada led the constituent assembly, elected in December 1900 to draft a new constitution and undisguisedly a Washington creation, like its twenty-first-century equivalents in Kabul and Baghdad. Six months later the assembly members voted (by fifteen to fourteen) to include the infamous Platt Amendment as an annex to their embryonic constitution – an Amendment already incorporated into US law on 2 March 1901, before the Cuban vote.",

This was the last of Lake Victoria’s surrounding lushness and soon I was in another world, crossing a flat fawn plain, victimised by drought, where withered maize rustled on every side, the few cattle were mere sacks of bones and only Euphorbia candelabra and feral sisal plants flourished.

Abroad, we are not ourselves; and as the normal and the novel are transposed, the very things that we might shun at home are touched with the glamour of the exotic. I had never seen, or wished to see, a Burt Reynolds movie until I found myself stuck in a miserable guesthouse in Bandar Sari Begawan; I had never been to a Dunkin’ Donuts parlor until I decided to treat myself after a hard day’s work in Bangkok. I enjoyed my first ever Yorkie bar in Surabaya (and my second there too, a few minutes later). And my first experience of the Emmy Awards came in the darkened lobby of a run-down hotel in Singapore, where the ceremonies were annotated, with beery profanities, by a gang of tattooed European and Australian sailors who broke off from their lusty commentary only when a French or Filipina trollop drifted barefoot through the room and out into the monsoony night.",

The act of chart-reading, even more than the act of map-reading, is part data-collection and part occultism.
