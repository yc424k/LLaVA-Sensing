Snow kept falling. “Hey bear,” I sang out when I started walking again. Hey bear, hey, I saw you, brown bear in a white world, so big how can you be so graceful, so close to me, so far away?",

We hadn’t noticed them, parked as they were, down the block, in the shade, but they noticed us. They drove their carriages at us and shouted over each other: Where you go next? Hey, mister! You know how much? Please, mister, ten pounds to start my day. The market is this way. The horses were emaciated and fatigued and their fur threadbare. The carriages they hauled looked no better. The seats – leather and velvet over a slim cushion – were tattered and patched and looked especially uncomfortable. The sight filled me with sympathy and disgust, and I wished I had never seen the poor animals or their drivers. “La, shokrun, la, shokrun,” I called, but the drivers wouldn’t hear me. They were desperate for business, and, in a tourist city with no tourists, Teresa and I were the only prospects.",

Around this water-hole were stretches of stone walls, high up on the banks. I suspected they were Aboriginal hunting blinds, perhaps thousands of years old. The hunters would have waited patiently behind these walls, upwind of the animals coming down to drink, then leapt out with their spears. They would have kept the hole clean in former years. Now, with none of them left to maintain and take care of this potentially beautiful watering place, even my camels turned their noses up at it. It was a horrible sewer and it smelt of death and decay. I made sure the camels had enough to drink from my drums that night before letting them go, just in case. Luckily, it was too cold for them to want to wallow in it.",

    "target_paragraph": "Ibn Saud is now barely forty, though he looks some years older. He is a man of splendid physique, standing well over six feet, and carrying himself with the air of one accustomed to command. Though he is more massively built than the typical nomad sheikh, he has the characteristics of the well-bred Arab, the strongly marked aquiline profile, full-fleshed nostrils, prominent lips and long, narrow chin, accentuated by a pointed beard. His hands are fine, with slender fingers, a trait almost universal among the tribes of pure Arab blood, and, in spite of his great height and breadth of shoulder, he conveys the impression, common enough in the desert, of an indefinable lassitude, not individual but racial, the secular weariness of an ancient and self-contained people, which has made heavy drafts on its vital forces, and borrowed little from beyond its own Forbidding frontiers. His deliberate movements, his slow, sweet smile, and the contemplative glance of his heavy-lidded eyes, though they add to his dignity and charm, do not accord with the Western conception of a vigorous personality. Nevertheless, report credits him with powers of physical endurance rare even in hard-bitten Arabia. Among men bred in the camel-saddle, he is said to have few rivals as a tireless rider. As a leader of irregular forces he is of proved daring, and he combines with his qualities as a soldier that grasp of statecraft which is yet more highly prized by the tribesmen. To be ‘a statesman’ is, perhaps, their final word of commendation.",

Within a year, it had shed its skin: the barley, dependent upon human intervention to survive, did not return. Since then, a changing cast of species has paraded through, as part of a process so fast as to make unrecognizable entire landscapes within a few short years, yet so slow as to be undetectable to the human eye. The plants shift in their seats, trade places, multiply, and disappearbut only when we are not looking. To stand in the field and consider its progress is to confront the eerie sensation of having been elected the unwitting judge of a game of musical statues; the trees and plants frozen in comic poses, their riffling leaves giving them as effectively away as the shallow breath of the stilled but living body.",

Then he would be digging again before he had actually had time to rest; this until dawn began and Ratliff and Bookwright stood over him in the wan light, arguing with him. “We got to quit,” Ratliff said. “It’s already light enough for folks to see us.” Armstid didn’t pause.",

A doctor was got from the nearest town, and I went across to hear what he ordered. He ordered bottles at regular intervals instead of the unbroken series it had been having, and fresh air. He could find nothing the matter with it, except unusual weakness. He asked if it always perspired as it was doing then, and himself took off the topmost bag of feathers.

The Pacific Club, apparently unmoved by the fact that Hawaii’s first U.S. representative and one of its first two senators were Asian American (both were also distinguished veterans of World War II; one of them, Daniel Inouye, had lost an arm), still formally banned Asian Americans from membership. This sort of bald discrimination wasn’t un-American—legal segregation was still in force in much of the country—but it was badly out of date in Hawaii. Even the low-rent haole kids in the In Crowd were more enlightened. They saw that my friends were cool guys—particularly, I think, Glenn—and, at least for gang purposes, just let the race thing go.

While he was away for the summer, his wife moved with their two small children onto his parents’ farm near Donovan, Illinois. In late April, a tornado struck near Donovan, killing seventy-five people. Among the victims were Rice’s wife, children, mother, and two sisters. Rice’s father, himself seriously injured, was found wandering in shock with one of the dead children in his arms; he died nine days later in the hospital. So, at a stroke, Rice lost his entire family. Dazed with grief, Rice drifted around America working at odd jobs. Eventually he enlisted in the navy. While playing for a navy team his remarkable talents became apparent. Clark Griffith, owner of the Washington Senators, somehow heard of this, invited him for a trial, and was impressed enough to sign him. Rice joined the Senators and in his thirties became one of the finest players in baseball. No one anywhere knew of his personal tragedy. It didn’t become public until 1963, when he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.",

The great white rollers, whiter by contrast with the dark deep water, come into the gulch just where we forded the river, and from the ford a passable road made for hauling sugar ascends to the house. The air is something absolutely delicious; and the murmur of the rollers and the deep boom of the cascades are very soothing There is little rise or fall in the cadence of the surf anywhere on the windward coast, but one even sound, loud or soft, like that made by a train in a tunnel.",

In the comfort and safety of the museum, Teresa and I quickly drifted apart. I adored the scale models scattered throughout the museum, while Teresa adored them and everything else. I first admired a topographical model of the Nile. It depicted the ancient cities of Upper Egypt and Nubia, two lands with a deep and overlapping history. The model, about twenty feet long and five or six feet wide, sat upon the floor, surrounded by a low glass wall. A handful of small sculptures on one end represented the pyramids at Giza and Saqqara, but the real magic lay a few feet upriver. Here were dozens of tiny sculptures that represented megalithic structures around Luxor and Aswan, the gateway between ancient Nubia and Egypt. I stared at the model for quite awhile. I walked its perimeter and inspected the fine details from several angles. Although I was surrounded by ancient artifacts, the piece I admired most was that modern scale model of the Nile Valley. I forced myself to move along.",

She kept the girls quiet when Madame was giving a lesson. The vulgarity of her hips repelled Alabama but they were good friends. It was with Arienne that she sat in the cafe under the Olympia after their lessons and drank the daily Cap Corse with seltzer. Arienne took her backstage at the Opera where the dancer was well-respected, and Arienne came to lunch with Alabama. David hated her guts because she tried to give him moral lectures about his opinions and his drinking, but she was not bourgeoise: she was gamine, full of strident jokes about firemen and soldiers, and Montmartre songs about priests and peasants and cuckolds. She was almost an elf, but her stockings were always wrinkled and she talked in sermons.",

The alleys were deserted but from the far side I could hear other noises behind the volleys of shot: clapping, drumming, and singing. Intrigued, I followed the sound. Passing under an intricately carved lintel, I peered into the courtyard beyond. Women and children dressed in coloured silks were dancing around a smoking wood fire, while their menfolk lined the walls howling, and occasionally letting off their guns. I had interrupted a Gujar shin, the pre-Islamic animist ceremonies still known to take place, but rarely witnessed by Westerners. I watched for all of ten seconds. One of the women screamed and pointed in my direction. Immediately the singing stopped and the women fled inside a hut. The men jumped up from the ground and came towards me with pointed guns. I could not run away so instead I stepped towards them, trying to appear unflustered. I extended my hand, lamely indicating friendship. No one shook it. I was led outside at gunpoint, and escorted up to a flat roof where there stood a single charpoy. The Gujars motioned that I should sit. They stood around me, guns still pointed, scowling. I had wrecked their party and Gujars, it seemed, were not of a forgiving nature. They were tall, thick-bearded and heavily-built. They wore Palestinian keffiyeh rather than turbans, and their charwal chemise were of a different, tighter fit than any others I had seen in Pakistan. One man stuck out from the crowd. His face – vaguely Germanic, I thought – was flat and skull-like. He had cold blue eyes and huge hands. He wore an Afghan chapatti-cap and you could see that he was either bald or shaven-headed.",

For my thirteenth birthday, I asked for a Chinese I Ching set containing all the items necessary for tapping into the powers of this chance-based system of belief. It begins with flipping coins to determine whether or not you draw a solid line or a broken line. A solid line represents lightness, while a broken line represents darkness, and these lines, stacked on top of each other in groups of six, create a unique hexagram that can be interpreted to give answers to big questions. A gesture as simple as a flip of a coin determines your dark or light lines and, ultimately, your future, and because your stacks will almost always have pairings of both, you end up with a combination of good and bad. Light and dark pairings can never be separated, because shadow cannot exist without light, male without female—these contrary forces hold the cosmos together, it’s said.",

Even with Varuna’s engine up to full revolutions, the current was so strong that it took nearly twenty minutes to cover the 500-foot-long pass. The evening wind had picked up, too, and I motored against it in the dwindling light to where Kriez was anchored, protected from the ocean swell behind a reef. It was too late to navigate our way through the coral heads to a safer anchorage, so we decided to do it early the next morning, when the sun would be at our backs. Otherwise, the glare of the sun in front would obscure proper visibility through the water, and the first hint that a reef was there would come when we heard it crunching against the boat’s hull. Early, before the next morning’s calm had a chance to be taken over by the trades, we tied Varuna behind the larger boat and towed her around the coral heads to an anchorage in the lee of the island.",

Then a man addressed us in English, asking the standard set of Balti questions – ‘Where is your city? What is your age? How much you pay for horse?’ When we accepted his invitation to drink tea a door was opened in the high stone wall beside the path and we followed a shy girl along a dark, wide passage – evidently a stable – from which led a boulder-stairway of shallow steps, specially constructed for cattle. The roof was divided into two sections and we sat on shaky home-made wooden chairs in the open-air parlour under a chenar, while a yak and three dzo gazed disbelievingly at us through a decrepit wall of woven willow-wands. From a higher roof – that of the kitchen and bedrooms, which led off the ‘parlour’ roof – sundry tiny white and brown sheep, and long-haired grey goats, peered down at us in comical astonishment. A fine cock and his harem flew to and fro – Balti poultry are great fliers – and the fascinated women of the family, themselves looking not unlike roosting hens, squatted in a row on a single tree-trunk ‘bridge’ linking two roofs; had they toppled backwards they would have fallen twenty feet.",

Some of the Consulate-General windows are eerily mirror-glassed, to prevent spying visual or electronic, and official American attitudes in the Crown Colony have often been similarly opaque. As recently as 1986 a senior American consular official was heard to tell a visiting bigwig from New York that there, right there in that Consulate-General, was where Hong Kong was really run. If the American financial interest in the territory is enormous, and growing fast, the Americans have also had powerful historical, political and ideological stakes in the place.",

There are two venerable missionaries, \"Father Coan\" and \"Father Lyman,\" the former pastor of a large native congregation, which, though much shrunk, is not only self-sustaining, but contributes $1200 a year to foreign missions, and the latter, though very old and frail, the indefatigable head of an industrial school for native young men. Their houses combine the trimness of New England, with the luxuriance of the tropics; they are cool retreats, embowered among bread-fruit, tamarind, and bamboo, through whose graceful leafage the blue waters of the bay are visible. Innumerable exotics are domesticated round these fair homesteads. Two of \"Father Lyman's\" sons are influential residents, one being the Lieutenant-Governor of the island. Other sons of former missionaries are settled here in business, and there are a few strangers who have been attracted hither. Dr. Wetmore, formerly of the mission, is a typical New Englander of the old orthodox school. It is pleasant to see him brighten into almost youthful enthusiasm on the subject of Hawaiian ferns. My host, a genial, social, intelligent American, is sheriff of Hawaii, postmaster, &c., and with his charming wife (a missionary's daughter), and some friends who live with them, make their large house a centre of kindliness, friendliness, and hospitality.",
