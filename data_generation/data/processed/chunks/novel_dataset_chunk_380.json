This time, he would follow “the most historic highway in South America, the old trade route between Lima, Potosi, and Buenos Aires.” Bolivar had used the route during some of his later military campaigns. Beyond that, it seems that Bingham just wanted to have a good look around.",

He was trying to encourage them to take a grip on his stick. An adult tarantula – the mother? the father? who knew? – also angrily appeared out of the hole.

    "target_paragraph": "We were on the move again next morning, driving to the Masai Mara where we would be staying in a tented camp for our ‘Out of Africa’ experience.\nIt was still dark when we left at 5.30am. The only noise, apart from the low murmurs of the porters taking our bags to the vehicles, was the chirping of the crickets and the song of the birds attracted by the lights. In the black sky, amongst the stars I saw a brilliant red glow that could only be the planet Mars. We were astonished at how clear and red it was, and beckoned all our fellow travellers to come and look. We all clustered around, pointing and inviting more and more people to come and see this extraordinary sight.\nOne of the porters stopped to ask what we are looking at.\n‘Mars!’ we told him, pointing at the red glow.\nHe gazed up into the sky. ‘That is the light on top of a telecommunications mast,’ he said, walking away, his shoulders jiggling and his head shaking as he chuckled to himself at the stupidity of the mzungu.\nIt was another long day drive, and we were riding with Dedan. As well as being an excellent guide, he is also political and up to date with current affairs. Every journey with him was an education. He pointed out a vast tract of land belonging to a European which was lying idle, while local Africans owned no land. A bill had been introduced in the Kenyan parliament to restrict the amount of land an individual could own to 25 acres in areas that are particularly fertile, and in less fertile areas, 60 acres. Any acreage over and above that would be bought by the government for distribution to the landless. While it sounded like a noble idea, I was dubious that even if it ever became law it would lead to an equitable distribution of land, as the wealthiest landowners would find ways to circumnavigate the law – easily done by forming a company – and therefore not count as individuals. I wasn’t optimistic.\nWe were heading south towards Narok. The traffic was a mixture of boda bodas, pedestrians, saccos, overloaded dilapidated vehicles with their bumpers scraping the road, wabenzi (people driving expensive cars like Mercedes), motorbikes often carrying several passengers or piled up with goods, bicycles and donkey carts. On the roads beside straggles of grazing sheep, goats, baboons and zebra, vendors offered vegetables, eggs, bottled water. Everywhere there were signs pointing to churches and schools. Kenyans are predominantly Christian and passionate about the importance of education to ensure that their children can progress in a modern world.\nDedan pointed to a dismal collection of buildings beside the road. ‘IDPs,’ he said, as if we should know what an IDP was. As he didn’t volunteer, I had to ask.\n‘IDPs? What is that?’",

She instantly had visions of vergers turning Catherine-wheels down the path, headed by high-stepping curates, followed by a congregation intoxicated by reaction. And never having had cause in her life to be afraid of personal remarks, she took what the children said as so many compliments, except that she rather wished they would keep off her hair. She was sensitive about that since her illness, and not quite sure whether Antoine had got the colour right. He said it was exactly the original colour; but if it was, it didn't seem to go quite so well with her face as it used to. Certainly if it made little Jim think of the yellow crocuses on the lawn, Antoine had got it seriously wrong. She would see him about it the first thing, when she got back on Monday.",

Back at Savuti Camp, night fell quickly, and I headed to the primitive, and now pitch-black shower block.

I was too hot to care, and stood beneath the welcome chill of the cold shower in the total darkness, with my eight-legged companions, reflecting on how close we'd come to disaster that day.",

But this evening, although three complain a little of sore eyes, they seem cheerful enough, taking turns at the telescope and shouting at some na high on the ridge. The Tamangs make wind shelters in the ruins of some herdsmen’s fallen huts, and the Sherpas take the headman into their tent, but the Tarakots are satisfied to hunch like growths among the snow patches, wrapped in old blankets, doing nothing at all to better their condition, despite the prospect of a long night of bitter cold. They have carried no firewood, and must scavenge rice from us, and most are barefoot.",

There he lived withdrawn from the world, attended by the monks and his own servants, and I hardly ever found an opportunity of conversing with him alone. Lobsang Samten lived in a room in the monastery, where I often visited him. We went out frequently with the Dalai Lama on his long walks. He used to visit the neighbouring cloisters on foot and everyone wondered at the speed with which he walked. Nobody could keep up with him. This was the first time he had opportunities for physical exercise and he made full use of them. His energy, moreover, was good for the health of his staff, who had to be in training to keep pace with him. The monks gave up snuff, and the soldiers tobacco and strong drink. In spite of the general depression the religious feasts were regularly observed, but the materials were lacking to reproduce the pomp and ceremony of the Lhasa celebrations. An agreeable interlude was provided by the visit of an Indian savant, who brought the king a genuine relic of the Buddha in a golden urn. On this occasion I took my last and best photo of the Dalai Lama.",

According to Jane, Wayra has never been swimming and, although she can spend hours staring at the reflections, she shows no inclination to go further. Other cats swim. Yuma, Inti, Wara and Yassi, Rupi and Ru . . . They each have access to their own lagoons, or their own private spots on the river that I’ve been told runs around the south of the parque. They swim most days with their volunteers, and they would swim in the wild. I think sometimes that when Wayra’s staring into the water, she’s trying to find her courage. But she’s afraid. I understand this. The bravado, the hissing and growling, they’re her coping mechanisms, just as smiling and being fine is mine. When I step on a stick, she jumps a metre in the air. A puma who’s afraid of her own shadow. Who’s afraid of the wild.",

As Williamson regained his senses, he said he’d arrived there the morning after he left, after walking almost continuously. He’d found the camp when he spotted the Canadian ensign flying at half-mast. He said that the men had moved Mamen and Malloch and buried them properly and flown the flag above their grave to honor them. Williamson was making more sense now, giving more details. He said that the men had killed five seals long ago but were now surviving only on sealskin. He’d told them about Breddy’s death, and how everyone was holding on at Cape Waring. Munro informed him that ice had been heavy all along the south coast and that he did not anticipate any chance for a ship until the end of the month. Williamson said he’d slept for twelve hours and then returned. There was nothing for him there, and little he could do for them. They had no food, but at least they were surviving.",

Barrel-chested, with broad, heavy shoulders, he walked with a slight stoop, letting his arms swing loosely, and they were so long that they dangled almost to the knees, the big hands and spatulate fingers curving deeply in like paws. His head, set down solidly upon a short neck, was carried somewhat forward with a thrusting movement, so that his whole figure had a prowling and half-crouching posture. He looked even shorter than he was, for, although he was an inch or two above the middle height, around five feet nine or ten, his legs were not quite proportionate to the upper part of his body. Moreover, his features were small--somewhat pug-nosed, the eyes set very deep in beneath heavy brows, the forehead rather low, the hair beginning not far above the brows. And when he was agitated or interested in something, he had the trick of peering upward with a kind of packed attentiveness, and this, together with his general posture, the head thrust forward, the body prowling downwards, gave him a distinctly simian appearance. It was easy to see why some of his friends called him Monk.",

The sun rose over a frost-bound Timisoara as we stood in a packed tram, swaying towards the central Piata Huniade. Maria pointed out a huge banner, proudly welcoming people to the ‘First Free City of Rumania’. Then she began to air a complicated hypothesis about the forty mysterious corpses forcibly removed from the city morgue on the night of the 17–18 December by Securitate officers – while the Director in charge of post-mortems, Dr Milan Leonard Dressier, was held at gunpoint. As we walked towards the splendid Opera House – an Austro-Hungarian legacy – Maria paused by a wall-poster display. ‘See this!’ she exclaimed. ‘All is uncertain – listen!’ And she translated a poster which accused Dr Dressier of having collaborated with the Securitate to conceal the number of those killed during the revolution – and which threatened his life.",

They are very wary of me now and are becoming more difficult to catch than the dorados. They don’t have the same sustained speed, but in quick little jerks they can dodge my spear deftly. They flirt just outside of my reach. Jab. Miss. I must two-arm a hit on a dorado, but maybe I can get a quick and penetrating one-arm shot on a trigger. Jab. Jab. Their waving fins taunt me.

Why I expected Alex to be a hot, single, interested, male extreme-sports guide, after so much evidence that this was not going to happen on this trip, is beyond me, but I did. As you would expect, because you are brighter than I, Alex was a beautiful, thirtysomething woman. And instead of meeting me for a beer, like I suggested, she met me at the airport, with my name on a sign, then took me back to her lovely two-bedroom cottage on a flowery hill overlooking the town and the lake.",

And then, for the second time—and once again, so gently, without warning, so slowly—I was weightless, I was airborne.

I told them who would get married and when, how many children each of them would have. Years went by, and what I had predicted came true. Pregnant women used to ask me whether they were carrying boys or girls. I would hold a needle suspended on a thread and concentrate. If the needle swayed to the right, it was a boy.

They would not have to run because their village was too remote. This only meant that he would not see Anulika get married, that he would not hold Nnesinachi in his arms as he had planned. But he would be back soon. The war would last just long enough for the Biafran army to gas the Nigerians to kingdom come.

One resident, Elisabeth de Graaff, later wrote of how the walls of the zoo had been destroyed by bombs, leaving wild animals free to wander the ravaged streets.
