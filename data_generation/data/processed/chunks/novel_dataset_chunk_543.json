(“This is not just any little fashion show to which you can bring a friend,” says an attenuated designer in black to a young woman who, insufficiently haughty, is reduced to angry tears.) Everyone wears self-importance demonstrably. In Krizia's runway arena, it is hot and crowded and strobe lights pierce the din and people fight for seating. Deneuve has been flown in, and God knows who else. One hears photographers speak of their “girls,” so proprietary, so objectifying (my prejudice against photographers is confirmed); one would think the “girls” had no function but to be mute and draped. The “girls” twirl, dance, stride down the runway (pelvic interplay with male photographers), demonstrating the truth of Oscar Wilde's dictum that “the most difficult pose is naturalness.” Clusters of black models appear in electric red, electric green, electric blue. They look like gumdrops on the darkened runway.",

Every now and then she put out a dripping hand and jerked a perambulator up and down for a moment, to calm the shrieks of the baby inside. On a wooden bench at the foot of one of the three beds a very old man sat and blinked at nothing. Crouching in a corner were two small boys of pasty complexion, playing with a guinea-pig and coughing violently. The loveliest little girl I have seen for a very long while lay in the bed nearest the door, quite silent, with her eyes closed and her mouth shut tight, as though she were trying hard to bear something. As I pulled the door open the first thing I saw, right up against it, was this set young face framed in tossed chestnut hair. \"Why, Frauchen,\" I said to the woman at the tub, \"so many of you at home to-day? Are you all ill?\" There was hardly standing room for an extra person, and the room was full of steam.",

Always he was imperturbable, authoritatively assured, on his aesthetic toes. And his progress through that brilliant assemblage was marked by a phosphorescent wake composed of the small nuggets of enlightenment which he dropped casually as he passed. Here it was a little confidential gossip about Sacco and Vanzetti, there a little first-hand information from Wall Street, now a sophisticated jest or so, again an amusing anecdote about what happened only last week to the President, or a little something about Russia, with a shrewd observation on Marxian economy--and to all of this a little Beddoes had been added for good measure. It was all so perfectly informed and so alertly modern that it never for a moment slipped into cliche, but always represented the very latest mode in everything, whether art, letters, politics, or economics. It was a remarkable performance, an inspiring example of what the busy man of affairs can really accomplish if he only applies himself.",

He had heard of my plight through an acquaintance who arrived from Brisbane – a camel-man also who had crossed Central Australia twice with three of his own, the first person to do so since the early days of exploration. We both worked for Sallay during that awful summer. Perhaps it was the intolerable heat in our work-tent, perhaps it was the poisonous snakes that crawled incessantly from under the flaps across the grass floor, perhaps it was the inch-long mosquitoes who bled you during the night until you were anaemic, perhaps it was simply that all people who deal long enough with camels go slightly troppo. But whatever it was, I managed to alienate Dennis too, who earlier on had been so willing to help me, and our squabbles often thudded out into the soggy, broiling air. I couldn’t work out this new capacity I’d acquired for creating enmity in the hearts of men.",

As we gathered for drinks in the warm Berkshire evening, he entranced us all with schoolboy fantasies of the Orient. Working for Swire’s, he began with practiced casualness, he received a free flat, free holidays, free flights on Cathay Pacific. How did he spend his weekends? Oh, usually, he flew off with a few expats to Bangkok for the night life and sometimes, that same night, they went on to Manila; on long weekends, they went to Bali. In the winter, expats went skiing in Japan; in the summer, they took over some forgotten fantasy island in the Philippines. And the food in Asia was terrific, and the weather was amazing. As for the girls, they were ravishing, and compliant, and dreamed of nothing but a British boyfriend! Even the miseries Charles described—dysentery in Kashmir, con men in Phuket, social diseases in Manila—sounded impossibly exotic.",

On these river descents, one seems to be penetrating to the very bowels of the earth, so colossal and overbearing are the surrounding mountains. A jerry-built concrete bridge took us over the Rio Pomabamba for the last time; we all agree that we feel much safer on a well-made tree-trunk bridge. For two hours we were climbing steeply: first on a barren, rocky, thorn-bushy mountain too arid to feed even a goat, then on grassy, more gentle slopes where we passed a ‘quake-stricken village with an abandoned school and two-roomed police-post. Three new ‘quake ravines have severely disrupted the path and we almost went astray again while seeking ways to rejoin it. We brunched on a high, turfy pass, aromatic with herbs and overlooking a line of sparkling, distant snow-peaks. In the perfect stillness, sunny and windless, we could hear from far above the poignant, eternal music of a goatherd’s pipe – to me the most enduring authentic link with the Andes of the Incas.",

He arrived on the now-famous ridge at Machu Picchu, he wrote, “without the slightest expectation of finding anything more interesting than the ruins of two or three stone houses.” In an interview that Bingham gave to The New York Sun just before departing, however, which ran under the headline WILL SEEK LOST CITIES, he told a reporter: “There are current in the country many reports of the existence of ruined cities along the Urubamba River, which reports we hope to run down. Indians frequently bring these reports. Dr. Farabee, who was in charge of the Harvard expedition of four years ago, told me of a rumor, pretty well authenticated, which he had got from Indians, of a big city hidden away on the mountainside above the Urubamba Valley.” Machu Picchu was (and to the present still is) the only major “ruined city” ever found in the Urubamba Valley. “The map I sent you,” Farabee wrote to Bingham in early 1911, “is a composite of many more or less inexact and some fairly exact elements.” Were those elements exact enough to lead Bingham to Machu Picchu? It’s impossible to know.",

Some support was necessary, for she was very stout, and so compressed that the upper part of her body hung considerably in advance of her feet, which could only trip in tiny steps, owing to the tightness of the skirt round her ankles. The dress itself consisted of a small piece of shiny yellow satin, adorned here and there indiscriminately with round shields of blue and green beads made to imitate the hues of a peacock’s breast. On the summit of a frothy castle of hair a purple plume stood erect, while her short neck was encircled by a black velvet ribbon knobbed with gems, and golden bracelets were tightly wedged into the flesh of her fat gloved arms. She had the face of an impertinent but jolly little pig, mottled red under a dusting of powder.",

We walked alignments, flagged the best line (avoid black spruce bog to the north, granite boulders to the south), and when the ground thawed in June, rented a Bobcat from Fairbanks ($400 for forty hours on the meter, delivery included). One week, 350 linear feet, and four hundred yards of gravel later we had a driveway. It peeled off the road over a stick of culvert buried two feet deep and curved its way gently to the chosen house site. We moved some displaced tundra mats, carpeting the fill slopes just as we had on trail projects. Nic came after work one evening to run the Bobcat while Gabe and I worked the hand tools, shoveling in low spots, raking edges. The same steps as for work, only for ourselves, better.",

Soon after, two valleys converged and our track followed a river; wide, fast, muddy-grey, its course marked by low trees. As we went upstream, flocks of raucous parakeets – the first we’ve seen – made emerald streaks against a cloudless blue sky. This was a hot, arid, uninhabited valley with pale grey precipices rising from the river. Looking back, our world seemed to be dominated by a mighty triangular rock-summit and, right up to the base of the triangle, someone had cultivated – on unbelievable slopes – several tiny, brilliant patches of barley. In the Andes Nature never repeats herself. Every turn of a path or valley reveals some original design exceeding the most outré imaginings of the most eccentric architect. When we were again facing the snows of the Cordillera Blanca we turned south, to follow the Rio Puccha to Chavín. On our left rose a sheer rock-wall: thousands of feet high, miles long, flat-topped, flawlessly smooth – one of the most spectacular geological phenomena I’ve ever seen.",

Sea mammal hunters started living at an encampment here about five hundred years ago, several centuries after the toggling point’s invention. On the long, grassy expanse above the seaside gravel, many large skulls of bowhead whales they had killed stood in an unevenly spaced line. Looking along the row from one end of it to the other, I absorbed the wordless impact of the site. In life these creatures would have been forty feet long and weighed fifty tons. The men who lived here pursued them aboard walrus-skin boats in water that was death even to fall into, and killed them with harpoons tipped with ingenious pieces of ivory. Vladimir said no one knew for sure if the skulls had had a ceremonial purpose, or perhaps simply served as stands on which to dry the skin boats and hold them ready for quick launching when whales were seen.",

It was more disconcerting to Ralph to learn that Mrs. Spragg, for once departing from her attitude of passive impartiality, had eagerly abetted her daughter’s move; he had somehow felt that Undine’s desertion of the child had established a kind of mute understanding between himself and his mother-in-law.",

The room paled, the dark outside was shot through with damp and chill, and Wessel, cupping his brain in his hands, bent low over his table, tracing through the pattern of knights and fairies and the harrowing distresses of many girls. There were dragons chortling along the narrow street outside; when the sleepy armorer’s boy began his work at half-past five the heavy clink and clank of plate and linked mail swelled to the echo of a marching cavalcade.\nA fog shut down at the first flare of dawn, and the room was grayish yellow at six when Wessel tiptoed to his cupboard bedchamber and pulled open the door. His guest turned on him a face pale as parchment in which two distraught eyes burned like great red letters. He had drawn a chair close to Wessel’s prie-dieu which he was using as a desk; and on it was an amazing stack of closely written pages. With a long sigh Wessel withdrew and returned to his siren, calling himself fool for not claiming his bed here at dawn.\nThe clump of boots outside, the croaking of old beldames from attic to attic, the dull murmur of morning, unnerved him, and, dozing, he slumped in his chair, his brain, overladen with sound and color, working intolerably over the imagery that stacked it. In this restless dream of his he was one of a thousand groaning bodies crushed near the sun, a helpless bridge for the strong-eyed Apollo. The dream tore at him, scraped along his mind like a ragged knife. When a hot hand touched his shoulder, he awoke with what was nearly a scream to find the fog thick in the room and his guest, a gray ghost of misty stuff, beside him with a pile of paper in his hand.\n“It should be a most intriguing tale, I believe, though it requires some going over. May I ask you to lock it away, and in God’s name let me sleep?”\nHe waited for no answer, but thrust the pile at Wessel, and literally poured himself like stuff from a suddenly inverted bottle upon a couch in the corner; slept, with his breathing regular, but his brow wrinkled in a curious and somewhat uncanny manner.\nWessel yawned sleepily and, glancing at the scrawled, uncertain first page, he began reading aloud very softly:",

He found there “lazy, languid Englishmen in banians and white jackets stretched on the cane chairs” and noted how far the civil station in Singapore stood from the “native town”.",

He whipped out a comb and attempted unsuccessfully to carve a parting into my Grade-5-clipper hair. He also took exception to my posture, and roughly manhandled my jaw into an upward tilt, which he obviously felt gave me a noble bearing. The resultant image was widely described as looking like a particularly camp Russian sailor, and as I was forced to buy a sheet of 24 copies, then unwisely used it for my new passport, it was a photo I came to know all too well.",

The city’s policemen were paid barely $20 a week, and from that they had to buy their own uniforms, so their grievances were real, but their actions alienated public opinion and left Boston at the mercy of lawless elements. For two days, mobs roamed the streets, robbing and intimidating innocent citizens, and looters had a field day. When city authorities failed to assert control, Coolidge, as governor, stepped in. With an unwonted show of forcefulness he called out the State Guard, dismissed the strikers, and hired a new force. “There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time,” he declared?the only occasion in his life, as far as can be told, that he uttered a ringing statement. His action made him a national figure and propelled him on to the nomination for vice president on the Harding ticket the following year.",

Outside the terminal, he was surprised to find not a single beat-up American car like the ones in Havana. For a few days he explored the city, astonished at what he saw. A friend took him to his high-rise apartment near the waterfront in downtown Miami. The rooms dazzled him, but nothing compared to what he saw from the balcony. It was twilight, the lights of the city had come on, and the streets sparkled with a brightness that matched the shining points of light on the water and in the sky. Oscar realized then how far behind Cuba had fallen. Free to explore without any kind of government minder, he gawked at the shelves of the Publix supermarket he was taken to. The sidewalks were so clean he thought they were closed, and nowhere did he come across mounds of trash like the one near his house. He had seen American movies where a man walks into the street, raises his arm, and a taxicab appears, and it was true!",

Bartlett then assisted the ship’s doctor, administering the ether Peary would need for the operation. The skin of his toes had sloughed off almost entirely, the necrotic flesh black and blistered. The doctor amputated eight of his toes. Before long, Peary was up and hobbling around on crutches, eager to start exploring again. Through the whole ordeal, he’d never uttered a word of complaint. Bartlett, deeply impressed by Peary’s toughness, asked him how he managed to stand the pain.",

What the devil can I do but keep on hack-writing?” But even that he did only intermittently. Nevertheless, he held jealously to his pecuniary independence, and, though he frequently accepted the hospitality of the Spears, and of a few other old friends, he was never known to have borrowed a penny of any of them, a fact which Halo Spear’s own brief experience led her to regard as unusual, and almost unaccountable. But then, she thought, there was nothing about George Frenside that wasn’t queer, even to his virtues. . . . Her eyes wandered back to the landscape. It lay before her in the perfect beauty of a June evening: one of those evenings when twilight floats aloft in an air too pure to be penetrated by the density of darkness. What did it all mean, she wondered--that there should be this beauty, so ever-varying, so soul-sufficing, so complete, and face to face with it these people who one and all would gladly have exchanged it for any one of a hundred other things; her mother for money enough to carry them to the end of the year, her father for his New York club and a bridge table, Lorry of course for money too (money was always the burning question in the Spear family), and George Frenside for good talk in a Bohemian restaurant?",

Then she come on down and in about ten seconds here he comes down the stairs with both hands on top of his head, going wump-wump-wump inside like one of these here big dray-horses, and he pawed at the door for about a minute, moaning to himself like the wind in a chimney Minnie says, until she opened the door and left him out.

In their zeal to clear, they have stopped for nothing, not even the wild (what I know as Cherokee) roses. Poppies, wild carnations, some fluffy white flower, and the host of yellow blooming weeds survive only along the terrace edges. The big news is the olives. In March, they planted thirty in the gaps on the terraces, bringing us up to a hundred and fifty trees. Already they’re flowering. We ordered larger trees this year than the ten Ed planted last year; at the rate olives grow, we want to be around to collect a little oil. Beppe and Francesco staked each new tree and stuffed a nest of weeds between the stake and the trunk to prevent chaffing. Ed knew to dig a big hole for each tree but he didn’t know to dig an enormous, deep one; Beppe explained that the new trees need a big polmone, a lung. Around each, they’ve dug to a circumference of about four feet. They also planted two more cherries, to go with the ones Ed planted last spring.",

It was sent as an appeal to an official involved in a federal policy review of America’s ‘Outdoor Recreation Resources’, and would later be published in a collection of Stegner’s essays. In it, Stegner argued that a wild place was worth much more than could ever be revealed by a cost-benefit analysis of its recreational economic value, or its minerals and resources. No, he explained, we need wild places because they remind us of a world beyond the human. Forests, plains, prairies, deserts, mountains: the experience of these landscapes can give people ‘a sense of bigness outside themselves that has now in some way been lost’.",

Needless to say, they would not come near finding him. He thought once that he heard the sound of an airplane, but eventually he realized that it was a chorus of wolves. In his hunger, he tried to kill squirrels. He made a spear, and threw it awkwardly as they jumped and chattered in the spruce boughs. He made a bow and arrow, using a shroud line from his parachute, but when he released the arrow it shot off at angles ridiculously oblique to the screeching, maddening squirrels. There was some rubber involved in the parachute assembly, and he used that to make a slingshot, which was worse than the bow and arrow. When he fell asleep by the fire, he dreamed of milkshakes, dripping beefsteaks, mashed potatoes, and lamb chops, with lamb fat running down his hands. Awake, he kicked aside the snow and found green moss. He put it in his mouth and chewed, and chewed some more, but scarcely swallowed any. Incidentally, he was camped almost exactly where, some twenty-five years later, Ed and Virginia Gelvin would build a cabin from which to trap and hunt.",

    "target_paragraph": "There is in Jefferson a boarding house known as the Beard hotel. It is a rectangular frame building with a double veranda, just off the square, and it is conducted theoretically by a countryman, but in reality by his wife. Beard is a mild, bleached man of indeterminate age and of less than medium size, dressed always in a collarless shirt and a black evil pipe. He also owns the grist mill near the square, and he may be found either at the mill, or on the outskirts of the checker-game in the courthouse yard, or sitting in his stocking feet on the veranda of his hostelry. He is supposed to suffer from some obscure ailment puzzling to physicians, which prevents him exerting himself physically. His wife is a woman in a soiled apron, with straggling, damp grayish hair and an air of spent but indomitable capability. They have one son, a pale, quiet boy of twelve or so, who is always on the monthly honor roll at school; he may be seen on spring mornings schoolward bound with a bouquet of flowers. His rating among his contemporaries is not high.",

With his say said and the mended satchel hanging from his hand, Richard still lingered. She was penned, between his obliterating presence and the figure of Rachel Mary standing close at hand, turned towards the little table busily occupied, but aware; waiting for a voice to sound, her own, or Richard’s, gently, acknowledging and expressing, as it broke the silence fallen with one consent upon the three of them, the wealth of this shared embarrassment.\n‘We shall want any number of nose-bags,’ she breathed, addressing the lamplit wall, half-prepared to see it miraculously open before her.\n‘Thee’ll be tired, Richard, with thee’s journey and all.’\nTurning she beheld the small figure confronting them, perilously propped against the edge of the larger table. Gone to her room after the supper she had stayed up to share in honour of Richard’s return, uneasy, made uneasy by his wandering attention, his silences and random replies, she had come back, ancient and haggard, frail and tottering and determined; to watch and protect.\n‘We’ll need heaps of nose-bags,’ said Richard, so gently that his tone could hardly have carried across the room, and moved nearer, so near that only a few inches divided them as they stood side by side facing the hapless little figure. Flouted. His mother, flouted and defied. Realization, throbbing in the air, keeping every one silent; deepening the golden glow.",

In a dreary barn-sized office men and women sat at metal desks, surrounded by tightly-packed filing cabinets, behind a bisecting counter. They looked pallid and embittered – as would we all, given such a work-place. On the public’s side of the counter the queue occupied sagging plastic-covered settees. Their problems were, it seemed, car-related, and for fifty minutes I watched men (only men) with furrowed brows laboriously filling in multi-paged documents which were then – often after much argument – lavishly rubber-stamped and filed away. How, I wondered, was I going to negotiate those bureaucratic shoals sans interpreter? But in fact the sheaf from Szivarvany, plus model 153–421, needed no verbal input from me. An elderly woman clerk, with glinting purple-copper hair such as one used to see on celluloid dolls, simply indicated where I was to sign another document guaranteeing that I could collect my property ten days hence.",

Half the canoes paddled off to leeward, while we, with the other half, headed to windward a mile and a half, until the end of our line was in touch with the reef. The leader of the drive occupied a canoe midway in our line. He stood erect, a fine figure of an old man, holding a flag in his hand. He directed the taking of positions and the forming of the two lines by blowing on a conch. When all was ready, he waved his flag to the right. With a single splash the throwers in every canoe on that side struck the water with their stones. While they were hauling them back—a matter of a moment, for the stones scarcely sank beneath the surface—the flag waved to the left, and with admirable precision every stone on that side struck the water. So it went, back and forth, right and left; with every wave of the flag a long line of concussion smote the lagoon. At the same time the paddles drove the canoes forward and what was being done in our line was being done in the opposing line of canoes a mile and more away.",

One of these are those first tender days of Spring when lovely girls and women seem suddenly to burst out of the pavements like flowers: all at once the street is peopled with them, walking along with a proud, undulant rhythm of breasts and buttocks and a look of passionate tenderness on their faces. Another season is early Autumn, in October, when the city begins to take on a magnificent flash and sparkle: there are swift whippings of bright wind, a flare of bitter leaves, the smell of frost and harvest in the air; after the enervation of Summer, the place awakens to an electric vitality, the beautiful women have come back from Europe or from the summer resorts, and the air is charged with exultancy and joy.",
