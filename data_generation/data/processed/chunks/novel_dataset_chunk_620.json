We can sit with them and explain to them what the decision is [about],” he said. “The decision is not final and could be reversed.”",

Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.",

    "target_paragraph": "Then, at the base of the western mountains, came a reunion with my old friend the Nam Kay – here not at all like the mild flow happily forded by the toddlers of Kasi. It was in fact a raging torrent, scarcely thirty yards wide but so turbulent one couldn’t estimate its depth. Again I consulted the map; that spidery line continued on the far bank. Walking upstream, I came upon a feat of local engineering. Three slim palm trunks, with twelve-inch spaces between them, had been tied with vine ropes to trees overhanging the river on either side. This contraption, suspended some twenty feet above the water, was approached by climbing frail-looking bamboo stepladders. As I viewed it despairingly, a movement upstream caught my eye. Standing chest-deep in the racing water, a man was fishing with a hand-net. His very beautiful young wife, collecting berries on the bank, had already seen me. She beckoned, then pointed farther upstream to a dry-weather fording point. I would never have guessed that one could safely cross there. Smiling kindly, my guide led me to the precise point of entry, then was fascinated to see me securing my journal, camera, binoculars and money-belt in the rucksack’s waterproof top pocket. The water came well above my waist and I longed for Mr Tang: the umbrella was a poor substitute. That crossing seemed to take for ever; I was too aware of the possible consequences of falling when heavily burdened. On the far side, while reorganizing things, I paused to watch two old women (probably great-grandmothers) fording quickly, supporting each other and cheerfully chatting as they went.",

I took a series of turns that seemed to lead ever farther away from society before finally bumbling into a short street that had a pub on the corner. Fancying a drink and a sit-down, I wandered inside. It was a dark place, and battered, and there were only two other customers, a pair of men sitting side by side at the bar drinking in silence. There was no one behind the bar. I took a stance at the far end of the counter and waited for a bit, but no one came. I drummed my fingers on the counter and puffed my cheeks and made assorted puckery shapes with my lips the way you do when you are waiting. I cleaned my nails with a thumbnail and puffed my cheeks some more, but still no one came. Eventually I noticed one of the men at the bar eyeing me.",

Our connecting flight to Panama City with Copa Airlines was scheduled to depart at 2.15pm. However, we hadn't factored in that our first flight would land at the domestic terminal, and the Panama flight would depart, not surprisingly, from the international terminal. We'd also not factored in a morning of violent electrical storms, which had delayed the arrival of our inbound aircraft, and also now delayed our outbound flight for nearly an hour.",

    "target_paragraph": "As we distributed the goodies, after consultations with staff nurses, it amazed Daisy to hear Anna speaking enough Arabic to be supportive. I always feel uncomfortable doing the Lady Bountiful thing and here the strangers’ reception was mixed. When not too ill to respond to visitors, the children were typical little Palestinians, affectionate and outgoing. In contrast, with Daisy and me most of their carers hovered tensely between superficial deference and veiled hostility. Anna of course was welcomed by all; to each encounter – several quite heartbreaking – she brought an imaginative sort of respectful compassion. Daisy tried to be amiable in Hebrew but the effort was painfully apparent. Walking between wards, I speculated about the possibility of helping a legless five-year-old boy (an IDF cluster bomb) – whereupon Daisy muttered a warning against trusting the lad’s father with money. I could see that she was being genuinely upset by this medical ghetto, but anti-Arab emotions run deep. She questioned Anna about the carers’ status when a nurse invited us into her office for tea.",

Cattle were dropping dead everywhere, horses were bags of bone and air that were now trying to eat spinifex, and there was not a cloud in sight. Glenayle was the furthest station out into the desert, and perhaps it was this very remoteness that made the Wards such a united family. That, and the fact that Henry was an excellent bushman, loved the country, and none of them would have swapped places with a city dweller for all the rain in the world. They took me out mustering while I was there – trying to scrape together a few steers before they died. The money they got for this meat would only just cover the cost of freight, if at all. We would camp at night, eat beef, laugh, and sing along to Slim Dusty, yodelling away about the wonderfulness of mothers.",

Smoking Man blew rings of yellow cigarette smoke in the air, and between exhalations of tar and nicotine he shouted into a cell phone. His words bounced off the walls in angry bursts of garbled syllables and snorts. I watched as he lit a second cigarette and let it warm in an ashtray while he sucked on the stick still burning in his mouth. Teresa guessed that he couldn’t read the No Smoking sign on his table.

I am also told that seeing Beryl from the back, walking down a Nairobi street with her wonderful stride and long blonde hair, you would think her a young woman. In the loaned house she has lately been robbed twice and badly beaten the second time, but still lives there. No woman could be more indifferent to her material surroundings, perhaps a habit picked up when her infant life began in a mud hut in the bush where her father was clearing land for a farm. People spoke with concern of Beryl being ‘hard-up, as usual’. Endearingly, she has collected all kinds of trophies but not money.",

Near the church stood half a dozen hovels, the inhabitants of which came out to watch me as I photographed. Almost unconsciously I was struck by some well-known look in the kohl-blackened eyes and certain peculiarities of manner that are difficult to specify but that combine to form an impression of easy and friendly familiarity with perhaps a touch of patronage in it. When the women joined the little crowd my eye was caught by the silver chains and buckles that they wore, which I remembered vaguely to have remarked elsewhere. As we were about to leave, an oldish man came forward and offered to walk with us for an hour, saying that the way down to Harim was difficult to find, and we had not walked fifty yards together before I realised the meaning of my subconscious recognition.",

Beyond another long stretch of shifting, tiring sand we passed the remains of two ancient bridges, both of which had crossed now-dry tributaries just above their confluence with the Rio Negra. We were still on the wrong side of the river, which here was deeper and faster. As the gorge gradually widened we could see a long jumble of blue mountains against the far horizon. Now the red cliffs were lower and a gigantic rift appeared in the brown mountains – presumably the Camino Real’s exit from the gorge. We could no longer postpone our third fording of the river and this time Juana was a little disconcerted by the strength of the current – a reaction I shared.",

They played again, an old waltz. The college Cerberus came across the dappled lawn to the fence and leaned his arms upon it, a lumped listening shadow among other shadows. Across the street, in the shadows there, other listeners stood; a car approached and slowed into the curb and shut off engine and lights, and in the tiered windows heads leaned, aureoled against the lighted rooms behind, without individuality, feminine, distant, delicately and divinely young.",

Shivering with cold we had to find a lodging, but in Lhasa it is not so simple to walk into a house as into a tent in the Changthang. We should probably be at once reported to the authorities. But we had to try. In the first house we found a dumb servant, who would not listen to us. Next door there was only a maid who screamed for help till her mistress came and begged us to go somewhere else She said she would be driven out of the quarter if she received us. We did not believe that the Government could be as strict as all that, but we did not want to cause her unpleasantness and so went out again. We walked through some narrow streets and found ourselves already at the other side of the town. There we came to a house much larger and finer-looking than any we had yet seen, with stables in the courtyard. We hurried in to find ourselves confronted by servants, who abused us and told us to go away. We were not to be moved and unloaded our donkey. Our driver had already been pressing us to let him go home. He had noticed that everything was not in order. We gave him his money and he went off with a sigh of relief.",

I can still clearly recall exiting Delhi airport upon our arrival in the country. There was a chill in the air as dawn broke, and wood smoke tinged with aviation fuel stung our eyes as we filed out to meet our minibus. Behind a wire fence stood a silent mass of gaunt, grimy faces, wrapped in blankets, eyes wide, observing the new arrivals. Having boarded a plane from polished, sterile Heathrow, it was a shock to see these semi-homeless inhabitants of the airport perimeter within minutes of stepping onto Indian soil for the first time.",

By the end of the 1950s, long-range jet aircraft spelled the end of Canton’s usefulness as a refueling station. The last Pan-Am flight departed the runway in 1965.",

Even by strictly controlling one’s imagination it is impossible to believe this lake to be clean; yet at present it is our only source of drinking-water, so quite a lot of expensive kerosene will be needed to boil the brew before use. It is rather annoying that so many Nepalese favour the edge of the lake as a latrine – obviously because they can then jump straight into the water and combine a swim with the ritual washing enjoined upon Hindus after defecation. But the abundant consequences of this habit diminish even my enthusiasm for swimming. Incidentally, one good result of nomadism is that the camp here has always been kept spotless – providing quite a contrast to the many Tibetan camps in India, which tend soon to become revolting manure-heaps. These Tibetans are so used to the hygiene of camping that even the hobbling grandparents and toddling infants go far over the fields each morning, and every day the whole camp is cleared of litter and swept as clean as a Mayfair street.",

A line of giant pylons bestrides this range, for the benefit of a chrome-mine and industrial estate just over the ‘border’, while the countless shacks beneath them remain unelectrified. Many families, gallantly determined to brighten their dreary plots, use battered old paint tins as flowerpots. The multitude of vehicles parked around the shacks puzzled me until my binoculars revealed that most have been cannibalized. Among the cacti and thornbushes a few emaciated cattle, donkeys and goats wandered and nibbled. One rarely sees emaciated goats; when they look poorly things are truly desperate. Ragged women and children, equally emaciated, criss-crossed the plain seeking scraps of firewood. Little herdboys sat leaning against boulders, doodling in the dust. My standard Map Studio road map, subservient to apartheid, indicates that this R37 route to Burgersfort crosses uninhabited country – in contrast to the surrounding Transvaal, dotted with dorps.",

She thinks that she is like that inside, thinking in this nocturnal confusion of her emotions with her response to beauty. She thinks of Dixie with excited identity as being some adult pan of herself divorced from her by transfiguring years, like a very sunburned arm which might not appear familiar if you had been unconscious of its alterations. To herself, she appropriates her sister’s love affair. Her alertness makes her drowsy. She has achieved a suspension of herself with the strain of her attenuated dreams. She falls asleep. The moon cradles her tanned face benevolently. She grows older sleeping. Someday she will awake to observe the plants of Alpine gardens in be largely fungus things, needing little sustenance, and the white discs that perfume midnight hardly flowers at all but embryonic growths; and, older, walk in bitterness the geometrical paths of philosophical Le Notres rather than those nebulous byways of the pears and marigolds of her childhood.",

Yet it seemed to move in complete silence. There was something almost furtive about it. Where the others had seemed to pass noisily, violently almost, in a kind of defiant valedictory of shame and despair, this one came and was gone with a sort of noiseless, celeritous effacement, as if the men who drove it abhorred, not its destination at all, but rather its contents.",
