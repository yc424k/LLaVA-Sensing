The undeveloped and ‘savage’ country would be transformed from a wasteland to a paradise of suburban homes and quaint bathing cabanas and popular beaches, all redolent, on hot days, of the subtle aroma of European culture. But the essence of progress is time, and we can only wait.",

    "target_paragraph": "Ah, that explained it. Homecoming. The big social event of the college year. There are three ritual stages attached to homecoming celebrations at American universities: (1) get grossly intoxicated; (2) throw up in a public place; (3) wake up not knowing where you are or how you got there and with your underpants on backwards. I appeared to have arrived in town somewhere between stages one and two, though in fact a few of the more committed revellers were already engaged in gutter serenades. I picked my way through the weaving throngs in downtown Iowa City asking people at random if they knew the way to Fitzpatrick’s Bar. No-one seemed to have heard of it – but then many of the people I encountered probably could not have identified themselves in a roomful of mirrors. Eventually I stumbled on the bar myself. Like all bars in Iowa City on a Friday night, it was packed to the rafters. Everybody looked to be fourteen years old, except one person – my friend John Horner, who was standing at the bar looking all of his thirty-five years. There is nothing like a college town to make you feel old before your time. I joined Horner at the bar. He hadn’t changed a lot. He was now a pharmacist and a respectable member of the community, though there was still a semi-wild glint in his eye. In his day, he had been one of the most committed drug takers in the community. Indeed, although he always strenuously denied it, everyone knew that his motive for studying pharmacology was to be able to create a more exotic blend of hallucinogenic drugs. We had been friends almost forever, since first grade at least. We exchanged broad smiles and warm handshakes and tried to talk, but there was so much noise and throbbing music that we were just two men watching each other’s mouths move. So we gave up trying to talk and instead had a beer and stood smiling inanely at each other, the way you do with someone you haven’t seen for years, and watching the people around us. I couldn’t get over how young and fresh-looking they all seemed. Everything about them looked brand new and unused – their clothes, their faces, their bodies. When we had drained our beer bottles, Horner and I stepped out on to the street and walked to his car. The fresh air felt wonderful. People were leaning against buildings everywhere and puking. ‘Have you ever seen so many twerpy little assholes in all your life?’ Horner asked me rhetorically.",

Some of the drovers, leaning on long tomahawk-like staves among their flocks, still wore cloaks of matted fleece; others, felt-like homespun with complex yokes of embroidery about the shoulders. At the entrance to farmsteads and hamlets, geese scuttled out of their ponds and across the path with a hissing and craning of necks that always turned into hostile beating of wings as Malek minced carefully by; if on dry land, they rushed at the ponds and splashed in. The women were aproned, embroidered, smocked and pleated in many pretty and unexpected ways and their hair was coifed and caught up in head-kerchiefs. Many of them had distaffs stuck in bright sashes of braid. Damping thumb and forefinger with their tongues, they pulled and twisted strands from the hanks of raw wool that clouded their distaff-prongs, and with the other hand set them spinning with twirls of their float-like spindles. These rose and fell like slow-motion yoyos, gathering thicker and still thicker coils of thread; later on, stretched on their elongated looms, they went to the weaving of those dense and unpliant capes. A girl on a stool among the hollyhocks outside her cottage trod and twirled at a spinning-wheel, a beautifully carved instrument polished by generations of toil, the only one I have ever seen in use.",

Now it is an expanse of concrete dominated by a nine-storey intrusion from Ceausescu-land. Another new addition is Michael the Brave on his mettlesome charger – he who briefly united Rumania at the end of the sixteenth century and is therefore not a Magyar hero. Under his undoubtedly approving eye the serious speeches began, explaining the Timisoara Proclamation point by point. For two and a half hours everyone stood motionless and attentive, from schoolchildren to great-grandparents. The speakers included the elderly Mayor of Cluj, a young dissident who had been in exile in West Germany before the revolution (and who soon after was charged with ‘fascism’ and again had to flee) and Doina Cornea, Cluj’s very own special heroine who got the warmest applause of all – though her speech was far from being the most substantial. Meanwhile the babies and toddlers obligingly dozed off in the hot sun, causing me to marvel yet again at the docility and adaptability of the Rumanian (very) young. That climax was no less significant and moving than the march: a vast silent throng concentrating on real politics with the intensity of a people starved all their lives of open debate.",

She simply did not move at all of her own volition, save to and from the table and to and from bed. She was late in learning to walk. She had the first and only perambulator the countryside had ever seen, a clumsy expensive thing almost as large as a dog-cart. She remained in it long after she had grown too large to straighten her legs out. When she reached the stage where it almost took the strength of a grown man to lift her out of it, she was graduated from it by force. Then she began to sit in chairs. It was not that she insisted upon being carried when she went anywhere. It was rather as though, even in infancy, she already knew there was nowhere she wanted to go, nothing new or novel at the end of any progression, one place like another anywhere and everywhere. Until she was five and six, when she did have to go anywhere because her mother declined to leave her at home while she herself was absent, she would be carried by their negro manservant. The three of them would be seen passing along the road—Mrs Varner in her Sunday dress and shawl, followed by the negro man staggering slightly beneath his long, dangling, already indisputably female burden like a bizarre and chaperoned Sabine rape.",

She could see that he was nervous; one would expect a bony young man with his face slightly reddened by the wind, and his hair not altogether smooth, to be nervous in such a party.

She would get up and close the window and dress and make coffee (the breakfast which while they were poor, when they did not know for certain where the next measure of coffee to put into the pot was coming from, they would prepare and eat together, the dishes of which they would wash and dry together side by side at the sink) and be gone and he would not know it. Then he in his turn would wake and listen to the passing children while the stale coffee heated, and drink it and sit down to the typewriter, entering without effort and without especial regret the anesthesia of his monotonous inventing. At first he made a kind of ritual of his solitary lunch, fetching in the cans and slices of meat and such the night before, like a little boy with a new Daniel Boone suit hoarding crackers in the improvised forest of a broom closet. But lately, since he had actually bought the typewriter (he had voluntarily relinquished his amateur standing, he told himself then; he no longer had even to pretend to himself it was a lark) he began to dispense with lunch altogether, with the bother of eating, instead writing steadily on, pausing only to sit while his fingers rested, a cigarette scarring slowly into the edge of the rented table, staring at but not seeing the two or three current visible lines of his latest primer-bald moronic fable, his sexual gum-drop, then remembering the cigarette and raising it to rub uselessly at the new scorch before writing again. Then the hour would arrive and with the ink sometimes scarcely dry on the stamped sealed and self-addressed envelope containing the latest story beginning ‘At sixteen I was an unwed mother’ he would leave the apartment and walk through the crowded streets, the steadily shortening afternoons of the dying year, to the bar where he and Charlotte and McCord met.",

This she could feel genuinely; this was something that she said herself. But then, as Cousin James went on reading, something slipped. The sense was blurred. She could not follow with her reason. Then in the midst of the argument came another burst of familiar beauty. ‘And fade away suddenly like the grass, in the morning it is green, and groweth up; but in the evening it is cut down, dried up, and withered.’ She could feel the beauty of that. Again it was like music; but then Cousin James seemed to hurry, as if he did not altogether believe what he was saying. He seemed to pass from the known to the unknown; from what he believed to what he did not believe; even his voice altered. He looked clean, he looked starched and ironed like his robes. But what did he mean by what he was saying? She gave it up. Either one understood or one did not understand, she thought. Her mind wandered.",

To go, leaving the edge of the world, up the road to the village, would be to move away from enchantment. Away up there, amongst the cottages, with the sea left behind, the air would be thin and dry. There would be people. Village people, circling unaware. She remembered the ancient churchyard, where Florence had remarked that every one in the parish lived to be ninety. But to prowl there would be to step back into last week, the other side of eternity. To go anywhere, yet, away from this corner where strength had begun to return, would be to leave that strength behind.",

    "target_paragraph": "When a young Kisumu doctor joined us I sought information – to the evident discomfiture of my companions – about the workings of Kenya’s National AIDS Control Programme. I could have asked no better man. Dr Shikuku had spent the day collecting blood in the bush from young donors whom he described as ‘relatively low risk’. Blood donations in Nairobi, he said, had dropped from 26,000 units in 1981 to 8,000 units in 1991 ‘because people fear they can get the virus from giving blood’. (A not unreasonable fear, I reckoned, but tactfully didn’t say so.) The most recent HIV + figures were 7.5 per cent of blood donors and 12 per cent of pregnant women attending ante-natal clinics. ‘And worst of all,’ said Dr Shikuku, ‘the high-risk group mostly don’t want to know and won’t be tested.’ Wearily he shook his head. ‘So our carriers will go on increasing fast. We used to think the high-risk age group was 25 to 40, now we know it’s 15 to 60. The National AIDS Control Programme was given enormous funding – KSh. 800 million. Most of that’s spent on big salaries, air fares to international AIDS conferences, hotel bills and “expenses”, Pajeros serviced and run for personal use only. Millions of Kenyans now imagine the virus is going away, we’ve so little publicity about the rate of spread. Our government is the most irresponsible in Africa, things are much better organised in Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia.’",

We caught the same train home together in the afternoon and started talking about the things boys talk about, such as fighter planes, whether a lion or a tiger would win a fight, and whether Mad magazine was funnier than Cracked. After just more than a year, we started attending the same high school and this time rode the same bus. Our friendship firmed, aided by the proximity of where we lived. From the age of twelve we started a tradition of creeping from our homes to meet at midnight, never to do anything malicious or even devious, just to talk. While any of the Africans that I know would laugh at the idea of my childhood being difficult, it was certainly not a happy one, and it was on these walks that I told Nick of my concern about my father’s drinking or that my stepmother was more than a little imbalanced. He rarely offered advice, which was okay because he gave the one thing that I needed?a sympathetic ear.",

It was commanded by a merciless general called Ali Pasha, ein schrecklicher Mann! Some Schässburgers had barricaded themselves in the tower and one of them aimed his arquebus at him, and – boom! – down he came.’ A looping parabola with his forefinger showed that somersaulting fall. ‘He was on an elephant.’",

For a long way down the snow was still thick.

Six weeks. I have almost forgotten how. No,” she said, “I’ll never forget that. You never forget that, thank you sweet God.” Then she said, holding him, the hard arms and thighs: “I guess I am a sissy about love.

He listened to threats and admonitions, and afterwards made his usual answers to questions, with his chin sunk on his breast, his hands tied behind his back, swaying a little in front of Sotillo, and never looking up. When he was forced to hold up his head, by means of a bayonet-point prodding him under the chin, his eyes had a vacant, trance-like stare, and drops of perspiration as big as peas were seen hailing down the dirt, bruises, and scratches of his white face.

A couple of fuel pumps on a gravel apron and a sheet-metal kiosk with a glass or plastic pay window so thick and opaque you could hardly make out the attendant inside comprised the total of their amenities. No advertising banners, vending machines, drinking fountains, or restrooms cluttered up this just-the-facts approach. Of course no bucket or squeegee was available should your window need to be cleaned. We had entered a buggy part of the journey, and our windshield was usually covered with splattered insects. No problem: Volodya took some water from our supply, gave the windshield a few splashes, crushed an unfiltered cigarette in his fingers, and using the tobacco as a solvent washed the bugs from the glass with big sweeps of his hand. Sergei, meanwhile, removed the wiper mount from the windshield-wiper arm and with the blade of the wiper squeegeed the windshield dry and clean.",

    "target_paragraph": "What a different place Britain was in the spring of 1973. The pound was worth £2.46, nearly a dollar more than now. Average weekly take-home pay was just over £30. A packet of potato chips was 5p, a soft drink 8p, lipstick 45p, chocolate biscuits 12p, an iron £4.50, an electric kettle £7, a black-and-white TV £60, a color TV £300, the average meal out £1. A scheduled airline ticket from New York to London cost £87.45 in winter, £124.95 in summer. You could have eight days in the Canary Islands on a Cook’s Golden Wings Holiday for £65, or fifteen days from £93. I know all this because before this trip I looked up the issue of The Times for March 20, 1973, the day I arrived in Dover, and it contained a full-page advertisement from the government outlining how much most of these things cost and how they would be affected by a zippy new tax called VAT, which was to be introduced a week or so later. The gist of the advertisement was that while some things would go up in price with VAT, some things would also go down. (Ha!) I also recollect from my own dwindling cerebral resources that it cost 4p to send a postcard to America by air, 13p for a pint of beer, and 30p for a Penguin paperback. The decimalization of English currency had just passed its second anniversary, but people were still converting in their heads—“Good lord, why that’s nearly six shillings!”—and you had to know that a sixpence coin was really worth 2½p and that guinea signified £1.05.",

The old streets were not strung with colored lights the way they had been before 1959, and the storefronts weren’t decked out with fancy displays. Memories of the feasts of her youth were so strong that she could smell the sweet churros and delectable little hamburgers called fritas that were sold at food stands around the park nearly until daybreak, though not one was there this day to tempt her. But for a few moments, as the Virgin swayed through the street, the band played familiar hymns, and a clergyman swung his silver thurible, Guanabacoa again rose to the glory of her past.",

The Geladas swarmed across the whole slope – above, below and on the path – and the nearest were hardly ten yards away, giving me a clear view of the heart-sized patch of crimson skin on each chest and of their long, powerful fangs gleaming in the sun at every shriek. In the circumstances, I could have done with a less clear view of these fangs. All baboons are reputed to be cowards but apparently Jock and I look unusually innocuous, for this troop was showing not the slightest inclination to move off the path. Then my memory perversely produced what is doubtless an old wives’ tale about human bones having been found among others in the Geladas’ boneyards. At which point I decided to take action – and a few stones immediately cleared the path, though none of the males moved far away and their hideous peals of rage almost deafened me as we slowly passed through the herd. Luckily Jock had maintained his customary stoicism during this encounter, merely looking relieved at having a chance to stand still.",

And Leo is twice the weight of Roz … Eventually I discovered that one could descend to within about one hundred feet of the water, but no further – something which would have been obvious from the start to any moderately intelligent person. So I sat down in the shade of a tree by the cliff-edge to smoke a cigarette while reflecting on the sad fact that soon we would have to ascend somehow to plain-level and resume our war of nerves with those tracks.",

Because of its small size it didn’t have to come right up alongside for the cranes to reach it and there was a gap of several meters between it and the docks. We had no choice but to wait until the boat moved closer before boarding, and so, philosophically, we sat down on our bags to wait for the propitious moment. With the midnight change of shift the boat was brought alongside, but the harbormaster, a nasty character whose face disclosed his ill temper, stood squarely on the gangplank checking the arriving and departing workers. The crane driver, who in the meantime we had befriended, advised us to wait for a better moment because, he said, the master was a hostile bastard. So we began a long wait which lasted the whole night, warming ourselves in the crane, an ancient contraption that ran on steam. The sun rose to see us still waiting on the dock with our bags. Our hopes of boarding by stealth had almost completely dissipated when the captain turned up with a new, restored gangplank, and with it the San Antonio was now in permanent contact with dry land. Well-instructed by the crane driver, we slipped on board easily, making ourselves at home, and locked ourselves and our bags in the bathroom of the officers’ quarters. From then on, all we had to do was say in a nasal little voice ‘excuse me, can’t come in’ or ‘it’s occupied,’ on the half dozen or so times someone tried to open the door.",
