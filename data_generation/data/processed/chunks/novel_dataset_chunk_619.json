He got about on crutches when he had his wooden stumps on him; at other times he crawled about on the stump ends of his amputated legs, which were protected by worn leather pads. He had had one leg shot off at Cold Harbor, and the other was mangled and had to be amputated. In spite of his mutilation and his huge bulk, he could move with amazing speed when he wanted to. When he was angered, he could use his crutch as a club and could floor anyone within a radius of six feet. His wife, a little, frail woman, was thoroughly submissive.",

We were instructed that if we sang to them it would get their attention, so a dozen of us floated in the frigid Antarctic water singing “Hot Cross Buns” and “Paradise City” into our snorkels. The dolphins swam by with their babies, who nosed me in the tummy and jumped over and under us as they passed. After the dolphin swim, I headed for the helicopter, where my tour partners were a gorgeous honeymooning couple from, of course, Argentina. The man could have been Father Juan’s brother, all shiny hair and dulce de leche skin. We went up together, and I got to see my first whale in the wild.",

    "target_paragraph": "I have made a second tour through the factory, and am rather disgusted with sugar making. \"All's well that ends well,\" however, and the delicate crystalline result makes one forget the initial stages of the manufacture. The cane, stripped of its leaves, passes from the flumes under the rollers of the crushing-mill, where it is subjected to a pressure of five or six tons. One hundred pounds of cane under this process yield up from sixty-five to seventy-five pounds of juice. This juice passes, as a pale green cataract, into a trough, which conducts it into a vat, where it is dosed with lime to neutralize its acid, and is then run off into heated metal vessels. At this stage the smell is abominable, and the turbid fluid with a thick scum upon it is simply disgusting. After a preliminary heating and skimming it is passed off into iron pans, several in a row, and boiled and skimmed, and ladled from one to the other till it reaches the last, which is nearest to the fire, and there it boils with the greatest violence, seething and foaming, bringing all the remaining scum to the surface. After the concentration has proceeded far enough, the action of the heat is suspended, and the reddish-brown, oily-looking liquid is drawn into the vacuum-pan till it is about a third full; the concentration is completed by boiling the juice in vacuo at a temperature of 150° and even lower. As the boiling proceeds, the sugar-boiler tests the contents of the pan by withdrawing a few drops, and holding them up to the light on his finger; and, by certain minute changes in their condition, he judges when it is time to add an additional quantity. When the pan is full, the contents have thickened into the consistency of thick gruel by the formation of minute crystals, and are then allowed to descend into a heater, where they are kept warm till they can be run into \"forms\" or tanks, where they are allowed to granulate. The liquid, or molasses, which remains after the first crystallization is returned to the vacuum pan and reboiled, and this reboiling of the drainings is repeated two or three times, with a gradually decreasing result in the quality and quantity of the sugar. The last process, which is used to get rid of the treacle, is a most beautiful one. The mass of sugar and treacle is put into what are called \"centrifugal pans,\" which are drums about three feet in diameter and two feet high, which make about 1000 revolutions a minute. These have false interiors of wire gauze, and the mass is forced violently against their sides by centrifugal action, and they let the treacle whir) through, and retain the sugar crystals, which lie in a dry heap in the centre.",

Partly it was from the look and feel of the North—the high, open moors and big skies, the wandering drystone walls, the grimy mill towns, the snug stone villages of the Dales and Lakes—and partly, of course, it was to do with the accents, the different words, the refreshing if sometimes startling frankness of speech. Partly it was also to do with the way southerners and northerners were so extraordinarily, sometimes defiantly, ignorant of the geography of the other end of the country. It used to astonish me, working on newspapers in London, how often you could call out a question like “Is Halifax in West Yorkshire or South Yorkshire?” and be met with a tableful of blank frowns. And when I moved north and told people that I’d previously lived in Surrey near Windsor, I often got the same look—a kind of nervous uncertainty, as if they were afraid I was going to say, “Now you show me on the map just where that is.”",

The blue morning glories were yet unwilted, rivulets dropped down into ferny grottoes and lingered there, rose ohia blossoms lighted shady places, orange flowers gleamed like stars amidst the dense leafage, and the crimped-leaved coffee shrubs were white with their mimic snow. It was my last tropical dream, and I was rudely roused by finding myself on the unsightly verge of the great bluff on the north side of this valley, which plunges to the sea with an uncompromising perpendicular dip of 2000 feet, and carries on its dizzy brow a shelving trail not more than two feet wide!",

On top of everything else, my right arm was swelling up, and I had this stupid wristwatch on, so as my arm got bigger and bigger, the watch got tighter and tighter until it was cutting off most of the blood supply to my hand. But with my hands messed up so badly, there was no way I could get the damn thing off. I yelled for help, but nobody came. It was one hell of a long night. Man, I was glad to see your face when you stuck your head inside the door.”",

Recalling a gruelling week-long cruise in an open boat through the Galapagos Islands – also on the Equator – I had been dreading this day’s exposure to the water-reflected sun. By the time we left, soon after 8 a.m., a strong south-easterly wind was troubling the lake and sheets of cold squally rain restricted visibility for the first hour or so. As this was a deep vessel I sat on the gunwale, shivering beneath my rain-cape because propriety had required me to swim in my underwear. Then the clouds lifted, without dispersing, and a strange, suffused, silvery light shimmered on the jade water. We passed close to several lonely islets; high, dark, cave-pitted cliffs were visible through a tropical tangle, rising from narrow fringes of golden sand.",

One witness reported the scene at Amsterdam Central Station as looters stacked ‘all sorts of things; furniture, desks, typewriters, stoves, even chicken coops with and without chickens’. In the eastern city of Arnhem, one resident told of finding a note requesting the theft to order of a dinner set and Persian carpet, ‘as if the place was a department store’. By the end of the war, the Red Cross had recorded the theft or destruction of 30,000 beds, 20,000 cooking stoves, 60,000 chairs and 80,000 blankets in the city of Arnhem alone. Nationwide, the government estimated that two-thirds of the country’s cars had been stolen. Bicycles also proved particularly tempting: over the course of the war, roughly half of the Netherlands’ around four million bicycles were either destroyed or confiscated; a war crime many Dutch would never forgive. As a Nazi army officer wrote in a report to his superiors: ‘no German measure has caused such bitterness in all ranks of society as the confiscation of the bicycles.’",

Merchants, middle-aged men in silk polo shirts, shouted to us from the comfort of their stools; some held up scarves and hats and souvenir picture books. We smiled and waved, and called out “Nyet, spasibo! No, thank you.” A few touts followed us for a minute or two. They delivered their sales pitches in thick Russian. “Nyet, spasibo,” I said with a wave. Around one corner, we found a Hard Rock Café, a pink Cadillac mounted on its terrace, homage, I presumed, to Bruce Springsteen and the (awful) song of the same name. “This,” I said, “looks more like Aruba than Egypt,” and Teresa agreed. I took a few photos, for no particular reason, and we moved along. A few minutes later, we paused in the shade by the Grand Resort, a massive hotel and retail complex that straddles the street, with rooms that overlook the sea and the promenade. We had seen enough resorts for the day; it was time to enjoy our own.",

To this dismal heath, therefore, they came, the swarthy children of a dozen races, clad in the hard and decent blacks in which the poor pay debts and go to funerals. They would advance across the barren lands, the harsh sere earth scarred with its wastes of rust and rubbish, going stolidly by below the blank board fences of a brick yard, crunching doggedly through the lanes of dirty rutted ice, passing before the grey besmutted fronts of wooden houses which in their stark, desolate, and unspeakable ugliness seemed to give a complete and final utterance to an architecture of weariness, sterility and horror, so overwhelming in its absolute desolation that it seemed as if the painful and indignant soul of man must sicken and die at length before it, stricken, stupefied, and strangled without a tongue to articulate the curse that once had blazed in him.",

Later that afternoon they suggested a walk: they would show their new guest the peak of Nanga Parbat, forty miles away, on which the snow glistened like oil paint. Rafiq and Laraine soon fell behind, then disappeared. Ishmael and his wife were a little aggrieved. Self-consciously and silently, like guests rather than hosts, they continued on their walk, pausing here and there to admire the view. In time they were rejoined by Rafiq and Laraine. No fulfilment on their faces, no fatigue: they were both hysterical. They were quarrelling and their rage was real. Presently they exchanged blows. The faces of both were already marked. She kicked him. He groaned, and slapped her. She cried out, swung her bag at him, kicked him again, and he tumbled down the brambly slope. Torn, bleeding, he came bellowing up, snatched her bag and threw it far down into a valley, where it would remain until the snows came and washed it away. At this she sat down and wept like a child. His rage vanished; he went to her; she yielded to him.",

The Government established Closed Camps to house refugees from Vietnam, the boat-people of the 1970s. Though surrounded by barbed wire, they are generally run humanely enough, and their purpose is logical – to provide a home for refugees hoping for permission to re-settle permanently somewhere else, while making the experience sufficiently unwelcoming pour encourager les autres; but in the Hong Kong official manner they have a numbingly institutional air, with their fences, their bunk-houses and their blazered, royal-badged staff seconded from the Correctional Services Department, while as the years drag by, and nobody offers the poor inmates any happier sanctuary, and more and more of them are forcibly repatriated, the camps come to seem more and more like prisons themselves.",

The gate is not carved, but the coral blocks are set in a decorative pattern. The top of the gate has the unusual \"winged\" appearance of the other two candi bentars in the temple. The gate curves away from the center in a graceful arc, then curves back again and ends in a point like the tip of a bird's wing. The Balinese called this style bersayap, meaning winged. This is a very rare style of candi bentar.",

A month previously, this scene would have been beyond the imagination of the most fanciful Rumanian. I looked at the crowd; years of malnutrition had left people abnormally susceptible to cold, and all were wearing woolly caps or fur hats, and sheepskin jackets or heavy drab anoraks. Yet to me the room-temperature seemed just right – and ecologically much sounder than our Western hot-houses. Many faces showed signs of long-term exhaustion and strain but now were relaxed: even, in some cases, serene. On one level this revolution had been totally successful. After decades during which only silence was safe, all Rumanians now felt free to express themselves loudly, as individuals, in public – and in the presence of members of the security forces. So completely do we take this freedom for granted that only then did I fully appreciate what it must mean to those to whom it is new.",

Houses hid behind bushes and lakes shimmered in the sunshine. The sun was now wide awake, bouncing across leaves and leaping above branches. Gone was the dust and dryness of the north.

That evening, on one of his forays to the deck, McKinlay stood at the rail, watching the ice cluster around the ship. “The ice had thickened up, but strangely enough the risk of being frozen in again never crossed my mind.” He brought the clothes he’d worn the entire time on Wrangel Island with him, and the garments sat on deck next to him in a sodden pile.",

One of her obsessions concerns shoe-laces, which she believes to have been tied in every case so that she may enjoy the satisfaction of untying them. But outlets for such a mania are few in this region of bare feet and therefore she rejoiced at today’s appearance on the airstrip of a very correctly attired Chinese Communist Delegation. (What they were delegated to or from I never discovered.) When the plane landed and the twelve comrades emerged many of Pokhara’s VIPs were there to greet them, most of Pokhara’s armed police were there to protect them (from Tibetans?), and immediately several Kathmandu and Peking press-photographers came scuttling around to arrange groups to prove how dearly the Chinese and Nepalese love one another.",
