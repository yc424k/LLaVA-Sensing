The old man in the feathered hat fell down, promptly picked himself up, and continued his lopsided run to the queue. Olanna was surprised, too, by the militia members flogging with long whips and shouting “Order! Order!” and by the stern faces of the women at the tables, who bent and scooped into the bags held out before them and then said, “Yes! Next!”",

With freezing cheeks and hair caked with snow, I clumped into an entrancing haven of oak beams and carving and alcoves and changing floor levels. A jungle of impedimenta encrusted the interior – mugs and bottles and glasses and antlers – the innocent accumulation of years, not stage props of forced conviviality – and the whole place glowed with a universal patina.

Jane helps me to move the hay mattress that has come to fit the contours of my body into Oscar’s old bunk. On my first night, huddled into my new bed, I’m delirious with happiness. Coco is snuggled against my chest and Faustino is hogging my pillow, pressing his soft, fuzzy bulk into my face. A photo of Wayra that Mila has printed out for me is pinned to the wooden window frame. I can’t sleep because I’m so hot. The monkeys are perfect hot water bottles. My sheets and skin are orange from their sweat, but somehow these things only make it better. The next morning, we go to Wayra and spend the whole day at the lagoon. The storms keep coming, making the smells different, the world wetter, hotter, closer. She comes up to the top of the bank and turns her angled cheekbones in our direction. A low, panicky grumble turns into a high, contented moan, and then a snore as she lays her head to rest on the ground between our boots and the new, young shoots of patuju that have sprouted up overnight.",

He asked if she’d fallen on the ice or slammed into a crate or something. “I chew Captain’s boots,” she said, smiling, and handed them to him. When he got the full story, with the help of Kuraluk’s translation, Bartlett was amazed. As the ship had been sinking, Auntie went to Bartlett’s cabin and retrieved his good boots, which needed repairs. She’d gone back to the igloo and “in the Eskimo way had chewed the thick leather into a pliable state and filled the soles with grass. In the cold and snow, and with the hard hide, she had split her lips in twenty places.” He just shook his head and thanked her, patting her on her shoulder, humbled by her kindness. Then he passed out, exhausted by the loss of the Karluk and the responsibility he bore.",

Quite apart from the thought that they may harbor wild beasts and armed, genetically challenged fellows named Zeke and Festus, there is something innately sinister about them, some ineffable thing that makes you sense an atmosphere of pregnant doom with every step and leaves you profoundly aware that you are out of your element and ought to keep your ears pricked. Though you tell yourself it’s preposterous, you can’t quite shake the feeling that you are being watched. You order yourself to be serene (it’s just a woods for goodness sake), but really you are jumpier than Don Knotts with pistol drawn. Every sudden noise—the crack of a falling limb, the crash of a bolting deer—makes you spin in alarm and stifle a plea for mercy. Whatever mechanism within you is responsible for adrenaline, it has never been so sleek and polished, so keenly poised to pump out a warming squirt of adrenal fluid. Even asleep, you are a coiled spring.",

After a long sleep in a bed with fresh sheets, I woke the next morning and took a stroll around the city, and a powerful new spasm of Russia-love came over me. There was no reason for it—I could think of plenty of good arguments against it—but I still could not stop a slide into exhilaration. In the cold sunlight, St. Petersburg seemed glorious. Everything about it aided the impression—the façades of the buildings in their faded Easter colors with their complicated veining of cracks, the strangely apt banners advertising superglues above the Nevsky Prospekt, the empty beer bottles frozen cheerily upright in the ice of the Griboyedova Canal, the brown haze of dust in the sky from the sand spread on the streets’ winterlong accumulation of ice . . .",

Instead, it’s pedal and push, shift and lean, gee and haw in a deep, calm voice, a hop to avoid low brush or a spruce branch in the eyes, a jump and dash over open water, broken ice. Off the runners, it’s a trail-breaking slog ahead of the team on snowshoes, route-finding in blowing snow. At camp, it’s chopping river ice or melting snow for thirty dogs’ dinners, the slosh of the long-handled scoop emptying gruel into their dented tin bowls and the sound of barking dogs falling silent on their grub, dogs who’ve pulled all day because you asked them to, and they love it.

Her swings had constant rhythm, the motion of the axe while not in contact with the tree as important as the chopping. The blade hit the wood at an angle, chiseling out pieces the way you’d whittle with a knife, and making clear the origin of the word “woodchips.” Reba swiveled the handle in her palms in midair so she used both bits of the head to chop on alternate sides, the width of the cut twice the diameter of the tree, leaving plenty of room for the angling cuts to meet in the middle and sever the trunk. My technique, I could see, was at best bludgeoning, more suited to driving a spike with a sledgehammer (the twelve-pound version of which would later make a different, equal fool of me). When Reba swung, it looked not exactly effortless, since her T-shirt was soaked with sweat and she stopped to catch her breath, but at least graceful. It seemed clear why you’d use that tool to do this job.",

We logged a few hours at the range each month, and Trent, our cowboy ranch kid, laughed at Randy and me as we overcame our tendency to handle the weapon at arm’s length like a venomous snake. At first, Randy took the gun tentatively, but by the second week he cocked it like a bandit and hooted with a fist in the air at a bull’s-eye. Though Randy would’ve liked to be immune to the gun’s charms, it seemed no one, not even a diffident “granola,” could resist the allure of firing off a shot.",

The Other is everywhere today, not least on our front doorsteps. We step outside our houses and are surrounded by the colors and rites of the place across the mountains. Ghosts and talismans and ancient superstitions are all around us; look outside your window, and you may see a dead chicken placed ceremonially at the center of a crossroads. A foreign mumbling is coming through the walls, from the new neighbor, and the signs on the store down the street dance and swirl as in a suq in North Africa. The modern, shifting world has brought disorientation home to us, and mystery and strangeness; even in the most familiar places we may come upon something unsettling, just through the alien presence at our side (I go into a church in Florence, everyday as the morning to me, and the friend I’ve brought with me from Japan suddenly stiffens, and runs out, her heart assaulted by the strangeness of a place I would never think twice about).",

For half a mile out of Chandanwari the path ran easily between rock and the boulder-strewn Lidder River until it came to the almost vertical two-thousand-foot wall of Pissu Ghati. Here the path narrowed and zigzagged up and up between rocks, the slain demons of one legend, for two miles. The pilgrims queued for the climb, and the queue moved slowly. At Chandanwari it did not move at all. It was hours before we could get going, and then we discovered that during our morning’s stupor one of our pony men had absconded. So Aziz’s torment began. The ponies had to be urged up Pissu Ghati, their loads held in place – we could hear the pony men’s cries all the way up and the occasional crash of tumbling loads – and there was nothing Aziz could do but to get off his pony and start pushing the abandoned, tent-laden pony up the steep path: he in his striped blue suit, his fur cap, his Terylene socks, he who had been forbidden to walk. Dignity abandoned him. He complained like a child; he cursed in Kashmiri; he swore to get vengeance; he asked me to write to Mr Madan. His whip hand flashed again and again. ‘Bloody swine man!’ he shouted in English, and the Terylene socks sagged down his stamping, sandalled feet. His cries grew fainter as we went ahead on our ponies. Looking down, we glimpsed him from time to time negotiating a hairpin bend, angrily dodging the tent-poles, and each time he looked tinier, dustier, more crumpled and more enraged.",

You are doing what everyone else in Italy is doing, millions of backsides being shined by chairs at millions of tables. Over each table, a miniature swarm of gnats is gathering. There are exceptions, of course. Parking attendants, waiters, cooks—and thousands of tourists, many of whom made the mistake of eating two wedges of great sausage pizza at eleven and now have no inclination to eat anything. Instead, they wander under the unbearable sun, peeking through metal grates covering shop windows, pushing at the massive doors of locked churches, sitting on the sides of fountains while squinting into minuscule guidebooks. Give it up! I’ve done the same thing. Then, later, it’s hard to deny yourself the luscious melone ice cream cone at seven, when the air is still hot and your sandals have rubbed your heels raw. Those weak ones (mea culpa) who succumb possibly will have another wedge, artichoke this time, on the way to the hotel; then, when Italy begins eating at nine, the foreign stomach doesn’t even mumble. That happens much later, when all the good restaurants are full.",

From the empty tank at the top a line of pools and watercourses descends from terrace to terrace. This pleasaunce of Hussein Baikara was built by forced labour; for when his subjects overstepped even his broad limits of the morally permissible, they had to help with the Sultan’s garden instead of going to prison. Up till the last century there was a pavilion here, and the water was still running; Mohun Lal mentions a great fountain, “which with its watery arrows fights with the top of the building.” What a phrase! But Mohun Lal, though he apologises for his English to the editor of the Bengal Journal, sometimes wrote very well. It would be hard to improve his description of Yar Mohammad, the then ruler of Herat: “He is a gloomy and decrepit prince; he excites the pity of mankind.”",

From these past conversations with other drivers I knew an hour would be miraculous for a first time solo set up. Thus, at 3 a.m. on a chilly Saturday in mid-December I went to the dispatch office and got the slip with the trailer numbers destined for Meridian. The slip listed the trailers in the order they were meant to be set up. The heaviest trailer belongs in front and the lighter one on the back. If their roles are reversed, a heavier trailer in the back can create a force strong enough to flip the back trailer onto its side or even to flip the entire rig. Sam had cautioned against this phenomenon when advising me not to let the tail wag the dog. A heavy back trailer could gain momentum swinging from side to side. Any driver who “lost” or flipped the back trailer received automatic termination for driving too fast for conditions, no matter what speed the truck moved at when the flip occurred. One driver explained, unless the truck was parked and tornado-like winds lifted and dropped the back trailer or the rig on its side, a driver had no chance of mercy.",

What makes the air feel thronged is the presence of household deities and ghosts, the spirits that for my neighbors inhabit every last desk or box of chocolates. Nothing essential ever seems to die in Japan, so the land is saturated with dead ancestors, river gods, the heavenly bodies to whom Hiroko gives honorifics, as if they were her country’s CEOs.",

The problem was that they could carry only so much when they all left Shipwreck Camp, and getting back to it for resupply was uncertain at best.

At a small widening, I pull over and then watch as the bus speeds up, takes a hairpin turn, its back end sweeping the pavement clear of everything in its way – road markers, trees, and (thankfully) not me. Once again the traffic picks up because the further north one goes, “you can’t get there from here.” Rather, you can only get there on this tiny road be you cyclist, bus, or tractor trailer.

He walked to the front of the open door and I saw him lift a gun. Mr Hani had just gotten out of his car. The blond man pulled the trigger twice. By that time I had just gone a short way past the house. I stopped the car and watched the blond man walk over to Mr Hani as he lay between the garage door and his car. He calmly lifted the gun again and, at almost point-blank range, pulled the trigger twice. I can still hear the shots ringing in my ears. At first I thought it was a security man shooting at a burglar. But as I watched in my rear-view mirror I saw the blond man walk back to his car, get in and begin reversing out of the driveway. I do not know what possessed me, but I reversed my car towards him. I did not even think that the killer might start shooting at me. All I did was look for the registration number. As the car got closer I saw it. I kept repeating it over and over so I wouldn’t forget. I sped home. I was so upset. I had just seen a man being shot down in cold blood. It all seemed like a movie that I was somehow caught up in. I ran up my driveway screaming out the registration number. Within seconds I had told the police the make, colour and number of that car.",

Once a heavily fortified barrier aimed at preventing a seaborne invasion from Britain, it was now a crumbling mass of black brick coiled among the grassy sand dunes like a slug. On top of a nearby sand dune sat four dilapidated satellite dishes, monstrous and skeletal, a relic of US army eavesdropping during the Cold War and a reminder that for all its current bleakness, this had always been one of the crossroads of Europe. A sign pointed with thick blue fingers towards distant megacities – New York: 5824 kilometres, St Petersburg: 1831, Shanghai: 8934.",

We joined Mobeen, the other physician on duty, and together headed toward the South Indian's stall to buy ourselves tea. As I was leaving the ICU, pulling me to one side, Mobeen stopped me just inside the steel doors.\n“Qanta, I must talk to you about Hajj.” His urgency stopped me in my tracks. We had hardly had any conversations outside of patient care. I leaned against a cool wall. Beads of perspiration slowly evaporated from between my shoulder blades. An air conditioning vent whirred directly overhead, dissipating the last remnants of my adrenalin. Intent, I listened, still keen from recent crisis.\n“Qanta, you must go to Hajj. You must.” Taken aback, I listened. I hadn't been thinking of going to Hajj at all.\nMobeen's soft voice was unexpectedly impassioned. The room contracted to a single, shared moment.

The luxurious German desks were so jam-packed that I had to walk across them to mount the high teachers’ ‘stage’, extending the width of the room. Yet this was also the examination hall. ‘So little space!’ lamented the teacher. ‘It makes cribbing too easy!’",

He knew that he was very popular with the people and went to work building Casernes and planning other improvements. But the conspirators grew bold by seeming immunity. They began to move with more assurance. Rumors of plots and conspiracies increased. Definite plans seemed to have been made and the Minister of the Interior began to be really alarmed and rushed to the President and mentioned names. He accused Tancred Auguste, Volcius Nerette, Chef de Sûreté, and La Roche, Minister of Agriculture, of plotting to overthrow the regime of Leconte and to make Auguste president in his stead. He urged the President to lose no time in arresting Auguste and Nerette. But such was the confidence of Leconte in his well-being that he refused to believe this advice. He put it down to over anxiety on the part of a friend. This was the state of affairs for some time before the night of the explosion.",

P. was feeding him he started again just whimpering at first until she touched him then he yelled she stood there her eyes like cornered rats then I was running in the gray darkness it smelled of rain and all flower scents the damp warm air released and crickets sawing away in the grass pacing me with a small travelling island of silence Fancy watched me across the fence blotchy like a quilt on a line I thought damn that nigger he forgot to feed her again I ran down the hill in that vacuum of crickets like a breath travelling across a mirror she was lying in the water her head on the sand spit the water flowing about her hips there was a little more light in the water her skirt half saturated flopped along her flanks to the waters motion in heavy ripples going nowhere renewed themselves of their own movement I stood on the bank I could smell the honeysuckle on the water gap the air seemed to drizzle with honeysuckle and with the rasping of crickets a substance you could feel on the flesh",
