Now all that remained was for everyone to gather the last of their personal belongings and leave the ship for the box house and igloo, where sleeping assignments had been made: in the box house would be all the Eskimos as well as McKinlay, Mamen, Dr. Mackay, Murray, Beuchat, Clam, Golightly, and Chafe; the igloo or snow house Bartlett would share with Munro, Williamson, Breddy, Hadley, Templeman, Maurer, John Brady, Sandy, Barker, Malloch, and Hadley. Captain Bartlett congratulated everyone for their efforts, and at midnight had the Canadian Blue Ensign “hoisted for the last time” to the main topmast. At two in the morning, he ordered everyone to turn in to their respective dwellings on the ice to try to get some sleep, or at least some rest.",

Over the next few days we discover four stone chutes running downhill from terrace to terrace and ending at a large square mouth that goes underground for about twenty-five feet, then reappears on the lowest terrace above the cistern, just as we suspected. The backs of all the chutes have the big single stone curved for the water to flow down. When the channels are cleaned out, water will cascade into the cistern after rains. I start to wonder if, with a small recirculating pump connected to the cistern, perhaps some of the water can fall all the time. After the experience of the dry well, the trickle and splash of falling water would be music indeed. Fortunately, we didn’t stumble into these chutes last year as we blithely meandered the terraces admiring wildflowers and identifying fruit trees.",

All around was open loneliness and black solitude over which a stiff breeze blew.",

I could understand the apprehension in the air; Laos in transition makes many peasants apprehensive, as Mr Tang had exemplified. Could I be some mysterious NGO rep planning to meddle with local irrigation systems? Or a foreign consultant advising the government on land registration and taxes?

He told me he wanted it to catch fire. It refused. He groped in the hearth for the bits of twigs with which the fire had been started. These twig-stumps he stuck in the fat, like an orange stuck with cloves, then he held it in the fire again. Now at last it caught, and it was a flaming torch running downwards with a thin shower of flaming fat. And now he was satisfied. He held the fat-torch with its yellow flares over the browning kid, which he turned horizontal for the occasion. All over the roast fell the flaming drops, till the meat was all shiny and browny. He put it to the fire again, holding the diminishing fat, still burning bluish, over it all the time in the upper air.",

Even today, the remnants of a British hill station are ubiquitous there. The town itself was a British creation, founded in 1887 by its namesake, Colonel May of the 5th Bengal Infantry. (‘Maymyo’, means literally ‘May Town’.) Old colonial houses with sun-faded brick walls sit silent and forgotten behind overgrown hedges and forests of trees. The British army imported Gurkha soldiers from Nepal, and you can still see Nepali sweater-knitters and find Gurkha descendants manning the dairies, balancing tin milk churns on either side of their bicycles. The lanes echo with the clip-clop of horse’s feet as pastel-coloured hackney carriages, painted with wreaths of flowers and driven by swarthy Indians in Victorian flat caps, rattle along the winding lanes. Near the old clock tower in the main street is a watch-repair shop which was started by a watchmaker from Madagascar who came here at the start of the twentieth century to cater to the fast-growing British population. The shop is now run by his great-grandson.",

The town consisted almost entirely of a complex network of white-walled lanes and passageways, many of them barely wider than your shoulders, and all of them interconnected in a wonderfully bewildering fashion, so that I would constantly find myself returning unexpectedly to a spot I had departed from in an opposing direction ten minutes before. Every few yards an iron gate would be set in the wall and through it I could glimpse a white cottage in a jungle of flowery shrubs and, usually, a quarry-tiled terrace overlooking the sea. Every few yards a cross-passageway would plunge off down the hillside or a set of steps would climb half-way to the clouds to a scattering of villas high above. I wanted every house I saw.",

Miss Painter alone seemed not only unaffected by the general perturbation but as tightly sealed up in her unconsciousness of it as a diver in his bell. To Darrow's strained attention even Owen's gusts of gaiety seemed to betray an inward sense of insecurity.

Bennie, the head of maintenance, rebuilt it. He did a fantastic job. It looks wonderful.

The Cordillera is gone from you as if it had dissolved itself into great piles of grey and black vapours that travel out slowly to seaward and vanish into thin air all along the front before the blazing heat of the day. The wasting edge of the cloud-bank always strives for, but seldom wins, the middle of the gulf. The sun—as the sailors say—is eating it up. Unless perchance a sombre thunder-head breaks away from the main body to career all over the gulf till it escapes into the offing beyond Azuera, where it bursts suddenly into flame and crashes like a sinister pirate-ship of the air, hove-to above the horizon, engaging the sea.",

(Cell phones and the Internet were many years away.) There were imported goods, mostly from China, in the tiny makeshift shops—shovels and flashlights, Golden Deer cigarettes, Long March transistor radios. But daily life was very largely a do-it-yourself affair. People farmed, fished, and hunted for their meals. They built their own houses and boats, made their own fishnets, mats, baskets, fans. They improvised endlessly. I was enchanted. I had set off from the United States with an ignorant ambition to see more of the world before it all turned into Los Angeles. There was no danger of that happening, of course, but fetching up in rural Polynesia caused my vague discontent with industrial civilization to snap into sharper focus.",

By 1743, the official name of the town had been changed to the Villa de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Guanabacoa. The high point of the year had long been a ten-day festival that combined a colorful street fair with a solemn religious procession. As a child, Mari used to portray one of a flock of petite angels that marched through the streets ahead of the statue of the Virgin that was carried on the shoulders of local men. By the time the procession ended, she’d have a painful red band around her waist where her mother had too tightly secured the belt that held on her wings.",

We waited until she turned the far corner to work on the three hidden rooms, and the instant the disinfectant splashed on the floor we darted into the room nearest the stairwell. Not only was it wallpapered, it had a television set and sofa. Now I really felt no guilt. Kandy went to one bed, I the other.

On practical matters, as well as natural ones, he was a valuable adviser. He was informed about shipping lines, the names of towns along the Congo River, and the worth of the Belgian franc in American money. He had been to the region I was especially determined to see—Lake Kivu—and he described it for me. I forgot no word of what he said that evening, because all of it was important to me, but the most striking aspect of our encounter was his placid acceptance of my intention to visit the Congo. Stewart, I found, was from Boston, whose women evidently did unexpected things—riding alone through the Andes, walking across the continent, teaching in China—without incurring the opprobrium or even attracting the attention of other Bostonians. I thought that clearly I must revise my ideas of New England; Boston was a better place than I had supposed.",
