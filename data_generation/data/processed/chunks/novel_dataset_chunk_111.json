The pub has Wi-Fi allowing me to plot out the days ahead. I am on a 3:1 schedule. If I live in my tent for three days, I give myself a roof on the fourth. Trying to find a roof in the kilometres ahead, though, is a knotty problem. I make the problem more difficult by drinking lots of beer and eating various appetisers. The Old Schoolhouse is both near the road I am taking and commended. They have a room available at a two digit price and, thankfully, a restaurant into which I book. Tomorrow is looking great. I bet the room even has heat. I curl up with my pile of books and try to lighten the load by finishing at least one. The sound of the waves that night keeps me awake, for a while, because it is so lovely I don’t want to miss it.",

Cloudbreak first bent it, opening hairline cracks across the bottom. Then, while I was riding a wave, it abruptly stripped four feet of fiberglass off the planing surface, all the way back to the fins, one of which tore out. This was in 2008, late in the week, and the swell was building. Selya, as luck would have it, had also brought an Owl to Tavarua that week as his big-wave board. His was blood-red but otherwise identical to mine. After the morning session that trashed my board, a nasty little north wind came up. It would be side-onshore, a terrible direction, at Cloudbreak. The boats stopped running. I wanted to go take a look, at least, but no one else was interested. I was suffering from the mania that Cloudbreak often infected me with. I needed to go. I talked a couple of boatmen into running me out there. Selya loaned me his Owl, in case we found something. During the run across the channel, the north wind quit and the sea went glassy. I was thrilled, though the boatmen remained noncommittal. Selya, I later learned, planted himself in a watchtower, a little shaded platform above the trees on the southwest side of the island. He kept binoculars on us the entire time we were gone.",

I don’t believe anything in the world can convince me that the creature with odd eyes slanting rain blue, dark blue at the corners is called anything.

Anna never for a moment permitted herself the delusion that she had renewed her promise to Darrow in order to spare her step-son this last refinement of misery. She knew she had been prompted by the irresistible impulse to hold fast to what was most precious to her, and that Owen's arrival on the scene had been the pretext for her decision, and not its cause; yet she felt herself fortified by the thought of what she had spared him.

His hair was iron grey, his eyebrows were still black, and his massive profile was the profile of a Caesar’s head on an old Roman coin. But his parentage was German and Scotch and English, with remote strains of Danish and French blood, giving him the temperament of a Puritan and an insatiable imagination of conquest. He was completely unbending to his visitor, because of the warm introduction the visitor had brought from Europe, and because of an irrational liking for earnestness and determination wherever met, to whatever end directed.",

The problem for us as Americans is that we are allowed only three months in the territory before we’re obliged to move on. The French and other citizens of the European Union don’t share this problem so it felt a little unfair. It’s not like FP is a small island group that you can cover in a few weeks. The territory is spread over an expanse half the size of the lower forty-eight United States. It would be impossible for anybody to cruise more than a small fraction of such a vast area in a mere ninety days, but we had given it our best shot. While some might have tried to make short visits to as many islands as possible, we took a different approach. We decided to focus on a few select places that we hoped would be representative of each island group and to experience those as fully as we could in the small amount of time we had.",

The lake was cold and clear; you could see the fish feeding like land animals on the weeds and on the lake bed, and when the sun came out every fish cast a shadow. It could be hot then, with the sun out, and woollen clothes were uncomfortable. But heat presently led to rain, and then the temperature dropped sharply. The clouds fell low over the mountains, sometimes in a level bank, sometimes shredding far into the valleys. The temple at the top of Shankaracharya Hill, one thousand feet above us, was hidden; we would think of the lonely brahmin up there, with his woollen cap and his small charcoal brazier below his pinky-brown blanket. When the wind blew across the lake the young reeds swayed; on the rippled water reflections were abolished; the magenta discs of the lotus curled upwards; and all the craft on the lake made for shelter. Some pulled in at the hotel landing-stage; occasionally their occupants went to the hut to get charcoal for their hookahs or for the mud-lined wicker braziers which they kept below their blankets. And immediately after rain the lake was as glassy as could be.",

He had bad teeth. His hair was light-brown, dry, and unruly; it stuck out in large untidy mats. He was dressed in the last cheap extreme of the dreadful fashion of the time: skin-tight trousers that ended an inch above his Oxford shoes exposing an inch of clocked hose, a bobtailed coat belted in across his kidneys, large striped collars of silk. Under his coat he wore a big sweater with high-school numerals.",

The moon was getting up and Pete’s straw hat was a dull implacable gleam slanted above the red eye of his eternal cigarette. And, yes, there was that queer, shy, shabby Mr. Gordon, mooning alone, as usual; and again she felt a stab of reproof for having neglected him. At least the others seemed to be enjoying the voyage, however trying they might be to one another. But what could she do for him?

Snow has an interesting psychological effect on the Baltis. Today it was possible to be out without gloves at 8.30 a.m., which would be unthinkable on a sunny, blue-skied morning. Yet the locals persuade themselves that it is much colder on a snowy, grey morning, and in all the Civil Supply offices groups of men were huddled miserably around smoking stoves and everybody exuded self-pity. As they snuggled deeper into their blankets, or ankle-length Gilgit cloaks, or ex-army greatcoats, they repeatedly told each other that this is the coldest day of the winter, which is almost the reverse of the truth. The explanation may of course be that as the local food supply diminishes, so does the local resistance to cold.",

For comfort they retreated to their cabins, where with tightly wedged feet they let the ship bounce and tumble. Their sensations were the sensations of potatoes in a sack on a galloping horse. The world outside was merely a violent grey tumult. For two days they had a perfect rest from their old emotions.

She had not talked to him, for when she talked the pinched, vexed look came into Mamma's face though she pretended she hadn't heard you. Every now and then Mark had looked at her over his shoulder and said, \"Poor Minx.\" It was as if he said, \"I'm sorry, but you see how it is. I can't help it.\"\nAnd just here, where the moor track touched the road, she had left them, clearing the water-courses, and had gone up towards Karva.\nShe had looked back and seen them going slowly towards the white sickle of the road, Mark very upright, taut muscles held in to his shortened stride; Mamma pathetic and fragile, in her shawl, moving with a stiff, self-hypnotised air.\nHer love for them was a savage pang that cut her eyes and drew her throat tight.\nThen suddenly she had heard Mark whooping, and she had run back, whooping and leaping, down the hill to walk with them again.\nShe turned back now, at the sickle. Perhaps Mark would come to meet her.\nHe didn't come. She found them sitting close on the drawing-room sofa; the tea-table was pushed aside; they were looking at Mark's photographs. She came and stood by them to see.\nMark didn't look up or say anything. He went on giving the photographs to\nMamma, telling her the names. \"Dicky Carter. Man called St. John. Man\ncalled Bibby—Jonas Bibby. Allingham. Peters. Gunning, Stobart Hamilton.\nSir George Limond, Colonel Robertson.\"",

This hotel is my personal AIDS prevention programme. Men away from home should have such places to stay, now more and more they want to avoid temptation. If they can have nice surroundings, good food, happy talk in the bar and no women hunting them – then they can safely travel. A year ago I told my husband we must have this sort of hotel, in time it will become popular – and already this is coming true, my hotel is getting a reputation for safety. I had to nag and nag at Percy, he didn’t want to know about the figures that put me in this mood. Sixteen AIDS deaths were reported in Mbeya in ’86. Four years later we had 1,776 reported deaths – and how many more? Now we are the third worst town in the country. That’s what made me do something, it’s crazy to say nothing can be done! If everyone does nothing, it gets like a sort of mass-suicide. If we don’t change, who will be left in twenty years? All my darling children could be dead, there are families who have lost all children … I don’t know how those parents go on living! Everyone has to do something, not only talk about how bad it is – or pretend it isn’t!’",

You do not begin to suspect its depth until you leave the beach and walk round towards the Gozanoishi Shrine, where the sand gives way to a sheer wall of boulders that descends almost vertically into the water. Apart from its depth, the circular lake – on this unseasonal August day – had nothing special to recommend it. The hills that surround it are less spectacular than those at Lake Towada and the souvenirs at the shabby restaurants were well below standard for a prefecture boastful of its handicrafts: the commonest items were plastic pinball games and replicas of yet another mystical lakeside maiden – clothed this time, but in a clinging garment that left nothing to the imagination. In the shrine a set of tinny loudspeakers endlessly broadcast a tape loop of ‘Etenraku’ – the only piece of shrine music most Japanese can recognize – and a gaggle of sightseers rinsed their hands in ritual water before lining up for a commemorative photograph.",

I found myself within a maze of shadowed hallways, musty stairwells, empty rooms. I passed through a frosted-glass door and was directed out again into another series of dark corridors. I stopped a passerby and was sent down another hallway. I found another official, and was pointed down a series of high school passageways, to a large room in which sat three small men. I asked them for a ticket to Beijing, and they pointed me out toward the station.",

    "target_paragraph": "But, as if by a refinement of cruelty, Dr. Monygham was left for months to decay slowly in the darkness of his grave-like prison. It was no doubt hoped that it would finish him off without the trouble of an execution; but Dr. Monygham had an iron constitution. It was Guzman Bento who died, not by the knife thrust of a conspirator, but from a stroke of apoplexy, and Dr. Monygham was liberated hastily. His fetters were struck off by the light of a candle, which, after months of gloom, hurt his eyes so much that he had to cover his face with his hands. He was raised up. His heart was beating violently with the fear of this liberty. When he tried to walk the extraordinary lightness of his feet made him giddy, and he fell down. Two sticks were thrust into his hands, and he was pushed out of the passage. It was dusk; candles glimmered already in the windows of the officers’ quarters round the courtyard; but the twilight sky dazed him by its enormous and overwhelming brilliance. A thin poncho hung over his naked, bony shoulders; the rags of his trousers came down no lower than his knees; an eighteen months’ growth of hair fell in dirty grey locks on each side of his sharp cheekbones. As he dragged himself past the guard-room door, one of the soldiers, lolling outside, moved by some obscure impulse, leaped forward with a strange laugh and rammed a broken old straw hat on his head. And Dr. Monygham, after having tottered, continued on his way. He advanced one stick, then one maimed foot, then the other stick; the other foot followed only a very short distance along the ground, toilfully, as though it were almost too heavy to be moved at all; and yet his legs under the hanging angles of the poncho appeared no thicker than the two sticks in his hands. A ceaseless trembling agitated his bent body, all his wasted limbs, his bony head, the conical, ragged crown of the sombrero, whose ample flat rim rested on his shoulders.",

The wild red cyclamen was out; he had seen the little tortoises hobbling from clump to clump; the air smelt strong and suddenly sweet, and the sun, striking on jagged splinters of marble, was very dazzling to the eyes. Composed, commanding, contemptuous, a little melancholy, and bored with an august kind of boredom, there he sat smoking his pipe.",

A trim man of about fifty with salt-and-pepper hair, he was the first person of Moroccan descent ever appointed to run a major Dutch city. He began to tell the story of the bombing of Rotterdam: the winds that had fanned the flames, the subsequent loss and starvation, the church that was struck by bombs but somehow remained standing. The statue of ‘a man without a heart’, the mayor said, symbolised a country that had lost almost everything but still believed in a better world; a world without war. ‘Het leven moet verder gaan,’ he said, ‘life must go on.’ A tall young woman standing next to me lit a cigarette, sending smoke curling across the crowd like a ribbon, providing a convenient excuse for all the men with watery eyes.",

He just never seemed entirely content on land, always bored and restless, always planning for his next adventure. He had become, like many who ventured to the frozen north, a pagophile—a creature most suited to life on sea ice. “It’s all right when you’re out exploring,” he said in his 1928 memoir. “You get used to rotten meat, frozen fingers, lice, and dirt. The hard times come when you get back.” He did not elaborate on the statement, but one senses that he was lonely and out of place on land, even when hobnobbing with other great men and famous adventurers at the Explorers Club. The camaraderie developed on a ship, bonding with men through shared hardships and life-or-death perils, could not be replicated back in civilization, where life was too easy.",

Since my daughter had a black angora rabbit as a pet once, I can’t look with cold eyes on the two spotted bunnies nibbling carrots in the dusty Alitalia flight bag, can’t imagine them trembling in the trunk of my car. I intend to stop at the butcher’s for a veal roast. The butcher’s is bad enough. I admit it’s not logical. If you eat meat, you might as well recognize where it comes from. But the drooped heads and closed eyelids of the quail and pigeon make me stop and stare. Rooster heads, chicken feet (with yellow nails like Mrs. Ricker’s, my grandmother’s Rook partner), the clump of fur to show the skinned rabbit is not a cat, whole cows hanging by their feet with a square of paper towel on the floor to catch the last drops of blood—all these things make my stomach flip. Surely they’re not going to eat those fluffy chicks. When I was a child, I sat on the back steps and watched our cook twist a chicken’s neck then snap off the head with a jerk. The chicken ran a few circles, spurting blood, before it keeled over, twitching. I love roast chicken. Could I ever wring a neck?",
