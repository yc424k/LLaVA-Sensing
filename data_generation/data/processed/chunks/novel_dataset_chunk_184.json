That means always getting the specialty of the house. That means smoking cigarettes I don’t smoke at the perfect corner café for hours at a time in Paris, and stripping naked for group hot-tubbing with people you don’t want to see naked in Big Sur. It means riding short, fuzzy horses that will throw me onto the arctic tundra in Iceland, or getting beaten with hot, wet branches by old naked women in stifling banyas in Moscow. When these moments happen, I get absurdly happy, like the kind of happy other people report experiencing during the birth of their children. And getting romanced by a Brazilian in Brazil, or a Cretan in Crete … this, to me, just happens to be the gold medal in the Do the Thing You’re Supposed to Do Olympics.",

Beyond the high wooden double door a vaulted passageway – wide enough for a horse and carriage – led to a quiet shrub-filled courtyard from which a curving stairway gave access to unsteady timber galleries. Off these were many small but comfortable bedrooms, each with a moody washbasin. Every evening savoury smells came from the Gypsies’ rooms, as suppers were cooked on home-made charcoal stoves.",

First, we lined it up the shelf ice to a point opposite the island, where we would try to angle down the heavy rapids and get a purchase on the island side. The dogs, meanwhile, jumped in and swam. One was a seven-month-old pup, swimming a current for the first time in her life. The choppy torrent was sparkling with sun, and her head was hard to follow. She tried to swim straight upstream, and the river—thirty-three degrees—kept moving her backward. At best, she just held even. I thought she was going to die. Finally, a bit at a time, she ferried on the current, moved sidewise, and, after a very long baptismal swim, went shaking onto the bank. Now, in the canoe, we human beings shoved into the rapid. Dick had a pole and wanted no help. We bucked on into the haystacks. “That pup was really working,” I said to Donna. “Quiet!” she replied. Her hands were wrapped around the center thwart, the knuckles white.",

The solitude did not breathe again yet; it had merely stopped watching him and was looking somewhere else, even turning its back on him, looking on away up the ridge at another point, and the boy knew as well as if he had seen him that the buck had come to the edge of the cane and had either seen or scented them and faded back into it. But the solitude did not breathe again. It should have suspired again then but it did not. It was still facing, watching, what it had been watching and it was not here, not where he and Sam stood; rigid, not breathing himself, he thought, cried No! No!, knowing already that it was too late, thinking with the old despair of two and three years ago: I’ll never get a shot. Then he heard it—the flat single clap of Walter Ewell’s rifle which never missed. Then the mellow sound of the horn came down the ridge and something went out of him and he knew then he had never expected to get the shot at all.",

He glanced up quickly and caught them in a series of sly communications: at the back of the room Sadie Feinberg, her fat neck half-turned to the right, was whispering out of the corner of her mouth to Miss Bessie Weisman; to the left Mr Sidney Osherofsky was whispering rapidly and cynically behind his hand to Mr Nathan Shulemovitch; and on the right-hand side of the room Mr Sol Grebenschik was carrying on a guttural but animated conversation with Mr Sam Vucker. Almost everyone in the class of thirty people, in fact, was either engaged in conversation or preparing to engage in conversation. Only Abe Jones and Mr Boris Gorewitz remained faithful. Mr Boris Gorewitz always remained faithful. He sat on the front row close, very close, ah, fragrantly, odorously close, too, too close to his teacher! He took notes. When beauty was revealed he smiled murkily, showing large white wet-looking teeth. When passion was indicated he looked stern and thoughtful: he was deeply stirred and polished his glasses. When some stupid question had been asked, or some opinion expressed with which he did not agree, he smiled contemptuously, shook his head violently from side to side, saying, ‘Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah!’ quite loudly and thrust his short dirty fingers vigorously and impatiently through the dry crinkly mass of hair that rushed back sproutily from his bulbous forehead, while Abe turned and glanced at him angrily, bitterly, mockingly, turning his cruel grinning Yiddish face to Eugene with a soft ‘Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!’ of contemptuous laughter.",

The kid sported a mini-mohawk and two huge Gothic-script tattoos of English words on his forearms. One said ‘PUNK’; the other said ‘FUCK’. These were the kind of tattoos that made you wish his mother had run screaming into the tattoo parlour and pulled him out of there. Red-haired David later told me he’d met Punkfuck previously at the cruising tea house under the Sule overpass. When David asked why he’d chosen those words for his tattoos, Punkfuck said that they summed him up well. He was a punk who liked to fuck.",

I was very worried about Ohatsu.’ Ohatsu is Onoe’s protégé in the drama, and Ohatsu also happened to be played by Tamasaburo in that performance. In Jakuemon’s concern for Ohatsu/Tamasaburo (it was not clear which), the onstage and offstage worlds were so intertwined as to be inseparable.",

The boat is small, his fellow passengers numbingly dull, and his cabin is claustrophobic, and noisy as a foundry. As soon as they have steamed far enough south for the air temperature to permit it, Mallory spends most mornings sitting in the bows, near where the ship’s anchors are lashed by their chains. Only the dark figure of the watchman on the upper bow-lookout, seated behind a canvas windscreen, is visible. Otherwise the bows are devoid of humanity, and this suits Mallory well, because he cannot abide humanity as it is to be found on board the Sardinia. He likes, too, the feel of the wind in his face, and to watch the wide sea and the passing land.",

His parents’ home was a cream-washed 1960s dwelling from which the younger generations had recently moved to the new ‘upstairs’. Soon, he explained, an outside staircase would replace the unnervingly flexible ladder leading to a balcony-in-progress. Sitting around a long palm-wood table (made by Ernesto, smelling new), we drank ice-cold guava juice and ate cucurucho, a toffee-like Baracoa specialty served in a cone woven of palm fibre. Our hostess listed the ingredients: grated coconut, ground cocoa beans, guava, banana, honey. The stock of cones in the fridge suggested ‘cottage industry’ but our attempt to buy half a dozen failed. Unless licensed to run a casa particular, Cubans are strictly forbidden to trade in cocoa, coffee, coconut; all must be exported to earn hard currency.",

The Palmers were on an impromptu holiday with a group of friends, had just finished a week-long trip to Amritsar and Chandigarh and were to fly out of Delhi the next day. They seized me, giving me a joint hug and a mouthful of Chris’s ponytail. I had forgotten the power of a hug: the warmth of their hands and breath prompted a prickle of tears that I blinked back in annoyance as they both beamed at me, looking like two halves of Jane.",

I thought lots of people liked an old-fashioned exterior but a modern interior. She looked sceptical. I photographed the courtyard, its wrought-iron balconies surrounding the cobbled centre. I could easily imagine it in 1944, stuffed with ragged people getting what air they could, however wintry, in this courtyard open to the sky.

And so Jang-bu is organizing a new lot of porters, who are demanding twenty-five rupees a day. Already these noisy fellows lay the groundwork for malingering at the Kang Pass—“What will you pay us if we must turn back?” They say two days are needed to prepare food and patch their clothes, and one man has been all day in our compound, sewing hard gray wool from a spindle whorl (much like the one used by the Hopi) into his calf-high woolen boots, and meditating on our gear the while.",

    "target_paragraph": "Nonna’s most essential, elemental ingredient surely was olive oil. Her woodstove was fired with the prunings; she dipped her bread in a plate of oil for toast, she doused her soups and pasta sauces with her lovely green oil. Cloth sacks of olives hung in the chimney to smoke over the winter. Even her soap was made from oil and the ashes from her fireplace. Her husband or his employee spent weeks tending the olive terraces. The old lore was to prune so that a bird could fly through the main branches without brushing its wings against the leaves. He had to know exactly when to pick. The trees can’t be wet or the olives will mildew before you can get them to the mill. To prepare olives to eat, all the bitter glucoside must be leached out by curing them in salt or soaking them in lye or brine. Besides the practical, a host of enduring superstitions determine the best moment to pick or plant; the moon has bad days and good. Vergil, a long time ago, observed farmers’ beliefs: Choose the seventeenth day after the full moon to plant, avoid the fifth. He also advises scything at night, when dew softens the stubble. I’m afraid Ed might veer off a terrace if he tried that.",

We walked to this building, while the chauffeur went in search of rooms; and on emerging from behind it were surprised to see our acquaintance the Governor of Maimena in the middle of an open space. Near him stood a Frank, whose polished pea-shaped pate announced him for a German. A squad of four soldiers was drawn up on one side, a knot of officers and secretaries had gathered on the other. Between them, in front of a tent approached by carpets, the German was explaining the lie of the ground to a dignified man wearing a fur hat, neatly trimmed black beard, open cricket shirt, and three fountain pens in his breast pocket.",

    "target_paragraph": "New Salem had a short and not very successful life. The original settlers intended to cash in on the river trade that passed by, but in fact the river trade did just that – passed by – and the town never prospered. In 1837 it was abandoned and would no doubt have been lost to history altogether except that one of its residents from 1831 to 1837 was a young Abraham Lincoln. So now, on a 620-acre site, New Salem has been rebuilt just as it was when Lincoln lived there, and you can go and see why everybody was pretty pleased to clear off. Actually it was very nice. There were about thirty or forty log cabins distributed around a series of leafy clearings. It was a gorgeous autumn afternoon, with a warm breeze and soft sunlight adrift in the trees. It all looked impossibly quaint and appealing. You are not allowed to go in the houses. Instead you walk up to each one and peer through the windows or front door and you get an idea of what life was like for the people who lived there. Mostly it must have been pretty uncomfortable. Every house had a sign telling you about its residents. The historical research was impressively diligent. The only problem was that it all became a little repetitive after a while. Once you have looked through the windows of fourteen log cabins, you find yourself approaching number fifteen with a certain diminution of enthusiasm, and by the time you reach number twenty it is really only politeness that impels you onward. Since they’ve taken the trouble to build all these cabins and scour the country digging out old rocking-chairs and chamber-pots, you feel that the least you can do is walk around and feign interest at each one. But in your heart you are really thinking that if you never saw a log cabin again you’d be pretty damn pleased. I’m sure that was what Lincoln was thinking when he packed his cases and decided not to be a backwoods merchant any more, but to take up a more rewarding career emancipating Negroes and being President.",

This part of the Gold Coast left me as indifferent as the other. Here my eyes were fixed on the opposite side of the road, where, most of the time, I could look out over Lake Michigan, and sometimes down at the beach. Even I could not claim that there was something like it, but better, in St. Louis. Even I could not imagine anything better to do at dusk than bowl along by Lake Michigan in the front seat of the top of a double-decker bus. The wind from that great sea was never quite like ordinary air. It had a delicious foreign smell. But the most enchanting thing about the lake was that you couldn't see to the other side.",

The New York Times recently ran a long article in which it tested a dozen family cars. It rated each of them for ten important features, among them engine size, trunk space, handling, quality of suspension, and, yes, number of cupholders. A car dealer acquaintance of ours tells us that they are one of the first things people remark on, ask about, or play with when they come to look at a car. People buy cars on the basis of cupholders. Nearly all car advertisements note the number of cupholders prominently in the text.",
