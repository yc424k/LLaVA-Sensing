It runs north/south like Arran with a slightly larger land mass and lots of wind turbines. Being a National Scenic Area has saved Arran from that fate. The tip of Kintyre is twenty kilometres from Northern Ireland and the Celtic influence is historical and linguistic. The topography of this whole region consists of large, long terrestrial fingers surrounded, or fragmented, by water. Peninsulas, islands, lochs, sounds, and dramatic scenery abound. The Kintyre Peninsula could be an island with only a small one mile isthmus between it and its next northerly connection, Knapland.",

Since it was now dinnertime, we quickly put this policy to the test, ventured out into the corridor in search of the dining room, sticking as close to one another as members of a chain gang. As we edged through the winding hallways, we found them crowded with other guests waiting to be admitted to their rooms. Finally, after many curses and collisions, we arrived at a huge assembly hall of a dining room. A sweet-faced girl was seated at a desk outside. She directed our attention to a piece of paper that said “Airpot Hotel.” Below that curious inscription were eight rows of Chinese characters. We stared at the list for a while in despair, and then the girl smiled back her understanding and motioned us to follow her into the kitchen. Proudly, she pointed to a bowl of chicken and a bowl of vegetables. And what could we have to drink? “Yes,” she said, smiling brightly. “Beer.”",

I desired a clone of the Luang Prabang Chinese model but only Thai models were available: either a mountain bike (twelve gears, $55) or an old-fashioned roadster (no gears, $40). I chose the latter, having learned in South Africa that a cheap mountain bike brings with it a bundle of troubles. Not much, I reckoned, could go wrong with a basic roadster. (Silly me – the Hare model is designed for use in and around the towns of the level Mekong valley. It is not designed to operate in mountainous areas where roads are indistinguishable from dried-up riverbeds.) I liked the trademark, a beaming hare depicted on the capacious plastic front basket and behind the strong carrier. Adjustable foot-rests were provided for the passenger. A metal stand added considerably to the weight but couldn’t be removed. Nor could an ominously soft saddle be changed; just looking at it made my bottom feel sore – and it was covered with a lamentable flowery pattern. (This was my first ever female bicycle, destined to be presented to a Lao woman friend.) The handlebar grips, of hard plastic and roughly grooved, generated spectacularly calloused palms. On all but the smoothest roads the chain-guard rattled loudly. No repair kit or tools were available; it seems cyclists are expected to be always within reach of a mechanic. My request for a preliminary oiling caused consternation. The Lao love to please and two young men turned that shop inside out: but oil there was none. Then the dealer himself arrived, considered the problem and hurried away to borrow an empty motor-oil container from a tuk-tuk driver. Picking a frangipani leaf from the gutter, he used it as a funnel, drained the container – and so Hare had her baptism of oil. Next day, visiting the Morning Market to buy warm trousers and a jacket (Houaphanh Province is high and cold) I found that 3-in-One is among the few commodities not imported.",

Gant’s roving spirit was parched for lack of travel: for Eugene, Saint Louis was a faint unreality, but there burned in him a vision of the opulent South, stranger even than his passionate winter nostalgia for the snow-bound North, which the drifted but short-lived snows in Altamont, the seizure of the unaccustomed moment for sledging and skating on the steep hills awakened in him with a Northern desire, a desire for the dark, the storm, the winds that roar across the earth and the triumphant comfort of warm walls which only a Southerner perhaps can know.",

    "target_paragraph": "On the chancel wall of the church are lively fifteenth-century frescoes by Benozzo Gozzoli of the life of the great theologian. I am surprised to see St. Monica plump, peasant-sturdy, and careworn; I always imagined that one who prayed unceasingly, as she did, for the salvation of her son, would find one’s flesh melting in the process. (I think of a life of prayer as inimical to fat.) Of all the charming frescoes, the most charming is that of Augustine chatting with the infant Jesus about the Mystery of the Trinity (that which might be remote and austere Gozzoli rendered immediate and intimate); the Child attempts to empty the sea into a puddle—much as any child might at the seashore, with a pail, or a shell—the impossibility of which convinces Augustine that the Trinity cannot be comprehended by reason alone.\nEverything You have made is beautiful, Augustine said to his God, but You are more beautiful than anything You have made. In the cloister of the Church of St. Augustine, that beauty is palpable; one feels one has entered the light and peace of God. The cloister is divided by box hedges into four quadrangular plots of land in which grow irises and tulips and palm trees and white and yellow dandelions and pink and blue wandering flowers.… How sweet, these enclosures within an enclosed opening: open/close, close/open; a cypress punctuates each of four corners. A loggia—pots of yellow flowers and geraniums—looks out over a central cistern; the scent of lilacs is pervasive, the lilacs swarm with bees. The fragrance of lilacs mingles with the fragrance of wood-smoke. I walk beneath a tree the leaves of which are the color of China tea; a cobweb brushes across my forehead. A jet plane streaks across the fragrance of lilacs; an orange-and-black cat mews piteously in the garden.\n(Were mazes an outgrowth and elaboration of these enclosures within enclosures? Why would anyone wish to complicate and convolute so simple, satisfying, and sweet a design?)\nThe sacristan plucks tenacious thorns from my coat. He is listening to a popular love song on his transistor radio in the sacristy. I light a candle and the sacristan extinguishes the flame. Even God has a riposo in Italy at lunch hour.\nMy hotel, once a palazzo, is in the Piazza della Cisterna, in the middle of which is a thirteenth-century cistern. From this piazza, through the battlemented archway, I can reach the square of the cathedral with its seven towers. I like the feel of the herringbone-patterned bricks under my thin sandals. I wander up and down steep hills, arched alleys, passing old men and women with canes. I never want to leave. My terraced hilltop room looks out over roofs and towers and blessed hills to the Val d’Elsa. I am beginning to believe the Annunciation did take place here. Art plagiarizes nature. I want to fly, as Cellini wanted to fly, “on a pair of wings made of waxed linen.” And I want to stay here, rooted, forever.",

For the first time, Sama has wanted to do something other than slide in and out of the dark jungle and watch me apprehensively from the shadows. I’ve stopped walking so many laps and just started sitting. There’s a log which I like, and I’ve been reading The Lord of the Rings aloud, just in case Sama is a nerd like me. It turns out, he is. Four chapters into The Two Towers, I watched him—careful not to let him see me watching him—slink out of the trees and come to rest, mere metres from the fence, from my log. When I kept reading and he didn’t move, I took that as a good sign. His eyes closed after a while, his cheek resting lazily on his paws. Relaxed. And I gazed at him, my heart in my mouth, as his eyelids fluttered gently in his sleep.",

The earliest recorded visit was in 1606, when a party of Dutch sailors under a Willem Jansz, or Janszoon, stepped briefly ashore in the far north (and as hastily retreated under a hail of Aboriginal spears), but it is evident that others had been there earlier still. A pair of Portuguese cannons, dating from no later than 1525, was found in 1916 at a place called Carronade Island on the northwest coast. Whoever left them would have been among the first Europeans to stray this far from home, but of this epochal visit not a thing is known. Even more intriguing is a map, drawn by a Portuguese hand and dating from roughly the same period, that shows not only a large landmass where Australia stands but an apparent familiarity with the jogs and indentations of Australia’s east coast—something supposedly not seen by outsiders for another two and a half centuries.",

For one thing, he was riding his bicycle with no hands on the wrong side of the road. (Cyclists in Japan seem not to be subject to any form of highway code. They can ride on either side of the road, on pavements, through traffic lights, and across pedestrian crossings as the mood takes them. Bicycles are the second largest cause of injuries in Japan. The first is falling down flights of steps.) For another thing, his spectacles were riveted on me, and we were deep in yelled conversation. I shouted to him to keep his eyes on the road, but no mere road was going to distract him. He was studying.",

There was no way even the most sure-footed mountain cow could have handled the downhill terrain we'd suffered, which meant there must be another route onto, and off, the plateau. We quickened our pace and soon caught up with a herd of ten cows and calves, each with a large metal bell around its neck. They regarded us with initial curiosity, then resumed their single-file trudge along the narrow track. We walked along at the rear of the clanking procession, frustrated by the slow pace of our bovine mountain guides, but afraid to overtake them in case we lost the path. We descended slowly, still unable to see our surroundings in the fog, and then began to follow a steeper uphill path, our laboured steps keeping time with those of the rear cow, and the almost hypnotic chime of their bells.",

Whether it is summer, whether it is winter, I no longer know by the moor grass, and the heath flower; only by the steam on the windowpane, or the frost on the window-pane. When the lark peels high his ring of sound and it falls through the air like an apple paring, I stoop; I feed my baby. I, who used to walk through beech woods noting the jay’s feather turning blue as it falls, past the shepherd and the tramp, who stared at the woman squatted beside a tilted cart in a ditch, go from room to room with a duster. Sleep, I say, desiring sleep to fall like a blanket of down and cover these weak limbs; demanding that life shall sheathe its claws and gird its lightning and pass by, making of my own body a hollow, a warm shelter for my child to sleep in. Sleep, I say, sleep. Or I go to the window, I look at the rook’s high nest; and the pear tree. “His eyes will see when mine are shut”, I think. “I shall go mixed with them beyond my body and shall see India. He will come home, bringing trophies to be laid at my feet. He will increase my possessions.”",

As he conducted me into his cattle-shelter-cum-guest-room I reflected that one of the strangest paradoxes of highland life is the extraordinary assurance and dignity – of a particular quality not found at all levels in European societies – which distinguishes so many of these peasants. Even in such a remote region as this, and when confronted with such a disquieting phenomenon as myself, their innate courtesy rarely fails them. Yet in many ways they are ignorant, treacherous and cruel to a degree – which has led some foreigners to dismiss their more attractive aspect as a form of deceit, or at best a meaningless routine of etiquette. But to me the two aspects, however contradictory, seem equally genuine.",

I found it fascinating to hear about how they viewed the role of women in their society. Some days, when she was not working, over warm tea and a feast of frozen fish and bread in the chum, Elena would take the time to explain, ‘In Nenets culture, women not only have mystical powers, we also have many rules and laws to follow. Anything to do with the “birth-giving” area of a woman’s body can be harmful and is considered somewhat of a taboo; because of this, we are not allowed to step over men or any of their tools. If a woman comes across one of the men’s lassos or tools on the ground, while walking through the camp, she has to walk around it?and never across it?lest she triggers incredibly bad luck for the whole tribe.’",

At dinner under the tarp, we peeled off rubber raingear and hung it from the guy lines, not to dry, impossible at 40 degrees in saturated air, but at least to air out the odor of an Italian meatball sub on a moldy bun. After scarfing down cold stew from cans, too chilly and numb to bother with real cooking and dishes, we’d take hot drinks to our tents, shucking the fly from where it was plastered to tent skin like a wet T-shirt worthy of Fort Lauderdale. Inside, we swapped wet Capilene for the drier pair, kept in a Ziploc inside the sleeping bag, somehow still damp. The wetter set went to the bottom of the bag (synthetic—a down bag would kill you) in hopes of drying it slightly before it went back on in the morning. The temptation to keep the dry pair on was great at 7 a.m., just to prolong relative comfort, but after work when there was nothing dry to change into, you’d regret it. We pulled on the damp stuff, each howling from our separate tents.",
