Talkeetna is a prime collecting point for climbers on their way to McKinley. I once saw a Japanese climber in Richard and Dorothy Jones’s store there, buying a cabbage. It was a purple cabbage and somewhat larger than his own head, which was purple as well, in places, from contusions and sunburn, and probably windburn, suffered in his bout with the mountain. On his cheek was a welted wound, like a split in a tomato. Leaving the store, he walked out of town, ate his cabbage, and slept it off in a tent. I had asked Mrs. Jones what she thought of the idea of moving the capital away from Juneau, and she said she was all for it, but she did hope the new town would not be placed near Talkeetna. “Please may they leave this beautiful section of Alaska alone,” she said. “Nature is part of us. We moved here for the out living—for the river. The capital has to have big buildings, a superhighway—and that takes care of the blueberry patches.”",

During the nights, I illuminated a masthead light while Jean Marie and Luc kept watch to stay within sight. During the day, the sky remained furiously dark as the strong current kept Varuna in a clutch that seemed, at times, to be pulling her backward. One day my taffrail log said that we had covered 100 miles and Luc’s SatNav registered 75. For every mile we plowed through the water, the current had carried us back a quarter of another. Much to my surprise, Varuna kept up with and even surpassed Thea’s speed. She was quick, which pleased me, and capable of heading several degrees farther into the wind. Luc was envious, forgetting that, for me, the performance really didn’t seem worth the discomfort of being within the confines of such a small vessel beating into the wind.",

She was at such times in real danger from his assault: she had to lock herself away from him. For from the first, deeper than love, deeper than hate, as deep as the unfleshed bones of life, an obscure and final warfare was being waged between them. Eliza wept or was silent to his curse, nagged briefly in retort to his rhetoric, gave like a punched pillow to his lunging drive – and slowly, implacably had her way. Year by year, above his howl of protest, he did not know how, they gathered in small bits of earth, paid the hated taxes, and put the money that remained into more land. Over the wife, over the mother, the woman of property, who was like a man, walked slowly forth.",

A forty-minute walk took me past nine stations. This means an absence of queues or crowds; a tourist could have spent 21 October drifting around any Cuban city or town without realising it was Election Day. On arrival voters exchange their registration cards for ballot papers, then enter a tent-like enclosure set up in a corner where they are invisible while making their marks. Thus citizens may anonymously express disapproval of or hatred for the government by spoiling their paper. A few steps take the voter from tent to ballot box, guarded by two uniformed junior schoolchildren. I watched one opening ritual. Out on the pavement, an elderly CDR member held high an empty cardboard carton while inviting any passer-by to enter the station to witness its being sealed with glue and placed on a little table between its juvenile guardians.",

It was simply a question of making Van Degen want her enough, and of not being obliged to abandon the game before he wanted her as much as she meant he should. This was precisely what would happen if she were compelled to leave Paris now. Already the event had shown how right she had been to come abroad: the attention she attracted in Paris had reawakened Van Degen’s fancy, and her hold over him was stronger than when they had parted in America. But the next step must be taken with coolness and circumspection; and she must not throw away what she had gained by going away at a stage when he was surer of her than she of him.",

    "target_paragraph": "The beautiful young Venetian woman who owns the restaurant near where we are staying is miserable with her fate. She hates Venice. She swears that everyone who lives in Venice regards it as a tomb. She’d fallen in love once with a Sardinian artist, who’d promised her another world of light and sun, but had left her, instead, with three children and no choice but to return to Venice and run the family restaurant. She is my age but looks even older than I do, and I can’t imagine the kind of man who could do that to a woman so attractive. (“He was powerful,” she says, “and I died of love in his shadow.”) Venice is conservative. The woman has had some affairs here, maybe even with some married men, but it always ends in sorrow. The neighbors talk about her. People stop speaking when she walks into the room. Her mother begs her to wear a wedding ring just for appearances—saying, Darling, this is not Rome, where you can live as scandalously as you like. Every morning when Linda and I come for breakfast and ask our sorrowful young/old Venetian proprietress about the weather report for the day, she cocks the fingers of her right hand like a gun, puts it to her temple, and says, “More rain.”",

I was standing wondering what to do when I noticed the gray light of a television filling an upstairs window of a guesthouse across the road. Hooray, I thought, someone awake, and hastened across, planning humble apologies to the kindly owner for the lateness of my arrival, and imagined a cheery conversation that concluded with the proprietress (played by Margaret Rutherford) bustling me to the kitchen table against my feebly hollow protests about inconveniencing her—“Now I won’t hear another word. You just sit yourself down, young man. Why, you must be positively ravenous after that long trip, you poor thing”—and provisioning me with a sandwich of thick-cut roast beef, a little potato salad, and perhaps a bottle or two of beer.",

His face betrayed no emotion but he agreed when I suggested that there’d be no more photos and that they could all rot in hell before we’d talk to them. The last of the convoy arrived a few minutes later. I reverted to my old trick of covering my face with my hat and shouting, ‘No photographs!’ Eddie echoed me. But as I went past I heard them all clicking away. ‘Bloody swine!’ I shouted. I was boiling, hissing with anger. Suddenly, all five foot four inches of Eddie turned around and strutted back to them. They continued clicking. He stood about three inches from one of the women’s faces and put on a truly extraordinary show. He turned himself into a perfect parody of a ravingly dangerous idiot boong, waved his stick in the air and trilled Pitjantjara at them and demanded three dollars and cackled insanely and hopped up and down and had them all confused and terrified out of their paltry wits. They’d probably been told in Perth that the blacks were murderous savages. They backed off, handing him what money they had in their pockets and fled. He walked demurely over to me and then we cracked up. We slapped each other and we held our sides and we laughed and laughed the helpless, hysterical tear-flooded laughter of children. We rolled and staggered with laughter. We were paralysed with it.",

He inherited his father’s conviction at times that the world was gathered in an immense conspiracy against him: the air about him was full of mockery and menace, the leaves whispered with treason, in a thousand secret places people were assembled to humiliate, degrade, and betray him. He would spend hours under the terrible imminence of some unknown danger: although he was guilty of nothing but his own nightmare fantasies, he would enter a class, a meeting, a gathering of students, with a cold constricted heart, awaiting exposure, sentence, and ruin, for he knew not what crime. Again, he would be wild, extravagant, and careless, squealing triumphantly in their faces and bounding along possessed with goaty joy, as he saw life dangling like a plum for his taking.",

They bark out orders, like cliché Communist bullies, yet there’s a modern twist: since they’re now a commercial airline, female flight attendants (unbearably cool and graceful) are decked out in beautiful skin-tight red dresses, high Mandarin collars, buttoned down the front and slit up the side, with black silky pyjama trousers underneath. Somehow it suggests elegance, straightjackets, and prostitution, all at once.”",

Back on board, McKinlay helped Mamen prepare a few pairs of skis, which Mamen was eager to use. They brushed the bottoms with hot pine tar to repel moisture and seal the wooden bases, and Mamen showed McKinlay how boots fit into the leather toe and heel bindings. When the pine tar dried, Mamen mixed up wax to use on the ski bases for glide, combining tar, candle wax, and gasoline. McKinlay was excited by the prospect of skiing, which he’d never tried.",

There were no more squalls, naught but fine weather, a fair wind, and a whirling log, with sheets slacked off and with spinnaker and mainsail swaying and bellying on either side. The trade backed more and more, until it blew out of the northeast, while we steered a steady course to the southwest. Ten days of this, and on the morning of December 6, at five o'clock, we sighted land \"just where it ought to have been,\" dead ahead. We passed to leeward of Ua-huka, skirted the southern edge of Nuka-hiva, and that night, in driving squalls and inky darkness, fought our way in to an anchorage in the narrow bay of Taiohae. The anchor rumbled down to the blatting of wild goats on the cliffs, and the air we breathed was heavy with the perfume of flowers. The traverse was accomplished. Sixty days from land to land, across a lonely sea above whose horizons never rise the straining sails of ships.",

    "target_paragraph": "Our yard was divided from its neighbors by a high board fence, always in need of paint. It had an occasional knothole and looked like the cartoon fences through whose holes little ragamuffins steal glimpses of baseball games. The upright planks were reinforced near the top by a ledge, on which daring children walked, balancing. In time, the fence was replaced by a low wire one—everybody who was anybody was getting wire fences— and privacy was gone in our block. You could see both ways as far as the eye could travel, and I was sorry. Progress marred our alley, too. To begin with, when I pulled myself up to stand on the rim of our ashpit and peered over a wall into the alley, what I saw was almost rural. The alley was cobbled, bounded on one side by a vacant lot and a couple of wooden outhouses and a stable. In the stable lived a horse, who kept his head resting on the lower half of his divided door and always regarded me amiably. The whole place smelled of horse, cold ashes, garbage, and open ground. But one day men appeared and dug in the vacant lot, and practically the next day a tall red brick apartment building stood on it. About the same time, the stable, shed, and horse disappeared, to be replaced by concrete and brick and glass, with a lot of earthenware pots in evidence. It must have been the back of a flower shop. In the same abrupt manner—my memory moves as jerkily as an early silent movie—the rough alleyway became smoothly paved and good for roller-skating. St. Louis changed, but it was nice.",

Now, when we had been going for five hours we made the worst crossing so far. On this bluff there were no trees, there was no vegetation and, therefore, no shade; the earth was red and burning hot and the dust swirled about us. The sun seemed to fill the entire sky like a great brass shield. In the gorge below us the river was a dirty, turgid yellow. Frequently Hugh had to stop, consumed by stomach trouble, to take what solace he could on the barren hillside. Fortunately there were no other travellers. Our men were far behind; all others had long since taken refuge from the heat of the day.",

Teresa skimmed our guidebook for last minute factoids about the old quarter while I shuffled my feet in the sand. I noticed an old woman; she wore a dusty black abaya and sat on a stone near the gate. I remembered that we had packed a lunch of sorts: those two snack boxes that we got the day before, on the bus from Hurghada. I gave the bag to the woman and walked back to the street, to find Teresa. She had thumbed through our guidebook and found a subway station marked on the map. “Let’s take the train,” she said. As we turned to walk away, I felt a tug on my elbow. The little old woman stood at my waist and bowed several times. She opened the bag of food and showed it to me, just in case I forgot how we knew each other. I’m not sure what she said, but she seemed very happy with the gift. In any other situation, I might have hugged her, but it was Egypt, and it was Friday, and it was Ramadan, so I just smiled.",

He sent me blurred photographs, taken through heat hazes, showing chalk paths disappearing over green hills into the uncertain distance. ‘Once walked,’ he wrote, ‘the old ways inhabit us. Even here, now, in the green and low south-west, I often find myself looking high for a beaten chalk path, and recalling those days of strange liberation.’ I didn’t dare ask what the friend’s crime had been that had brought such a sentence with it. One day I walked twenty-five miles with a young man called Bram Thomas Arnold who, after the death of his father, had set out from London and walked to St Gallen in Switzerland (where he had lived as a child), carrying his father’s ashes with him, sleeping in a small tent by the sides of vast alfalfa prairies and cropfields in northern France, making camp after dark and striking camp before first light in order to avoid farmers and police.",

The skirts of Miss Hudson and Miss Curry sweep by like candle extinguishers. Those are Susan’s white socks. Those are Louis’ neat sand-shoes firmly printing the gravel. Here come warm gusts of decomposing leaves, of rotting vegetation. We are in a swamp now; in a malarial jungle. There is an elephant white with maggots, killed by an arrow shot dead in its eye. The bright eyes of hopping birds—eagles, vultures—are apparent. They take us for fallen trees. They pick at a worm—that is a hooded cobra—and leave it with a festering brown scar to be mauled by lions. This is our world, lit with crescents and stars of light; and great petals half transparent block the openings like purple windows. Everything is strange. Things are huge and very small. The stalks of flowers are thick as oak trees. Leaves are high as the domes of vast cathedrals. We are giants, lying here, who can make forests quiver.’",

We continued under the arcade and at a street corner met a black woman, carrying a besom over her shoulder, who gave precise but complicated directions. (Cienfuegos’s port is vast.) I had to follow a long, unlit street, then turn this way and that – and the berth was unmarked, hard to find. My escort looked worried and was volunteering to guide me when a small lorry appeared. He stopped it with a shout, ran after it, enlisted the driver’s help – willingly given. At the ferry berth this young mulatto left his cab to assist me with my backpack and pointed out the obscure entrance. The Cubans are very couth, as a young friend of mine logically described nice new neighbours hours after learning the meaning of ‘uncouth’.",
