Pura Sakenan is a very sacred temple, and people from all over Bali come here to pray. It has one of the biggest outside fairs.",

I smiled, shook hands and told the captain that everyone on the island was very happy to see the ship arrive right on time. He smiled broadly and thanked me. If he detected any sarcasm he didn’t let it show. He asked if I wanted to buy any supplies. After hearing a listing of what was available all I took were a few cans of tinned butter and an overpriced case of Australian beer.

The channel meandered a bit, but the sticks were there, and he was able to stay in the middle of it. They completed the ten-mile run and exited the lake back into the river, which at that point was holding at about a mile wide. He had a waypoint in for Mario’s Marina and could see that they were about a mile out from it. Gillian steered while he opened and started rummaging through the cockpit locker looking for the dock lines that they hadn’t used since Key West. He also dragged out the heavy 50-amp shore power cord. Wow, he thought, shore power. No more charging the batts and watching the amp meter every day and no more water making and cockpit Sun Showers. They would have electricity to run the AC and the fridge and would have hot running water showers, and the thought of a cold beer at the bar also popped into his head.",

Passepartout sat a couple of rows behind reading a copy of 80 Questions to Understand India with his earphones wedged in. Not long after the bus departed, it rolled into a traffic jam. Less than three minutes had passed when the men began to stand up in their seats, sigh and climb down for a better look. They smoked with one knee up on the walls, held hands or skidded down the slopes to pee in the trees.",

The sun sank ever closer to the horizon, silhouetting the distant mass of Bigelow’s highest summit, Avery Peak, against the lavender sky.",

The weather was calm enough for him to leave with Kataktovik as well, but he wanted first to see these men off and then make sure that everything in camp at Icy Spit remained in order, and that his instructions for everyone after his departure were clear and would be followed. With the wind settling down to a gentle breeze, Munro led them out with sixteen dogs and one sled. Everyone came out to see them off, shouting, “Good luck!” and “Godspeed!” Bartlett knew it was a risk. The sea had opened and nearly swallowed Kuraluk’s entire family on the other side of the ice wall, but given the amount of food that might still be available at Shipwreck Camp, and their finite rations here, it was a risk Bartlett felt was worth taking.",

    "target_paragraph": "Our friend insisted that we must rest and eat at her home; I daresay we both looked what Rachel graphically describes as ‘Whacko’. We were led around the edge of another enormous maize-field, mercifully level, to a two-storey adobe house, red-tiled and substantial – though what we glimpsed of the interior was filthy and chaotic. For the visitors, wobbly home-made cane chairs were placed outside the kitchen-hut in the small yard, overlooking an untidy but gay flower-garden. Through the doorless entry to the kitchen we could see and hear the fire being blown by our kneeling hostess. Her dirt-encrusted young, aged two and four, were playing rather half-heartedly on a floor strewn with maize-husks and egg-shells. Their two-month-old baby brother died recently of dysentery. As we ate mounds of boiled maize, topped by two fried duck eggs each, our hostess apologised repeatedly for having no rice – the prestigious grain – but we assured her, truthfully, that we prefer maize. Meanwhile several hens and ducks, and a large brown dog and a small black kitten were in hopeful attendance on us. By the time we’d finished eating the sun’s rays were so fierce that one kind girl, seeing us dripping sweat, moved our chairs into the shade while our hostess was brewing mugs of delicious herbal tea that gave us an extraordinary ‘lift’ – God knows what was in it. None of these girls spoke more than a few words of Spanish, yet we were restored as much by their caring attitude as by the sustenance they provided. We have become so used to being ignored by campesinos that our gratitude for this cherishing was extra-keen.",

Those wrecked and rescued were well treated, often for very long times since no regular communication existed as John Sands, a journalist, discovered when stranded on Hirta in 1876. Vessels generally did not call at the islands in winter. Sands noticed that canes were washing ashore, deduced an ocean current, and began experimenting with throwing messages into the ocean. When nine Austrians were shipwrecked, the experiments moved from “entertainment” to “survival” since the resources of the islanders were severely constrained. Sands felt starvation was not far away. He and the Austrians constructed a canoe from a log, tied on a pickle bottle with a letter asking the Austrian Consul for help, and tossed it in the sea. A second message was attached to a buoy. The buoy arrived in Birsay, Orkney in nine days. The canoe, in Poolewe in twenty-two days. Help came and the “mail boat” system was born. An average of four of six mail boats launched from St Kilda reached a destination, including the final mail boat sent before the islanders left for good. It landed three months later in Norway.",

The sky behind it was full of the splintered glories of the descending sun, and before long she expected to hear Harney’s bicycle-bell in the lane. He had bicycled to Hamblin, instead of driving there with his cousin and her friends, so that he might be able to make his escape earlier and stop on the way back at the deserted house, which was on the road to Hamblin.

They are built in the same style as the Secretariat itself, with red bricks and yellow cornices, but it is possible to see these structures at closer range. Black stains drip like spilled ink from the rain-soaked roofs. Bare light bulbs dangle on wires hung over the decrepit door frames. Most of the window panes are broken and have been replaced by corrugated iron or pieces of cardboard. Dotted between the buildings are small vegetable patches. Chickens peck among the weeds, and a few pigs can be seen half-sunk in mud. At night the Secretariat dissolves into darkness and is visible only as a hulking black silhouette, like the ghostly mansion of a Gothic fairy tale. In the foreground, among the ruins that lie along the edge of the compound, soldiers and their families cook their evening meals over camp fires.",

Jacksonville was part of a movement called “spiritual warfare” or “spiritual mapping,” which held that Christians should attack “territorial spirits” sent by Satan. Christians needed to locate the source of their community’s evil and cast it out, through prayer. I later read literature he recommended, which spoke of hitting “satanic command and control centers” with “smart bomb praying.” In some cities, prayer targeted a gang, or a non-Christian cult, or the teachings of a liberal college. In Jacksonville, it was aimed at the long-ago slaughter of French Protestants by Spanish Catholics.",

And her success amused and exhilarated her so much that, even tonight, though she had come down oppressed with problems, they slipped from her before she even had time to remind herself that they were nonexistent. She had only to look at the faces gathered about that subdued radiance of old silver and scattered flowers to be sure of it. There, at the other end of the table, was her husband’s dark head, comely and resolute in its vigorous middle-age; on his right the Marchesa di San Fedele, the famous San Fedele pearls illuminating her inconspicuous black; on his left the handsome Mrs. Herman Toy, magnanimously placed there by Pauline because she knew that Manford was said to be “taken” by her, and she wanted him to be in good-humour that evening. To measure her own competence she had only to take in this group, already settling down to an evening’s enjoyment, and then let her glance travel on to the others, the young and handsome women, the well-dressed confident-looking men. Nona, grave yet eager, was talking to Manford’s legal rival, the brilliant Alfred Cosby, who was known to have said she was the cleverest girl in New York. Lita, cool and aloof, drooped her head slightly to listen to Torfried Lobb, the composer; Jim gazed across the table at Lita as if his adoration made every intervening obstacle transparent; Aggie Heuston, whose coldness certainly made her look distinguished, though people complained that she was dull, dispensed occasional monosyllables to the ponderous Herman Toy; and Stanley Heuston, leaning back with that faint dry smile which Pauline found irritating because it was so inscrutable, kept his eyes discreetly but steadily on Nona. Dear good Stan, always like a brother to Nona! People who knew him well said he wasn’t as sardonic as he looked.",
