Also, even at night when the sun has faded, streetlights and headlights from oncoming traffic leak into the sleeper compartment. Some drivers are awakened by the cigarette smoke produced by their co-driver, if it makes them cough. Or if the ventilation is on the blink, the compartment may feel too warm or too cold, depending on the time of year. Co-drivers stopping frequently can be a nuisance, too. But the granddaddy of all sleep-depriving phenomena on a truck must be NOISE!",

While Isabela seemed to be the island of iguanas, and Santa Cruz the island of baby sharks, San Cristobal is definitely the island of sea lions. There are hundreds upon hundreds of them, and they are everywhere. I never realized the multitude of weird sounds they make – barking, burping, roaring. It is hilarious listening to them having a conversation back and forth. After dark, when they start falling asleep all over the town, it’s like seeing passed-out drunk frat boys. You’re walking along and there next to a trash can, lying in a puddle of pee, is a sea lion totally passed out on its back with one flipper draped over an empty whiskey bottle.

My resignation was tendered. Finally I would return to New York. After two years, I would be leaving the Kingdom. I would be returning to the real, free world, where I could be valued as a woman once more. I felt a warm sense of satisfaction.\nOutside, the vapid, mid-afternoon heat strangled the rooftop apartment. This was now to be my last Saudi September, my last months of buffeting desert breezes, my last dusty days shrouded, suffocating in black polyester.\nDownloading email, I savored the anticipation of contact with the real world. The television was on. The nostalgic sound of Katie Couric soothed me. NBC seemed to be running the same news item. Glancing at a single smoldering tower, staccato sirens insistently pulled me to the screen.\nMoments later, any nostalgia drowned in swirling currents of horror. Scrambling to the phone, I began dialing numbers to reach friends in New York City. For me, 9/11, moments before, had been a day of freedom and beginnings. Instead, my American future was now supplanted by the fearful vacuum arrived in plane-shaped arrowheads that sheared our world in two. The terror had come like an arrow through its quarry. I was reminded of the chilling Hadith which now in these moments seemed prophetic. It was ascribed as the words of the Prophet when asked what he feared most for his followers:\nThey recite the Quran and consider it in their favor but it is against them",

A flock of goats trail over the beach near the lapping wave's edge, dismally. Great wide deserts of stony river-beds run down to the sea, and men on asses are picking their way across, and women are kneeling by the small stream-channel washing clothes. The lemons hang pale and innumerable in the thick lemon groves. Lemon trees, like Italians, seem to be happiest when they are touching one another all round. Solid forests of not very tall lemon trees lie between the steep mountains and the sea, on the strip of plain. Women, vague in the orchard under-shadow, are picking the lemons, lurking as if in the undersea. There are heaps of pale yellow lemons under the trees. They look like pale, primrose-smouldering fires. Curious how like fires the heaps of lemons look, under the shadow of foliage, seeming to give off a pallid burning amid the suave, naked, greenish trunks. When there comes a cluster of orange trees, the oranges are red like coals among the darker leaves. But lemons, lemons, innumerable, speckled like innumerable tiny stars in the green firmament of leaves. So many lemons! Think of all the lemonade crystals they will be reduced to! Think of America drinking them up next summer.",

He took one hundred dollars from his savings, converted it to five twenty-dollar bills dated 2013 or later as the Jamaican embassy in Havana required. After the flurry of excitement in the wake of Obama’s visit and the changes he brought in, the United States had a new president, and suddenly some of the old worries about relations between the two countries began to creep back in. Donald Trump was a businessman who was said to have been interested in building in Cuba, but in the middle of his campaign he had started to side with the Cuban old guard in Miami, whose vote could be decisive. Then, in January 2017, just before leaving office, President Obama had pulled the plug on the wet foot, dry foot policy that had been established in the wake of the chaotic summer of 1994. Under that policy, Cubans who set foot on U.S. soil without a visa were put on a fast track to receive permanent residency.",

Examining the gorge walls at this point, and remembering how the bridge was built, one understands why Victor von Hagen wrote: ‘The Incas, living on a neolithic cultural horizon tied to stone tools, still conceived a communication system that stands extremely high in comparison with the Romans who had three thousand years of experience to draw on … An Inca road is in many respects superior to a Roman road. The Apurimac Bridge, for example, was part of a highway which came from heights the like of which no Roman had ever seen. The passes the Romans conquered were as nothing compared to those in the Andes; Mont Blanc, the highest peak in Europe, is 15,800 feet high; yet here in Peru we walk over Inca roads built at this height’. The most detailed description of the Huaca-Chaca’s structure was given by Garcilaso de la Vega, the Cuzco-born part-Inca historian who wrote: ‘The Apurimac Bridge has its pillar support made up of natural rock on the Cuzco side; on the other side is the stone tower, made of masonry. Under the platform that holds this tower, five or six large wooden beams are inserted as thick as oxen – they stretch from one side to another, placed one higher than another like steps. Around each of these beams, each of the suspension cables is twisted once so that the bridge will remain taut and not slacken with its own weight, which is very great’.",

They flew over fabulous, gin-clear sand flats of the most beautiful, light turquoise water. They pulled Big Dink up on the beach and waded and swam in the warm waters. It wasn’t hard to see why this place was a favorite sailing destination. Even though it was winter, they were only nine degrees north of the equator, and the heat and Caribbean humidity were really stifling. The tropical water made it bearable.",

He slanted his body to keep it headed for the elm, repeating to himself again and again: “I know we can fetch it”; and little phrases she had spoken ran through his head and danced before him on the air. The big tree loomed bigger and closer, and as they bore down on it he thought: “It’s waiting for us: it seems to know.” But suddenly his wife’s face, with twisted monstrous lineaments, thrust itself between him and his goal, and he made an instinctive movement to brush it aside. The sled swerved in response, but he righted it again, kept it straight, and drove down on the black projecting mass. There was a last instant when the air shot past him like millions of fiery wires; and then the elm …",

According to regulations, he should have stopped for a ten hour break, leaving the cattle hungry and thirsty in the trailer that entire time. Some of those cattle would have perished from neglect due to heat and dehydration. The driver didn’t think that the right thing to do so, well able to make the delivery, he brought the cattle in and got fired for his efforts. In his case, no mercy, he had deliberately gone over his hours. Maybe such things should be judged on a case-by-case basis where the humane treatment of animals is concerned.",

He was blind as a bull, and she swooned in anguish, only little veins streaking her white cheeks red. Now though they pass plates of bread and butter and cups of milk at tea-time I see a crack in the earth and hot steam hisses up; and the urn roars as Ernest roared, and I am blown out hard like the pyjamas, even while my teeth meet in the soft bread and butter, and I lap the sweet milk. I am not afraid of heat, nor of the frozen winter. Rhoda dreams, sucking a crust soaked in milk; Louis regards the wall opposite with snail-green eyes; Bernard moulds his bread into pellets and calls them “people”. Neville with his clean and decisive ways has finished. He has rolled his napkin and slipped it through the silver ring.* Jinny spins her fingers on the table-cloth, as if they were dancing in the sunshine, pirouetting. But I am not afraid of the heat or of the frozen winter.’",

She dosed his evening whiskey with poison and whisked it into his prune whip (a feature of the affair much dwelled on by reporters). When that failed to slow him, she added crushed sleeping pills to the concoction, gave him bichloride of mercury tablets on the pretext that they were a healthful medicine, and even tried gassing him, but the unwitting Albert Snyder proved obstinately indestructible. In desperation, Ruth turned to Judd Gray. Together they devised what they conceived to be the perfect murder. Gray caught a train to Syracuse and checked into the Hotel Onondaga, making sure that plenty of people saw him, before slipping out a back way and returning to the city. While he was away he arranged for a friend to go to his hotel room, muss the bed, and otherwise make it look as if the room had been occupied. He also left the friend with letters to mail after his departure. His alibi thus securely in place, Gray traveled to Queens Village and presented himself late at night at the Snyder house. Ruth, sitting up in the kitchen in her soon-to-be-famous scarlet kimono, let him in. The plan was for Gray to creep into the marital bedroom and smash in Albert’s skull with a sash weight that Ruth had placed on the dresser for the purpose. Things didn’t work out quite as planned. Gray’s first blow was timidly experimental and served only to wake the intended victim. Confused but considerably enlivened at finding a strange, small man leaning over him and tapping him on the head with a blunt instrument, Snyder cried out in pain and grabbed Gray’s necktie, choking him.",

Not a word was mentioned about his actual political views, which were anything but aligned with Castro’s regime. With a unanimous show of hands, it was settled. Arturo Montoto became a candidate for delegate in the municipality of Guanabacoa. He had his photograph taken, and he provided facts for the single-page biography that was the only campaign literature any candidate was allowed to prepare. He could not hold any campaign rallies. He was prohibited from running ads in the newspaper, and he was not given any opportunity to appear on TV to outline any program. In this version of Cuban elections, voters had to make their decision solely on the biographies posted at the voting places.",

    "target_paragraph": "In Vientiane, when I paid a farewell visit to Mrs Bounyong, she told me about a bird sanctuary established some eight years previously by villagers who linked a drastic drop in the local fish population to a lack of those birds whose droppings nourish fish. (The birds had of course been eaten.) A specially created lake and a headman’s ‘preservation order’ had the desired effect; hundreds of herons and bitterns settled nearby and the fish increased and multiplied and filled the lake. It is drained every March, when the fish are sun-dried and divided between the ban’s ninety families. In 1996, a foreign eco-NGO got wind of this enterprise and were astonished that illiterate villagers had proved capable, sans outside advice, of diagnosing what was wrong and retrieving the situation. Then they were affronted by the villagers’ polite but firm refusal to allow them to set up ornithologists’ observation platforms – another ecotourism project, to raise funds for that NGO. As Marie had observed in another context, Lao peasants could teach their government ministers a thing or two about rejecting foreign meddling. Sadly, a forest fire had recently broken out near this ban (Chinese loggers were blamed) and as some 300 men struggled to fight the flames a tiger appeared – less than forty miles from Vientiane. Mrs Bounyong feared that the misfortunate animal, deprived by the blaze of his natural prey, might soon kill a buffalo or a person and therefore be himself killed. Or the Chinese loggers might shoot him for his body parts.",

The teeth, the wild eyes, the long red gullet, stooped at him, framed out of a swirled rigidity of forelock and mane, the entire animal floating overhead in monstrous deliberation. The air was filled with furious wings and the four crescent-glints of shod hooves as, still screaming, the horse vanished beyond the ravine’s lip, sucking first the cow and then himself after it as though by the violent vacuum of its passing. Earth became perpendicular and fled upward—the yawn of void without even the meretricious reassurance of graduated steps. He made no sound as the three of them plunged down the crumbling sheer, at the bottom of which the horse rolled to its feet without stopping and galloped on down the ditch and where he, lying beneath the struggling and bellowing cow, received the violent relaxing of her fear-constricted bowels. Overhead, in the down draft of the ravine, the last ragged flame tongued over the lip, tip-curled, and vanished, swirled off into the windless stain of pale smoke on the sunny sky.",

Someone sent me upstairs. On the landing I came upon a barefooted group seated on the stone floor. At first I thought they were playing cards: it was a popular Bombay pavement pastime. But they were sorting parcels. Their spokesman told me I had been misdirected; I needed the building at the back. This building, from the quantity of ragged clothing seen in one of the lower rooms, appeared to be a tenement; and then, from the number of broken chairs and dusty pieces of useless furniture seen in another room, appeared to be a junk-shop. But it was the place for unclaimed baggage and was therefore the place I wanted. Upstairs I stood in a slow queue, at the end of which I discovered only an accountant.",

But after the two days Horace appeared again, and those who sat close to the stage remarked an expression of beatific happiness on that young acrobat's face even when he was twisting breathlessly in the air an the middle of his amazing and original shoulder swing. After that performance he laughed at the elevator man and dashed up the stairs to the flat five steps at a time—and then tiptoed very carefully into a quiet room.",

Renaissance doors pierced walls of ancient brick, upper storeys jutted in salients of carved timber and glass, triangles of crow-steps outlined the steep gables, and eagles and lions and swans swung from convoluted iron brackets along a maze of lanes.

This unlikely group settled at Santarem, at the confluence of the Amazon and Tapajos Rivers, with high hopes of becoming rich as planters. The experience proved disastrous. Their crops repeatedly failed, and tropical fevers carried off three members of the group in the second year and two more in the third. By 1875, only Wickham and his wife remained. The other survivors had gone back to England.",
