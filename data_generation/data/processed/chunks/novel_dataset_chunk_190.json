As the car that was taking him to Exeter roared down the winding street, under the hot green leafiness of June, he heard, as from the seadepth of a dream, far-faint, the mellow booming of the campus bell. And suddenly it seemed to him that all the beaten walks were thudding with the footfalls of lost boys, himself among them, running for their class. Then, as he listened, the far bell died away, and the phantom runners thudded into oblivion.",

I didn’t want to delude myself, to make myself believe that and to count on it. What if I didn’t make it tomorrow? I had been walking slowly, had lost my way, had wasted a lot of time. Anyway, the Indians made the walk during the dry season. And they probably were better hikers than I. Maybe a four-day walk for them is like a seven- or eight-day walk for me. It made sense. I stopped thinking about the next day, but deep in my heart I fervently hoped that I would find the village. What a wonderful surprise that would be.",

We quickly passed by the Shot Bar, the icky kebab place, icky pizza place, Full Moon Thai Massage place, and turned onto Dohany street, which means tobacco – which is what this area was all about long ago.",

Its creepy picture of the little girl with a missing finger was the only other face around. We had stumbled on a Technicolour ghost town, or at the very least the set of a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, where the whole town would suddenly fling open the bright orange shutters and leap through the pink doorways in chorus. But for now there was no sign of human activity. It was late afternoon and the sun blazed down from a low, china-blue sky, chalk-marked with wisps of cloud, as we set off on a hunt for signs of life.",

Besides, by this stage I was so fit, I was virtually immune to cold and pain. My threshold had reached absurd heights. I had always been jealously in awe of people (particularly men) who could hurt themselves, and pretend they didn’t feel it. Now I was the same.

Andrews, through the provinces of Yugoslavia between the two World Wars, she encountered and wrote about ethnic fears and prejudices among the people she met. “There was imminent the Balkan feeling of a shiftless yet just doom,” she wrote in Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, a meditation on the destiny of modern man, with a haunting relevance to events today. An insightful, sensitive observer of the Balkan people (“their choice of destiny might be made on grounds so private as to mean nothing to any other human being”), West was especially equipped to write of the dark, inscrutable side of these peoples, who are now engaged in brutal civil war.\nThe following excerpt is about Mostar, a Muslim town bombed extensively during the current war. West was a writer of novels, histories and criticism, but she received her greatest praise for Black Lamb. She was educated in Edinburgh and died in England.",

For the airy elevation of its spell tempted us all to overlook the one inescapable fact of our presence here: that the Chinese, by most accounts, had decided to open up the “autonomous region” not out of charity, nor out of genuine penitence, but for purely strategic reasons, both military and economic. They knew very well that Westerners could not resist paying any amount of money to penetrate the world’s last secret, and they were hardly blind to the power of public relations. Thus, by opening up Tibet, Beijing was apparently hoping to give proof to the world of its enlightened tolerance; and by flocking to Tibet, we were in effect giving legitimacy to this show of good intentions. In our determination to be one step ahead of everyone else, we were like the vanguard of some invading army that, by racing ahead, is the first to trip the mines.",

One old man kept putting his boot to his ear as though he were listening to sea-sounds in a shell and each time his face lit up. The noise of talk, bursting out in squabbles or giggles on a higher note and then subsiding again to a universal collusive whisper, rippled through the place with a curious watery resonance. The groups were reduced in scale by the size and the height of the enormous room. They seemed to cluster and dissolve like Doré figures swarming and dwindling all over the nave of some bare, bright cathedral – a cathedral, moreover, so remote that it might alternatively have been a submarine or the saloon of an airship. No extraneous sound could pierce those high bare walls. To those inside them, everyday life and the dark strife of the city outside seemed equally irrelevant and far away. We were in Limbo.",

So were the exposed mountaintops I’d crossed despite lightning, hail, and rain falling so thickly I could only see a few feet. In the days behind me, I’d cried thinking my hike was over too many times to count. Yet always the magic of the mountains—whether crane, porcupine, moose, or river—had reassured me that all was not lost. And now, having released myself from my schedule, I was moving forward faster than ever. I had to let go of my own expectations in order to find out what I was truly capable of doing. Despite the hardships, I felt afire with hope. Anish was finally ready to embrace the Appalachian Trail in all her rocky, wild, forested glory.",

Although the British Government was one of the first to recognize the new Communist regime, provocations of many kinds were practised upon the colony during the People’s Republic’s uneasy years of confrontation with the West. In May 1962, when things were particularly hard in China, 70,000 refugees were suddenly let loose across the border without warning, terrifyingly straining the colony’s resources of food and housing. And in 1967, when the British Embassy in Beijing was sacked by activists of the Cultural Revolution, the most violent riots Hong Kong had ever known were incited by events across the frontier. Mobs roamed the streets waving red flags, brandishing the Thoughts of Chairman Mao and massing in their thousands outside the gates of Government House, which were stuck all over with propaganda leaflets.",

Then two sturdy beaming nurses hopped me into a ward where only crab-wise movement was possible between the four narrow beds. Two patients shared one small locker; there was no other furniture. Each bed had a rock-hard mattress, a meagre lumpy pillow, stained and torn sheets and one threadbare blanket; during winter, families provided extra bedding.

It seemed incredible to him, as he fondly looked down at her when they were in the bright warm sunshine on the ferry, that he had actually attained his heart’s desire and got Catherine. Life was splendid–packed with possibilities, a thing of the utmost magnificence. The waters of the Solent danced and sparkled; white wings flashed out of the deep blue of the sky; the sun lay hot across the back of his neck; the wind was fresh and salt in his face; the world looked as it must have looked on the morning of its first day. Old Lewes–he would go and dig out old Lewes to-morrow, and make him come and lunch in one of those jolly little restaurants where the food was good and ladies didn’t go, and yarn his head off. And on Saturday he would take Catherine down and introduce her to his uncle, who would certainly adore her, and she would wander about the garden and enjoy her darling little self while he gave the old boy the round of golf he knew he was thirsting for. So was he thirsting for it. His honeymoon had been wonderful, but a fortnight is enough. It wouldn’t of course be enough, and one would never then want it to end, if one were going to be torn from one’s beloved when it was over. But here they were, he and she, entering into the joys, the varied joys of married life, with him, the male, girding up his loins in the morning and going forth to labour until the evening, as men from time immemorial had girded themselves and gone forth, and coming back at night to his nest and his mate. And this after all was better in the long run than a honeymoon, just as real good bread and butter was better than everlasting cake.",

Already the child was whimpering, so I could hardly say ‘no’, and he beamed delightedly when lifted on to the sacks.

Then there was another dull boom. A man on a ladder who was painting the windows of one of the houses paused with his brush in his hand and looked round. A woman who was walking along carrying a loaf of bread that stuck half out of its paper wrapping stopped too. They both waited as if for something to happen. A topple of smoke drifted over and flopped down from the chimneys. The guns boomed again. The man on the ladder said something to the woman on the pavement. She nodded her head. Then he dipped his brush in the pot and went on painting. The woman walked on. Crosby pulled herself together and tottered across the road into the High Street. The guns went on booming and the sirens wailed. The war was over1 – so somebody told her as she took her place in the queue at the grocer’s shop. The guns went on booming and the sirens wailed.",

Japan maintained ‘peace in the marketplace’ by supporting cartels which set prices high, to the disadvantage of the consumer. It avoided competition in communications or the film industry by restricting the number of companies involved in service industries. And through every possible means, the impact of the outside world was kept to a minimum: foreigners were not allowed to run companies here, to design or construct buildings here, to make movies here, etc. It worked all too well. Because of the high wall of regulation and the cozy systems which exclude them, foreign firms are now giving Japan a miss as they move into the rest of Asia. The president of a firm specializing in computer services based in Dallas recently told me that his company is considering Vietnam, Thailand, China and Malaysia – but not Japan. ‘It’s not worth the brain damage,’ he said.",

The canyon floor averages about fifty feet in width but the curving walls are at least five times that high, without benches or ledges, sheer, monolithic and smooth as if carved in butter, paralleling each other in a sort of loosely jointed ball-and-socket fashion, each concavity matched by a corresponding convexity on the opposite wall. And all this inspired by the little stream that swings through the rock and the centuries – truly a perfect example of what geologists call an entrenched meander.",

Some poems are useful one way, some poems another (she ran to catch the trolley) and I used one poem. “Thou hast forgotten she chanted in an undertone as she slid into a side seat, “O summer swallow” and I’m glad it’s empty this time. “Do not spit on the floor” she read and “Wear Washable Whalebone” and “Extra, Extra, Extra” a boy shouted and “All about the big fire” above the rumbling wheels.

With any sense of modesty long departed, I removed my sweat soaked t-shirt, and felt the perspiration course down my torso and gather at the waistband of my shorts.

If we can just make it ashore, we can go on from here by foot and easily bypass the canyon overland to Curiplaya.’",

The town of over two thousand inhabitants might have been deserted; the pale sickle of a new moon, a sky luminous with stars, circle after circle of shuttered huts. The place had an eerie air after Nicoboozu and Duogobmai, where music and dancing, laughter and cries went on till midnight, for it was not yet nine. But as we returned up the path out of the forest and flashed our torches on the town, we lit up two human figures who were standing silently outside the devil’s hut. Perhaps the devil had set a watch on Zigita to see who moved or peeped, because for some time after we returned to the rest-house we could hear feet moving in the compound, lightly stirring in the dust outside. As we undressed the devil’s music began in Zigita, the pulse of a drum. We turned out the lamps and lifted the screen from the window which faced the town, but there was nothing to be seen from the direction of the devil’s hut; no lights moved. ‘When once,’ Saki wrote, ‘you have taken the Impossible into your calculations its possibilities become practically limitless.’ We had the creeps that night; there were no doors and anyone could slip into the house under the mosquito-screens. I very nearly took the automatic out of the money-box to load it; only self-consciousness prevented me.",

    "target_paragraph": "Undine had supposed that on her marriage one of the great suites of the Hôtel de Chelles would be emptied of its tenants and put at her husband’s disposal; but she had since learned that, even had such a plan occurred to her parents-in-law, considerations of economy would have hindered it. The old Marquis and his wife, who were content, when they came up from Burgundy in the spring, with a modest set of rooms looking out on the court of their ancestral residence, expected their son and his wife to fit themselves into the still smaller apartment which had served as Raymond’s bachelor lodging. The rest of the fine old mouldering house—the tall-windowed premier on the garden, and the whole of the floor above—had been let for years to old-fashioned tenants who would have been more surprised than their landlord had he suddenly proposed to dispossess them. Undine, at first, had regarded these arrangements as merely provisional. She was persuaded that, under her influence, Raymond would soon convert his parents to more modern ideas, and meanwhile she was still in the flush of a completer well-being than she had ever known, and disposed, for the moment, to make light of any inconveniences connected with it. The three months since her marriage had been more nearly like what she had dreamed of than any of her previous experiments in happiness. At last she had what she wanted, and for the first time the glow of triumph was warmed by a deeper feeling. Her husband was really charming (it was odd how he reminded her of Ralph!), and after her bitter two years of loneliness and humiliation it was delicious to find herself once more adored and protected.",

Not so much the motions of it, not where the wolf walked and how long it took and what I thought when it disappeared. But I remember its eyes reflecting light, how the shoulder muscles undulated beneath the thick beginnings of its winter coat. I remember that it didn’t run. It never seemed wary, or curious. Not canny, smart, devious, or fierce. We crossed its path and it regarded us briefly before making its way toward pups in a den, a deer kill buried in a hole, or miles more hungry walking under the slim moon. That night, whether because of culture or nature, my wishful tilt toward wildness or an evolutionary hunch, I felt the borders of physicality and transcendence shift until one allowed the other in, and when the wolf slipped into the woods, I wanted to follow it. I wanted to dip my face to the river to drink, tear flesh with my teeth, flatten myself a bed of needles with a circling pace before sleeping. Never mind the blood on my face. Never mind the cold.",

It climbed briefly, before winding for hours from mountain to mountain through cool forest – a few pines, mostly a tangle of unfamiliar trees and shrubs. Sometimes ground-creepers formed trip-wires and vine-swathes hung at face level and the birds – rarely visible – were numerous and melodious. Then came an open plain where a sandy track showed – not recent – traces of equine traffic. No trees remained, only hundreds of stumps and occasional charcoal-burning residues amidst low, red-leaved bushes, slender saplings and tall clumps of delicately tinted flowers – ideal bird-watching territory. Of the half-dozen species on view I could identify only hawks, woodpeckers and finches. I mistook the cartacuba for the zunzuncito – the smallest bird in the world, weighing one-fourteenth of an ounce. As cartacubas make wrens look burly this was an understandable error. Several of these exquisites flashed by me and at noon, when I had been sitting motionless beside a bush for some moments, one perched a mere yard from my face. I could see its eyes glinting, its long needle-like beak, its emerald back and crimson throat. That made my day.",

He explains that this is a community of families who share a shop and a school, and run tours to the local caves for income. The group of houses is tucked into the base of a steep canyon, with the only exit being that rickety bridge and then the steep dirt road out. Talk about being isolated.",

At the walls we tethered the donkey, and also its fellow brute, a grey mule bearing cold water in a massive clay amphora stopped with carob leaves. Precipitous paths and flights of steps led up through chapels, halls, cisterns, dungeons, to the topmost platform and its sentinel tower. Below the gleaming silver crags and stunted green-feathered pines, the mountain fell three thousand feet to the coastal plain, an endless panorama of rusty red speckled with myriads of little trees and their shadows, beyond which, sixty miles away across the blue sea, appeared the line of Asia Minor and the Taurus Mountains.
