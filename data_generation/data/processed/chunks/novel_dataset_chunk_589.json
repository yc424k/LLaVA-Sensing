Halfway down the staircase Mother overtook me, registering anxiety; I must conceal the box in my shoulder-bag, not let it be seen on the street as I left this building.",

Charis explained that, in Greece, only the family must attend the vigil. So, the night before the funeral, they left him alone there lamenting. When the village was asleep, he gave the dead man a shake, and Panos sat up scattering the flowers and stepped from the candles. Then, hop! they were out of the window and away over the steppe with a new suit and a hat full of cash to the good! After a hundred versts or so, on the outskirts of a new village, Panos climbed on Charis’s back again and they headed for the market place. . . . They were very fond of Russia.’",

It was as near perpendicular as a slope can get without actually being a rock climb. Slowly and laboriously we picked our way between and over boulders, using our hands as much as our feet. Combined with our exertion, the cloying heat was almost unbearable. I found I had to stop every ten or twelve yards to draw breath and wipe burning sweat from my eyes. I was swimming in heat, bathed in heat, swaddled in it. I drank three-quarters of a bottle of water on the way up and used much of the rest to wet a bandanna and try to cool my throbbing head. I felt dangerously overheated and faint. I began to rest more frequently and for longer periods, to try to cool down a little, but each time I set off again the heat came flooding back. I had never had to work so hard or so tiringly to clear an Appalachian impediment, and this was just the first of a series.",

As time went on, the terps were extended and joined together to form the first dikes: muddy sea walls reinforced with straw, household waste, wood and even cow hides. In 57 BCE, when the Romans invaded what would later become the Netherlands, the terp-dwelling Frisians were one of the few tribes in Europe successfully to resist Roman conquest. The edge of the empire was demarcated by a string of riverside army camps, with bridges and canals enabling troops to move quickly when a rebellion broke out.",

Torrential rain followed a dazzling display of jagged lightning. At 5.15 we were told to ‘confirm’: the bus was on its way. Another ledger demanded everyone’s details before our train tickets could be stamped on the back (twice, by different clerks) for bus use. When the Astro coach arrived at 6.40 the torrent had dwindled to a trickle – just enough to dampen the next queue, by the bus door. On a front seat sat the conductress, a uniformed middle-aged mulatta whose task it was to enter all our details in her mini-ledger before admitting us. As I waited, poised on the lowest step, she queried two ID photographs and long arguments ensued. (One beard had disappeared, one shaven head had grown hair). While my details were being inscribed I stowed my rucksack on the overhead rack where it fitted easily. But the conductress insisted it must go in the hold, at which point my adaptability to the Cuban way of travelling was almost over-taxed. I wanted to stamp my feet and shout at this bully. Around the open hold passengers were queuing to have their luggage tagged, a reasonable security precaution. One ancient man had a battered cardboard carton in a plastic sack tied with twine. The tag wouldn’t stick to the plastic and it took his trembling fingers several minutes to undo the knots – during which time the driver refused to tag anyone else. We departed at 7.05 and ten minutes later, at a traffic lights pause, two men boarded, slipped the driver a NP10 note and took empty seats at the back – unregistered and ticketless.",

    "target_paragraph": "She started with a top-to-bottom cleanup. Three decades after it was taken over by the state, the plant was a mess. Windows were cracked. The roof leaked. Trash and discarded aluminum were everywhere. She applied one of her mother’s lessons about stretching a peso. Zenaida kept everything—buttons from old shirts, zippers from jackets—and reused them. The aluminum stamping process was far from foolproof, and Novalum’s aging equipment guaranteed lots of mistakes. Defective pots and pans were removed from the production line, and the workers had gotten into the habit of taking them home either to use or, more likely during the special period, to sell. In backroom crucibles all over Havana, lopsided jugs were melted down and made into trim pieces for old American cars or other hard-to-come-by items like TV antennae. Cary put a stop to all that, instructing the workers to collect the defective pieces in one place. She then sold the batches of aluminum to a state enterprise that exported the scrap. She used the proceeds to fix Novalum’s roof, replace broken windows, and repair aging machinery. Workers resented the move because it deprived them of desperately needed income. But officials took note of what she was doing, and, as was usually the case, working with the system had its rewards.",

His own taste was in the line of less solid and more highly-seasoned diet; but hunger makes any fare palatable, and there had been times when Mr Stepney had been reduced to a crust.",

As the boys led us through narrow, rough, unlit streets, where only feeble lamp-light glimmered in living-room windows, a brilliant half-moon sailed into view. So my first battle with my own weird knots was by moonlight. We have tethered Juana to a huge fallen cactus trunk: the earth is too loose and dry for the picket to be trustworthy.

They had taken a large, high-ceilinged, one-room metal building that had been some type of aircraft hangar or storage building in times past and partitioned the middle area of it into two small classrooms. You could walk all the way around the outside of the classroom structure while inside the large building. The plywood-walled rooms were dwarfed by the huge space they sat in—little open-top boxes sitting inside a big box. The children could look up and see the underside of the metal roof far above.",

Feet pass the shop, men come ghostwise from the fog's thick mantle, are for a moment born, are men again, are heard upon the pavement, then, wraithlike, vanish into fog, are ghosts again, are lost, are gone. The proud, the mighty, and the titled of the earth, the lovely and protected, too, go home--home to their strong and sheltered walls behind the golden nimbus of other lights, fog-flowered.

As she had answered her husband's previous appeal by her flight to the woman he disliked, so she answered this one by riding the horse he feared.... Justine's last illusions crumbled. The distance between two such natures was unspannable. Amherst had done well to remain away...and with a tidal rush her sympathies swept back to his side....",

He was all sunburn, of the sort a blond takes on when his skin does not peel. His long yellow hair was burnt, so was his beard, which sprang from a soil unploughed by any razor.

The smell of fresh-cut grass filled our noses. Teresa posed for a few photos with the pyramids as her backdrop. A gardener stopped to enjoy our photo shoot. He waved and smiled then leaned over and returned to work. We crossed the garden, toward a thick row of hedges that stood between us and the road that led up to the pyramids. From that vantage point, about five or six feet above street level, we could see most of the pyramid complex including the ticket booths, security checkpoints, crowds, camels, and horse-drawn carriages that mingled around the plateau. I leaned over the hedges to take more photos of the pyramids.",

I like details.” When his friend next came up to Lima, Paolo arranged for them to visit the old hospital grounds. “She starts sensing things, and she zeroes in on the patio. Then she pulls out this special dowsing thing. I gave her a piece of chalk and said, ‘Mark the ground.’ She starts making marks, x x x x x x x. Then she says, ‘This must be wrong?it’s a shape about a meter long. How can he be a meter tall?’ I said, ‘Incas were mummified in a sitting position.’” They found three possible mummies, one of whom Paolo surmised had been cremated. Paolo took a photo of the three sites and then the two of them marked up the patio with fifteen more body shapes with chalk x’s to hide their discovery. “It looked like the crime scene for a mass murder.” He was concerned that time might be running out?the charity that administered the hospital grounds had begun leasing out lots for commercial purposes.",

My mind would wander as we explored the steppes. And the wind on my face, as I rode in this magical setting, added to the overwhelming feelings of well-being and happiness inside me. Ultimately, the horseback riding was just phenomenal. Some days we would meander along rocky ridges, passing herders and their flock along the way and on other days we would traverse pristine streams and rivers, taking in the wide, blue skies, open spaces, magnificent snowy mountains and untouched lakes. On occasion, we would come across ancient petroglyph carvings, which illustrated the development of culture in Mongolia over a period of 12,000 years. The earliest images reflected a time when the area was partly forested and the valley provided a habitat for hunters of large game. Later images show the transition to herding and a horse-dependent, nomadic lifestyle as the dominant way of life?a real archaeologist’s dream and a fascinating catalogue of the evolution of life in the region.",

A primitive farm table, left in the limonaia, becomes our dining table on the front terrace. We sit outside talking late about the restoration, savoring the Gorgonzola with a pear pulled off the tree, and the wine from Lake Trasimeno, just a valley away. Renovation seems simple, really. A central water heater, with a new bath and existing baths routed to it, new kitchen—but simple, soul of simplicity. How long will the permits take? Do we really need central heat? Should the kitchen stay where it is, or wouldn’t it really be better where the ox stall currently is? That way, the present kitchen could be the living room, with a big fireplace in it. In the dark we can see the shadowy vestiges of a formal garden: a long, overgrown boxwood hedge with five huge, ragged topiary balls rising out of it. Should we rebuild the garden with these strange remnants? Cut them out of the hedge? Take out the ancient hedge altogether and plant something informal, such as lavender? I close my eyes and try to have a vision of the garden in three years, but the overgrown jungle is too indelibly imprinted in my brain. By the end of dinner, I could sleep standing up, like a horse.",
