We have been most successful against those Nandi who broke out of the reserve … When it was just light enough to shoot we surprised a party in a hollow not more than forty yards from us. I at once ordered rapid fire and the whole party of thirteen were shot down … By this time Wilson had reached the vicinity and the enemy was completely surrounded. They lost thirty-two killed. I took my position on Chebarus Hill, whence I could overlook the operations … [which] … I hope will convince the Nandi of the futility of breaking out of their reserve … We effected a complete surprise, finding many of the enemy still in their huts. We killed nineteen Nandi and captured thirty-four. We also bagged 542 sheep and goats. We had two men wounded. When natives are surprised like this they have little heart for opposition, especially when they find themselves surrounded. Having taught these Nandi their lesson we came on to Nandi Fort in the evening.",

Dave was a dear friend and loved to sail. He had a summer place on Cape Cod and owned a small boat that he kept on the Potomac for twilight sails that they both enjoyed over the years. But Dave loved Lone Eagle because she was a traditional boat whose design was based on the North Sea rescue boats. Dave loved the warmth of the teak and oil lamps below and the feel of her big tiller and the tear-drop shaped cockpit. Rail down with cold beers in their hands, and the summer just seemed to melt away.",

Like air hostesses, residents of Baarle-Hertog and Baarle-Nassau traversed international borders almost continuously, sometimes travelling from Belgium to the Netherlands and back again just to cross the street in front of their homes. Within the towns many services were duplicated, with two electrical systems, two postal services, two police departments, even two mayors. Each house apparently paid taxes in the country where its front door was located, so – as The Ultimate Guide to Offshore Tax Havens advised moguls – houses on the border needed only to move their front doors in order to cut their tax bills. For Dutch people used to shops remaining closed on Sundays, living a few metres from Belgian stores was another obvious advantage. According to one legal textbook, police officers had sometimes even used buildings on the border to interrogate witnesses, who could sit in the same room as their questioners but in another country, safe from fear of arrest.",

Then he had been unknown and starving; now he had a name, had friends, a roof over his head, and a wife who adored him; yet his inner solitude was deeper than ever. Was the fault his, or was it latent in this dreadful system of forcing talent, trying to squeeze every drop out of it before it was ripe; the principle of the quick turnover applied to brains as it was to real estate? As he walked, the old dream of the New York novel recurred to him: the jostling crowds, the swarm of motors, the huge arrogant masses of masonry, roused his imagination, and he thought to himself: “Tarrant’s right; what a fool I was to talk poetry to him!” He stood on a corner of Fifth Avenue while the motors crawled up and down in endless procession, and looking into one slowly moving carriage after another he wondered what sort of a life each of these women (they were almost all women) led, where they were going, what they were thinking of, what other lives were interwoven with theirs. Oh, to have a year to dream of it all, without putting pen to paper! But even a year would not be enough; what he needed was to immerse himself in life without so much as remembering that it must some day bring him in a return, to live as carelessly as all these women rolling past him in their motors. . . .",

Yesterday's dream had come more than true, at once, at the beginning of the evening. He had come straight to her with his friend, not dancing, not looking for a partner. They were in the little green enclosure with her. The separating curtains had fallen back into place.\nBehind the friend who stood leaning against the far end of the piano, the massed fernery gleamed now with the glow of concealed fairy lamps. She had not noticed it before. The fragrance of fronds and moist warm clumps of maidenhair and scented geraniums inundated her as she glanced across at the light falling on hard sculptured waves of hair above a white handsome face.\nHer music held them all, protecting the wordless meeting. Her last night's extremity of content was reality, being lived by all three of them. It centred in herself. Ted stood within it, happy in it. The friend watched, witnessing Ted's confession. Ted had said nothing to him about her, about any of them, in his usual way. But he was disguising nothing now that he had come.\nAt the end of her playing she stood up faintly dizzy, and held out towards Max familiar strangeness hands heavy with happiness and quickened with the sense of Ted's touch upon her arm. The swift crushing of the strange hands upon her own, steadied her as the curtains swung wide and a group of dancers crowded in.\n\"Don't tell N.B. we've scrubbed the coffin, Miriorama — she'll sit there all the evening.\"\n\"That was my sister and my future brother in-law,\" said Miriam to Max as Harriett and Gerald ran down the steps and out into the dark garden.\n\"Your sister and brother-in-law,\" he responded thoughtfully.\nHe was standing at her side at the top of the garden steps staring out into the garden and apparently not noticing the noisy passers-by. If they stood there much longer, Ted, who had not been dancing, would join them. She did not want that. She would put off her dance with Ted until later. The next dance she would play herself and then perhaps dance again with Max. Once more from the strange security of his strongly swinging arms she would meet Ted's eyes, watching and waiting. She must dance once more with Max. She had never really danced before. She would go to Ted at last and pass on the spirit of her dancing to him. But not yet.\n\"I will show you the front garden,\" she said, running down the steps.\nHe joined her and they walked silently round the side of the house, through the kitchen yard and out into the deserted carriage drive. She thought she saw people on the front lawn and walked quickly, humming a little tune, on down the drive.\nMax crunched silently along a little apart from her, singing to himself.",

By midmorning the wind had blown most of the straggling storm clouds away, and in the subdued breeze flocks of white cumulus drifted lazily over the hills casting round blimplike shadows. Most of the drive-ins I passed were closed for the holiday. Near one – the Oasis – a ragged little procession of dark-suited men picked its way up a hillside behind a brown-robed priest. One man carried a white wooden sotoba stick of the kind that are planted in clusters behind a grave; another carried a bunch of wilting yellow flowers.",

I can see the Alberto, slow, laboured, yet with a kind of pristine simplicity in all his movements, that touched his fat commonplaceness with beauty.

A female, this ancient grandmother of a tree may be three hundred years old; growing very slowly, the juniper seldom attains a height greater than fifteen or twenty feet even in favorable locations. My juniper, though still fruitful and full of vigor, is at the same time partly dead: one half of the divided trunk holds skyward a sapless claw, a branch without leaf or bark, baked by the sun and scoured by the wind to a silver finish, where magpies and ravens like to roost when I am not too close.",

Naipaul, say, the jungle is seldom a force of magic, and if it is, it speaks for a magic that is only pushing back and down the clear daylight world of reason. Those born to nature seldom have to go back to it. Yet in Bali all these ideas are upended. Bali is a magical world for those who can see its invisible forces and read all the unseen currents in the air (that woman is a leyak witch, and that shade of green portends death). Yet for everyone else, it is simple enchantment. We stand at the gates of Eden, looking in, and choose to forget that one central inhabitant of the Garden is a snake.",

The most renowned find, the Kensington Stone in Minnesota, bore a runic inscription that told of Goths and Norwegians who journeyed there from Vinland. Countless other runes cropped up across the heartland, as far away as Heavener, Oklahoma. How and why the seafaring Norse had traveled to landlocked states was never made clear.",

The great building, shining with lights, loomed above a tranquil sea; music drifted out from it, and on the side toward the sea its wide terrace was thronged with ladies in bright dresses, and their partners. Boyne walked up among them; but as he reached the terrace a drizzling rain began to fall, and laughing and crying out the dancers all hurried back into the hotel. He stood alone on the damp flagging, and paced up and down slowly before the uncurtained windows. The dinner was over—the restaurant was empty, and through the windows he saw the waiters preparing the tables again for supper. Farther on, he passed other tall windows, giving on a richly upholstered drawing-room where groups of elderly people, at tables with shaded lamps, were playing bridge and poker. Among them he noticed a stout lady in a low-necked black dress. Her much-exposed back was turned to him, and he recognised the shape of her head, the thatch of rippled hair, silver-white now (she had kept her resolve of not dyeing it), and the turn of her white arms as she handled her cards. Opposite her sat her partner, also white-headed, in a perfectly cut dinner-jacket; the lamplight seemed to linger appreciatively on his lustrous pearl studs and sleeve-links. It was Mr. Dobree, grown stouter too, with a reddish fold of flesh above his immaculate collar. The couple looked placid, well fed, and perfectly satisfied with life and with each other.",

Many faranjs condemn the treatment which highland women receive from their husbands, but my own impression is that most couples show a normal degree of mutual affection and consideration. Highland tradition undoubtedly gives women a lowly status in some respects, as is symbolised by their carrying of loads in a country where I have never yet seen a man carrying anything but his dula or rifle – and perhaps an injara-basket, if he is not accompanied by his wife. However, it is unfair to deduce from this that most men always treat their wives callously or that there is no such thing as a henpecked highland husband. In at least two tukuls on my route I have noticed that the unfortunate head of the household lived in constant dread of his overbearing wife and became almost as subdued as a highland child when she was present.",

In fact, President Ayub’s strongest psychological card in the political game is probably his genuinely felt link with the ordinary village people, and his understanding of them is no doubt one of the reasons why he doesn’t repeat the fatally unrealistic mistake of trying to run Pakistan as thought it were a Western democracy. Islamic countries have their own traditional type of democracy which, as I mentioned a few days ago, President Ayub is now attempting to revive in Pakistan. Whether the flair for accepting a drastic change of status with such natural dignity is due to the democratic aspects of Muslim philosophy or to the sense and sensibility of the individuals concerned it is difficult to know, but this characteristic certainly makes for a very pleasant social atmosphere.",

At 11:45 P.M. on New Year’s Eve, I walked to the most powerful of the calvarios, being careful to avoid the evidence of black witchcraft, lit a white candle I’d purchased in the chapel, and began to pray over the couple in Hebrew. It seemed normal to them, and oddly normal to me. I wasn’t afraid. I prayed from my heart, using gestures and words Ana had taught me, but filtered though my own upbringing. In a language that didn’t seem alien coming from my lips, I prayed and prayed and prayed.",

On the high ground of the spit, no more than a few feet above the water, grasses and mosses grew sparsely. Near the end of the spit was a cabin made of drift boards, a flattop structure smaller than a two-car garage. A radio aerial extended twenty-five feet above its roof, with a second, shorter aerial alongside. As the taller aerial moved back and forth, it provided the only visible indication, besides the waves, of the force of the wind. A small drift-board storage shed flanked the cabin at one corner. Inland, a green tundra plain stretched away into the clouds and fog. At a cleft between two hills close by, where the river emerged, a steady breath of steam went up, evidence of the hot spring that gave the river its name.",

He deftly used his underdog status to reinforce the perception that Dutch politics was a stitch-up that paid little attention to the wishes of the working man. ‘He made politics simple,’ one friend told me years later, unable to hide the warm glow of admiration in her voice. As Fortuyn denounced Islam in ever more strident terms, many Dutch were appalled, but many others were entranced. By one estimate, Fortuyn at one point garnered as much media coverage as the sitting prime minister, minister of justice and the leaders of the two largest opposition parties put together. Fortuyn’s no-nonsense conservatism proved capable of uniting what the Dutch called kerk en kroeg: the people sitting in the country’s churches and those propping up its bars. There was also something typically Dutch about Fortuyn’s undisguised pride in his country and its culture. Wealthy, flashy and openly gay, he was an unlikely champion of the Dutch working classes, but epitomised a f**k-the-establishment attitude that endeared him to many in Rotterdam. ‘Ik zeg wat ik denk en ik doe wat ik zeg!’ he declared. ‘I say what I think and I do what I say!’",
