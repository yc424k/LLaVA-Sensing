At any rate he was probably the first to roll down them without his head, having been literally torn to pieces on the Campidoglio. That was after a seven years’ exile and a triumphant comeback of two months, and it happened to the shout, as terrible as the war cries of the barons, of “Popolo! Popolo!”—the same who had drunk from the horse’s nostrils, and who would die laughing; after which they left him hanging headless for two days outside the church of San Marcello on the Corso.",

They listened in astonishment to Noville’s account of their flight, but they couldn’t report America’s arrival to the world because the town had no telephone or telegraph service between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. It was daylight by the time Byrd and his men managed to return to the beach and check their plane, and they found that the locals had dragged it onto dry land. Less helpfully, the same locals were now plundering it, as they might a shipwreck. Six men were staggering up the beach under the weight of one of the large motors. Byrd prevailed upon them to bring the motor back, but other parts of the plane were permanently missing, including a forty-foot strip of fabric bearing the plane’s name. The missing strip was later reported to be hanging on the wall of the casino in Deauville. The plane was never reassembled. All that remains of it today are a few tattered fabrics in a glass display case in a museum in Ver-sur-Mer. The forty-foot strip appears to have vanished permanently.",

I was so exultant I ran straight to the clump of eucalyptus trees in the middle of the park (where they say an ancient temple used to stand, honoring the god Ganesh—the remover of obstacles) and I threw my arms around one of those trees, which was still warm from the day’s heat, and I kissed it with such passion. I mean, I kissed that tree with all my heart, not even thinking at the time that this is the worst nightmare of every American parent whose child has ever run away to India to find herself—that she will end up having orgies with trees in the moonlight.",

His body shook and shuddered as if quivering in the wake of the very landslides, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions that had forged the topography of his homeland. With sweat staining his shirt, causing the flag around his neck to cling to his skin, he seemed in the moment, as Xandra would later remark, to be not only the cultural heart of his community but the very personification of his nation, a living symbol of all that makes Colombia great.",

The eyeglass fell from his perturbed eye: this gave him actually an expression less perturbed, but, in revenge, the hairs on the back of his scalp grew suddenly untidy. Sylvia, wavering along beside her husband, held out her long arm and careless hand. Macmaster winced almost at the contact, as if his fingers had been pinched in a vice. Sylvia wavered desultorily towards Edith Ethel, who was suddenly small, insignificant and relatively coarse.

Our train was making a steady twenty miles per hour through taiga mixed with hayfields. During the night a heavy frost had covered the countryside. It rimed the leaves of the birch trees, some of which had already turned yellow, and made the needles and knobby branches of a tree I took to be a larch a soft white. At this speed I could see the trackside weeds curved like shepherds’ crooks by the spiderwebs attached to them, the frost on the web strands glistening in the sun. When the tracks went around a bend, the rest of the train was revealed extending far ahead. Our vagon was the second-to-last car. A broad hayfield we passed had just been cut. The short stubble, all frost-white, lay like carpet among the haystacks spaced regularly across it. In the cool morning air, the top of every haystack was steaming, and each wisp of steam leaned eastward, the direction we were going.",

Wodehouse, Eddie Cantor, George M. Cohan, and, for a time, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald all had homes there, as did a few more louche types, like the mobster Arnold Rothstein. This was the world of The Great Gatsby, published two years earlier. Sands Point, where the Guggenheims clustered in three substantial houses, was the wealthy East Egg of the novel.",

The return bus broke down, so he didn’t get back until evening. Meanwhile, I geared up for the cold, put on my snow-tire boots, and explored the town. The day was sunny, clear, and calm. By taking occasional breaks inside warm public places, I had no difficulty staying outside for long strolls. Beyond the central administrative area, the town looked ramshackle, like a Western mining town. On some of the houses, sections of railroad cars had been used to add a room, or repairs had been improvised with sheets of corrugated iron. Most of the buildings in town were blocks of apartments, usually four stories high. I sat in front of one for a while and sketched the many kinds of antennae on its roof. In ninety minutes of sketching, I froze so I could no longer draw and had to start walking again. On a hill above town, I came upon the ruins of an amusement park with carnival-type rides lying around in pieces, and benches and walkways deep in snow. In a sort of cove of benches near one dismantled ride, a group of teenage girls and boys were smoking cigarettes and drinking from plastic liter-bottles of beer. The gust of alcohol breath and cigarette smoke and pheromones that came from them was more pungent for being concentrated by the cold.",

If the track petered out into dust bowls with drinking spots in the middle of them, it was relatively easy to find where it continued on the other side. The camels were going well and behaving like lambs. Life was good. The country I was travelling through held my undivided attention with its diversity. This particular area had had three bumper seasons in succession and was carpeted in green and dotted with white, yellow, red, blue wildflowers. Then I would find myself in a creek-bed where tall gums and delicate acacias cast deep cool shadow. And birds. Everywhere birds. Black cockatoos, sulphur-cresteds, swallows, Major Mitchells, willy-wagtails, quarrian, kestrels, budgerigar flocks, bronze-wings, finches. And there were kunga-berries and various solanums and mulga apples and eucalyptus manna to eat as I walked along. This searching for and picking wild food is one of the most pleasant, calming pastimes I know. Contrary to popular belief, the desert is bountiful and teeming with life in the good seasons. It is like a vast untended communal garden, the closest thing to earthly paradise I can imagine. Mind you, I wouldn’t want to have to survive on bush-tucker during the drought. And even in the good season, I admit I would prefer my diet to be supplemented by the occasional tin of sardines, and a frequent cup of sweet billy tea.",

Ecstatically I pedalled or pushed (mainly pushed) Lear around mountain after mountain, never able to guess at the configuration of the terrain around the next shoulder. This was a gloriously unpredictable range, in contrast to some African landscapes where it can seem as if the Creator ran out of ideas on whichever day they were created.

The flank of the Church in question was the Order of the Good Shepherd, founded in Angers. Sheila Cassidy was placed under the care of Good Shepherd nuns when she was imprisoned in Santiago in 1979. She was a British doctor, and she had been arrested in a house belonging to the Columban Fathers for treating a wounded revolutionary. The housekeeper was murdered and Sheila Cassidy was taken away and repeatedly tortured. Later, after three weeks in solitary confinement, she was moved to Tres Alamos prison. There were eighty other women there with her, and on Christmas Day they stood on tables at the appointed hour of ten in the evening and sang songs like Take Heart, Joe, My Love’ to prisoners in the men’s jail over the spiked concrete wall. The men were waiting, and shortly their song of reply drifted across, faint on the wind. The British ambassador took Sheila Cassidy a Harrods’ Christmas cake.",

It swelled, tightening, stretching out her wounded flesh.\nShe knew that the little man they called the doctor was really Mr. Hancock. They oughtn’t to have let him in. She cried out, “Take him away. Don’t let him touch me”; but nobody took any notice.\n“It isn’t right,” she said. “He oughtn’t to do it. Not to any woman. If it was known he would be punished.”\nAnd there was Maggie by the curtain, crying.\n“That’s Maggie. She’s crying because she thinks I killed her baby.”\nThe ice-bag laid across her body stirred like a live thing as the ice melted, then it settled and was still. She put her hand down and felt the smooth, cold oilskin distended with water.\n“There’s a dead baby in the bed. Red hair. They ought to have taken it away,” she said. “Maggie had a baby once. She took it up the lane to the place where the man is; and they put it behind the palings. Dirty blue palings.\n“. . . Pussycat. Pussycat, what did you there? Pussy. Prissie. Prissiecat. Poor Prissie. She never goes to bed. She can’t get up out of the chair.”\nA figure in white, with a stiff white cap stood by the bed. She named it, fixed it in her mind. Nurse. Nurse—that was what it was. She spoke to it. “It’s sad—sad to go through so much pain and then to have a dead baby.”\nThe white curtain walls of the cubicle contracted, closed in on her. She was lying at the bottom of her white-curtained nursery cot. She felt weak and diminished, small, like a very little child.\nThe front curtains parted, showing the blond light of the corridor beyond. She saw the nursery door open and the light from the candle moved across the ceiling. The gap was filled by the heavy form, the obscene yet sorrowful face of Connie Pennefather.\nHarriett looked at it. She smiled with a sudden ecstatic wonder and recognition.\n“Mamma——”",

A full 2-metre gap stood between the crowd and the edge of the platform, so we darted in front and parked ourselves in the space.

And one day, as he threaded his way through rush-hour traffic, a Saudi Arabian cabbie gave me a thirty-minute introduction to Mormonism. Everyone is hyphenated here, and the melting pot has been nothing if not vigorously stirred: the first time I opened up the Buenos Aires Herald, I found a picture of a schoolteacher at “St. Paul’s College, Hurlingham,” with the inimitable, and thoroughly Argentine, name of Margarita Churchill Browne de Gómez.

The bed was made up, but there was a strange girl in a mini-skirt sitting on it, while my aunt leant out of the window waving and blowing kisses. The girl and I looked at each other with embarrassment. We could hardly speak and interrupt this ceremony of separation. She was very young, perhaps eighteen, and she was elaborately made up with a chalk-white face, dark shadowed eyes and long auburn hair falling over her shoulders. With the strokes of a pencil she had continued her eyelashes below and above the lids, so that the real eyelashes, standing out, had a false effect like a stereoscopic photograph. Her shirt had two buttons missing at the top as though they had popped off with the tension of her puppy fat and her eyes bulged like a Pekinese dog’s, but they were pretty nonetheless. They had in them what used to be called by my generation a sexy look, but this might have been caused by short sight or constipation. Her smile, when she realized that I was not a stranger intruding into my aunt’s compartment, was oddly timid for someone who looked so flagrant. It was as though someone else had dolled her up to attract. She was like a kid tethered to a tree to draw a tiger out of the jungle.",

I was taken to a stale smelling room, where a succession of officials came to peer at me through a small glass window in the door.

I had fallen among GaKgapane’s élite, unwinding on a Saturday afternoon: the supermarket owner and his wife, three teachers, a factory manager, a nurse, a police officer and the librarian who became over-excited when I introduced myself. At once he rushed away to fetch a dog-eared copy of Muddling Through in Madagascar for autographing. That boosted my self-esteem: you have to be famous if one of your books is in GaKgapane’s public library.",

Once they passed the cliffs, the going got smoother. Corrigan pointed in different directions, sometimes inland and sometimes out to sea, carrying on a long monologue, perhaps about his harpooning days or hunting exploits. Bartlett listened, but he understood only the occasional word. Corrigan got very animated as he yelled above the skidding sled and racing dogs, and Bartlett nodded back, pretending to comprehend. After hours of this, Corrigan realized that Bartlett couldn’t understand him, and he clapped his hands to his head and made a gesture of desperation and despair. Bartlett just laughed, deeply amused by his efforts.",
