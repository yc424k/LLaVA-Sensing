    "target_paragraph": "The Greeks are famous for their financial acumen. Their knack of spinning the air into gold is mercifully unpolluted by its accompanying blemish: meanness is scorned and almost non-existent; they prize and practise generosity whether or not they can afford it, and the laws of hospitality are as deeply rooted as the most sacred feelings of patriotism or Orthodox pietas. I think the Greeks have a much sharper awareness than Western Europeans of the flux of events and the instability of human affairs. In spite of interludes of Romaic sloth and procrastination, they feel compelled to take time by the forelock, exploit favourable currents and wrest fortune from unpromising circumstances’, a tendency which can lead to bold and sudden undertakings and sometimes to opportunism. They have the keener sense, which poor and barren countries instil, of the existence of disaster and tragedy. But, though they may see many things in tragic and melodramatic terms, stoicism and humour are at hand to deflate them. Humour, indeed, runs through their whole story in a saving lifeline. Similarly the self-imposed code of philotimo, or private honour—a whole apparatus of ancestral scruples—mitigates anarchic impulses and sets a codifying bridle on Romaic short-cuts and personal solutions. To contravene these laws marks the offender with a more shameful and indelible brand than any sanction that the law can inflict.",

It is not solid; it gives me no satisfaction—this Empress dream. It leaves me, now that it has fallen, here in the passage rather shivering. Things seem paler. I will go now into the library and take out some book, and read and look; and read again and look. Here is a poem about a hedge. I will wander down it and pick flowers, green cowbind and the moonlight-coloured May, wild roses and ivy serpentine.* I will clasp them in my hands and lay them on the desk’s shiny surface. I will sit by the river’s trembling edge and look at the water-lilies, broad and bright, which lit the oak that overhung the hedge with moonlight beams of their own watery light.* I will pick flowers; I will bind flowers in one garland and clasp them and present them—Oh! to whom?* There is some check in the flow of my being; a deep stream presses on some obstacle; it jerks; it tugs; some knot in the centre resists. Oh, this is pain, this is anguish! I faint, I fail.* Now my body thaws; I am unsealed, I am incandescent. Now the stream pours in a deep tide fertilizing, opening the shut, forcing the tight-folded, flooding free. To whom shall I give all that now flows through me, from my warm, my porous body? I will gather my flowers and present them—Oh! to whom?",

It is the place of the forenoon housewives with their shapeless gingham dresses, bare legs, slippers, turbaned heads, bare, bony, labor-toughened hands and arms and elbows, and the fresh, clean, humid smell of houses airing in the morning. It is the place of the heavy midday dinners, the smells of roasts of beef, corn on the cob, the deep-hued savor of the big string beans, cooking morning long into the sweet amity and unction of the fat-streaked pork; and above it all is the clean, hungry, humid smell and the steaming freshness of the turnip greens at noon.",

When we turn the camera lights on we’re mobbed. A man sticks his small smiling sons under each of Jonathan’s armpits and a group stands directly behind him as starstruck and frozen as Marcia in the game show episode of The Brady Bunch. The only one who is slightly animated slowly and carefully picks his nose. Just as Jonathan delivers a decent take, a tiny plump woman jumps into the shot, puts on her spectacles and begins to recite a poem she’s written, called “Ode to a Hostage.”",

On the upper two floors, there are two bedrooms on either side of the stairs; you must go through the first room to get to the other. Privacy, until recently, wasn’t much of an issue for Italian families. Even Michelangelo, I recall, slept four abed with his masons when he worked on a project. In the great Florentine palazzi, you must go through one immense room to get to the next; corridors must have seemed a waste of space.",

It was far harder work than I had imagined and the heat was terrific; almost at once my goggles steamed up, making it difficult to see anything. I pushed them up on my forehead and was blinded by the reflected light and flying chips of ice.",

The upper Yukon now is considered “full,” saturated with settlers, all space reserved—roughly one person for every five miles. Not everyone on the river gathers for the equinox. Some are not tribally inclined. I was in the Yukon Trading Post in Circle one time when a man about forty came up over the riverbank and bought six bottles of Worcestershire sauce, twelve packets of yeast, a case of matches, some Spam, sardines, hot dogs, three pounds of tea, a hundred and fifty pounds of sugar, a hundred and fifty pounds of rice, fifty pounds of cornmeal, and two cigars. He counted out three hundred and forty-four dollars cash, laid it on the counter, and went back to the river without so much as a word about the weather. Frank Warren—pilot, trapper, keeper of the Trading Post—remarked that he had happened by that man’s cabin one day and had thought to pay a visit. It was a small cabin, eight by ten, without windows. As Warren approached, he heard a voice. The man was telling himself a joke. Reaching the punch line, he erupted in laughter. Warren tiptoed away.",

They looked incredible—long, long, long, fast, empty lefts, six feet on the smaller days, eight-feet-plus when the swell pulsed. I now think that José and I were surfing the wrong place. For me, it was natural to move up the line, toward the top—to the first place where a wave was catchable. At Grajagan it was big and sectiony and mushy up top, but that’s where I went, and José followed my lead. I figured I could connect some of the racier parts of the wave farther down. Except I rarely could. There were always flat spots, then unmakable sections. I was misreading the reef completely. It apparently never even occured to me to move down inside, to try to find a corner in there where a makable takeoff led to a cleaner, better-peeling wave. On the biggest day, José wanted no part of it, and Mike, who had rarely left his mosquito net, convinced me to paddle all the way up to where it was genuinely huge. He even talked me into wearing a little white wetsuit vest he carried. It would make a nice contrast with the turquoise water and my brown arms, he said. I caught one monster wave, against my better judgment, barely making the drop on my trusty New Zealand pintail. Mike said he got the shot, though I never saw it.",

The demolition work began almost as soon as the last resident had been evicted. Men with heavy pickaxes smashed out the windows and broke down the brick walls. The street took on the feeling of an archaeological site as women in tatty straw hats picked among the rubble and sorted it into piles of reusable material. They prised rusty nails out of wooden window frames, and scraped the plasterwork off bricks and beams. The roof shingles were stacked into neat rows along the road for waiting trucks to take away. Almost every scrap of these old British buildings was destined for reuse.",

He was terribly tired, and the light and warmth, the movements of the hands, and the soft communicative voices soothed him; they gave him a strange sense of quiet and relief. As he sat there, motionless, this feeling of relief became a feeling of profound happiness. Without any sense of disloyalty to Terence and Rachel he ceased to think about either of them. The movements and the voices seemed to draw together from different parts of the room, and to combine themselves into a pattern before his eyes; he was content to sit silently watching the pattern build itself up, looking at what he hardly saw.",

These occasional disturbances only heightened the night’s quiet; unlike in American cities, in Russian cities you almost never hear sirens at night. From Volodya’s balcony during daylight you could see two nearby hills and the hollow between them filled with low apartment buildings, scraggly trees, and a scattering of little garage-boxes for individual cars. On one hill, high-rise buildings perched right at the edge as if defying any earthquake to topple them, while on the other hill, radio and TV and power-line towers in sizes ranging from small to medium to skyscraper high clustered like a throng of black steel church steeples. The dark clouds moving over them had the rolling momentum of weather just come in from the sea.",

Then it turned back, slowly, as though pacing invisible feet beyond the wall, back to the chair against the door and became motionless there for a moment. Then she faced forward and Tommy watched her take a tiny watch from the top of her stocking and look at it. With the watch in her hand she lifted her head and looked directly at him, her eyes calm and empty as two holes. After a while she looked down at the watch again and returned it to her stocking.",

One of them started for the stairs, as instructed, but the other, in a burst of petulance, decided to make for the rest-room.

He shifted gears, hit the gas, and drove toward a crowd of men who loitered in the parking lot. Those fearless souls barely moved as our driver weaved through their huddled masses. On the far side of the parking lot, the driver stopped suddenly near a shack by the gate. He honked the horn a few times – no answer. He honked again. A police officer, dressed in a crisp, white uniform, stepped outside. He inspected the taxi, the driver, and us. When he was satisfied, of what I can’t say, he leaned through the passenger window and exchanged a few words with the driver. The only thing I understood was Mena House, and those words sounded better by the minute. The officer asked for our passports, scribbled some words on a sheet of paper, and handed his clipboard to me. The clipboard held a single sheet of paper filled top to bottom with a long list of names and destinations, few of which I could read or understand. At the bottom of the list, the officer had printed our names and the name of the hotel in neat block letters. I scribbled my initials on the form and wondered whether anyone would ever compare those signatures against some master list of foreigners and visas and hotels. I didn’t have time to ask.",

    "target_paragraph": "I had brought plenty of sugar-lumps and after gratefully giving Malek a couple I fed him some solider stuff and wandered off to see what was going on. A reversal of last night’s shadows striped the plain; smoke was rising and fingers were already threading, plaiting and splicing among the heaped-up reeds. Apart from the dazzling frippery of the girls, I had been disappointed the night before by the tameness of this little company. Not a glimpse of a musical instrument, not a note or a twang; not even a dancing bear. But I was wrong. In the lee of a cart, a huge brown Carpathian beast, his cheek resting on folded paws, lay fast asleep; and even as I watched he began to stir. Sitting up, he yawned long and wide, rubbed his eyes, then dropped his paws in his lap and peered about with bleary goodwill, while his companion, blowing on embers, prepared breakfast for two. I rejoined Malek, and as we both munched, I noticed that our sheltering tree, tall as a medium-sized oak, belonged to a kind I had never seen. The bark was darker, oval leaves the colour of verdigris grew in symmetrical sprays and leathery pods dangled among them like dark runner-beans. It was a carob tree. (Its blackish pods, with the faint, dull, haunting taste of fossil chocolate, are like teak to chew. A few years later I sometimes used to stem hunger with them on the southern rocks of Crete, unconsciously imitating the Prodigal Son: they are the husks which he and the swine did eat, and they are still fed to pigs. ‘Locust-beans’ is an alternative name and some rashly think it was these, with wild honey, that kept St John the Baptist alive in the desert.)",

The painfully preserved equilibrium of the neutrals made a pitiful show now that the monstrous facts of the first weeks were known: Germany’s diplomatic perfidy, her savagery in the field, her premeditated and systematized terrorizing of the civil populations. Nothing could efface what had been done in Belgium and Luxembourg, the burning of Louvain, the bombardment of Rheims. These successive outrages had roused in Campton the same incredulous wrath as in the rest of mankind; but being of a speculative mind—and fairly sure now that George would never lie in the mud and snow with the others—he had begun to consider the landslide in its universal relations, as well as in its effects on his private ant-heap.",

At eight minutes past eight in the morning on the eighth day of the eighth month of that year, students launched a countrywide demonstration against almost three decades of poverty and oppression under military rule. Thousands of people flooded into the streets of cities and towns all over Burma shouting, ‘Dee-mo-ka-ra-see! Dee-mo-ka-ra-see!’ The government response was brutal: that evening, soldiers marched into the streets and strafed the crowds with machine-gun fire. In Rangoon, doctors and nurses, overwhelmed by the wounded, hung a sign outside the general hospital begging the soldiers to stop killing people. The sign was written with the blood of the wounded and dead. When a column of nurses joined the protest in the streets, wearing their white uniforms, they too were shot. Among those who died during the days of chaos that followed were high-school children, teachers and monks. Smoke billowed from crematoriums as the authorities rapidly disposed of their corpses. The uprising did not end until more than 3,000 people had been shot or bludgeoned to death by government soldiers.",

The hawker, realising she was outnumbered by angry women with fleshy limbs, squatted down in the middle of the aisle, trying to retrieve bunches of ribbon unravelling across the carriage and ranting to nobody in particular. It was a sorry scene and no one moved to help her gather her things. I caught a reel of pink ribbon as it rolled past and gave her a handful of clips that had scattered under the seat. She smiled and shook her head, revealing a beautiful set of teeth that gleamed like the floral-shaped stud in her nose. At the next station, a crowd had gathered and the women began to trip and fall in through the doorway before the train had stopped. I peered through the bars and saw the stampede stepping over a girl sprawled on the ground. Eventually she picked herself up and adjusted the jasmine in her hair before coming on board. So much for the peaceful journey.",

As disquieting as the blood were the faces of some of the enthusiasts. One had no nose, just two punctures in a triangle of pink mottled flesh; one had grotesquely raw bulging eyes; there was one with no neck, the flesh distended straight from cheek to chest. In their walk was pride; they behaved like busy men with no time for trivialities. I suspected some of the bloody garments. Some looked too dry; they might have been last year’s, they might have been borrowed, or the blood might have been animal’s blood. But there was no denying the integrity of the man whose nearly bald head was roughly bandaged, the blood still streaming down.

    "target_paragraph": "We only had time to visit one more landmark, and, after a quick consultation with our guidebook, Teresa picked the Hanging Church. Established in the third century, when Christianity was fairly new and practitioners often met in secret, the church’s nickname comes from its position atop the southern gate of the fortress. The gate was then about thirty feet high, and the church, built of simple palm logs and fieldstones, seemed to hang midair, high above the surrounding walls. The church was rebuilt and renovated many times – a common theme in Old Cairo – and though parts of the current building date back to the tenth century, the façade, bell towers, and staircase are relatively recent additions from the nineteenth century. With all the additions and modifications, the church complex looks almost modern, like the architects intended to build a church on the third floor of a Spanish mission. There are few hints of the old fortress visible from the ground floor. We climbed a steep flight of stairs up to a small terrace. There we found a small courtyard surrounded by locked offices and a gift shop. Vendors lined the portico with small tables. They displayed mass cards and trinkets and DVDs emblazoned with images of Mary. The courtyard led to the vestibule and the vestibule led into the old church. The air was dark and warm and haunting, and the room felt like a warehouse for ancient religious icons. The power was off, and the only light came from a few rays of sun that cut through the stained glass windows. The portraits on the iconostasis, illuminated only from behind, and only by the sun, looked ghostly. Teresa knelt and recited a short prayer while I stood off to the side and admired the architecture. A small group of church workers paced around the pews. They pointed and whispered, to and about what I couldn’t tell, but I suddenly felt very guilty, like I was never meant to be there. I told Teresa to take her time, and I retreated outside to the courtyard.",

Amherst heard a cry of glee behind him; then all sounds were lost in the whistle of air humming by like the flight of a million arrows. They had dropped below the sunset and were tearing through the clear nether twilight of the descent; then, with a bound, the sled met the level, and shot away across the meadow toward the opposite height. It seemed to Amherst as though his body had been left behind, and only the spirit in him rode the wild blue currents of galloping air; but as the sled's rush began to slacken with the strain of the last ascent he was recalled to himself by the touch of the breathing warmth at his back. Bessy had put out a hand to steady herself, and as she leaned forward, gripping his arm, a flying end of her furs swept his face. There was a delicious pang in being thus caught back to life; and as the sled stopped, and he sprang to his feet, he still glowed with the sensation. Bessy too was under the spell. In the dusk of the beech-grove where they had landed, he could barely distinguish her features; but her eyes shone on him, and he heard her quick breathing as he stooped to help her to her feet.",

I had climbed it in winter, brushing snow from the branches with my hand, with the wood cold as stone to the touch, and real crows’ nests black in the branches of nearby trees. I had climbed it in early summer, and looked out over the simmering countryside, with heat jellying the air and the drowsy buzz of a tractor audible from somewhere nearby. And I had climbed it in monsoon rain, with water falling in rods thick enough for the eye to see. Climbing the tree was a way to get perspective, however slight; to look down on a city that I usually looked across. The relief of relief. Above all, it was a way of defraying the city’s claims on me.",

Through most of my trip with John, a quote from Shirley MacLaine, patron saint of pop occultism, had been stuck in my head like a bad fast-food jingle:  I went to Machu Picchu in Peru with a man who said he had had a love affair with an extraterrestrial. He said he was still being guided by her and could call on that guidance anytime. He proceeded to do just that.",

Next, there are what one might describe as hygienic and climatic considerations. Summer is approaching, sir, and apart from certain unpleasant risks which I need not specify, you will surely agree with me that the solstitial heat is a needlessly severe trial for a boy with long hair. My own children are all cropped close, and I have reason to think they are grateful for it. Why not yours?

It alarmed me to see a huge empty loggers’ truck – bigger than any of the dwellings – parked in the middle of the ban, with no number plate. When I paused to scrutinize it an old man, very small and wrinkled and worried looking, rushed towards me. His sign-language message was that I should (a) move away from the truck and (b) return to Vieng Xai. Had I not already identified my track I might have taken his advice but that track was irresistible, leading directly into primary forest. I tried, unsuccessfully, to soothe him before continuing. Casual visitors can’t realistically expect to see endangered species yet merely to be in an area where such sightings were remotely possible exhilarated me and I was equipped to spend a few days in the forest; even during the dry season these mountains have running streams.",

If she did so she must in some measure become the apologist of her husband, and she was not prepared to go so far.",

This meant he had no forward visibility, but that troubled him less than you might expect. He couldn’t see the ground ahead during takeoff anyway because of the backward slope of a taxiing plane, and once airborne he would be flying over an empty ocean with nothing to crash into. He could get a fix ahead by “crabbing,” a maneuver in which the plane is turned slightly sideways while still flying forward, allowing one of the side windows to become temporarily a front window. Even so, one of the mechanics, a former submariner named Charlie Randolph, installed a simple periscope that Lindbergh could use if he needed to, though he never did.",

Then she turns again and walks, swinging her head, stormy wild and flinching, as thunder shatters the sky, stopping every third step to turn, baulk at this person with the rope, at me, recover herself, snarl, lunge. Sometimes she doesn’t come close enough to touch me, sometimes she does. But again, again and again, she doesn’t hurt me. She rips my shirt, bats my legs, looks as if she will kill me. And in this way, in this awful, dreadful dance, we walk back to her cage. I can’t hear anything but blood in my ears, the crack of the wind, and the lurching attacks of her hiss.",

It seemed that the owners had done some blasting on the reef to open up the boat channel, but the wave out front was the same. Same rifling, too-good-to-be-true left flaring down the reef at hull speed. Surfing it was a sense-memory barrage. The blue swell breaking far up the reef, the intricate scrollwork on the face, the unforgiving coral. The critical moment that seemed to go on forever, the sensation of impossible abundance. I had lost a step or two in the twenty-four years since I last rode it, and the wave, particularly the takeoff, was as quick as ever. But I was crafty from long experience, and I could still make the wave, still ride it respectably. The lineup was no longer empty, of course. One had to share with fellow guests. But that was easy enough. The takeoff spot, which we had once found by using a crossed pair of extra-tall coconut trees, was now established by the reflection of a bar mirror in the resort’s restaurant.",
