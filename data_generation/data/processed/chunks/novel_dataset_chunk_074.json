With his great hands he had laid the foundations, burrowed out deep musty cellars in the earth, and sheeted the tall sides over with smooth trowellings of warm, brown plaster. He had very little money, but his strange house grew to the rich modelling of his fantasy: when he had finished he had something which leaned to the slope of his narrow uphill yard, something with a high embracing porch in front, and warm rooms where one stepped up and down to the tackings of his whim. He built his house close to the quiet hilly street; he bedded the loamy soil with flowers; he laid the short walk to the high veranda steps with great square sheets of coloured marble; he put a fence of spiked iron between his house and the world.",

But her husband recognised him at once, not by the face, he scarcely glanced at that, but by the coat: the worn dusty broadcloth garment which—not the man but the coat, and not even the whole coat but the elbow-deep, suitcase-roomy tails of it—the county and state police of five contiguous commonwealths had been blocking roads and searching farm wagons and automobiles and freight trains and the Jim Crow cars of passenger ones, and depot lavatories, charging in pairs and threes with shotguns and drawn pistols through the pool halls and burial associations and the kitchens and bedrooms of Negro tenements for sixty-five hours now, trying to find. As did the town too: the turnkey and his shackled prize had scarcely left the jail before they began to gather behind them a growing tail of men and youths and small boys like that of a rising kite, which in the street leading to the square the turnkey could still tell himself that he was leading, and which while crossing the square toward the courthouse he even still looked like he was, walking faster and faster, almost dragging the prisoner at the other end of the chain joining them, until at last he broke and even took one step actually running before he stopped and turned to face the pressing crowd, drawing the pistol from its holster all in one blind motion like the hopeless and furious repudiation of the boy turning, once more whole, stainless and absolved, to hurl his toy pistol into the very face of the charging elephant, victim no more of terror but of pride, and cried in a thin forlorn voice which itself was like the manless voice of a boy:",

Mrs. Leath had not written—she had not taken the trouble to explain her telegram. Darrow turned away with a sharp pang of humiliation. Her frugal silence mocked his prodigality of hopes and fears. He had put his question to the porter once before, on returning to the hotel after luncheon; and now, coming back again in the late afternoon, he was met by the same denial. The second post was in, and had brought him nothing.",

Thankfully he could tie it to the sea anchor bridle that was already in place. Gillian was at the tiller and struggling to keep Lone Eagle’s bow into the wind. Lone Eagle was now head to wind and hobby horsing. It was hard for him to keep his footing with waves breaking over the bow. The guy in the stern of the Marine Rescue boat threw him a messenger line, which he was able to grab, and he then began the process of hauling in the heavy tow line. Once he had the end of it, he tied it to the bridle with a bowline and threw both over the bow. The deckhand on the Marine Rescue boat signaled the skipper, and he slowly took in the slack. They were now under tow. In his mind, it was a rather embarrassing arrival in Oz, but he knew they had made it safely and that nothing had broken in the blow.",

I have traveled enough to know that a chef does not, as a rule, settle in a place like Macksville because he has a lifelong yearning to share the subtleties of 3,500 years of Szechuan cuisine with sheep farmers. So I went off to see what else there might be in Macksville’s compact heart. The answer was very little. Everything appeared to be shut except one small takeout establishment called, not altogether promisingly, Bub’s Hotbakes. I opened the door, briefly enlivening five thousand flies that had dropped by to see what Bub and his team were up to, and stepped inside, knowing in my heart that this was almost certainly going to be a regretted experience.",

Then they glanced at me uneasily, perhaps imagining some sinister link between the appearance of a faranj and this derangement in the heavens. I had wondered, as I watched it, if it were manned; and I also felt uneasy, thinking of the ominous contrast between the life of an astronaut and the life of my companions – which is now as it was when ‘there were … shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them …’",

One June day in 2002, she and her husband, Harry, both retired, were resting with a Spanish pilgrim by the side of the road just outside Estella when a car rounded the corner and struck them. Mary Catherine was killed instantly. Her husband was not injured, but the Spanish pilgrim spent more than a month in hospital. A few years after the accident, Harry returned to the site and erected a cairn to his wife’s memory.",

I step out and go exploring in the beauty salon next door, climbing the grand staircase of an old colonial mansion, and finding, at the top, girls recumbent in the hair-cutting chairs, too poor, I assume, to have real homes in which to sleep. In one room, no less mysterious, a Japanese boy lying flat out on a treatment table, a young woman coming in now and then to adjust the sheet above him, his feet protruding beneath it.",

In their place were the Malibú, migrants from the north who occupied the ancient levees and village sites but had no knowledge of how or when the colossal works had come into being. By that time, the descendants of the Zenú had settled in the mountains of San Jacinto, with other populations scattered across the lowlands, in the valley of the Río Sinú, the Betancí wetlands, and along the banks of the Magdalena.

In this, he draws from his theory of island biogeography, which holds that the greater the area, the wider the array of species a piece of land might support. He too thinks of “islands” in the metaphorical sense, and his breakthrough findings have been of great inspiration to the contemporary rewilding movement, which now sets its goals at the “landscape scale.”",

The orange sun is setting in a clear blue sky; two black frigate birds with their long and angled wings hover over Fort Jefferson. The wind has finally begun to ease, but still blows at about 15 knots out of the east. Just this slight easing of a few knots increases the tranquility of the twilight compared to the previous evenings. Seagulls circle over the ruins of the coal docks next to the main dock. Palm trees lean with the breeze on the west edge of the little island. The sun passes behind the horizon, backlighting a line of blue-grey cumulus clouds. Two fishing boats approach from the southwest. They come every night. Someone blows a conch-shell horn to mark the sunset. I hear it but can’t tell where the sound comes from. More birds fly in from a day of searching for food, much like the fishing boats. Gulls, a pelican, and terns fly in a cluster; an odd turkey vulture, completely out of place, joins the scene, passing through without flapping its wings. The horizon in the east, opposite the sunset, turns pink while the western sky greys.\nI’ll miss this place. It gave me much-needed rest after the first singehand crossing of my life. I was so fatigued when I entered the harbor – it took all my focus to not make a terrible mistake. In fact the only injury I sustained in the three-day crossing was in the harbor. I lost footing while carrying the stern anchor to the bow, so I could lie to two anchors, like my father taught me to do 30 years ago right here in this very same anchorage. I slipped and my fingers got caught and pinched between the flukes of the Fortress anchor. One was cut, two others were bruised – a very small price to pay for such a prodigious journey.",

There were no massed clouds, nothing but a hard even dark copper-grey, and away through the gap the distant country was bright like a little painted scene. On the horizon the hard dark sky shut down. At intervals thunder rumbled evenly, far away. Miriam stood still in the middle of the summer-house floor. It was half-dark; the morning saal lay in a hot sultry twilight. The air in the summer-house was heavy and damp. She stood with her half-closed hands gathered against her. “How perfectly magnificent,” she murmured, gazing out through the hard half-darkness to where the brightly coloured world lay in a strip and ended on the hard sky.\n“Yes ... yes,” came a sad low voice at her side.\nFor a second Miriam did not turn. She drank in the quiet “yes, yes,” the hard fixed scene seemed to move. Who loved it too, the dark sky and the storm? Then she focussed her companion who was standing a little behind her, and gazed at Fräulein; she hardly saw her, she seemed still to see the outdoor picture. Fräulein made a movement towards her; and then she saw for a moment the strange grave young look in her eyes. Fräulein had looked at her in that moment as an equal. It was as if they had embraced each other.\nThen Fräulein said sadly, “You like the storm-weather, Miss Henderson.”\n“Yes.”\nFräulein sighed, looking out across the country. “We are in the hollow of His hand,” she murmured. “Come to your breakfast, my child,” she chided, smiling.",

I walked onto the little peninsula that jutted south of the bay, and found a smear of grass on which to pitch my tent. The peninsula was a beirgh, or a’ bheirgh, a loan-word from the Norse that designates ‘a promontory or point with a bare, usually vertical rock-face, and often with a narrow neck’. Its cliffs were pinkish with feldspar. Inland, near Griomabhal, I could see a golden eagle, its primaries extended like delicate fingers, roaming on a late-day hunt. A tern beat upwind: scissory wings, its black head seemingly eyeless, its movement within the air veery and unpredictable as a pitcher’s knuckle-ball. Creamy waves moshed and milked on the beach and rocks, making rafts of floating foam just offshore and sending spray shooting above the level of the tent. Wave-surged infralittoral rock, tide-swept circalittoral rock, micro-terrains of lichen and moss. Far out to sea there were breaches in the cloud through which sun fell.",

No sentimental scruple made the blow waver or deflected her resolute aim. She had thought at once of Laura, and Laura was his only, his inevitable, resource. His anxious mind pictured his sister’s wonder, and made him wince under the sting of Henley Fairford’s irony: Fairford, who at the time of the marriage had sat silent and pulled his moustache while every one else argued and objected, yet under whose silence Ralph had felt a deeper protest than under all the reasoning of the others. It was no comfort to reflect that Fairford would probably continue to say nothing! But necessity made light of these twinges, and Ralph set his teeth and cabled.",

When I asked her once why she didn’t walk to the gym and do five minutes less on the treadmill, she looked at me as if I were being willfully provocative. “Because I have a program for the treadmill,” she explained. “It records my distance and speed, and I can adjust it for degree of difficulty.” It hadn’t occurred to me how thoughtlessly deficient nature is in this regard.",

Not about her. Not at what they will find out because she would tell them all that herself if it only occurred to them that the simple thing would be to come and ask her. And told me the rest of it: how she had at last quit beating on the locked door behind which the Board of Supervisors and the School Board crouched holding their breath, and now she was merely meeting a class of small children each Sunday at one of the Negro churches, where she would read aloud in the dry inflectionless quacking, not the orthodox biblical stories perhaps but at least the Mesopotamian folklore and the Nordic fairy tales which the Christian religion has arrogated into its seasonal observances, safe now since even the white ministers could not go on record against this paradox.

The place is full, but I’m reminded how much Raffles is a web of nooks and crannies. In a city of rectangles and squares, it offers the grace of a circle, which is to say something intimate and enveloping; the Long Bar feels like an assembly of private corners, better suited to confidences than to brassy announcements.",

We nodded, he rolled his bicycle up to us, and we took the five-minute ride to the hotel. Getting out, we handed him 40 fen (there are 100 fen in a yuan), and he pushed the money back to us. Again, the Brit gave him the fare, and began walking away. He hurried up and grabbed the Brit by the arm, thrusting the money back into his hand. His friends began gathering around. He shouted at us. We stood our ground. He shouted again. The Brit shouted back. The mood of the crowd started to turn ugly. The man poked at the Brit’s arm, and the Brit pushed him back. There were shouts and threats. The Brit gave him the money again and he threw it on the ground. Alarmed by the mounting air of violence, I raced into the hotel and brought back a young gift-shop proprietress to serve as an interpreter. She explained that the man wanted 4 yuan. We told her that we had paid only 1 yuan for four people on the way over. The Brit handed over 40 fen again, and the man let out a shout. The girl, looking back and forth with rising alarm, told us that the driver was going to bring the police. Thirty or forty people had gathered around by now, some of them curious, some of them furious. The Brit threw 40 fen onto the ground and began walking away. The man spit at us. The girl, looking more and more miserable, said we would be taken to jail. The man hovered over us. The Brit cursed. The girl asked us just to pay 2 yuan and be done with it. We protested. The man circled around. At last, we handed over 2 yuan and, twenty-five minutes after the dispute had begun, the gang of rickshaw drivers shambled sullenly away.",

The construction of Kyoto Tower was followed by the rapid destruction of most of the old town, leaving only temples and shrines untouched. Each step of the way was marked with open attacks on the city’s heritage by the municipal administration. The most dramatic attack came quite recently with the rebuilding of Kyoto Station. A competition was held, to which both foreign and Japanese architects submitted a number of plans, some of them incorporating traditional features such as sloping tiled roofs. There was a super-modern design by the architect Tadao Ando in the shape of a great gate, reminiscent of the gates that used to stand on the edge of the city. But the selection committee rejected them all and chose the one plan that denied Kyoto’s history in every way. Designed by the leading architect at Kyoto University, it is a huge box faced with glass which looks rather like an airport lobby. There could be no greater proof of Kyoto’s hatred of Kyoto.",

He was overworked and out of spirits, she wrote, and his mother and sister, reluctant as they were to interfere, felt they ought to urge Undine to come back to him. Details followed, unwelcome and officious. What right had Laura Fairford to preach to her of wifely obligations? No doubt Charles Bowen had sent home a highly-coloured report—and there was really a certain irony in Mrs. Fairford’s criticizing her sister-in-law’s conduct on information obtained from such a source!",

She advised me to come back in a week. At this, Sergei, standing by my side, leaned into the window and offered the woman 150 rubles, about $5. After a moment the woman told us she had searched again and this time had found my reservation after all. I handed Sergei the fare in dollars, he pushed it under the window, and in fifteen minutes she gave us the ticket—from Vladivostok to Seoul, from Seoul to Anchorage, and from Anchorage to JFK Airport in New York.

Sometimes, waiting in pitch darkness on the stairs at Eliza’s, at one or two o’clock in the morning, he felt her pass him.

I was a deep reader, plunging into a story and remaining immersed even after I'd finished it. Some of it was apt to cling for a long time, like water to a bathing suit. The \"Jungle Books\" clung, for example. Mowgli was a natural wanderer. I was surprised when he went back to his home cave once, after he'd grown up, to confer with Mother and Father Wolf. I assumed that he had forgotten them. I had. I was also a natural wanderer, or wanted to be. Mowgli was the real thing—the best example—but there were others. David Copperfield, for instance; he ran away, and a lot of Dickens' other children were admirably mobile, too. I was certain that Little Nell, though she thought she was sorry to slip away from home with her grandfather, must have felt some hidden enthusiasm for the road. Nor did I have to depend on Dickens for vicarious running away. I drifted downriver with Huck Finn, and got lost with Tom Sawyer, and sailed here and there, all over the world, with any number of other people, scorning the stale air of indoors.",
