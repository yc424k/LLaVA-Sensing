Mrs Browning herself had discarded her Indian shawls. She wore a cap made of some thin bright silk that her husband liked. Her hair was brushed in a new way. And when the sun had gone down and the shutters had been raised she paced the balcony dressed in thin white muslin. She loved to sit there looking, listening, watching the people in the street.",

McKinlay struggled to understand this “most curious illness,” concluding that it must certainly be the pemmican. If Mamen and Templeman were to survive, they’d need fresh meat and a break from pemmican, which Mamen could no longer stomach. The prospects, he reasoned, were greatest back at Icy Spit, where Kuraluk and Hadley were at least having some success getting seals. If he could somehow summon the strength, he intended to lead them back north to Shore Camp.",

Deepwater pools along the shoreline wetted them through to the skin. McKinlay fell over with exhaustion when they got back, and he worried about the severe physical cost that the subsistence hunting was having on him. “I began to be aware of my extreme weakness,” he wrote. “And this journey made me acutely conscious of the effect malnutrition was having on me.” It was almost the end of June. The seals seemed to be farther and farther away from the campsite, probably scared off by the shooting of crowbills at the cliffs. While McKinlay sat next to the fire, watching Auntie and the girls skin and hack at the seals, he wondered which would run out first, their ammunition or their strength. “A period of crisis was approaching,” he scribbled weakly in his diary. “Meat is around but is proving extremely costly to acquire.”",

As I walked through the city my first day in La Paz, the women who lined the sidewalks in their colorful clothing never once made an approach to me, or shouted anything out, or tried to catch my attention with their wares. They seemed content to sit where they were, as (it was easy to believe) they had always sat. When, once, the sky suddenly turned black and torrential rains began to pelt down on us all, they got up wordlessly, draped some tarpaulin over their shacks and then sat down again, as silent as before.",

I reached the upended root ball and turned to see my guide still standing on the trail, watching. With a small wave, I started climbing up the exposed roots to reach the trunk. The brook stampeded under the tree at a dizzying speed. I’d initially been miffed that my escort had essentially denied me a chance to go to the trail crossing and make my own decision about whether to ford or cross a suspended tree. But, watching the movement of the water, I realized I’d have made the same decision and he had indeed saved me a half mile of walking back and forth. Clambering over the top of the roots, I stepped down onto the rough, wet bark. I scuffed my shoe across the log a couple of times to assess the grip. It was a good twenty feet across and I didn’t particularly want to butt scoot that far unless absolutely necessary.",

I’ve grown to love him more than I’ve ever loved a beast, different than how I’d love a kid, less attached to how he reflects me, less worried about what I’m doing wrong. Unencumbered by expectation, we coo over his funny antics, how he chases his tail when he wants a walk, his long, slow farts when he sits for a treat. I’m soft for this dog, in love with his thick fur that smells like snow and spruce and popcorn. I worry that he’s warm enough on cold days at his dog house (he is), and if he likes the kibble we feed him (he does), and that we’re pushing his old bones too far. But Campion surprises me again and again. He skijored with me at nine, ten, thirteen (pulling out front in his harness while I skied behind) and happily ran with a team when given the chance. Campion taught me about winter—how to move carefully on frozen rivers, how to find a packed trail underfoot, when to curl up and cover your nose with your tail. He taught me about determination, how drive can be both ingrained and chosen, again and again. At nearly sixteen, with a tumor and a limp and foggy eyes, he’s taught me how to give my whole heart to something I’ll lose. Campion prepared us for our second sleddy, Beluga, a spunky lead dog I love just as much, for new reasons. Together they sleep in a pile in the back of the truck. (They whine when they don’t get enough exercise.) They bark and yank at their chains when we come to unclip them. (They eat moose turds and lick my face.) They skijor with us over miles of snow, one in a blue harness, one in red. (They turn me into a person who’s always covered in dog hair.)",

He recalled the evening when he had first seen her—the hot, crowded drawing-room, the heavy atmosphere, the dull faces coming and going, and the figure of Audrey flashing through it all. She had irritated him then, for he had not yet classified her. He had tried not to think of her. She dogged his thoughts with most unmaidenly insistence; her image lay in wait for him at every cross-road of association; it was something vivid yet elusive, protean yet persistent. He recalled that other evening of her dinner-party—their first recognised meeting. Her whole person, which at first sight had impressed him with its emphatic individuality, now struck him as characterless and conventional. And yet—what was she like? She was like a chameleon. No, she wasn't; he recollected that the change of colour was a vital process in that animal. She was like an opal—all sparkle when you move it, and at rest dull, most undeniably dull. No, that wasn't it exactly. She was a looking-glass for other people's personalities (he hated the horrid word, and apologised to himself for using it), formless and colourless, reflecting form and colour. After a moment's satisfaction with this last fancy, he became aware that he was being made the fool of metaphor. That was not his way. To find out what lay at the bottom of this shifting personality, what elemental thoughts and feelings, if any, the real Audrey was composed of; to see for himself the play of circumstances on her plastic nature, and know what reaction it was capable of—in a word, to experimentalise in cold blood on the living nerve and brain tissue, was his plan of work for the year 1896.",

In the porch—a thatched loggia with mud benches down the sides—the fifteen wives of the chief sat doing bead-work. They buy the long strings of beads at the market and work them into fancy wear, for their necks and waists, their only clothing. The youngest wife looked about fourteen. The chief has eleven children thus far; he cannot have put his heart into the job. His mother was also there; the old women are the worst advertisement for primitive life as they all look shrivelled and shrunken and bitter.

I drew the curtains and was not surprised that they had to be yanked violently before they would budge and came nowhere near meeting in the middle. There was a tray of coffee things but the cups were—let me be charitable—disgusting, and the spoon was stuck to the tray. The bathroom, faintly illuminated by a distant light activated by a length of string, had curling floor tiles and years of accumulated muck packed into every corner and crevice. I peered at the yellowy grouting around the bath and sink and realized what the landlord did with his phlegm. A bath was out of the question, so I threw some cold water on my face, dried it with a towel that had the texture of shredded wheat, and gladly took my leave.",

As our personal search was completed by the voiceless shrouds, I began to understand. Arriving in Mecca, at the threshold of the Ka'aba, I was entering a pristine, divine garden where all creation was welcome irrespective of what a male committee of mullahs might think. Here every life was equally valued and had been so for more than a millennium. I was walking in the footsteps of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) into the House of God. I was walking into the light.\nThere could be no turning back.12",

On St Andrew’s Day Jardine’s used to take over Happy Valley for a celebration which culminated with the running of the Ewo Handicap, a mile race for ponies ridden by members of the staff. Men of all ages and all riding abilities entered the race. The winner got a cup, the last man in got a wooden spoon so large that it became a Jardine’s custom to pass it around the company filled with whisky – ‘Testing the Capacity of the Wooden Spoon’. I have a photograph of the jockeys who ran the Ewo Handicap in 1930, and a formidable crew they look: eight extremely healthy-looking Europeans, mostly Scots, ranging from the youthful to the grandfatherly, and eyeing the camera with expressions of unsmiling resolution, as if they were summing up the photographer’s suitability for employment.",

That of course is only conjecture, but I think the conjecture is pretty well justified. You have the fact that those two went out, that she followed them almost immediately afterwards through the darkness and, a little later, she came running back to the hotel with that pallid face and the hand clutching her dress over her heart. It can’t have been only Bagshawe. Her face was contorted with agony before ever her eyes fell upon me or upon him beside me. But I dare say Bagshawe may have been the determining influence in her suicide. Leonora says that she had that flask, apparently of nitrate of amyl, but actually of prussic acid, for many years and that she was determined to use it if ever I discovered the nature of her relationship with that fellow Jimmy. You see, the mainspring of her nature must have been vanity. There is no reason why it shouldn’t have been; I guess it is vanity that makes most of us keep straight, if we do keep straight, in this world.",

That was actually fine with me. The world was mapped in so many different ways. For worldly Americans, the whole globe was covered by the foreign bureaus of the better newspapers—the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal—and, at that time, the big newsweeklies. Every place on earth was part of somebody’s beat. Bryan understood that map before I did, having gone to Yale. But when I’d found an old copy of Newsweek on Captain Brett Hilder’s bridge, and tried to read a George Will column, I’d burst out laughing. His Beltway airs and provincialism were impenetrable. The truth was, we were wandering now through a world that would never be part of any correspondent’s beat (let alone George Will’s purview). It was full of news, but all of it was oblique, mysterious, important only if you listened and watched and felt its weight.",

This is one of Afghanistan’s main tourist attractions (hence a ‘luxury’ hotel), but what a contrast to our idea of a tourist centre! Apart from the hotel the whole valley is completely unspoiled; nothing comes between the ancient past and the moment when you walk beneath the shadow of those immense monuments of an era when Bamian was the centre of the Buddhist religion. The statues, however, look far less impressive close-to than from the other side, or centre, of the valley. There the effect of so many centuries of weathering is not apparent, although, considering their great antiquity, the damage is very slight and much skilful restoring has recently been done; even the paintings executed on the arches of the alcoves and in the caves are still traceable. The monastery of caves is fabulous; one could spend days wandering (chiefly on one’s tummy) through the maze of connecting passages between one cell and another. Similar caves, all blackened with the smoke of fires that burned so long ago, are located in other mountains around the valley and I hope to explore these tomorrow on my own; delightful as the Indians are, I prefer being alone in places like this.",

I tossed and turned, counted sheep, counted pigs, listed vicious ways of incapacitating Madam Curd – but all to no avail. I gave up and went off to have a shower. But here lay only further frustration. The hotel was owned and run by an organ of the Central Government, and so (like everything else official) it worked on Peking Time. This ran two hours behind Sinkiang time, and was quite ill-suited to the region. According to Peking Time, dawn is at half past nine in the morning, and sunset takes place sometime towards midnight. In this manner the hands of the Central Committee, which manipulate everything in China, turn even the shower knobs of Chini Bagh. I arrived at the bath house to find it closed. In Peking it was still only five a.m. The showers were not due to open for another three hours.",

Rain is such a constant in Southeast Alaska that everyone I met seemed to own a pair of knee-high brown XtraTufs, whose ubiquity and versatility make them roughly analogous to cowboy boots in Texas. (Should you find yourself stumped for conversational topics while in the company of Alaskans, ask for their opinion about whether XtraTuf quality declined when the company outsourced manufacturing to China.) A good pair of rubber boots is a wise long-term investment. Unlike much of the world, which will be facing drought and famine in the not too distant future according to current climate change models, the Inside Passage is actually expecting an increase in precipitation by the year 2100.",

Nothing is missing, except as it seems the basic necessities: garbage disposal, food storage, stewards’ quarters, butchering plant and a hundred other simplicities that must have taken a lot of room and made a lot of noise, but have vanished; nothing looks poor enough for them; the music remains very fine and tense and grand in every part, as though life could be a long pride of elegance suspended in the air, but what you feel more is again the primacy of the forms. It is all a playing with space; whatever goes in them is an afterthought.",

Pedestrians in their thousands hasten over the road-bridge, into the subway, along the sidewalk, in and out of McDonald’s, all down the walkway to the outlying island ferry station. I count thirty-five freighters moored within my field of vision, some of them so engulfed in lighters that they seem to be in floating docks. A white cruise ship lies at the Ocean Terminal, with a fruit carrier astern of her, and the inevitable armada of launches, barges, tugs and sampans moves as in pageant through the harbour.",

In vain we tore down branches, clung to the ropes and piled up rocks at the hairpin corners. Indifferent to brake or steering-wheel, the lorry went its own way, lurching crabwise down the boulders, dangling its tyres over space, cannoning from cliff to cliff, while we stumbled after it through the dusk and the freezing slush. A shepherd hailed us from underneath. Beside him, in the moonlight, lay another lorry with its wheels in the air. By now our lights were failing. When at last we reached the open slopes, the driver could not drive, and we could not walk, any further.",

Then all at once the branches were banging about, hitting each other like boxers, and dust and pollen flew from the boughs in a twisting yellow cloud. Grass flattened twirling and forking into channels, every poplar in the valley shuddered from root to tip like a Malay kris and the loosened hay-ricks moulted in spirals. Husks, chaff, straw, petals, young twigs, last year’s leaves and nosegays scattered out of the jam-jars on the graves were rushing up the slope in a gale which tossed the dishevelled birds about the air. The clouds had darkened, a volley of drops fell and we and the organist sheltered from the downpour under a clump of chestnuts. It stopped just as abruptly and we found ourselves, as a rainbow formed and dissolved again in a momentary foxes’ wedding, looking down, as though through a magnifying glass, at a world of hills and meadows and the flash of a river and an upheaval of distant ranges. Outraged cawing and twittering filled the branches and the air was adrift with the scent of pollen, roses, hay and wet earth.",
