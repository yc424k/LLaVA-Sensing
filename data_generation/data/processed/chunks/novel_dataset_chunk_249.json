In Madrid, Cuba’s rulers, foreseeing just that, proposed ending the slave trade to all Spain’s Caribbean colonies. As Eric Williams has written:",

One day, the girls asked me to go with them to the forests and return by moonlight, but they only spoke of them as the haunts of ferns, because they supposed that I should think nothing of them after the forests of Australia and New Zealand! They were not like the tropical woods of Hawaii, and owe more to the exceeding picturesqueness of the natural scenery. Hawaii is all domes and humps, Kauai all peaks and sierras. There were deep ravines, along which bright, fern-shrouded streams brawled among wild bananas, overarched by Eugenias, with their gory blossoms: walls of peaks, and broken precipices, grey ridges rising out of the blue forest gloom, high mountains with mists wreathing their spiky summits, for a background: gleams of a distant silver sea: and the nearer, many-tinted woods were not matted together in jungle fashion, but festooned and adorned with numberless lianas, and even the prostrate trunks of fallen trees took on new beauty from the exquisite ferns which covered them. Long cathedral aisles stretched away in far-off vistas, and so perfect at times was the Gothic illusion, that I found myself listening for anthems and the roll of organs. So cool and moist it was, and triumphantly redundant in vagaries of form and greenery, it was a forest of forests, and it became a necessity to return the next day, and the next; and I think if I had remained at Koloa I should have been returning still!",

    "target_paragraph": "The candles, spiked on a triangular grid, lit up these rustic masks and populated the nave behind them with a crowd of shadows. At a pause in the plainsong one of the tapers was put out. I realized, all at once, that it was Maundy Thursday. Tenebrae were being sung, and very well. The verses of the penitential psalms were answering each other across the choir and the slow recapitulations and rephrasings of the responsories were unfolding the story of the Betrayal. So compelling was the atmosphere that the grim events might have been taking place that night. The sung words crept step by step through the phases of the drama. Every so often, another candle was lifted from its pricket on the triangle and blown out. It was pitch dark out of doors and with the extinction of each flame the interior shadows came closer. It heightened the chiaroscuro of these rough country faces and stressed the rapt gleam in innumerable eyes; and the church, as it grew hotter, was filled by the smell of melting wax and sheepskin and curds and sweat and massed breath. There was a ghost of old incense in the background and a reek of singeing as the wicks, snuffed one after the other, expired in ascending skeins of smoke. ‘Seniores populi consilium fecerunt,’ the voices sang, ‘ut Jesum dolo tenerent et occiderent’; and a vision sprang up of evil and leering elders whispering in a corner through toothless gums and with beards wagging as they plotted treachery and murder. ‘Cum gladiis et fustibus exierunt tamquam ad latronem …’ Something in the half-lit faces and the flickering eyes gave a sinister immediacy to the words. They conjured up hot dark shadows under a town wall and the hoarse shouts of a lynch-mob; there was a flicker of lanterns, oafish stumbling in the steep olive groves and wild and wheeling shadows of torches through tree trunks: a scuffle, words, blows, a flash, lights dropped and trampled, a garment snatched, someone running off under the branches. For a moment, we – the congregation – became the roughs with the blades and the cudgels. Fast and ugly deeds were following each other in the ambiguity of the timbered slope. It was a split-second intimation! By the time the last of the candles was borne away, it was so dark that hardly a feature could be singled out. The feeling of shifted rôles had evaporated; and we poured out into the dust. Lights began to kindle in the windows of the village and a hint of moonrise shone at the other end of the plain.",

And then, as they sat on the terrace after luncheon, looking across at the yellow tree-tops of the park, one of the women said something—made just an allusion—that Susy would have let pass unnoticed in the old days, but that now filled her with a sudden deep disgust.... She stood up and wandered away, away from them all through the fading garden.",

Not until after ten did the wet and weary adventurers stagger out of the forest. Without a word, Young and one of the Tlingit guides stripped Muir naked and dressed him in dry long underwear. Stickeen, who usually bounded into camp, crawled cold and wet to an edge of blanket and curled up by the fire. Only when Muir had eaten a hot meal could he speak of the day’s events. His recounting of crossing what he called “that dreadful ice bridge in the shadow of death” moved Young to tears. Muir looked over at Stickeen on his blanket. “Yon’s a brave doggie,” he said.",

Here, sitting in a folding chair outside a café, we meet a retired Floridian, a man of seventy years. He talks to us of earthquakes—as much a subject for conversation as malaria was a hundred years ago—and of the politics of earthquakes (during the earthquakes of 1980 and 1984 houses were damaged, here in the epicenter, for the most part inside, he tells us, and nobody died, as a result of which the government—adhering to some severe poetry of law—is withholding millions of dollars in aid). What we are interested in, of course, is him, the anomalous fact of him, here. He takes his being here for granted, his fate does not surprise him. He wears badger bristles in his hatband to ward off the Evil Eye.",

I had stayed with Aurangzeb and his wife Naseem, eldest daughter of the late Field-Marshal Ayub Khan, who was then at the height of his power as Pakistan’s benevolent military dictator.

I let in the clutch and the car rolled smoothly down the gradient towards the sea, its tyres crunching on the bony gravels and ribbed stones of the village road. It was quite hot now and the mountains had turned pale and feathery as the ground-mists reached them from the damp plain. At the last hump before we joined the main road I paused for a minute to watch the long carved coastline stretch away into the haze, trembling and altering in the bluish afternoon as the light of a star will. Saint Epictetus lay below us with its white belfries and cubist houses; just beyond the long stone tongue of land on which Marie’s house had already begun to grow up, gleamed fitfully.",

In this café the service is nicely slow. The other café is patronized by an occasional tourist and by Italians on holiday. (“They must send all the ugly ones to Staten Island,” Anna says. How well I know the feeling.) In this café—the fancier one—there is a special table for taxi drivers (who are underemployed). We watch nuns in black habits and red sneakers carrying red canteens, shepherding children with clucking, purring noises; we watch the old taxi drivers remove their belts from their pants to tie together the suitcases of hotel guests; we watch the yellow buses disgorge their passengers for a fifteen-minute stop; the postmistress making her rounds. What other entertainment is necessary? Sometimes some of us arrange ourselves at one café and others (or one of us) at another: We wave across the square.",

Customers didn’t seem to mind as long as they could get a decent drink. For more public and rooted places like hotels, the options were far fewer. The bar in the Knickerbocker Hotel (reputed birthplace of the dry martini) took in $4,000 a day before Prohibition, a sum not easily replaced. Without its bar takings, the Knickerbocker went under. So, too, did the Manhattan Hotel, where the Manhattan cocktail was first created. Some hotels tried to survive by offering what were known as “setups”?ice, seltzer, Angostura bitters, and so on?to which the customer could add his own alcohol, but that hardly compensated for all the lost liquor business. Others continued selling alcohol discreetly in the hope that it would somehow escape official notice. Sooner or later they were nearly always disappointed.",

We are having lunch at Otello, a trattoria in a cobblestoned courtyard on the Via della Croce, a block away from the Piazza di Spagna and its fancy shops; it is always cool here, the fountain murmurs green music all the time. Against the wall and in the basin of the fountain are pyramids (red, green, yellow, white, purple) of peppers, pears, tomatoes, grapes, cherries, eggplants, peaches, squash (their green-yellow trumpetlike flowers intact). I cannot comprehend Jane's objection to this cornucopia. It is not typical of her; and if we want a peach, the waiter will pluck one from the pyramid and dip it in the fountain and bring it to us, droplets icy, flesh warm. Nothing is lost, it is not an economy of waste . . . and yet the Romans are somehow taken to task for this and similar displays, how odd. . . . Of course, the Calabrian did leave her.",

Around the first corner we turned on to a winding, shady track and had to crouch to avoid overhanging branches. Banana plants at varying stages of growth surrounded a few concrete post-Revolution dwellings. We stopped outside a large compound – sending teenage pigs squealing into the undergrowth – to deliver an elderly man and his sack of manioc. Plaintively Clodagh asked, ‘Why can’t we stay on paths like this? It’s so nice and cool!’ I pointed ahead: the track ended below a precipitous terrace accessible only to goats. As the lorry turned (a tricky manoeuvre) two mothers carrying babies hurried towards us, relieved to get a lift to Uvera’s polyclinic where the infants were due to have some inoculation. Come economic hell or high water, no Cuban baby goes uninoculated.",

    "target_paragraph": "Mayor is almost as weird as its hinterland; most of the few inhabitants look a trifle crazed, which is not surprising. At first it seemed a deserted village; we saw nobody while walking down a long street of single-storey adobe houses – all padlocked, though it was then 6.10. Later we learned that there has been mass-migration to Lima. The main Plaza was also lifeless, apart from a haggard, spinning campesino woman squatting at the half-closed door of an empty shop. She scowled at us and said there is no food available because Mayor is too far from everywhere. This however was an exaggeration. Little can be grown in the pueblo’s desert-like surroundings, but a carretera of sorts runs on the far side of the Mantaro and basic supplies come in by truck. Unfortunately these do not include fodder and as Juana had had nothing to eat since 11 a.m. we were frantically worried. Coming to a second, smaller Plaza, we saw an unexpectedly large police station and went to beg for aid and advice. The police, not being native to Mayor, are the most normal people around. A fat, cheerful senior officer invited us to spend the night as guests of the force and despatched a junior officer to requisition Alf from the only local who grows it – on a minute strip of irrigated land near the Mantaro. So I’m writing this sitting on the concrete floor of an empty room with Rachel asleep beside me on her flea-bag because it’s too hot to be in it. Juana is audibly munching in a nearby patio where a life-sized statue of St Rose of Lima, patron saint of the Peruvian police, stands in one comer with a few dusty plastic flowers at its feet. In another corner are two barrels which a small boy fills twice daily with murky Mantaro water for police ablutions and cooking. The Mayor restaurant, where Rachel ate an inferior lomo saltado while I (too heat-exhausted to eat) drank six litres of cerveza, is the filthiest we’ve seen. Even the celebrated Murphy immunities may not preserve us from its after-effects.",

If left to my own devices, I could have been on the path to Luang Prabang by 6.30, enjoying the cool of the morning. Again bonfires were lit and men and children hunkered around them while the womenfolk prepared breakfast: sticky rice. On neighbouring balconies, girls were vigorously brushing their hair, then tying it back with bands made of plaited grass. Small children released poultry from miniature thatched huts, also on stilts, then collected eggs and carefully carried them up ladders. Older children untethered pigs and buffaloes and led the latter down to the river. I wondered why the men didn’t stay warmly in bed till the sun came up, since they seemed to have no morning chores. But then I noticed that most did have paternal responsibilities, either tied to their back or sitting on their lap.",

But her eyes gave out the vivid rays that noise and banter always struck from them; her face, at such moments, was like a theatre with all the lustres blazing. That the illumination should have been kindled by his cousin’s husband was not precisely agreeable to Marvell, who thought Peter a bore in society and an insufferable nuisance on closer terms.

    "target_paragraph": "I was just ahead of Masha when I saw the snake, a dead one, severed at the neck, presumably by a shovel. Its body was a fat S-curve with distinctive markings: a Russell’s viper, responsible for more incidents and deaths than any snake throughout Asia, killing around 46,000 Indians per year and maiming countless others. Farmers who work all day long in the fields face the greatest risk. The snake is fast, with long fangs and rapid injection, striking victims from five feet away within seconds, and unlike most other venomous snakes, it almost never delivers a dry bite, preferring instead to inject its maximum dose. But that’s not even the worst part: If you survive a bite from this moody beast, the venom destroys the kidneys or shuts down the function of the pituitary gland, which causes a kind of reverse puberty. Pubic hair drops out. Men lose facial hair and muscles, women lose curves, and both genders lose sex drive and fertility.",

The proprietors often are sitting in chairs outside or grabbing an espresso nearby. From the rosticceria, tempting smells of roasting chicken, duck, and rabbit drift into the street. They do a fast business in lasagne at lunch and all day in panzarotti, which means rolled bread but loses something in the translation. It’s rolled around a variety of stuffings, such as mushrooms or ham and cheese. Sausage and mozzarella is one of the best. Past the circular Piazza Garibaldi—almost every Italian town has one—you come to the proof, if you have not intuited it before, that this is one of the most civilized towns on the globe. A shady park extends for a kilometer along the parterre. Cortonese use it daily. A park has a timeless quality. Clothing, flowers, the sizes of trees change; otherwise it easily could be a hundred years ago. Around the cool splash of the fountain of upside-down nymphs riding dolphins, young parents watch their children play. The benches are full of neighbors talking. Often a father balances a tiny child on a two-wheeler and watches her wobble off with a mixture of fear and exhilaration on his face. It’s a peaceful spot to read the paper. A dog can get a long evening walk. Off to the right, there’s the valley and the curved end of Lake Trasimeno.",

Michael Robartes was silent, seeming anxious to leave me to my thoughts; and as we walked between the sea and the rocky side of a great promontory, I realized with a new perfection what a shock had been given to all my habits of thought and of feelings, if indeed some mysterious change had not taken place in the substance of my mind, for the grey waves, plumed with scudding foam, had grown part of a teeming, fantastic inner life; and when Michael Robartes pointed to a square ancient-looking house, with a much smaller and newer building under its lee, set out on the very end of a dilapidated and almost deserted pier, and said it was the Temple of the Alchemical Rose, I was possessed with the phantasy that the sea, which kept covering it with showers of white foam, was claiming it as part of some indefinite and passionate life, which had begun to war upon our orderly and careful days, and was about to plunge the world into a night as obscure as that which followed the downfall of the classical world. One part of my mind mocked this phantastic terror, but the other, the part that still lay half plunged in vision, listened to the clash of unknown armies, and shuddered at unimaginable fanaticisms, that hung in those grey leaping waves.",
