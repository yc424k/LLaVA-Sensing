While Mrs Ambrose arranged her embroidery, sucked her silk, and threaded her needle, she lay back gazing at the horizon.",

If I am mad enough to take a walk after one-thirty, no one is out, not even a dog. The word torpor comes to mind. All shops close during the sacred three hours. If you need something for bee sting or allergy, too bad. Siesta is prime time for TV in Italy. It’s prime time for sex, too. Maybe this accounts for the Mediterranean temperament versus the northern: children conceived in the light and children conceived in the dark. Ovid has a poem about siesta, written before the first millennium turned. He’s lying relaxed in sultry summer, one shutter closed, the other ajar, “the half-light shy girls need,” he wrote, “to hide their hesitation.” He goes on to grab the dress, which didn’t hide much. Well, everything is always new under the sun. Then, as now, a quick wash in the bidet and back to work.",

He had of course known of this necessity: he had seen too many friends through the Divorce Court, in one country or another, not to be fairly familiar with the procedure. But the fact presented a different aspect as soon as he tried to relate it to himself and Susy: it was as though Susy's personality were a medium through which events still took on a transfiguring colour. He found the \"domicile\" that very day: a tawdrily furnished rez-de-chaussée, obviously destined to far different uses. And as he sat there, after the concierge had discreetly withdrawn with the first quarter's payment in her pocket, and stared about him at the vulgar plushy place, he burst out laughing at what it was about to figure in the eyes of the law: a Home, and a Home desecrated by his own act! The Home in which he and Susy had reared their precarious bliss, and seen it crumble at the brutal touch of his unfaithfulness and his cruelty—for he had been told that he must be cruel to her as well as unfaithful! He looked at the walls hung with sentimental photogravures, at the shiny bronze \"nudes,\" the moth-eaten animal-skins and the bedizened bed-and once more the unreality, the impossibility, of all that was happening to him entered like a drug into his veins.",

But no, after all, it was not that: he was unhappy, that was it, he was desperately unhappy. But why? Was it because he feared he had exceeded his rights in pledging her to such an extent, in acting for her when there was no time to consult her? Apparently the idea of the discord between Lita and Jim, and Lita’s thirst for scenic notoriety, had shocked him deeply—much more, in reality, than they had Pauline. If so, his impulse had been a natural one, and eminently in keeping with those Wyant traditions with which (at suitable moments) she continued to identify herself. Yes: she began to understand his thinking it would be odious to her to see the names of her son’s wife and this worthless Italian cousin emblazoned over every Picture Palace in the land. She felt moved by his regard for her feelings. After all, as he said, Lita and Michelangelo were no relations of his; he could easily have washed his hands of the whole affair.",

Soon I was surrounded by hundreds of little tin-roofed homes in tiny plots – most gardens neat and flowery, a few shimmy, each with an outside latrine. Many dwellings have brightly painted woodwork and curtained windows, some have lean-to shacks at the back. Electricity has recently been laid on for the minority who can afford it. Small supermarkets stock a range of manufactured goods and processed foods unseen (outside of the capitals) between Nairobi and Karoi. I counted seven churches, some hut-sized; South Africa has approximately 3,500 indigenous Churches, independent of the imported variety, their memberships varying from hundreds to millions.

She sat on the edge of the next table as we ate, chatting non-stop, an amiable demonstration of democracy I had also noticed in the Hanabanilla and Playa Giron hotels. Taking Oscar as a sympathetic abuelo figure, she confided that her parents disapproved of her beloved because he couldn’t (or wouldn’t?) move to Havana – where she could earn far more, being a personable young woman, in any of the big tourist hotels. Afterwards Oscar told me he encouraged her to put love before convertible pesos. Being unable to follow their rapid conversation I was relating to Carlota, an enchanting half-grown tabby who could be heard raucously demanding breakfast before dawn and who frisked all day amongst the ceiling-high potted shrubs in the lobby-cum-restaurant. Her play was vigorous yet gentle; she kept her claws sheathed and her love-bites were nicely judged not quite to draw blood.",

A calico torn with a black neckline like a court decoration decides to investigate a bloody scrap of paper in which there are still a few scraps from one of the meat stalls, pulls his paw across it languidly a couple of times and saunters back to rest among the zinnias. On the first shelf of the ruin two kittens, one white as a sacred calf, box a moment, not having learned to gage their desires, then in disillusion move apart. Here and there older cats take a swipe or two at washing themselves or each other, and are not too drowsy to have their feelings hurt; obscure episodes of pride and disgrace are taking place all through the happy scene, but that is not the fault of Rome.",

He told tales of perilous adventure by flood and field, by mountain and forest; of the wild chase of moose and wapiti among the snows of the Rockies; of the fierce delight of single-handed combat with grizzly bears, the deadliest of their kind; of how he, Hardy, had been rolled down a cañon, locked in the embrace of a furry fiend that he had stabbed in the throat one second before the fatal hug. He told of the melting of the snows in forest rivers; of the flood that swept away the lonely traveller's encampment, and bore him, astride on a log of driftwood, five miles amid wrack and boulders on its whirling current; of deliverance through a pious Indian and his canoe, which he entered as by a miracle in mid-stream, and without upsetting any of the three. He told of long wanderings in the twilight solitudes of Canadian forests; of dangers from wolves and the wild coyotes, half-dog, half-wolf, heard nightly howling round the Indian camp-fires; and from the intangible malice of the skunk, a beautiful but dreadful power, to be propitiated with bated breath and muffled footstep. He told, too, of the chip-munks, with their sharp twittering bark; and he contrived to invest even these tiny creatures with an atmosphere of terror—for it is well known that their temper is atrocious, and that a colony of them will set upon the unfortunate traveller who happens to offend one, and leave nothing of him but his bones and the indigestible portions of his clothing. And over all he cast the glamour of his fancy, as if it had been the red light of the prairie sunsets; in it he appeared transfigured, a half-mythical personage, heroic, if not indeed divine. The whole of it had appeared word for word in the pages of the Pioneer-book.",

Faced with a language barrier, Kenyans tend to be aloof, almost hostile, I fancied later, wandering around Narok in search of groundnuts. But perhaps I was mistaking unease for antagonism. Abraham had warned me that ‘uneducated Kenyans’ (many Africans are fond of this academic class distinction) expect elders to behave with dignity. And travelling by bicycle is not dignified for any European, least of all a female elder; one rarely sees an African woman cyclist.",

My English-speaking friends admit, ‘We are in retreat’ – shopping hurriedly, not strolling around the pleasant parks or meeting friends for leisurely sessions in Pietermaritzburg’s cosy little coffee shops. However, many more blacks are visible; hawkers trade everywhere, including on the wide steps of the municipal offices and court house, where they assert ‘equality’ by spreading woven blankets and crocheted tablecloths on the ornamental shrubs.",

    "target_paragraph": "The long corridor of blue-and-cream enfiladed rooms ends with the bar that opens onto the fragrant garden. Tanned bodies, gleaming and scented, retaining their memory of the soft seawater, move languidly. In the opaline light they look, to an equally languid observer, like figures lit behind gauze. As dusk lengthens, personalities take on more definition. The men talk about the rehabilitation and, as the mood grows mellower, the renaissance of Naples. “Il mare non bagna Napoli [the sea doesn't bathe Naples],” the editor says, whereupon someone makes the sign to ward off the Evil Eye. A scholar of gesture has determined that there are seventeen meanings to the gesture that signifies the Evil Eye, depending on context and nuance of finger position; the editor makes them all, to the mingled delight and mock or real alarm of all assembled. A vagrant breeze carries the faint sound of faraway music into the lamplit room, and soon voices are raised in song—Neapolitan love songs, subtle (subtlety is not a characteristic usually attributed to Neapolitans; but this is not the Naples of the streets, it is the Naples of the salon), sophisticated, plaintive laments suffused with dark longings and dark humor. . . . As the energy increases, the women play to one another, as if they alone know what it is like to be tormented by the arrows of love; their glances, haughty-warm, hot-cool, slide off the faces of the bemused men, who conduct a dialogue with their hands, as if they alone have known betrayal and perfidy. How sweetly man and woman sing to each other of the other's treachery. The play of hands and eyes and voices is elegant; the movements—apparently spontaneous—achieve a stylized eloquence. The wordless hospitality that enfolds us is exquisite.",

They seemed to be eminently gentle souls, and I could not help being impressed when they informed me that they had given up their jobs in Vancouver, their homes, even their proprietorship of a local Dead-head fanzine, in order to come to Asia for a year. Just to travel? No, they replied, they planned to work in an eye clinic sponsored by the Dead. Where exactly? Nepal. Perfect, I thought. Hessean journeyers to the East, propelled by a social conscience, a lifetime of Dead-mania, a kind of improvised innocence—this was exactly what I dreamed of finding in Kathmandu.",

Mrs. Belknap walked toward the house to welcome a group of visitors, and Miss Wicks remained beside the tea-table, alone with Troy. She was leaning back in a wide basket-chair, her thin ankles in white open-work stockings thrust out under her short skirt, her arms locked behind her thrown-back head. Troy lay on the ground and plucked at the tufts of grass at his elbow. Why was it that, with all the currents of vitality flowing between this group of animated girls and youths, he could feel no nearness but hers? The feeling was not particularly agreeable, but there was no shaking it off; it was like a scent that has got into one's clothes. He was not sure that he liked her, but he wanted to watch her, to listen to her, to defend her against the mockery and criticism in the eyes of the others. At this point his powers of analysis gave out, and his somewhat extensive vocabulary failed him. After all, he had to fall back on the stupid old school phrase. She was \"his size\"—that was all.",

In the dry season the water level in the Tapajos could fall by as much as forty feet, and for much of the year it was too shallow for boatloads of equipment to reach the plantation. Such equipment as did arrive frequently proved to be useless or at least premature. One crate sent from Detroit contained ice-making machines. Another consignment included a narrow-gauge steam locomotive and several hundred feet of track. Blakeley failed to build adequate storehouses, so supplies spoiled on the riverbanks. Bags of cement absorbed moisture from the air and became hard as rock. Machines and tools rusted and grew unusable. Anything that was remotely portable was pilfered.",

The chaos had begun in the plane itself, the large man next to me pulling out a flask of something potent as soon as we were in the air, while other of his fellows began running hands up any cabin attendants who walked past. (In fact, it had begun even earlier, in JFK, where all the passengers seemed to be carrying all their goods onto the plane with them. I, too, fearing what would happen to my bags if they left my sight, had tried to carry everything onto the plane, and been forced to check in luggage as I boarded.)",

Though the gold-plated sultanate was famous for its $350-million palace (complete with a telephone in each of its 2,200 rooms), its $15-billion surplus spread among a population about the size of Colorado Springs’ and its per capita income, the highest in the world outside Kuwait, the only Neronian splendors I could find in its torpid capital were a multistory car park, a stadium, two overpriced hotels and a supermarket (which accepted American Express cards). Within two hours of arrival, I had exhausted its main sights—a tiny aquarium and a museum commemorating Winston Churchill on the grounds that Churchill had never been here—and was reduced to reading old copies of Harper’s in the local library. In the streets, I saw tired-looking Mummies in sundresses leading whining children by the hand, and in the Grill Room (a pubby place with barrels of sherry on its walls and place mats representing the churches of Albion), red-faced Brits sullenly knifed their steaks while their Malay mistresses gaily chattered away. By my second day in town, I was beginning to see the same faces in the same places, and by my second night I was longing for the days to end. I stayed up till 1 a.m. to watch I Was a Mail Order Bride on TV and spent much of a morning reading the local phone book’s essay “How to Use a Telephone” (Step #1: “Ascertain from the current issue of the Telephone Directory the number you wish to call”). That evening, at the Sheraton coffee shop, I saw the same Brit sipping what looked like the same $7 celery juice and paging his way through the same worn volume of Angus Wilson. I got on the next bus to the airport, and fled.",

A brook divided the moor from the tenements, and to outward view there was no way across it—no way to the houses but round about by the road. But under every householder’s stairs there was kept a mysterious plank nine inches wide; which plank was a secret bridge.",

In one of the smaller valleys we walked into a cleft so narrow that we could not get on, and had to wait till morning. The place was so lonely and sheltered that I could without misgiving take the opportunity to dye my blond hair and beard black. I also stained my face and hands with a mixture of permanganate, brown paint, and grease, which produced a dark shade. By this means I acquired some resemblance to an Indian; that was important as we had decided, if we were challenged, to say that we were on a pilgrimage to the sacred Ganges. As for my companion he was dark enough not to be noticeable at a distance. Naturally we did not mean to court close inspection.",
