Although puffins are capable of flight, their chubby bodies and tiny appendages make airborne activity difficult.

However this year, all of a sudden the middle class women of the UK have no such money for gift shops. How is business for him? It’s down by more than half, but that’s better than most of his neighbours. They rebuilt fast, cheap, and furiously after the tsunami damage – now four years ago. The worst hit business in his extended family was their rubber tree plantation, and that’s nothing to do with the storm. Global prices are literally starving small farmers. Sister Mango arrives and shows me a pleasant hut, up on the usual stilts to stay cool and to be above rats, snakes, rabid dogs, etc. It has a private (cold) shower, a fan, and a small balcony with chair and clothesline, all for six pounds per day (that’s eight euros or ten dollars). This is less than half of what I am paying for my noisy wiener oven. The views are of palm trees and the garden. It is a surprisingly quiet courtyard, and most of my neighbours are friendly Dutch bikers. I am home. I pay in advance. I will move in first thing tomorrow morning.",

    "target_paragraph": "Our target for today was the mountain overlooking Ronda village and for the first hour we were climbing gradually through tiny, terraced fields bounded by glistening, frozen irrigation channels. Here were many apricot, apple, mulberry, walnut and plane trees, some with ancient vines twining around their trunks, or linking tree to tree, like fabulous serpents. Near the edge of a precipice we rested in the sun while looking down on yesterday’s ‘grey valley’ and on the Indus still further below. Then we turned to gaze over the roofs of Ronda village at our objective. We were not aiming for the 14,000 foot summit – an unclimbable buttress of fluted rock – but for a point some 2,000 feet lower, to which a goat track led from Gomu hamlet, beyond Ronda. This path could be seen running like a pencil-line straight across a vast expanse of scree, and then climbing through a jumble of broken brown rock in the midst of which it seemed to peter out.",

Possibly at the moment he did not even recognise the ford at once, even when the cow, slowing, walked down into the water and stopped and drank and he ran up, slowing too, moaning, urgent but not loud, not to send her once more in to flight. So he approaches the bank, stilling his voice now, picking his feet up and putting them down again in one spot, his singed and scorched face urgent and tense. But she does not move, and at last he steps down into the water, onto the water, forgetting again that it will give under his weight, crying once again not so much in surprise as in alarm lest he alarm her, and steps again forward onto the receptive solid, and touches her. She does not even stop drinking; his hand has lain on her flank for a second or two before she lifts her dripping muzzle and looks back at him, once more maiden meditant, shame-free.",

I watch a sea kayaking group make landfall on Eilean an Fheidh, one of many small uninhabited islands in Loch Moidart. Sadly, the road ends here. Travel choices include backtracking or walking the bike along a coastal path that overlooks the loch. The coastal path contour lines are hair raising. Since it is barely past 1pm, backtracking wins. Backtracking sometimes provides sights unseen on the first bypassing. This time it is a bridge over the River Shiel commemorating the 1899 agreement between the Right Honourable Lord Howard of Glossop and Charles Dunell Rudd Esq of Ardnamurchan, lairds respectively of the Dorlin and Ardnamurchan Estates. The agreement designated the midpoint of the river as the boundary between their two estates. I stand in the middle of the bridge, straddling that line, and look for fish. The shadows of the trees obscure them. The river’s banks have long boardwalks extending midstream. Salmon fishing is big here now that the sea trout fishery has crashed. The wind is from the north. Given there is nothing between me and the polar ice cap, the occasional mists feel like ice crystals.",

Sometimes one thing, sometimes another, to confirm her philosophy that colour is sound—or, perhaps, it has something to do with music. She could never quite say, though it was not for lack of trying. And she could not ask you back to her room, for it was ‘not very clean, I’m afraid’, so she must catch you in the passage, or take a chair in Hyde Park to explain her philosophy. The rhythm of the soul depends on it—(’how rude the little boys are!’ she would say), and Mr Asquith’s Irish policy, and Shakespeare comes in, ‘and Queen Alexandra most graciously once acknowledged a copy of my pamphlet,’ she would say, waving the little boys magnificently away. But she needs funds to publish her book, for ‘publishers are capitalists—publishers are cowards’. And so, digging her elbow into her pile of books it fell over.",

Huh?’ – he said, almost barking at him, with a comical thrusting movement of the head. But even before the boy could answer, and he saw the sullen and exasperated scowl upon his face, he thrust his fingers wildly through his hair, burst into a wild rich ‘whah-whah’ of crazy laughter – a laughter that was all the more strange and astonishing because even as he laughed the taut and drawn tension of his face and nerves, and the frenzied unrest of his eyes, were terribly apparent – and then started the car in motion again with a jarring, grinding and convulsive jolt. And Luke could not have said why he had halted at these last two outposts of the town – the drug-store and the filling station – but certainly the impulse that had made him halt had little to do with food or drink, for neither of them was hungry, and they had no need or desire for further nourishment.",

As they disappeared behind, sheathed in their spooky mist, I began to cry, thinking of the daunting 3,000 miles between us and our next landfall. Nowhere but in my minuscule Varuna, in the middle of an ocean, could the enormity of planet Earth make me feel so privileged yet so completely like a speck of nothingness. Today, it was the latter that produced my tears. They cooked into my stew; they dampened Dinghy’s fur; and they formed circular wet spots on my pillow and charts. The more the anxiety welled up, the more my attention and energies focused on Varuna, and as we crept farther into the blue void, we drew even closer together. When I steered, her tiller was an extension of my own hand. When I slept, Varuna held me in an isolated cradle of safety.",

Ah, if one could sail for ever, on a small quiet, lonely ship, from land to land and isle to isle, and saunter through the spaces of this lovely world, always through the spaces of this lovely world. Sweet it would be sometimes to come to the opaque earth, to block oneself against the stiff land, to annul the vibration of one's flight against the inertia of our terra firma! but life itself would be in the flight, the tremble of space. Ah, the trembling of never-ended space, as one moves in flight!",

The SEA movement community which she belongs to is made up of surfers, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, journalists and policymakers who want to preserve the natural resources and beauty of the island of Siargao, while developing it in a sustainable way to provide jobs and opportunities for the local community. ‘It is crucial that all sectors?government, businesses and NGOs?work together to tackle the risk of environmental degradation. As the influx of tourism keeps intensifying, empowering the local community is vital so that it doesn’t remain passive to the changes taking place. For starters, we need a proper waste management system, both solid and sewage. This is by far the biggest challenge facing the island. We also require access to good medical facilities, affordable and quality education, typhoon-proof housing, clean water, a sustainable tourism plan and real jobs with salaries. These things should be prioritized over international airports and massive bridges,’ she said.",

Prime pickings for Henry VIII who dissolved it, then sold it on in 1540. The Abbey was left to decay, with stone being pilfered for local building projects such as Fountains Hall. You would know Fountains Abbey as it regularly shows up as a film location and on tourist brochures. We wander down the River Skell and water gardens, crossing from one side to the other.

Her job was in a rambling shabby side-street boarding-house with an equivocal reputation, named the Savoy Hotel. Her work began at daybreak and ended sometime after dark, sometimes well after dark. She swept and made the beds and did some of the cooking, since there was a negro porter who washed the dishes and kept up the fires. She had her meals there and received three dollars a week. “Only she’s going to keep her heels blistered running barefooted in and out of them horse-traders’ and petty jurys’ and agents for nigger insurances’ rooms all night long,” a town wit said. But that was her affair. Ratliff knew nothing about that and cared less and, to his credit, believed even still less than that. So now he would not see her at all save on Sunday afternoons as, the children in the new overcoats which he had bought for them and the woman in his old one which she had insisted on paying him fifty cents for, they would enter the gate to the jail or perhaps emerge from it. That was when it occurred to him how not once had any of his kin—old Ab or the schoolmaster or the blacksmith or the new clerk—come in to see him. And if all the facts about that business was knowed, he thought, There’s one of them that ought to be there in that cell too. Or in another one just like it, since you cant hang a man twice—granted of course that a Snopes carries the death penalty even for another Snopes.",

If she wouldn’t listen now, at least they might arrange an hour the next day when she would. He couldn’t go home to just black misery. He couldn’t. He was a human being. There were things a human being simply couldn’t do. He would see her again that evening, if only to find out when she would let him call and talk quietly. Surely she owed him this. He hadn’t done anything to offend her really, except tell her that he loved her. And was that an offence? No; it was most natural, inevitable and right, he assured his shrinking heart. For his heart did shrink; it was very fearful, because he knew she would be angry when she saw him. He could barely get the words out to Mrs. Mitcham at the door, so short was he of breath because of his heart.

He once prematurely used up his food, and he walked out in eleven days, eating squirrels. It takes more than squirrels to keep Roy Miettunen in form. He lost more than sixty pounds, and came out of the woods weighing two thirteen. He speaks slowly, firmly, attractively. With his great frame and his big head, his unfrivolous jaw, he looks more sergeant than Sarge. He was, long ago, of the Seattle police. In his cabin he has eighteen rifles, thirty-four pistols, and two swords.",

After they died, it was decided I would live with my aunt in London.” Richard paused, pleased to feel the strangely inchoate intimacy that came with talking about himself, something he rarely did. “My cousins Martin and Virginia were about my age but terribly sophisticated; Aunt Elizabeth was quite grand, you see, and I was the cousin from the tiny village in Shropshire. I started thinking about running away the first day I arrived there.”",

It appeared to have a definite goal in front of it, differing in this respect from the singular high stepping angular green insect who attempted to cross in front of it, and waited for a second with its antennæ trembling as if in deliberation, and then stepped off as rapidly and strangely in the opposite direction. Brown cliffs with deep green lakes in the hollows, flat bladelike trees that waved from root to tip, round boulders of grey stone, vast crumpled surfaces of a thin crackling texture—all these objects lay across the snail’s progress between one stalk and another to his goal. Before he had decided whether to circumvent the arched tent of a dead leaf or to breast it there came past the bed the feet of other human beings.",

A few couples huddled in doorways, speaking softly. It was close to ten, and the air was still hot. The only activity was along the river, where thatch-roofed restaurants, open to the air and brimming with people, ran half the length of the waterfront. There was an ice cream shop just below us, and a coffee bar, but the rest was under construction: a new boardwalk and promenade, and the rising outlines of yet another hotel, what would be the fifteenth in a community of just twenty thousand.",

Suddenly the little girl turned, ran after them – and presented one bar of chocolate to the boy. Although both mothers looked astonished they didn’t communicate, didn’t acknowledge each other’s existence.

Or we would head due north, away up to Sula Sgeir and Rona. Ian placed one hand on top of the other and laid them on the chart, then looked off into mid-air. The shipping forecast murmured in the background: Malin, Hebrides, Minch. Light southerly, 3 or 4. Cyclonic veering south-south-easterly for a time. ‘Good wind strength for a small boat,’ he said. ‘Just a touch light, if anything.’",

    "target_paragraph": "Genghis Khan told the peoples he conquered that he was their punishment for the soft, luxurious lives they had been leading. Certainly, the Mongols’ existence on the steppes had been the opposite of that. Physically, the Mongols were narrow waisted, small footed, with large heads; many had the bowlegs nomads acquire from growing up on horseback. The men shaved the crowns of their heads and left bangs hanging down in front and two long locks in back, which they braided and tied to their ears. They had thick eyebrows. Much of their lives was spent outdoors in the steppes’ fierce climate, almost always on horseback. They would mount up and ride whenever they had to go a distance farther than a hundred paces. Observers said the Mongols would eat just about anything—mare’s milk curds dried on rocks, roots, lice, dogs, rats, meat tenderized by being ridden on all day beneath a saddle. Marco Polo said they ate a lot of hamsters, which were plentiful on the steppes. Other observers noted that on long journeys Mongol riders would open a vein in their horse’s neck and fill a small bowl with blood, or drink directly from the vein. They could endure extreme cold or heat while riding, Friar Carpini said, and after two days with no food “sing and make merry as if they have eaten their bellies full.”",

A sharpnose eel slowly swims like a snake across the bottom while SCUBA divers congregate and watch. A black-and-white spotted moray eel hides in a cave and does not move when I shine my light on it and stare.

Model 153–421 was conspicuously marked 4,800 forints, then approximately $60. All the non-Soviet models cost at least 20,000 forints, an out-of-the-question investment since this machine was to be left with a Rumanian friend. Inside, hundreds of 153–421s were stacked along one wall in an alarmingly unassembled state; one would need an honours degree in engineering to get them on the road. In sign language I pleaded with a grumpy, undersized young man to sell me the assembled display model. He responded, naturally enough, in Hungarian, which language isolates its users to a unique extent from their fellow-Europeans. Yet his expression and tone conveyed a clear message: in this unreformed state store no rule could possibly be bent for the sake of a mere customer. Despairingly I sought an English-speaker, or even a German- or French-speaker. In any Rumanian city multi-linguists would at once have swarmed, excitedly eager to help the foreigner. In Budapest it is otherwise.",

It’s a converted farmhouse, white with a red-tiled roof. I was born in my sister’s room, next door to my dad’s childhood bedroom. Dad moved back there when he married my mum. After they divorced and he moved out, my mum wanted to stay. She rescued Fletcher, a massive, confused dog. And she’s happy, I think. Just her and Fletch. All year round, the garden is wild with colour. It was planted by my grandmother Sonya. The yellow of daffodils in spring, seas of bluebells, pink with roses and the red of maples in summer, carpets of scarlet and orange as the oak leaves fall, white with winter frosts. Now I think the house smells like my mum, of old cushions and freshly watered plants. She’s probably asleep there now, Fletcher snoring downstairs unless he’s awake, eyes wide at nothing.",

Then in 1869 a local entrepreneur named Sylvester March built the cog railway, the first in the world. Everyone thought he was mad and that even if he succeeded in building the railway, which was doubtful, there wouldn’t be any demand for it. In fact, as the disgorging throngs below me demonstrated now, people haven’t tired of it yet.",
