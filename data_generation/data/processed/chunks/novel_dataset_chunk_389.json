Eliza straightened out Ben’s limbs, and folded his hands across his body. She smoothed out the rumpled covers of the bed, and patted out the pillows, making a smooth hollow for his head to rest in. His flashing hair, cropped close to his well-shaped head, was crisp and crinkly as a boy’s, and shone with bright points of light. With a pair of scissors, she snipped off a little lock where it would not show.",

The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.",

The two ladies went upstairs to the sitting-room, where Mrs Peniston seated herself in her black satin arm-chair tufted with yellow buttons, beside a bead-work table bearing a bronze box with a miniature of Beatrice Cenci in the lid. Lily felt for these objects, the same distaste which the prisoner may entertain for the fittings of the court-room. It was here that her aunt received her rare confidences, and the pink-eyed smirk of the turbaned Beatrice was associated in her mind with the gradual fading of the smile from Mrs Peniston’s lips. That lady’s dread of a scene gave her an inexorableness which the greatest strength of character could not have produced, since it was independent of all considerations of right or wrong; and knowing this, Lily seldom ventured to assail it. She had never felt less like making the attempt than on the present occasion; but she had sought in vain for any other means of escape from an intolerable situation.",

Emma’s hands were on her muff, stroking it eagerly. “Hendchen, Hendchen,” she cooed in her consoling tones, “to house to house, I am so angry—hangry.”\n“Hungry.”\n“Hungry, yes, and Minna and Clara is ready. Komm!”\nThe child linked arms with her and pulled Miriam towards the corridor. Once out of sight under the gallery she slipped her arm round Miriam’s waist. “Oh, Hendchen, my darling beautiful, you have so lovely teint after your badth—oh, I am zo hangry, oh Hendchen, I luff you zo, I am zo haypie, kiss me one small, small kiss.”\n“What a baby you are,” said Miriam, half turning as the girl’s warm lips brushed the angle of her jaw. “Yes, we’ll go home, come along.”\nThe corridor was almost airless. She longed to get out into the open. They found Minna at a table in the entrance hall her head propped on her hand, snoring gently. Clara sat near her with closed eyes.\nAs the little party of four making its way home, cleansed and hungry, united and happy, stood for a moment on a tree-planted island half-way across a wide open space, Minna with her eager smile said, gazing, “Oh, I would like a glass Bier.” Miriam saw very distinctly the clear sunlight on the boles of the trees showing every ridge and shade of colour as it had done on the peaked summer-house porch in the morning. The girls closed in on her during the moment of disgust which postponed her response.\n“Dear Hendchen! We are alone! Just we nice four! Just only one most little small glass! Just one! Kind best, Hendchen!” she heard. She pushed her way through the little group pretending to ignore their pleadings and to look for obstacles to their passage to the opposite curb. She felt her disgust was absurd and was asking herself why the girls should not have their beer. She would like to watch them, she knew; these little German Fraus-to-be serenely happy at their bier table on this bright afternoon. They closed in on her again. Emma in the gutter in front of her. She felt arms and hands, and the pleading voices besieged her again. Emma’s upturned tragic face, her usually motionless lips a beseeching tunnel, her chin and throat moving to her ardent words made Miriam laugh. It was disgusting. “No, no,” she said hastily, backing away from them to the end of the island. “Of course not. Come along. Don’t be silly.” The elder girls gave in. Emma kept up a little solo of reproach hanging on Miriam’s arm. “Very strict. Cold English. No bier. I want to home. I have bier to home” until they were in sight of the high walls of Waldstrasse.",

The part was a small one—Flamel had few intimate friends—but composed of more heterogeneous atoms than the little pools into which society usually runs. The reaction from the chief episode of his earlier life had bred in Glennard an uneasy distaste for any kind of personal saliency. Cleverness was useful in business; but in society it seemed to him as futile as the sham cascades formed by a stream that might have been used to drive a mill. He liked the collective point of view that goes with the civilized uniformity of dress-clothes, and his wife’s attitude implied the same preference; yet they found themselves slipping more and more into Flamel’s intimacy. Alexa had once or twice said that she enjoyed meeting clever people; but her enjoyment took the negative form of a smiling receptivity; and Glennard felt a growing preference for the kind of people who have their thinking done for them by the community.",

On the wall of one building I could just make out the emblem of the British Crown and the date it was built: 1923. Layers of paint, decades of renovations, were flaking off its columns like the sheaths of skin shed by snakes. The wreckage of the façade was patched together here and there with corrugated iron and tarpaulin, and mildew was creeping up the walls. The town is centred around an old British-built market with elegant pillars and wrought-iron roof fixtures. Inside the market, plump women sit amid baskets of damp greens and fresh flowers. There are stalls selling a rainbow array of plastic buckets and raincoats. Deeper inside, beneath the gloom of the roof, shanks of raw meat hang from metal hooks. And down where the market opens on to the river, where the produce of the Delta is loaded on to boats bound for Rangoon, piles of yellow mangoes glistening wet from the rain are nestled in beds of straw, and bananas dangle like claws from bamboo poles. Myaungmya was once a bustling trading post and attracted merchants from all over Burma. There are mosques and pagodas and Chinese shrines smeared with red paint and golden calligraphy as thick as papier mâché. But as I looked down the side alleys I saw that they drifted off into dirt lanes and jungle.",

    "target_paragraph": "Eugene and Anna had a new life in the Bronx running a bar together, but this chapter came to an unexpected and abrupt end. In 1920, they encountered Prohibition: that bizarre experiment, the American teetotal “Eighteenth Amendment” that was approved early in 1919, giving the nation one year to brace itself. The USA went dry one year later, 17 January 1920. No alcohol was to be sold anywhere, officially. Although “speakeasies” and all sorts of underground networks sprang up, Eugene and George sold the bar and Eugene bought a garage. The Assignment of Mortgage was listed in the New York Tribune on 15 January, just two days earlier. He seems to have thought ahead, or perhaps he was guided by Big Capable George, his business partner with the cigar.",

Finally, he got up out of his chair, grunting painfully, and fumbling for the walls, lurched out into the hall, and began to grope his way across the corridor toward the stairs. And the first step fooled him as it had done so many times before; he missed his step, even as a man stepping out in emptiness might miss, and came down heavily upon his knees. Then, pushing with his hands, he slid out peacefully on the oiled green linoleum, pillowed his big head on his arms with a comfortable grunt, and sprawled out flat, already half dead to the world. It was in this position – also a familiar one – that Creasman, who had heard his thump when falling, found him. And she spoke sharply and commandingly as one might speak to a little child.",

I can see the sand on the bottom, or the reef, and sometimes the waves are transparent. The water just looks cleaner and more friendly than what I am used to.\n​I meet other surfers every time I go to the beach, and we all enjoy the waves together, without any competitiveness or negative vibe. Not only are the surfers friendly, but so are the locals. I get a ride every time I walk on the road, even twice when I’m not even sticking my thumb out.\n​I suppose one reason the beach isn’t crowded or popular with travelling surfers is because the prevailing wind here is onshore. The best times to surf are on the days right after a front passes, when it gets a day or two of offshores while the swell still comes in. While surfers can easily find more consistent and higher-quality waves in Central America, Eleuthera is a good place for the sailing surfer who is already in The Bahamas and doesn’t mind hitchhiking.",

Its four rooms could have comfortably accommodated his immediate family – a strong-featured wife, as forceful as himself, and three bouncy small children. This however was an extended-by-misfortune family, including Jawdat’s mother, a widowed sister and her two children (also small and bouncy), an alarmingly asthmatic first cousin, two adolescent orphans bequeathed by a more distant cousin and Musa, a seriously disabled great-uncle. In 1988 an IDF bullet had damaged his spine as he walked home through a ‘disorder’.",

The chorus, like a torrent jumping rocks, brutally assaulting old trees, pours with splendid abandonment headlong over precipices. On they roll; on they gallop; after hounds, after footballs; they pump up and down attached to oars like sacks of flour. All divisions are merged—they act like one man. The gusty October wind blows the uproar in bursts of sound and silence across the court. Now again they are smashing the china—that is the convention. An old, unsteady woman carrying a bag trots home under the fire-red windows. She is half afraid that they will fall on her and tumble her into the gutter. Yet she pauses as if to warm her knobbed, her rheumaticky hands at the bonfire which flares away with streams of sparks and bits of blown paper. The old woman pauses against the lit window. A contrast. That I see and Neville does not see; that I feel and Neville does not feel. Hence he will reach perfection and I shall fail and shall leave nothing behind me but imperfect phrases littered with sand.",

The guard was very upset by something in Teresa’s bag. He pointed with a baton and directed her to unpack. It was the monolith, of course – that solid stone thing wrapped in a thousand sheets of tissue paper – that upset the guards. “What is this?” they asked. They passed the thing through the X-ray machine a few times, and they inspected it by hand and by eye till they were convinced of its innocence. The guards walked away and waited for the next round of suspects. Teresa humbly wrapped the thing in its shroud and tucked it back into her bag. We checked in for our flight, passed through another round of security inspections, and found ourselves in a brightly lit concourse. An LED board announced a long string of destinations serviced by the terminal, including ours: London Heathrow.",

Within a block of my hotel, the Nome Nugget Inn, I spotted two businesses offering assaying and refining services. As Robert drove into the foothills back from the coast, mining sites, mostly one-man operations, dotted the bleak landscape. “This guy here is killing it,” he said, pointing at one spot. “These guys over here hit twenty-nine hundred ounces in six weeks.” We passed a gigantic hole like a sunken football stadium, with tiny trucks rolling around its dusty bottom. “That’s an open-pit mine. I hear their workers get a hundred and fifty thousand dollars per season.” That money didn’t go as far in Nome as it did elsewhere. Gas cost twice what it did in Anchorage. “Lunch here is twenty dollars.”",

That September, an opportunity came up to join a crew transplanting red salmon from one location on the island to another in an old amphibious Grumman Goose, an airplane designed with a wide, boatlike hull.* The move required carrying adult fish in a portable wooden tank. Bad weather rolled in, trapping six men in a lakefront cabin for three days. On the fourth day, things cleared enough for Harry and the pilot, Hal Derrick, to attempt a run. But rains had raised the lake level, and water now slopped against the fuselage. “By the time I got the door closed, the water was above the floorboards of the plane,” Harry said. The first fish drop went okay, though the Goose “felt a little tail-heavy.”",

I too got out, my luggage being exposed in the boot; and as I stood poised to foil a thief one sneaked up behind me – a small boy with a filthy pinched face, red-rimmed eyes and an air of savage desperation. He tried to pick my jacket pockets while my hands were in them. Meanwhile several adults, also with haggard faces and wild eyes, were physically fighting over bars of soap and packets of cigarettes. Jimbolia is not recommended for a first crossing into Rumania; there one would be unlikely to fall in love with the country.",

Some of the farmers are even already going out into their fields. It must be getting rather hot down there in Southern California by now. I wonder if you ever got a chance to get out and see how many people showed up for the March 20 Rainbow gathering there at the hotsprings.

Leather chairs lazed around a comfortable lobby. Bright corridors gave off into kitchens and computer centers. Office windows offered penthouse views of the glittering city below. Everyone, explained Joe, was joining in on the mad search for oil in the South China Sea. Over there—he pointed into the illumined night—was the $100-million building built by BP. That ten-story monstrosity was Esso’s headquarters. In the distance, the big skyscraper was the Garden Hotel.",

And everything smelled foul and dark and musty in the room. Your lips got dry, and your heart was pounding in you like a hammer, and every time you heard someone creaking down the hall your guts got numb and you held your breath. You stared at the door knob and waited for the door to open, and you thought it was your time.”",

The vision is of the woman captive, \"confined in triple walls\", the \"guest darkly lodged\", the \"chainless soul\", that defies its conqueror, its gaoler, and the spectator of its agony. It has, this prisoner, its own unspeakable consolation, the \"Messenger\":\nHe comes with western winds, with evening's wandering airs,\nWith that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars.\nWinds take a pensive tone, and stars a tender fire,\nAnd visions rise and change that kill me with desire.",

As I roll it out with one of the handblown Chianti bottles I rescued from the debris, I think with amazement of my kitchen in San Francisco: the black and white tile floor, mirrored wall between cabinets and counter, long counters in gleaming white, the restaurant stove big enough to take off from the San Francisco airport, sunlight pouring in the skylight, and, always, Vivaldi or Robert Johnson or Villa Lobos to cook to. Here, the determined spider in the fireplace keeps me company as she knits her new web. The stove and fridge look starkly new against the flaking whitewash and under the bulb hanging from what looks like a live wire.",

The wind remained feeble through the day and night as we drifted with the tides in and out of sight of the jutting peak.

At first I was hesitant – aren’t coca leaves somehow associated with cocaine? But the leaves are many stages removed from cocaine, and it’s a tasty tea that locals swear will help with altitude adjustment. We now have a thermos in the van – which was given to us by a random guy in Colombia, of course, friendliest country of the trip to date – and a bag of loose coca leaves that we use to make hot tea multiple times a day. I can’t say whether it’s helping with our acclimatization or our energy levels, but it definitely helps to warm up our bodies on these cold days.",
