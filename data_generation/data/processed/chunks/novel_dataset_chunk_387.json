By 6.30 we were at 10,500 feet and the deep valley on our right was full of dusk and shrieking baboons.

He sometimes throws himself on the hood, sometimes dances, or sometimes misses the car entirely through his drunk, blurry vision. Car after car stops to hand him a coin. Everyone is in good spirits, most people give him money, and I am very glad we’re not attempting to drive anywhere.",

Kate had been living in Buenos Aires for about seven years, and was a smart, quiet girl whose greatest love in life was her dog, Daisy. Daisy had once eaten several of my personal items during a stay with them, and was generally a wild and unpleasant animal who drove everyone besides Kate insane. Daisy’s only redeeming quality came years later, when Kate hired Marco, a very young, very hot passeaperro, or dogwalker. He was the only other human in the world who loved Daisy like Kate did, and he eventually became Kate’s much-younger boyfriend. Over the years, he tamed Daisy and Kate tamed him, and eventually she moved Marco in, like an old-timey British gentleman might raise and then marry his ward. The three of them have now been together for years, and Kate is four months pregnant. So she basically nailed it.",

Slowly a great clock began to strike in the old town. In a cool, dark church, which he had seen the day before, a bell-rope, knotted at the ends, hung down before the altar-steps from an immense distance in the ceiling. The moment the town bell had finished its deep reverberation, a sexton walked noisily across the old flagged church-floor and took the bell-cord in his hands. Slowly, with a gentle rhythm, he began to swing upon the rope, and one could hear at first an old and heavy creaking from the upper air, but as yet no bell.",

On each side of the road were the Rugby fields of two of the colleges and in the afternoon he could look out and down and see the fresh moist green of the playing fields and watch young college fellows, dressed in their shorts and jerseys, and with their bare knees scurfed with grass and turf as they twisted, struggled, swayed, and scrambled for a moment in the scrimmage-circle, and then broke free, running, dodging, passing the ball as they were tackled, filling the moist air with their sharp cries of sport. They did not have the desperate, the grimly determined, the almost professional earnestness that the college teams at home have; their scurfed and muddy knees, their swaying scrambling scrimmages, the swift breaking away and running, their panting breath and crisp clear voices gave them the appearance of grown-up boys.",

When I found the river-bed veering too much to the south I reluctantly left it and walked over a mile or so of desert back to the road. The last thirty miles were through another magnificent mountain range with a very stiff climb up to this village. I passed the scene of a ghastly smash-up reported a few days ago in the English-language Teheran paper. A truck and bus were in a head-on collision on a V-bend – both went into a ravine and fifty-one were killed. Something similar happens almost every day somewhere in Persia and the drivers are always blamed. Watching Persian buses on mountain roads makes me feel quite ill; when I see the dust-cloud that heralds one I dismount and remove myself to a safe distance. During ten days in Teheran I witnessed seven bad traffic accidents, four of them involving the deaths of nine people.",

I had spent the summer traveling around in the company of one Stephen Katz, who had joined me in Paris in April and whom I had gratefully seen off from Istanbul some ten days before. I was tired and road-weary, but very glad to be back in England. I stepped from a London train and was captivated instantly. The village of Virginia Water looked tidy and beckoning. It was full of lazy late-afternoon shadows and an impossible green lushness such as could be appreciated only by someone freshly arrived from an arid clime. Beyond the station rose the Gothic tower of Holloway Sanitorium, a monumental heap of bricks and gables in parklike grounds just beyond the station.",

Then he tried to pin down the foggy colour of the brick of which so much of London is constructed, the look of an English doorway, of a French window, of the roofs and chimney-pots of Paris, of a whole street in Munich--and each of these foreign things he then examined in contrast to its American equivalent.",

Their skin and fur clothing were caked with rime. Munro, slapping his clothes of ice, reported that they’d made it all the way to the other side of the pressure ridges their first day out, with the dogs running well and the trail still easy to follow. But then they’d encountered “an ocean of open water.” The three men had camped there and waited for two days, but the water never closed and Clam and Breddy both began to feel sick, lethargic, and complained of pain in their limbs. So they’d been forced to return.",

The big mountains are the Torridan Hills, which at 1,055 metres qualify as mountains to me. The odd aspect of the Torridons is that they are sandstone. Thus, instead of being rock that has been thrust up, the Torridons are what has remained when the rest has eroded away. Although, granted, they were much higher to begin with, an estimated seven kilometres. Because the sandstone is considerably softer than the Lewisian gneiss on which it sits, climbing the Hills is unique and dangerous. Aside from the loose rock are the unforgiving features such as deep ravines and steep ridges with no escape routes. The mountains are spaced well apart and very pretty to look at, as I pedal along Upper Loch Torridon watching another tourist boat bang up and down in the waves. Torridon Hotel offers luxury accommodations for rich hillwalkers. I pass it by and continue on to the unmanned campsite in Torridon that has the densest population of midges I have yet encountered. Getting the tent up is a challenge. Cooking dinner without getting the life blood sucked out of me is impossible. I opt for a cold dinner and crash.",

Had he not scowled and glowered gloomily, whined at the lack of this, the want of that, the intrusion of some shackling obstacle that kept his genius from its full fruition? Had he not bewailed the absence of some earthly heaven in whose unpolluted ethers his rare soul could wing its way triumphantly to great labors? Was not the sun of this base, stinking earth too hot, the wind too cold, the shifting weathers of the seasons too rude and variable for the tender uses of his sweet, fair hide? Were not the bitter world he lived in and the men he knew given to base gain and sordid purposes? Was it not a barren, sordid, ugly world in which the artist’s spirit withered and went dead, and if he changed his skies—oh! if he could only change his skies!—would he not change his soul, as well? Would he not flower and blossom in the living light of Italy, grow great in Germany, bloom like the rose in gentle France, find roots and richness in old England, and utterly fulfill his purposes if he, too, like an æsthetic exile from Kansas whom he had met in Paris, could only “go to Spain to do a little writing”?",

Every morning, he held mass prayers at home before thousands of prostrate devotees, and the word went around that he could heal the afflicted. When the Hindi cinema released its first 3-D movie, it was Amitabh who came on screen beforehand to still the worries of startled moviegoers and give the project his blessing. Even a respected newspaper asserted, in a peculiarly Indian allusion, somewhat askew but nobly Shakespearean, that “Amitabh continues to stride the scene like a modern Colossus.” Why, even his name, in Sanskrit, meant “Infinite Life”! Much of this reflected nothing more, perhaps, than the power of images on an unsophisticated audience ready to take their gods where they found them (the towering hero was often shot from below in order to increase his stature). But it also seemed to reveal a deeper, more widespread hunger for heroes. I could think of no American star who could command the same kind of worship from old and young, rich and poor, housewife and illiterate villager.",

Five of his six children were born in Alaska. His hair is graying and as long as the times. There is a pipe, a sports jacket, a blue button-down shirt, a knitted tie. I asked him one day how he saw the new city, and he said he deliberately tried to avoid thinking of that in order to play his role as written. Crittenden had done the new Federal Building, the BP Building, the Union Oil Building—some of the high-rising glass of Anchorage. Pressed to describe the new capital as it might appear in his private thought, he finally said, “Well, to tell you the truth, I would reverse all of the things that people come to Alaska to get away from. I would not go along with the I’ll-build-my-cabin-where-I-damned-well-want-to syndrome. I would apply ideas from the Eastern United States—a central core, a central walking mall, a controlled environment. Living structures would be concentrated, and in modules of enclosed space. There would be modules for state and local government, and commercial modules, all concentrated, with plenty of open space around them—plenty of undisturbed, or almost undisturbed, Alaska.” So saying, and in a cloud of pipe smoke, Crittenden departed for Siberia. An honored figure in the field of Arctic construction and Arctic community development, he was going there to participate in the first Soviet-American exchange on human environment in the north.",

On the steps of one locked-up church a half-naked Indian girl sat clutching the yellow-pink peel of a pomegranate, its seeds spilling out around her like confetti. Near another church is an old British cemetery where a farmer squatted on top of a sarcophagus, slowly chewing a mouthful of betel while his cattle grazed among the grass and daisies that grew over the graves. Nationalized mission schools with oversized colonnades and cobblestone archways sit incongruously among wooden houses and bamboo groves. Peeking inside the doorway of one empty classroom I spied an old nursery rhyme written in a neat, methodical hand on the blackboard: ‘Hickory dickory dock,/The mouse ran up the clock . . .’",

About 50 feet away a gray lump surfaced and a spout of water spewed out with a great whoosh, then disappeared followed by a V-shaped flipper tail that made another resounding wet splash. It was a little too close for comfort. I held my breath, expecting the moment when one of the swimming blimps would surface again from right below us and topple Varuna over. Waiting motionless, I listened for the rumbling bell notes of the whales’ songs and sniffed for the ripe air from their blowholes. Recollecting stories of disastrous collisions with the oblivious monsters, I turned on the engine to make our presence known. Totally unconcerned, they continued their migration onward, without so much as a backward glance.",

Then, less melodiously, dissenters of different sects issue a cantankerous emendation.

But nowadays it is the thin voice of duty, piping in a white thread from the top of a funnel, that collects the largest multitudes, and night is nothing but a long-drawn sigh between hammer-strokes, a deep breath—you can hear it from an open window even in the heart of London.",

A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts.\nIn a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.\nHer glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On me alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down.

Let me be and let me live.\n—Kinch ahoy!\nBuck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.\n—Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is apologizing for waking us last night. It’s all right.\n—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.\n—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our sakes.\nHis head disappeared and reappeared.\n—I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it’s very clever. Touch him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.\n—I get paid this morning, Stephen said.\n—The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much?\nFour quid? Lend us one.\n—If you want it, Stephen said.\n—Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent sovereigns.\nHe flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent:\nO, won’t we have a merry time\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine,\nOn coronation,\nCoronation day?\nO, won’t we have a merry time\nOn coronation day?",

Dirt and rust tarnished the lustre of his short beard. His shirt collar and cuffs were crumpled; the blue silken tie hung down his breast like a rag; a greasy smudge crossed his white brow. He had not taken off his clothing nor used water, except to snatch a hasty drink greedily, for some forty hours. An awful restlessness had made him its own, had marked him with all the signs of desperate strife, and put a dry, sleepless stare into his eyes. He murmured to himself in a hoarse voice, “I wonder if there’s any bread here,” looked vaguely about him, then dropped into the chair and took the pencil up again. He became aware he had not eaten anything for many hours.",

Everything he has to say runs through his hands. It’s easy to sense that he has given his life to this craft out of love. Yes, he nods, the gate can be repaired. The question is time. Giuseppe is disappointed. He envisions something grander. He draws shapes in the air with his arms, an arching top with arrows.
