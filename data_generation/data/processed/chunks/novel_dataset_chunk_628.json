Fairbanks is the pivot from which travellers fan out to the north—the usual departure point for Arctic Alaska, and the departure point, as well, for mail planes and bush craft that serve the Interior villages. A look at a map would suggest a site near Fairbanks as an obvious capital for the state as a whole, because of Fairbanks’ position near the center of the Alaskan mainland. There are drawbacks, however, in climate. The Interior is so named because it lies between the Brooks Range, which traverses the far north, and the Alaska Range, which is the climax of the mountain chain that comes up the Pacific coast and then bends across south-central Alaska to indicate the Aleutians. The Interior is the hottest region of Alaska. It is also the coldest. Temperatures there can go into the nineties in summer and into the minus-seventies in winter, and at times of deep cold large areas of the Interior will be palled with ice fog. Fairbanks has more motor vehicles per capita than does Los Angeles, and as the cars toot and tap bumpers on the long crawls through the ice fog the warm gases of their exhaust plumes seem to stick in the air close around them—an especially pernicious, carcinogenic subarctic variety of smog. This experience would suggest—too late to help Fairbanks—that it might be imprudent to plan deliberately to attract numerous vehicles to a single site in the Interior.",

Speaker suggested that I toss a rock into the water jet to see what would happen. I lobbed up a big one. It intersected the jet about a foot from the nozzle, shot through the air like a discharged ballistic shell, and smashed into a pile of tailing boulders several hundred feet away. There was an eternal rainbow under the jet. The air around it swirled with mist and spray. Speaker said he had been operating giants for sixty years—in Oregon before Alaska—and he had once seen a jet of water (out of control) go straight through the body of a distant grazing cow.",

I drove the boys to school, took long shopping trips to the supermarket and stopped glazing my hands with sanitizer every ten minutes. To my former colleagues I bragged a little about the trip?“of course you’ve got to be careful traveling with mules at high altitude”?but the satisfaction was ephemeral. For a few weeks my wandering mind seemed to tune in intermittently to a staticky Andean radio station; at stoplights, random thoughts of devil goats and intihuatanas popped into my head. Whenever I started to wonder if my memory was playing tricks on me, I pulled out two souvenirs I’d brought home as reminders that Peru was simply a different world. One was a ten-sol note, Peru’s equivalent of a five-dollar bill. On the flip side, where the august Lincoln Memorial would be printed on a sawbuck, was a picture of a Peruvian war ace flying his plane. Upside down. The other memento was a postcard of Cusco’s most famous painting, which hangs in a cathedral on the central plaza. In it, Jesus and the twelve disciples are seated at the Last Supper. At the center of the table, paws up, is a roasted guinea pig. Of course, having been raised Catholic, I immediately felt guilty for seeing humor in a painting that others saw as holy. Even if it was pretty funny.",

As my departure had grown imminent, I knew that I had to explain my upcoming disappearance from everyday life. In the final months of preparation, I’d begun telling my friends and family about my goal . . . and eventually strangers on long runs. Inevitably, they were superficially interested?few comprehended the actuality of what I planned to do?so I always answered yes, because I knew that I was supposed to, even though I felt more like I was being forced to walk the plank. On trail I didn’t feel excitement either, only impetus. The few people I had met gave me effusive praise for attempting this seemingly crazy endeavor. I received it with a mix of emotions, drawing courage and strength as well as resentment from their words. People believe I can do this! Maybe they are right! Yet, I feel like a sacrifice to vicariousness. If people were this eager to see someone break this record, then why didn’t someone else do it already? Why me?",

Space there was certainly of every kind: empty sheds, empty barns, empty oast-houses, and, if we had chosen to open one of the rickety windows, an empty house. Space there was in plenty; but an inhabited farm with milk and butter in it would have been more convenient. Besides, there did undoubtedly lie—as Mrs. Menzies-Legh said—a sort of shiver over the place, an ominously complete silence and motionlessness of leaf and bough, and nowhere round could I see either a roof or a chimney, no, not so much as a thread of smoke issuing upwards from between the hills to show me that we were not alone.",

One Holy Thursday, of all days in the almanack, we was here as we mid be now, only there was no churning in hand, when we saw the girl’s mother coming up to the door, with a great brass-mounted umbrella in her hand that would have felled an ox, and saying “Do Jack Dollop work here? – because I want him! I have a big bone to pick with he, I can assure ’n!” And some way behind her mother walked Jack’s young woman, crying bitterly into her handkercher. “O, Lard, here’s a time!” said Jack, looking out o’ winder at ’em. “She’ll murder me! Where shall I get – where shall I—? Don’t tell her where I be!” And with that he scrambled into the churn through the trap-door, and shut himself inside, just as the young woman’s mother busted into the milk-house. “The villain – where is he?” says she, “I’ll claw his face for’n, let me only catch him!” Well, she hunted about everywhere, ballyragging Jack by side and by seam, Jack lying a’most stifled inside the churn, and the poor maid – or young woman rather – standing at the door crying her eyes out. I shall never forget it, never! ’Twould have melted a marble stone! But she couldn’t find him nowhere at all.’",

Finally, she handed the book through the window—though she didn’t release her grip until she’d harangued the student on how properly to care for it. Then she asked if they wanted another volume—which, naturally, was the case. Russians don’t usually buy their textbooks; they borrow them. Every student in that queue needed at least six. So the process repeated itself again and again at an unfathomably slow pace, numbing our minds and trying our souls. It took an hour for the eight students in front of us to collect their books, and an additional twenty stood behind us. One could have distinguished the Americans from the Russians on body language alone: We fidgeted, sighed, grumbled, and bitched; they gazed ahead stoically.",

A tiny breeze gently lifted her hair. Far out in the bay a cluster of almost motionless fishing boats hovered like a flock of white birds on the tranquil sea. How beautiful, how beautiful. Not to have died before this . . . to have been allowed to see, breathe, feel this. . . . She stared, her lips parted. Happy? Poor, ordinary, everyday word. But what could one say, how could one describe it? It was as though she could hardly stay inside herself, it was as though she were too small to hold so much of joy, it was as though she were washed through with light. And how astonishing to feel this sheer bliss, for here she was, not doing and not going to do a single unselfish thing, not going to do a thing she didn't want to do. According to everybody she had ever come across she ought at least to have twinges. She had not one twinge. Something was wrong somewhere. Wonderful that at home she should have been so good, so terribly good, and merely felt tormented. Twinges of every sort had there been her portion; aches, hurts, discouragements, and she the whole time being steadily unselfish. Now she had taken off all her goodness and left it behind her like a heap in rain-sodden clothes, and she only felt joy. She was naked of goodness, and was rejoicing in being naked. She was stripped, and exulting. And there, away in the dim mugginess of Hampstead, was Mellersh being angry.",

Technically, he could have tried to back over me, but he might have risked hitting the truck behind him. Anyway, I didn’t think he’d make the attempt. He proved me right. Instead, he stepped hard on the accelerator, going forward much faster than is customary in a fuel lane. His final remark whirled through the air above the roar of his engine. “Fucking cunt!”",

An elderly man in a dhoti and Nehru topi stood behind me, applying steady pressure to my back with the tip of his index finger, as though this would make the queue move faster. Ten days ago I would have turned around and fumed. But now this man was only as annoying as I allowed him to be. In a few moments we would reach the front of the queue. Was it worth spending the next five or six minutes pulling my forehead into a scowl and tutting at a man who was completely indifferent to the effects of his poking? Not really. Instead I turned around, looked at him and started to laugh. He smiled back at me with a set of teeth like broken tombstones and muttered in Telugu about the wait. At the same time, he removed the finger to pick his nose. Everything is, indeed, impermanent.",
