She was laughing… Here she looked up and caught his eye. She had been talking aloud to herself in an omnibus. She must cure herself of the habit. She must wait till she brushed her teeth. But luckily the bus was stopping. She jumped out. She began to walk quickly up Melrose Place. She felt vigorous and young. She noticed everything freshly after Devonshire. She looked down the long many-pillared vista of Abercorn Terrace. The houses, with their pillars and their front gardens, all looked highly respectable; in every front room she seemed to see a parlourmaid’s arm sweep over the table, laying it for luncheon. In several rooms they were already sitting down to luncheon; she could see them between the tent-shaped opening made by the curtains. She would be late for her own luncheon, she thought as she ran up the front steps and fitted her latch-key in the door. Then, as if someone were speaking, words formed in her mind. ‘Something pretty, something to wear.’ She stopped with her key in the lock. Maggie’s birthday; her father’s present; she had forgotten it. She paused. She turned, she ran down the steps again. She must go to Lamley’s.",

Unfortunately, this was also the likeliest route to fly into Saudi Arabia from India and Pakistan. It quickly became obvious from Javed's demeanour that our seats on the flight had been sold to someone else, most likely a group of rich Hajji's paying a grossly inflated price. The news that we couldn't fly home and would have to return to the hotel was greeted with shrugs by most of the group. i.e. the majority who were retired and were in no rush to get back. But for myself, Karen, and two middle aged teachers from Derby, who all needed to be back at work on Monday, this spelled potential disaster.",

    "target_paragraph": "“Are you dressed, Hendy?”\nMiriam, who had sat up in her bath when the drumming came at the door, answered sleepily, “No, I shan’t be a minute.”\n“Don’t you want to see the diving?”\nAll Jimmie’s fingers seemed to be playing exercises against the panels. Miriam wished she would restrain them and leave her alone. She did not in the least wish to see the diving.\n“I shan’t be a minute,” she shouted crossly, and let her shoulders sink once more under the comforting water. It was the first warm water she had encountered since that night when Mademoiselle had carried the jugs upstairs. Her soap, so characterless in the chilly morning basin lathered freely in the warmth and was fragrant in the steamy air. When Jimmie’s knocking came she was dreaming blissfully of baths with Harriett—the dissipated baths of the last six months between tea and dinner with a theatre or a dance ahead. Harriett, her hair strained tightly into a white crocheted net, her snub face shining through the thick steam, tubbing and jesting at the wide end of the huge porcelain bath, herself at the narrow end commanding the taps under the steam-dimmed beams of the red-globed gasjets ... sponge-fights ... and those wonderful summer bathings when they had come in from long tennis-playing in the sun, filled the bath with cold water and sat in the silence of broad daylight immersed to the neck, confronting each other.\nSeeing no sign of anything she could recognise as a towel, she pulled at a huge drapery hanging like a counterpane in front of a coil of pipes extending half-way to the ceiling. The pipes were too hot to touch and the heavy drapery was more than warm and obviously meant for drying purposes. Sitting wrapped in its folds, dizzy and oppressed, she longed for the flourish of a rough towel and a window open at the top. She could see no ventilation of any kind in her white cell. By the time her heavy outdoor things were on she was faint with exhaustion, and hurried down the corridor towards the shouts and splashings echoing in the great, open, glass-roofed swimming-bath. She was just in time to see a figure in scarlet and white, standing out on the high gallery at the end of a projecting board which broke the little white balustrade, throw up its arms and leap out and flash—its joined hands pointed downwards towards the water, its white feet sweeping up like the tail of a swooping bird—cleave the green water and disappear. The huge bath was empty of bathers and smoothly rippling save where the flying body had cleaved it and left wavelets and bubbles. The girls—most of them in their outdoor things—were gathered in a little group near the marble steps leading down into the water farthest from where the diver had dropped, stirring and exclaiming. As Miriam was approaching them a red-capped head came cleanly up out of the water near the steps and she recognised the strong jaw and gleaming teeth of Gertrude. She neither spluttered nor shook her head. Her eyes were wide and smiling, and her raucous laugh rang out above the applause of the group of girls.\nMiriam paused under the overhanging gallery. Her eyes went, incredulously, up to the springboard. It seemed impossible ... and all that distance above the water.... Her gaze was drawn to the flicking of the curtain of one of the little compartments lining the gallery.",

The Mayor’s telephone was out of order; he lived in some state on his property beyond the town and it was hot. Neither the Second or Third Gendarme nor the porter felt like walking there. Gallic good sense and chivalry triumphed. The Chief Gendarme said, “You had better spend the night here. You can visit the Mayor in the morning. We welcome you with open arms and open hearts. There is no reason why we should not.” No reason except the tiresome directives from the Governor of Martinique, a long way off.",

On the Indian side of the gates an army of mothers with children danced on the road to ‘Jai Ho’, waving arms and blow-dried curls, while packs of men wearing flags as capes pounded fists, their cheeks puffed out by whistles. Western tourists sat along the front rows, knees together, clapping along. On the other side of the gates the Pakistani crowd appeared to be partaking in a memorial service. Not a face flinched. Green flags wilted like dead leaves. As a furious chorus of ‘Hindustan Zindabad!’ came to an end, the revellers collapsed in their seats and the Pakistani crowd erupted. It was their turn.",

Downstairs is the all-purpose living room and there are three smaller huts in the compound – one a kitchen, the others the homes of married sons. The headman and his wife and sister-in-law are splendid old people – gracious and warm-hearted – and on meeting them I was glad that we had been forced to stop here. Faranjs are obviously a rarity in their lives but these elders have an air of dignified assurance, though the younger people (except for the Adua-educated Ayela) are timid enough. Highland society has always been organised on strictly hierarchical lines and each headman wields considerable power within his own little realm.",

I had kept mine long, thinking it could be tamed into a ponytail, but it was refusing to do so. The humid air and the absence of Velcro rollers, a hair dryer, two brushes, and half a dozen hair products had caused my hair to explode into a cascade of plump, loose curls that made it look as if it were on holiday itself.

What Holmes realized in the course of his own pursuits was that the footstepping biographer never actually reached his subject; only encountered at best the second-order suggestions of their earlier presence: glimpses of afterglow, retinal ghosts, psychic gossamer. ‘You would never catch them,’ cautioned Holmes, ‘no, you would never quite catch them…’ I had set out to come to know Thomas by walking where he had walked, but he had mostly eluded me, remaining a Lob-like figure glimpsed now and then at a bend on the path or through a hole in the hedge, still enigmatic. And yet I had learnt so much from the people I’d met along my journeys: people for whom, as for Thomas, landscape was intricately involved with self-perception, and for whom certain places or weathers brought yields of grace. Ian sailing his sea roads, Miguel wandering his forest paths, Steve Dilworth striding from boulder to boulder, Anne Campbell and Finlay out on the moors, Nan Shepherd walking up and into the mountain, Raja roaming the Israel–Palestine anticline, keeping the paths open. This, I thought, had been the real discovery: not a ghostly retrieval of Thomas, but an understanding of how for him, as for so many other people, 32the mind was a landscape of a kind and walking a means of crossing it.",

The nearer we came to that adventure, the more formidable did it appear, and I was beginning to realize that it would be folly to take a caravan across the parched and stony waste, and to revolve plans for sending the muleteers to Kerbela and taking only Fattu? with me to Khei?ir. At ?adithah we met an aged corporal, who declared that nothing would be easier than to go straight thence to ?a?r ’Amej, and for water we should find every night a pool of winter rain. He had crossed the desert two years ago and there had been no lack of water.",

Looking at photos in the den of his Salt Lake City home, he described to us the majestic black spires of Torres del Paine and FitzRoy, the pure sparkling rivers spilling from immense glaciers, the coastline teaming with penguins and seals, magical names like Straits of Magellan and Beagle Channel, and gauchos in black berets galloping horseback through the waving grasslands of the pampas. He loved the clarity of the air, the broad, sweeping views. Above all, he was enchanted with the start of what was projected to be a magnificent wild road called the Carretera Austral, which for the first time would permit access by car to Chile’s isolated southern coastline. I’d been longing to go there ever since.",

They are booked out, but as I am early the hostess kindly offers that I can eat as long as I promise to vacate my table by 7pm. It is 5:30pm. I can manage that. One of the Starfish’s specialities is fish pie. This is either going to be like the oatmeal at Carrick Lodge, an unexpected treat, or bland, boring potatoes and fish. Nothing ventured. I order smoked salmon as a starter (with a wonderful wine) and the fish pie. The smoked salmon comes with both cold and hot smoked salmon, a combination I have never had. It is fabulous. The fish pie, full of all kinds of seafood, is beyond description. It is far and away the best meal I have had on this trip.",

Housemaids were passing briskly from room to room, but Mrs Thornbury avoided them; she hardly saw them; they seemed to her to be in another world. She did not even look up directly when Evelyn stopped her. It was evident that Evelyn had been lately in tears, and when she looked at Mrs Thornbury she began to cry again. Together they drew into the hollow of a window, and stood there in silence. Broken words formed themselves at last among Evelyn’s sobs. ‘It was wicked,’ she sobbed, ‘it was cruel—they were so happy.’",

There was a large white china washbasin that looked Victorian, and probably was. There was a white china elephant’s feet squat toilet. There was an actual showerhead, which I eyed with excitement: I had become used to washing in a bucket of water. However, there were limits to my new luxury. When I put my hand under the showerhead in delighted expectation, there was no hot water in the shower; in fact there was no running water in the bathroom at all. Nor was there electricity.",

Chunks of debris were being picked up by the gusts and flung downwind at unnerving speeds. A slab of galvanized metal roofing rocketed past a few feet in front of me. I had an image of it slicing through my neck like a machete. We all scurried back to the school in a crouch, pushed through the heavy wooden doors and barred them behind us.",

And he said how Mr Snopes was there too, in a rented dress suit, and Jefferson probably thought at first that that rented dress suit was just the second footprint made on it, until they had time to realise that it wasn’t anymore just a footprint than that water tank was a monument: it was a red flag. No: it was that sign at the railroad crossing that says Look Out For The Locomotive.",

He gave up the backyard where he had raised chickens and pigs to build a kitchen and bathroom for them. When the girls started calling him abuelo and didn’t shy away from his scars, he had no regrets about losing his yard. Then one day Lili received a call from her own father’s caregiver in Santiago telling her that the “Gallego,” which was how everyone knew her father, had trouble remembering anything, even when to eat. He was losing weight and spent much of the day, and night, wandering. Looking after him and keeping him safe had become more than the caregiver could handle. You need to move him, she told Lili, and Lili convinced Carlos that she couldn’t leave her father alone.",

    "target_paragraph": "Passing languidly up through the house after breakfast, unable to decide to spend her Saturday morning as usual at a piano in one of the bedrooms, Miriam went, wondering in response to a quiet call from Fräulein Pfaff into the large room shared by the Bergmanns and Ulrica Hesse. Explaining that Clara was now to take possession of the half of Elsa Speier’s room that had been left empty by Minna—“poor Minna now with her good parents seeking health in the Swiss mountains, schooldays at an end, at an end, at an end,” she repeated mournfully. Fräulein indicated that Clara’s third of the large room would now be Miriam’s.\nMiriam stood incredulous at her side as she indicated a large empty chest of drawers, a white covered bed in a deep corner away from the window, a small drawer in the dressing-table and five pegs in a large French wardrobe. Emma was going very gravely about the room collecting her work-basket and things for raccommodage. She flung one ecstatic glance at Miriam as she went away with these.\n“I shall hold you responsible here amongst these dear children, Miss Henderson,” fluted Fräulein, quietly gathering up a few last things of Minna’s collected on the bed, “our dear Ulrica and our little Emma,” she smiled, passing out, leaving Miriam standing in the wonderful room.\n“My goodney,” she breathed, gathering gently clenched fists close to her person. She stood for a few moments; she felt like a visitor ... embroidered toilet covers, polished furniture, gold and cream crockery, lace curtains, white beds, the large screen cutting off her third of the room ... then she rushed headlong upstairs, a member of the downstairs landing, to collect her belongings.\nOn the landing just outside the door of the garret bedroom stood a huge wicker travelling basket; a clumsy umbrella with a large knobby handle, like a man’s umbrella, lay on the top of it partly covering a large pair of goloshes.\nShe was tired and very warm by the time everything was arranged in her new quarters.\nTaking a last look round she caught the eye of Eve’s photograph gazing steadily at her from the chest of drawers.... It would be quite easy now that this had happened to write and tell them that the Pomerania plan had come to nothing.\nEvidently Fräulein approved of her, after all.",
