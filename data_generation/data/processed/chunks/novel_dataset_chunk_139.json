He showed me a sheaf of restaurant bills he had been adding up. He shook them and then threw them into the air: “Whee!” We sat down again, and Vassily, too drunk to remember that I couldn’t speak Russian, harangued me for fifteen minutes. I suppose he was saying, “Look at me. Fifty-five years old and I’m running this crummy dining car. Urp. Back and forth, every two weeks, from Moscow to Vladivostok, sleeping in Hard Class, too busy to take a piss, everyone giving me lip. Urp. You call that a life?” Towards the end of his harangue his head grew heavy, his eyelids drooped, and his speech became thick. He put his head down on the table, and, still holding tight to the bottle, he went to sleep.\n“Merry Christmas.”\nI finished my drink and went back to my compartment through the bouncing train.\nThe next morning, Christmas, I woke and looked over at the zombie sleeping with his arms folded on his chest like a mummy’s. The provodnik told me it was six o’clock Moscow time. My watch said eight. I put it back two hours and waited for dawn, surprised that so many people in the car had decided to do the same thing. In darkness we stood at the windows, watching our reflections. Shortly afterwards I saw why they were there. We entered the outskirts of Yaroslavl and I heard the others whispering to themselves. The old lady in the fully nightgown, the Goldi man and his wife and child, the domino-playing drunks, even the zombie who had been monkeying with my radio: they pressed their faces against the windows as we began rattling across a long bridge. Beneath us, half-frozen, very black, and in places reflecting the flames of Yaroslavl’s chimneys, was the Volga.",

    "target_paragraph": "NOT FAR FROM MANDALAY, about an hour’s winding drive up a steep mountain road, is Maymyo, the former hill station where the British went to escape the heat and dust of the city. George Orwell visited Maymyo at least twice while he was posted in Mandalay. For homesick colonial officials, Maymyo was the closest thing to Britain you could find in the sweltering townships of Burma. Most British memoirs of Burma spare a nostalgic paragraph or two for it, describing a paradise of flower gardens, woodland walks and picnic grounds. Orwell didn’t mention Maymyo in his novel Burmese Days, but the town makes a surprise cameo appearance in his book on the Spanish Civil War, Homage to Catalonia, where he remembers his arrival in Maymyo by train: \t\t\t \t\t\t\tIt is a rather queer experience. You start off in the typical atmosphere of an eastern city—the scorching sunlight, the dusty palms, the smells of fish and spices and garlic, the squashy tropical fruits, the swarming dark-faced human beings—and because you are so used to it you carry this atmosphere intact, so to speak, in your railway carriage. Mentally you are still in Mandalay when the train stops at Maymyo, four thousand feet above sea-level. But in stepping out of the carriage you step into a different hemisphere. Suddenly you are breathing cool sweet air that might be that of England, and all round you are green grass, bracken, fir-trees, and hill-women with pink cheeks selling baskets of strawberries.",

On a dusty common, encircled by soaring blue gums, a few score cows and calves – long-horned, glossy though thin, as beautiful to look on as their owners – were being denigrated by Nairobi traders whose trucks waited nearby. The Masai listened in haughty silence. ‘They won’t bargain,’ said the elderly Kikuyu by my side, who had also stopped to watch. ‘When they don’t get their price they are happy. They want not to sell, they only try because of the drought. They love their cattle more than their families. They are primitive people with no education.’",

As soon as they are in the air I think, Fool! You should have washed them off and then tried them. Next time. But such a waste of five fish. I mop up the spilled stomach juices and finish cleaning the dorado. Sweat pours off of my head as I squat over my catch and labor in the heat to slice up the body. I stop twice to stretch out my legs and to relieve my cramped knees and back. The work is hard, but I move fast so that I can rest sooner.

There’s no town, no hotel, no one else on the island besides the few other backpackers who came on our same boat. We walk a few steps from our simple hut directly into the coral reef for amazing snorkeling, surrounded by every color of fish you can imagine. We use our inflatable kayak daily, go scuba diving, climb palm trees, swim and fish.\n\nIt’s paradise, but definitely Robinson Crusoe style.",

Her right hand skimmed slightly the end of the table, and when she had passed on towards the sofa the carving knife had vanished without the slightest sound from the side of the dish. Mr Verloc heard the creaky plank in the floor, and was content. He waited. Mrs Verloc was coming. As if the homeless soul of Stevie had flown for shelter straight to the breast of his sister, guardian and protector, the resemblance of her face with that of her brother grew at every step, even to the droop of the lower lip, even to the slight divergence of the eyes. But Mr Verloc did not see that. He was lying on his back and staring upwards. He saw partly on the ceiling and partly on the wall the moving shadow of an arm with a clenched hand holding a carving knife. It flickered up and down. Its movements were leisurely. They were leisurely enough for Mr Verloc to recognise the limb and the weapon.",

The Cuarto Congreso docked in Regla just six minutes after it had pulled away from Old Havana. They waited for most of the other passengers to leave before Pipo helped Cary to the concrete landing. They hurried through the turnstiles and past the immaculate white church of the black Virgin of Regla, hoping to get to the corner before the next bus left for Guanabacoa. Behind them, an attendant on the dock gassed up the Cuarto Congreso. It didn’t take long; it never does.

I walked upon my shadow, tramping it into the dappled shade of trees again. The road curved, mounting away from the water. It crossed the hill, then descended winding, carrying the eye, the mind on ahead beneath a still green tunnel, and the square cupola above the trees and the round eye of the clock but far enough. I sat down at the roadside. The grass was ankle deep, myriad. The shadows on the road were as still as if they had been put there with a stencil, with slanting pencils of sunlight. But it was only a train, and after a while it died away beyond the trees, the long sound, and then I could hear my watch and the train dying away, as though it were running through another month or another summer somewhere, rushing away under the poised gull and all things rushing. Except Gerald. He would be sort of grand too, pulling in lonely state across the noon, rowing himself right out of noon, up the long bright air like an apotheosis, mounting into a drowsing infinity where only he and the gull, the one terrifically motionless, the other in a steady and measured pull and recover that partook of inertia itself, the world punily beneath their shadows on the sun.

At that moment, by a kind of miracle, an ice cream van came trundling over the hill playing a twinkly tune such as English ice cream vans always play (to attract the notice of children) and set up at the edge of the parking lot. I waited an impatient ten minutes while the young man in sole charge unhurriedly opened up various hatches and set out things. The instant the window slid open I asked him what he had to drink. He rooted around and announced that he had six small plastic bottles of Panda Cola. I bought them all and retired to the shady side of the van, where I feverishly removed the plastic lid from one and poured its life-saving contents down my gullet.",

The initial fence was dilapidated and desperately in need of repair. It has since been upgraded. The initial fence was supposedly electrified, but Sabie Park personnel confirmed that the electricity worked sporadically at best. No matter. For years the elephants recognized the importance of having a barrier to separate us. They never challenged the fence. In fact, the elephants walked beside the fence so frequently that they created a path on the Kruger side of the fence. The fence, therefore, straddles two paths. The path on the Sabie Park side of the fence is for humans to follow; the path on the Kruger side of the fence is for elephants and other animals to use. We should also add that we have never seen an elephant make a misstep and accidentally bump into the fence. Despite their size, elephants are sure-footed.",

The thronging streets, the jammed congestion of the traffic, the intolerable glare, the insane kaleidoscope of Broadway burned there in his inflamed and maddened vision, not in a blur, not in a drunken maze, but with a kind of distorted and insane precision, a grotesque projection of what it really was. His baffled and infuriated spirit turned against it—against everyone, everything—against her. For suddenly he realized that she was taking him home to his hotel. The knowledge infuriated him, he felt that she was deserting him, betraying him. He shouted to the driver to stop, she caught hold of his arm and tried to keep him in the car, he wrenched free, shouted at her that she had gone back on him, sold him out, betrayed him—that he wanted to see her no more, that she was no good—and even while she pled with him, tried to persuade him to get back into the car with her, he told her to be gone, slammed the door in her face, and lunged away into the crowd.",

Flush’s life was also changed. His outdoor education was supplemented by that of the bedroom, and this, to a dog of Flush’s temperament, was the most drastic that could have been invented. His only airings, and these were brief and perfunctory, were taken in the company of Wilson, Miss Barrett’s maid. For the rest of the day he kept his station on the sofa at Miss Barrett’s feet. All his natural instincts were thwarted and contradicted. When the autumn winds had blown last year in Berkshire he had run in wild scampering across the stubble; now at the sound of the ivy tapping on the pane Miss Barrett asked Wilson to see to the fastenings of the window. When the leaves of the scarlet runners and nasturtiums in the window-box yellowed and fell she drew her Indian shawl more closely round her. When the October rain lashed the window Wilson lit the fire and heaped up the coals. Autumn deepened into winter and the first fogs jaundiced the air. Wilson and Flush could scarcely grope their way to the pillar-box or to the chemist. When they came back, nothing could be seen in the room but the pale busts glimmering wanly on the tops of the wardrobes; the peasants and the castle had vanished on the blind; blank yellow filled the pane. Flush felt that he and Miss Barrett lived alone together in a cushioned and firelit cave. The traffic droned on perpetually outside with muffled reverberations; now and again a voice went calling hoarsely, ‘Old chairs and baskets to mend’, down the street: sometimes there was a jangle of organ music, coming nearer and louder; going further and fading away. But none of these sounds meant freedom, or action, or exercise. The wind and the rain, the wild days of autumn and the cold days of mid-winter, all alike meant nothing to Flush except warmth and stillness; the lighting of lamps, the drawing of curtains and the poking of the fire.",

The last time I went along, in 1988, at least 3, 000 people followed Barong, and the procession stretched out for well over a kilometer along the road, several people abreast. Many of the pemangkus, the offering specialists, and most of the offerings are hauled to Pecatu on the Bukit by truck. But most of the people walk the 16 kilometers to Pura Luhur Uluwatu and back, stopping both going and returning at Pura Pererepan Pecatu, some 10 kilometers from Jimbaran. The procession begins at Pura Ulun Siwi about 7 A. m. The pace set is a very brisk walk, and some of the older people have difficulty keeping up. The three Rangda masks are carried on the heads of members of the sekan barong. Barong walks too, as do members of Barong's gong, carrying and playing their \"marching music\" with drums, cymbals, and gong only. As a member of the sekan barong, I carry the umbrella shading Rangda's mask. It gets very heavy after three hours, and three of us trade off the task along the way. The heavier instruments go to Pecatu by truck.",

He stands in his khaki shorts and safari hat, clipboard in hand, beaming. “Are you ready, Miss Morris? Have you had your tea?” I nod, unable to hide my dismay. Though I spent only a few days with them, I miss Ajay and Sudhir. I want Ajay to be listening to the wings of birds and Sudhir trying to get a python back into a gunnysack. I miss having the best guide in India even if Vibhav is a very nice and, I’m sure, competent man.\nI’m as ready as I suppose I’ll ever be.\n“Then let’s go.” After more than a week of searching for tigers, I have seen none. Yet Vibhav seems endlessly optimistic. Though I can’t blame the messenger, I recall that troubled flicker that went across Catherine’s face when I saw her back in Delhi. It is just too cold for tigers to be on the prowl. “So how did you sleep?” Vibhav asks as we make our way through the chilly morning air to the jeep. “Are you feeling better?” I nod again though I’m not feeling any better at all. “I think we will go in a different direction today. Tigers are very smart. They know the way the jeeps tend to go and so they head into another part of the jungle. We will try and outsmart them.”\nHow can I tell him that all I want to do is stay under the covers? With a scarf around my neck and hot-water bottle in hand, I can barely talk for fear I’ll start hacking. I think of the method of the servants of the maharaja who sewed white sheets together to flush the tiger out. Perhaps we should try this instead. But Vibhav, who knows I am sick, assures me. We will stay out for only a few hours. “I’ll have you back by noon.”\nAs we drive along, he points out things I have already seen. He tells me what I already know. Only once does he raise his hand as if he hears something. Then just before noon we turn around. He tells me sadly that today there aren’t even alarm calls. “It’s as if the jungle,” he says, “is asleep.”",
