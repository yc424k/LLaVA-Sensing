They figured they were too early, since most of the nests were empty, and hoped for better luck in the weeks ahead. McKinlay’s hind end and back ached so badly from the fall that he could not hunt the next day. While McKinlay recovered in camp, Hadley had another idea. They would build a bosun’s chair out of a flat piece of drift lumber and some cordage, and using this, they could lower McKinlay from a cliff top down to get eggs. McKinlay agreed to try it once he got over the soreness and fright from the recent fall and regained some strength: “Unfortunately the kind of diet we were getting made me in no condition for such mountaineering exploits,” he had to admit.",

But I could not banish the thought that their touching faith would never move the golden gods. If no help came from outside, Tibet would soon be roughly awakened from its peaceful slumbers.",

Perhaps it was the time of day, the weather, the sense of relief at being out of Naples, but it seemed perfect: a compact town tumbling down from the station to the Bay of Naples. At its heart was a small, busy square called the Piazza Tasso, lined with outdoor cafes. Leading off the square at one end was a network of echoing alleyways, cool and shadowy and richly aromatic, full of shopkeepers gossiping in doorways and children playing and the general tumult of Italian life. For the rest, the town appeared to consist of a dozen or so wandering streets lined with agreeable shops and restaurants and small, pleasant, old-fashioned hotels hidden away behind heavy foliage. It was lovely, perfect. I wanted to live here, starting now.",

I pretended not to notice him until he climbed on to my verandah, and then I didn’t offer him a chair. I waited until my carriers were close and then I cursed him.

Roughly rectangular in shape, about four football fields long by two across, the Col’s eastern margin drops 7,000 feet down the Kangshung Face into Tibet; the other side plunges 4,000 feet to the Western Cwm. Just back from the lip of this chasm, at the Col’s westernmost edge, the tents of Camp Four squatted on a patch of barren ground surrounded by more than a thousand discarded oxygen canisters.* If there is a more desolate, inhospitable habitation anywhere on the planet, I hope never to see it.",

Its mother, a gaunt wisp-haired mountaineer, turned the back of the seat ahead, and bedded the child on a spread newspaper. Its wizened face peeked dirtily out of its swaddling discomfort of soiled jackets and pink ribbon. It wailed and slept. At the front of the car, a young hillman, high-boned and red, clad in corduroys and leather leggings, shelled peanuts steadily, throwing the shells into the aisle. People trod through them with a sharp masty crackle. The boys, bored, paraded restlessly to the car-end for water. There was a crushed litter of sanitary drinking-cups upon the floor, and a stale odour from the toilets.",

For several minutes more he stood there, shifting uneasily on his feet and watching all the upper windows as for a sign. Then, suddenly, his jaw muscles tightened, he stuck out his under lip in desperate resolve, and he bolted across the pavement, hurled himself against the door, and disappeared inside.",

Sitting half-naked for hours on the wet earth of his prison, and so motionless that the spiders, his companions, attached their webs to his matted hair, he consoled the misery of his soul with acute reasonings that he had confessed to crimes enough for a sentence of death—that they had gone too far with him to let him live to tell the tale.",

Mamen found it hilarious: “The doctor is in his second childhood.… Every time he fell, he got his pantaloons full of snow!” Indeed, the cold soon drove him back to the ship for hot tea and warmer clothing. Mamen was impressed by everyone’s progress, noting that Bartlett, Dr. Mackay, Wilkins, and Malloch were all coordinated and physically fit. To test them, he organized a cross-country ski competition, “the Karluk Championship Distance Race,” and recorded the results in his diary: No. 1 Wilkins 14:46; Dr. Mackay 16:12; McConnell 17:56; Malloch 18:16.",

The young thorn leaves smelt of almonds and of their own bitter green.\nThe five trees stood up, thin and black, in an archway of golden white fire. The green of their young leaves hung about them like an emanation.\nA skylark swung himself up, a small grey ball, spinning over the tree tops to the arch of the sunset. His song pierced and shook, like the golden white light. With each throb of his wings he shrank, smaller and greyer, a moth, a midge, whirling in the luminous air. A grey ball dropped spinning down.\nBy the gate of the field her sudden, secret happiness came to her.\nShe could never tell when it was coming, nor what it would come from. It had something to do with the trees standing up in the golden white light. It had come before with a certain sharp white light flooding the fields, flooding the room.\nIt had happened so often that she received it now with a shock of recognition; and when it was over she wanted it to happen again. She would go back and back to the places where it had come, looking for it, thinking that any minute it might happen again. But it never came twice to the same place in the same way.\nCatty was calling to her from the bottom of the lane. She stood still by the gate, not heeding Catty, holding her happiness. When she had turned from the quiet fields it would be gone.",

After all, the poor devil had to make a living. He liked being generous: he liked to leave people smiling; and two shillings meant nothing to him. But what’s the use, he thought, now it’s done?

Alas, I took an almost total leave of absence from laughter for seven days. This hotel, Moscow four star, has three cathedral spires with a red star in lights on the highest spire. The front is covered with an acne of stone ornamentation. It is a skyscraper, twenty-nine floors high, one thousand rooms, but there are only four lifts, two to each side in the entrance lobby, and of these only one was working, hand operated and always by a blonde whose posture and face were the very picture of hate-filled bitterness. You queued to get to your room. People fought like tigers for a place in the lift. Then were stuck together in the stifling heat of the airless box, as it slowly rose.

He would lather his face for shaving, shave one side of it, and then begin to walk up and down the room again, singing, making strange noises in his throat, staring vacantly out of the window at a cat that crept along the ridges of the fence; he would pull books from the shelves, reading a line or page, sometimes reading her a passage from a poem as she cooked, and then forgetting the book, letting it fall upon the cot or on the floor, until the floor was covered with them. Then he would sit on the edge of the cot for minutes, staring stupidly and vacantly ahead, holding one sock in his hand. Then he would spring up again and begin to pace the room, shouting and singing, with a convulsion of energy surging through his body that could find no utterance and that ended only in a wild, goatlike cry of joy.",

Then I noticed one ancient Ford saloon about to drive off with only an elderly couple in front and desperately I begged for a lift to the junction. The burly fair-skinned husband had African features and crinkly brown hair. ‘Where is your car?’ he demanded. ‘How did you get here? Why are you with those people? You must ask my wife for permission.’ His wife was a small sour shrivelled woman who looked Indian and offered all sorts of excuses for not taking us. In disgust I walked away. But then a young Muslim man – we had talked earlier – intervened and after an overheated argument in Afrikaans we were taken aboard. Mr Burly asked how much we had paid the taxi and said, ‘You can come as far as Belleville for twice that price.’",

All heavenly visions were chased away for the night…\nOur hero, half crazed with fear, disgust and irritation, lay wide awake, his nostrils on the watch for the smell of burning chintz or muslin, and wondered how an educated man – for Ribot was a law-student – could ever make such a filthy beast of himself as that! It was a scandal – a disgrace; it was not to be borne; there should be no forgiveness for such as Ribot – not even on Christmas Day! He would complain to Madame Paul, the patronne; he would have Ribot turned out into the street; he would leave the hotel himself the very next morning! At last he fell asleep, thinking of all he would do; and thus, ridiculously and ignominiously for Little Billee, ended the réveillon.\nNext morning he complained to Madame Paul; and though he did not give her warning, nor even insist on the expulsion of Ribot (who, as he heard with a hard heart, was bien malade ce matin), he expressed himself very severely on the conduct of that gentleman, and on the dangers from fire that might arise from a tipsy man being trusted alone in a small bedroom with chintz curtains and a lighted candle. If it hadn’t been for himself, he told her, Ribot would have slept on the doorstep, and serve him right! He was really grand in his virtuous indignation, in spite of his imperfect French; and Madame Paul was deeply contrite for her peccant lodger, and profuse in her apologies; and Little Billee began his twenty-first Christmas Day like a Pharisee, thanking his star that he was not as Ribot!",

But I don’t want to keep the boat. After you left, I couldn’t eat. That’s why I’m so skinny. Just outside of Tonga, after I dropped you off at the dock with your suitcase, I saw a mother and her calf in the water. It gutted me that you weren’t there.

This warm-up adventure completed, we would fly on to Darwin in the Northern Territory—the Top End, as it is fondly known to Australians—for the thousand-mile drive through the scorched red center to Alice Springs and mighty Uluru. Having assisted me through the worst of the perils, the heroic Mr. Sherwin would fly back to England from Alice, and leave me to continue on through the western deserts on my own. It wasn’t that he thought I would be ready for this by then—for he had no confidence whatever in my survival capabilities—but that ten days was all he had to spare. For my part, I had no greater confidence in him, but I was glad of the company.",

As presidents go, Calvin Coolidge was not a magnificent specimen. He was slight of build and terse of manner. His face was pinched and inclined to scowl; he looked, in the well-chosen words of Alice Roosevelt Longworth, as if he had been “weaned on a pickle.” Whereas Warren G. Harding had charm but no brains, Coolidge had brains but little charm. He was the least affable, gregarious, metaphorically embraceable president of modern times. Yet America came to adore him. Though he would spend the 1920s doing as little as possible?that was essentially his declared policy as president?he set the mood in the nation in a way few other presidents have. If the 1920s was the age of anyone, it was the Age of Coolidge.",

It was also home to Leopold, the café made famous by the book Shantaram. During the day it buzzed with activity: cycle rickshaws kerb-crawled behind tourists buying feathered earrings and browsing bookstalls, art lovers roamed from one gallery to the next and packed dhabas drew chaat lovers from the pavement. At night a different group came out to play. Taxi drivers milled between airport trips, chowkidars dozed on stools and fathers gambled in circles over bottles of dirty spirits, their families asleep on charpoys and mats. Luckily for Ed, we had already scouted out Olympia Coffee House’s keema pav and a pair of Indian restaurants near the hotel, called Sher-e-Punjab. They appeared to be run by the same management and were across the road from one another. Both restaurants did excellent keema and parathas. One served alcohol, one did not. The first was popular, the second was not. Above all, they showed the IPL cricket and were jammed full of Indians throughout the day, which was always a good sign.",

The Thunderbird’s outsized bonnet swung over the hogsback of the ridge, and we were off: down we twisted, through a series of S-bends, under the ruins, past the posters: Salvatore Ferragamo Pour Hiver 94; an Ottoman villa pockmarked with small-arms fire; Valentino: En Exclusivité; a Bible-black hearse parked outside a church; Martini: Right Here, Right Now; two decapitated palm trees; Calvin by Calvin Klein; a dead tank; Cool Budweiser – On Tap; a bombed-out hospital; Lucky Strike; a cluster of skyscrapers so pockmarked with shrapnel they looked like a mouthful of severely rotten teeth; Versatile by Versace …",

You pay a load of money at a ticket window and step into a bare, dim hall and there it is, this most famous of frescoes, covering the whole of the far wall. A railing keeps you from approaching any closer than about twenty-five feet, which seems unfair since it is so faint that you could barely see it from five feet and must strain to the utmost to see anything at all from twenty-five feet. It’s like a ghost image. If you hadn’t seen it reproduced a thousand times before, you probably wouldn’t be able to recognize it at all. One end was covered with scaffolding and a great deal of gleaming Dr Who-like restoration equipment. A lone technician was on a platform scratching away. They have been working on the ‘Last Supper’ for years, but I couldn’t see any sign that the thing was actually coming to life.",

She’s probably still bleeding. Come along.” They went on. He entered the house first; even at the moment he realised that he had preceded the other not as a guest, not even as owner, but because he believed now that he alone of the two of them had any right to enter it at all so long as the woman was in it. They were out of the wind now. It merely leaned, black, imponderable and firm, against the door which the man called Harry had closed behind them: and now and at once the doctor smelled again the odor of stale and cooling gumbo. He even knew where it would be, he could almost see it sitting uneaten (They have not even tasted it he thought. But why should they? Why in God’s name should they?) on the cold stove since he knew the kitchen well—the broken stove, the spare cooking vessels, the meagre collection of broken knives and forks and spoons, the drinking receptacles which had once contained gaudily labelled and machine-made pickle and jam. He knew the entire house well, he owned it, he had built it—the flimsy walls (they were not even tongue-and-groove like the one in which he lived but were of ship-lap, the synthetic joints of which, weathered and warped by the damp salt air, leaked all privacy just as broken socks and trousers do) murmurous with the ghosts of a thousand rented days and nights to which he (though not his wife) had closed his eyes, insisting only that there be always an odd number in any mixed party which stayed there overnight unless the couple were strangers formally professing to be man and wife, as now, even though he knew better and knew that his wife knew better. Because this was it, this the anger and outrage which would alternate with the despair tomorrow and tomorrow: Why did you have to tell me? he thought. The others didn’t tell me, upset me, didn’t bring here what you brought, though I dont know what they might have taken away.",

Still, I now had to find an outside channel, which meant craning to read, from the crest of each swell moving through the trough, the horizon. What were the significant patterns in the faint, distant movements of blue-gray water half a mile out? And in the bumps beyond that? Where along the vast, undulating outside bar did the energy seem to be concentrating? Which way should I go? When to start sprinting? Now? Two minutes from now? How to avoid a frightening, deepwater pounding. The fear in these long trough moments was nothing like the concentrated panic I once felt at big Rice Bowl as a kid. It was more diffuse, queasy, contingent. Drowning was just a vague, unlikely possibility, the ultimate unwanted outcome, floating around the edge of things—a cold green specter, nothing more. If I made it across the outside bar intact, it would be time to surf, to find waves to ride. That, after all, was what we were out here for.",
