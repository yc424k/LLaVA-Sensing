But soon we were climbing steadily, the land rising between what might here be described as ‘rolling hills’ – i.e., pretty impressive mountains, though not in the ‘savage peak’ category. Rachel marvelled at their colouring: great glowing patches of red and yellow, riven by wide streaks of orange and pink – as a painting this scene would have seemed vulgar, as Andes it was superb. But the drought-damage marred our joy. Beside the narrow stoney road, many hectares of withered young wheat lay on the cracked and desperate earth. Other fields were ploughed for planting; but if no rain comes, why waste seed? These fields had cactus hedges and when Juana noticed gaps on the right she made half-hearted attempts to turn towards home. Federico had advised me to lead her all day, foreseeing that she might take Rachel back to Martin.",

Between the wings, four wide-spaced Tuscan columns advanced and ascended both floors to form a splendid loggia. White louvred shutters continued the line of windows on either side, each leaf touching its neighbour on the façade when they were open while indoors the light poured across the floors; closed, with their slats ajar when the sun became too hot, they striped the wide polished beams underfoot with bars of light and dark. There was a wheel with a handle which cranked out an enormous slant of white awning and, looking out, one might have been on the deck of a schooner painted by Tissot with tree-tops for waves. Beyond, the vine-clad hemispherical hill of Mokra soared like a volcanic island against snowy heaps of cloud and a pale sky. The smells of lilac, box and lavender drifted in, goldfinches moved about the branches, and now and then house-martins from the nests clustering along the pediment strayed indoors and flew in desperate circles or swept clean through the house and out the other side.",

    "target_paragraph": "But with Mr Ramsay bearing down on her, she could do nothing. Every time he approached—he was walking up and down the terrace—ruin approached, chaos approached. She could not paint. She stooped, she turned; she took up this rag; she squeezed that tube. But all she did was to ward him off a moment. He made it impossible for her to do anything. For if she gave him the least chance, if he saw her disengaged a moment, looking his way a moment, he would be on her, saying, as he had said last night, ‘You find us much changed.’ Last night he had got up and stopped before her, and said that. Dumb and staring though they had all sat, the six children whom they used to call after the Kings and Queens of England—the Red, the Fair, the Wicked, the Ruthless,—she felt how they raged under it. Kind old Mrs Beckwith said something sensible. But it was a house full of unrelated passions—she had felt that all the evening. And on top of this chaos Mr Ramsay got up, pressed her hand, and said: ‘You will find us much changed’ and none of them had moved or had spoken; but had sat there as if they were forced to let him say it. Only James (certainly the Sullen) scowled at the lamp; and Cam screwed her handkerchief round her finger. Then he reminded them that they were going to the Lighthouse tomorrow. They must be ready, in the hall, on the stroke of half-past seven. Then, with his hand on the door, he stopped; he turned upon them. Did they not want to go? he demanded. Had they dared say No (he had some reason for wanting it) he would have flung himself tragically backwards into the bitter waters of despair. Such a gift he had for gesture. He looked like a king in exile. Doggedly James said yes. Cam stumbled more wretchedly. Yes, oh yes, they’d both be ready, they said. And it struck her, this was tragedy—not palls, dust, and the shroud; but children coerced, their spirits subdued. James was sixteen, Cam seventeen, perhaps. She had looked round for someone who was not there, for Mrs Ramsay, presumably. But there was only kind Mrs Beckwith turning over her sketches under the lamp. Then, being tired, her mind still rising and falling with the sea, the taste and smell that places have after long absence possessing her, the candles wavering in her eyes, she had lost herself and gone under. It was a wonderful night, starlit; the waves sounded as they went upstairs; the moon surprised them, enormous, pale, as they passed the staircase window. She had slept at once.",

One Friday evening in August she walked a little way along the road and entered the orchard for the first time since the sombre event of the preceding Christmas. None of the old colour had as yet come back to her cheek, and its absolute paleness was heightened by the jet black of her dress till it appeared preternatural. When she reached the gate at the other end of the orchard, which opened nearly opposite to the churchyard, Bathsheba heard singing inside the church, and she knew that the singers were practising. She opened the gate, crossed the road and entered the graveyard, the high sills of the church windows effectually screening her from the eyes of those gathered within. Her stealthy walk was to the nook wherein Troy had worked at planting flowers upon Fanny Robbin’s grave, and she came to the marble tombstone.",

All of them are set now in the cold blue of that slanting shadow, except the pitcher, who stands out there all alone, calm, desperate, and forsaken in his isolation, with the gold-red swiftly fading light upon him, his figure legible with all the resolution, despair and lonely dignity which that slanting, somehow fatal light can give him. Deep lilac light is eating swiftly in from every corner of the field now, and far off there is a vision of the misty, golden and October towers of the terrific city. The scene is unforgettable in the beauty, intoxication and heroic feeling of its incredible design, and yet, as overwhelming as the spectacle may be for him who sees it, it is doubtful if the eye-witness has ever felt its mystery, beauty, and strange loveliness as did that unseen and unseeing audience in a little town.",

If a new wooden roof were raised over the nave, the floor were swept and the gables slightly repaired, the church would be ready for use tomorrow. But, like so many other churches across the Middle East, this astonishing basilica now acts as nothing more than a convenient sheep-pen: as I walked across the fields and through the olives, I could see a shepherd boy drawing water from a well to one side of the ruin. He poured the water into a trough which, as I drew nearer, I realised was actually the old church font. The boy salaamed, and led me inside.",

The clouds were low and dark, the water a dull gray. Bryan said that except for the palm trees thrashing in the gloom, and the temperature, it felt like northwest Ireland. He was on his frontside—a goofyfoot going left—and he put together a string of long, fast rides, taking a high line through the shut-down section and threading it cleanly. The surf was shoulder-high and pulsing. The wind added drama to the approaching sets and a faint blue light high in the faces just at the moment of breaking. We surfed till after dark, then walked back into Sala’ilua through a warm, thick, gentle rain.",

Newly sheared stumps and trees crushed to pulp by the advancing ice littered the ground; the rain had swollen a stream of glacial runoff into a cascading torrent. Realizing that a coat was useless in such conditions, Muir stripped his off and surrendered to a complete drenching. Having ascended several miles with Stickeen along the glacier’s edge, he scanned across its body as he neared the top. “As far as the eye could reach, the nearly level glacier stretched indefinitely away in the gray cloudy sky, a prairie of ice.”",

When he woke he saw a pattern of rippling foliage on the ceiling of his room, and a bar of sunlight lying across the floor. The air that came in through the window was sultry with heat, and flies buzzed against the pane. Looking about him at the streaked and faded wallpaper, his clothes heaped up on a broken-down verandah chair, and the water jug with a chipped spout on the old-fashioned washstand, he felt a qualm of homesickness, and thought longingly of the spring sunsets across the fields at Crampton, and the perfume of his grandmother’s neglected lilacs. So strong was the impression that the perfume was actually in his nostrils. He raised himself on his elbow, and there, on the pillow, lay a spray of white lilac, filling the room with June. “Well, that’s nice of them,” Vance thought, burying his face in the ivory-coloured clusters. He remembered his grandmother’s once saying, as they sat on the Crampton porch on a hot June evening: “I guess that box of ointment Mary Magdalen broke over our Lord’s feet must have been made out of lilacs,” and he had liked the fancy, and wished he knew how to make a poem out of it, rich and heavy with perfumed words. His grandmother’s random fancies often stirred his imagination in this way.",

Fadi and I meet at Damascus Gate, and we’re going to get coffee (okay, and cigarettes) on his way to work and on my way to where I’m staying. There are kids break dancing over the steps—Taylor Swift, then Justin Bieber, then something in Arabic. They’re flipping in the air.\nJust a few days ago, an old mother ran at a group of Border Police at the gate with a knife—or maybe a pair of scissors—and they shot her dead before she could stab them.\nShortly after she died, the story hit the news: Her son had been killed accidentally by soldiers at a checkpoint the year before. “It was a mistake,” they said. But he was dead, shot, wrong place at the wrong time, driving while Palestinian, no excuse.\nAnd his mother, broken, cleaved down the middle with grief, wanted to join him, so she came to Damascus Gate and ran at the soldiers, and they shot her.\nI’m a mother, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t understand.\nI can’t tell if that’s blood on the ground, or just a shadow.\n“My friend saw the whole thing,” Fadi says to me. “You know, the guy who sells oranges? Hatem? He said that she didn’t even have a weapon, but she ran at the soldiers and shouted, “Allahu Akbar, and they just shot her.”\n“That’s not what the police say, but the whole thing is just awful.”\n“I wasn’t there,” he tells me. “Hatem was and I trust him. But even if it’s true, and all she did was shout Allahu Akbar, I understand why they shot her.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Maybe they thought she had a suicide vest. Maybe they thought she had a gun. They didn’t know, and they’re young boys, just a few years older than my son, and I understand it. I would have done the same.”\n“You would have shot her?”\n“If it’s your life or her life, wouldn’t you?”\nI can’t answer that. I think about my friend’s brother on that bus from Gilo to Jerusalem, newly married, his body blown up in a million little pieces, and his yarmulke the only thing they could find 100 meters from where he sat.\nAnd I think about my kid who will one day wear combat boots and carry guns because that’s what it means to be Israeli, and I think about Fadi’s kids, too.\nTwo Border Police walk over with their guns on their backs to the guys selling crepes. They’re bigger than the kids behind the stand. The kids look up.\nMy body goes rigid, and so does Fadi’s. I can feel him next to me, poised, tense, just as I am. We’re watching but we don’t move.\nI wonder if the kids are in trouble. I wonder if the Border Police could be, too.\nI look at Fadi and the pulse beats in his jaw. His fists are clenched. I realize mine are, too.\nAre the kids going to be arrested?\nCould one of them pull a knife?\nWe don’t move.\nOne of the Border Police steps forward, and I want to grab Fadi’s hand, but I don’t.\n“Hey, can we get five crepes?” he asks, handing the kid fifty shekels.\n“Sure, brother,” one of the kids answers. “No problem.”\nFadi and I laugh and laugh until tears fill our eyes.\n“Want a crepe?”\n“No, but yes.”",

So empty and featureless was the terrain, wrote Murray afterwards, that maps of it resembled ‘sea charts, blank sheets apart from the coastline’. Despite the deprivations and the dangers of the situation, he found a beauty in that hard and hostile sand world. He grew to love the desert: its clarity of line, its fiery sunrises - ‘when the huge sun-disc lifted up from the horizon, the cool stillness then, the vastness of blue skies’ - and the light, which at the brightest hours gave the impression of having bleached the sand so white that it seemed as if snow had settled upon the desert.",

The more there are, the easier it becomes for others, as organic matter builds up as leaf mold and deadwood and algae, and acts as a compost for the next generation. To begin with, the bings would have been species poor, and then a fluctuating assemblage of species would have played across their faces as each tried out new forms of what they might become. Montane species, common weeds, escaped ornamentals. But over time, species accrue, bed down. And now, the bings come to act almost as an archive of biodiversity for the local area.",

He had dropped the gun too so he had to dive, submerge again to find it, back out of the icy air into the water which as yet felt neither, neither cold or not and where even his sodden garments—boots and thick pants and sweater and hunting coat—didn’t even feel heavy but just slow, and found the gun and tried again for bottom then thrashed one-handed to the bank and treading water and clinging to a willow-branch he reached the gun up until someone took it; Edmonds’ boy obviously since at that moment Aleck Sander rammed down at him the end of a long pole, almost a log whose first pass struck his feet out from under him and sent his head under again and almost broke his hold on the willow until a voice said:",

The valley that contained the lakes was a lush lime green against the greeny black of the surrounding hills, and as I walked into the little town of Mikata, past a supermarket where a loudspeaker was broadcasting ‘I’d Like to Get You on a Slow Boat to China’, a little boy with a Union Jack on his T-shirt said ‘Bye-bye’ so incredibly politely that I stopped to congratulate him on his choice of flag.",

The flame of the sun was so many million candles, burning to its own glory. In it, she was submerged, rising, dropping to straddle the middle of the three land marks.

Nothing in her husband's brief lines had embittered her as much as the allusion to Strefford. It seemed to imply that Nick's own plans were made, that his own future was secure, and that he could therefore freely and handsomely take thought for hers, and give her a pointer in the right direction. Sudden rage had possessed her at the thought: where she had at first read jealousy she now saw only a cold providence, and in a blur of tears she had scrawled her postscript to Strefford. She remembered that she had not even asked him to keep her secret. Well—after all, what would it matter if people should already know that Nick had left her? Their parting could not long remain a mystery, and the fact that it was known might help her to keep up a presence of indifference.",

We agreed sometimes we could only listen to current news as filtered through political satirists or comedians. We talked about dozens of different things. I concluded she was the heart, spine, and muscle of this branch. She left home aged seventeen, stayed with one friend after the next, then moved into a collective, which was a thing then, in her Maoist phase. I never had the nerve to leave like that, although I dreamed of it every day. She spoke of her first real working years as a psychiatric nurse. She loved it, but back then, those places were punishing, like prisons. She lobbied for reform, and of course, she did not stay. Years later, such ideas were more accepted, but by then she’d spent twenty years in news journalism, and raised a family on that.",

I will not however at present go into that, having gradually in the course of writing this become aware that what I shall probably do next will be to collect and embody all my more metaphysical side into a volume to itself with plenty of room in it, and will here, then, merely ask my hearers to behold me whistling in my caravan on that bright August morning, whistling, and ready, as every sound man should be, to leave the annoyances of yesterday beneath their own dust and begin the new day in the spirit of “Who knows but before nightfall I shall have conquered the world?”",

She stared at herself aghast; and a recollection of those pleasant bus conductors and taxi-men came into her mind, all smiling at her and calling her Miss as lately as a week ago, and of her own image in the glass at that time when, radiant with the cool happiness of not being in love, with the peace of gratified vanity at having somebody extraordinarily in love with her, while she herself loved him quite enough but not too much, she might have been and was so easily taken for really young.",

    "target_paragraph": "Xandra and I first came upon the city from the water, much as Alexander von Humboldt did in 1801. He described a river of jewel-like islands, some floating forests, others covered by thickets of delicate willows, and still others open meadows, with reeds and wild grasses swaying in the breeze. The shores at the time were thick with chingalé palms, calliandras, and wild figs, ficus trees with broad, spreading branches draped in lianas and festooned with epiphytic bromeliads, aroids, and orchids. High above the riverbank, the branches of massive ceiba, cantagallo, and caracolí trees met and intertwined to form a dense canopy that the great naturalist described as a “carpet floating in the air,” a layer of botanical life that all but blocked out the sun, leaving the forest floor a shaded garden of luscious herbs and heliconias, platanillos, and prayer plants, an impenetrable darkness that, as Humboldt wrote, “brings a sense of doom and dread to the soul.”",

Its irregular waterfront lots accumulate crumbled-up Caterpillar treads, school bus hulks, twisted scaffolding in rats’-nest heaps, rusted gold dredges, busted paddle wheels, crunched pallets, hyperextended recliner chairs, skewed all-terrain vehicle frames, mashed wooden dogsleds, multicolored nylon cable exploded to pompoms, door-sprung ambulance vans, dinged fuel tanks, shot clutch plates, run-over corrugated pipe, bent I beams, bent rebars, bent vents. The pileup at land’s end is almost audible, as if you could still hear the echoes of the cascade from the continental closet where all of it once was stored.",

The lyre Severn designed for Keats’s tomb, with half its strings missing as a sign of the unfinished life—as the Humboldts had set up broken stubs of columns by their small children’s graves—is not intrusive. But for words there should obviously be none but the strangely simple ones he requested, which are only as modest as a person of great gift and soul and knowing his worth, unless nothing has any, should be: Here lies one whose name was writ in water.",

    "target_paragraph": "“Wait!” Charlotte cried. “Wait!” They paused; they watched her once more as the crayon moved, and now, at the rear of the throng waiting outside the closed window Wilbourne saw his own face emerge from beneath the flying chalk; anyone would have recognised him: they did at once. The sound ceased, they looked at Wilbourne then at one another in bewilderment. Then they looked at Charlotte again as she ripped the paper from the wall and began to attach a fresh sheet; this time one of them stepped forward and helped her, Wilbourne too watching the flying crayon again. This time it was himself, indubitably himself and indubitably a doctor, anyone would have known it—the horn glasses, the hospital tunic every charity patient, every hunky gutted by flying rock or steel or premature dynamite and coming to in company emergency stations, has seen, a bottle which was indubitably medicine in one hand, a spoonful of which he was offering to a man who was compositely all of them, every man who ever labored in the bowels of earth—the same wild unshaven look, even the sheepskin collar, and behind the doctor the same huge hand with its huge diamond in the act of extracting from the doctor’s pocket a wallet thin as paper. Again the eyes turned toward Wilbourne, the reproach gone now and only the ferocity remaining and that not at him. He gestured toward the remaining laden shelves. Presently he was able to reach Charlotte in the pandemonium and take her arm.",

It’s a curious thing how, no matter what’s wrong with you, a man’ll tell you to have your teeth examined and a woman’ll tell you to get married. It always takes a man that never made much at any thing to tell you how to run your business, though. Like these college professors without a whole pair of socks to his name, telling you how to make a million in ten years, and a woman that couldn’t even get a husband can always tell you how to raise a family.",
