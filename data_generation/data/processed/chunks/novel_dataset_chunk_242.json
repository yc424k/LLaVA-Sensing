On Sundays he was a man of misty views, rather given to a postponing treatment of things, whose best clothes and seven-and-six-penny umbrella were always hampering him: upon the whole one who felt himself to occupy morally that vast middle space of Laodicean neutrality which lay between the Sacrament people of the parish and the drunken division of its inhabitants – that is, he went to church, but yawned privately by the time the congregation reached the Nicene creed, and thought of what there was for dinner when he meant to be listening to the sermon. Or, to state his character as it stood in the scale of public opinion, when his friends and critics were in tantrums he was considered rather a bad man; when they were pleased he was rather a good man; when they were neither he was a man whose moral colour was a kind of pepper and salt mixture.",

Fitzpiers kept himself continually near her, dominating any rebellious impulse, and shaping her will into passive concurrence with all his desires. Apart from his lover-like anxiety to possess her the few golden hundreds of the timber-dealer, ready to hand, formed a warm background to Grace’s lovely face, and went some way to remove his uneasiness at the prospect of endangering his professional and social chances by an alliance with the family of a simple countryman.",

    "target_paragraph": "“Me too, Jane,” I said, realizing how quickly we had become demarcated from the Saudi nationals we knew. We were too afraid to engage in dialogue, even moving in the educated sector. Visiting the grocery store on the compound confirmed the prevalent hate.\nThe South Indian check-out boy scanned my shopping. Always chatty, he wanted to talk. He spoke in his native Hindi, which I answered in Urdu. He was eager to discuss the news.\n“This news in New York has been very good, Doctora! The Americans deserved it.” I looked up from my wallet, disgusted. A man of only twenty-two, perhaps, he had until now, always impressed me with his friendliness and warmth. There had been a certain curiosity about him that belied promise. Instead he proved himself ignorant and hateful.\n“New York City is my home!” I barked. “My friends and my family are there. Don't ever say that again. You call yourself Muslim and you celebrate death! Don't you know life is the most sacred thing in Islam? That the right to human life overrides even the rights of God?” The young man cowered under my blistering attack. Shamed, he immediately began to apologize. I snatched my goods from him, threw a handful of notes in payment and pushed my way past other shoppers. I wanted to get away.\nIn the days following 9/11, I bore witness to an extraordinary fabric, uniting the most educated and elite of Muslims to the weakest and least educated in shared hatreds. As I stumbled upon rancid hates and crude appetites, I was reminded of what I had chosen to forget: the deep-rooted currents of anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism that here often seemed to run together. An instance flashed into recall.\nA few months earlier, in the compound video store, I was about to leave when I noticed a Saudi couple. The woman was wearing a hijab with her face uncovered, standing with her thobe-clad husband. They were renting a movie; planning their Thursday night as a family. A daughter, perhaps ten at most, stood between them. She was unveiled. Her curly hair cascaded into a lush mane. Clinging on to her mother's hand with slim fingers decorated with plastic jewelry, she waited for them silently. Ribboned hair indicated she was cherished, adorned. Warming at the sight of a valued daughter, I was surprised to notice the mother clutched an Al Pacino movie, The Devil's Advocate. I had seen the film and knew it to be inappropriate for a ten-year-old. I had to say something.\n“Excuse me, but some of the film is a little explicit. It's not what you should be allowing your young daughter to see. I have seen it. I think you won't be able to have your little girl watch it.”",

Monsieur Dussaud began the work on it five years ago; Mr. Butler and Dr. Littmann, whose visit immediately preceded mine, will be found to have continued it when their next volumes are given to the world. Having seen what tombs they had uncovered and noted several mounds that must conceal others, I sent away my companions and wandered in the dusk through the ruined streets of the town, into great rooms and up broken stairs, till Gablān came and called me in, saying that if a man saw something in a fur coat exploring those uncanny places after dark, he might easily take the apparition for a ghoul and shoot at it. Moreover, he wished to ask me whether he might not return to Tneib. One of the Arabs would guide us next day to the first Druze village, and Gablān would as soon come no nearer to the Mountain. I agreed readily, indeed it was a relief not to have his safety on my conscience. He received three napoleons for his-trouble and a warm letter of thanks to deliver to Fellāh ul ’Isa, and we parted with many assurances that if God willed we would travel together again.",

Most of us were in a state of shock. It seemed that everybody had a horror story. The yacht Sunshine had actually surfed into the village, riding the crest of a curling wave, shooting between collapsing houses, knocking down power lines with her mast, finally coming to rest in a churchyard a quarter-mile from the harbor. Nobody in the crew of three was seriously injured. Banyan and Gallivanter were bashed and battered at the quay but their crews were likewise not injured. Tulak was carried ashore on a wave and deposited in a pile of wreckage on the soccer field that had almost trapped us, but Steve, her singlehanded captain, was likewise miraculously unhurt. We learned that the two ships that smashed our bow were already disabled when the tsunami struck. One had no working engine and the other no working transmission. They had been rafted together and making repairs when they broke free of the tuna cannery dock. They were now aground at the head of the bay.",

The town was full of surprises—of unexpected glimpses upon a group of slender palms, some gleaming precipice, or the distant sea. Gardens appeared to be toppling over the houses; green vines festooned the doorways and gaily coloured porches; streets climbed up and down, noisy with rattling carriages and cries of fruit-vendors who exposed their wares of brightest hues on the pavement. Country women, in picturesque cinnamon-coloured skirts, moved gravely among the citizens. The houses, when not whitewashed, showed their building stone of red volcanic tufa; windows were aflame with cacti and carnations; slumberous oranges glowed in courtyards; the roadways underfoot were of lava—pitch-black. It was a brilliant medley, overhung by a deep blue sky. The canvas was indeed overcharged, as Denis had said.",

We often looked back to where the mighty peaks beyond the Shigar rose shining above the darkness of ‘the three bears’; but luckily I was not looking over my shoulder when the track ended abruptly on the edge of a profound chasm, evidently recently created by some slight shudder of these restless mountains. Here we seemed very close to the snows at the head of the valley. Judging by the wind’s keenness – despite the hot noon sun – and by our sense of intimacy with the surrounding heights, I would say we were at about 11,000 feet. It is unusual to find a completely unpeopled nullah, so doggedly do the Baltis make habitable the most unlikely places, and I relished the vast solitude. Yet those tiny deserted fields were rather poignant, as was a grove of gnarled fruit-trees opposite our enforced resting-place, where the vanished village most probably stood.",

Between two of the windows stood a large Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony, and inlaid with ivory and blue lapis. He watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet almost loathed. His breath quickened. A mad craving came over him. He lit a cigarette and then threw it away. His eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek. But he still watched the cabinet. At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying, went over to it, and, having unlocked it, touched some hidden spring. A triangular drawer passed slowly out. His fingers moved instinctively towards it, dipped in, and closed on something. It was a small Chinese box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought, the sides patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads. He opened it. Inside was a green paste waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and persistent.",

Then the raft dove under again, taking me with it. I rammed into rocks so violently that I was twice thrown into the air, landing in the water, vulnerable to the torments of the river, sucked down to its depths.

Bob said that when he felt it with his feet he thought it was a cat or a monkey, however he didn’t consider attacking it. We did love Bob with his air of bewilderment and grumpiness, but in his eyes there was always a gleam of merriment. We had much in common, as he’s an Anglophile and enjoyed talking about England, and in particular his partiality to Tiptree jams and crumpets.\nThe night was full of intriguing sounds. Grunts, squeals, roars, rattles, growls, splashes, crashes, squeaks, chewing and belching. What a heavenly sensation of being so very, very close to nature with nothing more than a wall of thick canvas between us, and knowing at the same time that we were perfectly safe. It gave me a feeling of calm and being in another world.",

Talk turned on the Arlosorov, the Jewish leader, who was shot on the sands of Jaffa while walking with his wife. The murderers are supposed to have been Jewish revisionists, an extreme party that want to be rid of the English and set up a Jewish state.

It was in spinnaker, up mizzen, all sheets by the wind, and we were moving slowly ahead, heaving the lead and straining our eyes for the fixed red light on the ruined fort that would give us our bearings to anchorage. The air was light and baffling, now east, now west, now north, now south; while from either hand came the roar of unseen breakers. From the looming cliffs arose the blatting of wild goats, and overhead the first stars were peeping mistily through the ragged train of the passing squall. At the end of two hours, having come a mile into the bay, we dropped anchor in eleven fathoms. And so we came to Taiohae.",

When he was a student in art college he’d taken an air-rifle into the life-drawing class, sat by an open window that overlooked a stand of trees, and shot any squirrels that appeared.

Reconstructions indicate this could have induced global cooling by up to 10.4ºF for a period of four or five years (though the true extent is a point of rigorous debate). Certainly, the impact of the eruption reverberated around the globe: the following January, English monk Matthew Paris recorded “such unendurable cold, that it bound up the face of the earth . . . suspended all cultivation, and killed the young of the cattle,” and, by summer, starvation: “dead bodies . . . swollen and livid, lying by fives and sixe’s in pigsties, on dunghills, and in the muddy street.” (A mass grave holding in excess of ten thousand corpses dating from this period was unearthed in Spitalfields, London, in the 1990s.) Glaciers and ice caps expanded.",

His ancestors had come from Spain and settled both in Guanabacoa and in what became the province of Artemisa, west of Havana. His grandfather, César Mas, was a printer and newspaperman who set down roots in the San Sebastián neighborhood of Guanabacoa in a tumbledown wooden house on the corner with Aguacate, one block uphill from the Brazo Fuerte bakery that Cuban rebels burned in 1896, the same year Eustoquia’s plantation in Colón went up in flames. Jorge was born in the house, and after his grandfather died and his father, Jorge Luis, abandoned the family, he grew up surrounded by women. He was enrolled at Los Escolapios when it was an all-boys school run by priests. His grandmother Victoria walked him there every day and made sure he received the Catholic sacraments.",

Nothing to trouble your youth or lack of it: rather something to trouble the very fibrous integrity of your being. Mr. Talliaferro slapped his neck savagely.",

Up and down the cars prowl on Saturday nights, in one never-ending stream, past ice cream parlors offering “dietetic” snacks, past tanning centers and solaria. Much of the city, in fact, feels as if it were decorated by Judith Krantz: the streets are lined with hand-painted copies of famous Benetton and Calvin Klein ads, and everywhere you go you see familiar names—Sony, Burberry, Eastern Airlines; Lloyds Bank, Visa, Hyundai. Even the villages in the Brand-Name Republic are draped in Wranglers ads, and a huge banner hangs above the main street in the lakeside resort of San Bernardino: LUCKY STRIKE WISHES YOU A HAPPY SUMMER.",

Previously, nearly all manufacturers placed the driver on the outer, curb-side of the car so that an alighting driver could step out onto a grassy verge or dry sidewalk rather than into the mud of an unpaved road. Ford reasoned that this convenience might be better appreciated by the lady of the house, and so arranged seating for her benefit. The arrangement also gave the driver a better view down the road, and made it easier for passing drivers to stop and have a conversation out facing windows. Ford was no great thinker, but he did understand human nature. Such, in any case, was the popularity of Ford’s seating plan for the Model T that it soon became the standard adopted by all cars.",

She had suddenly become very angry, with a rage which their relationship made silent, and therefore doubly powerful and critical. She felt all the unfairness of the claim which her mother tacitly made to her time and sympathy, and what Mrs Hilbery took, Katharine thought bitterly, she wasted. Then, in a flash, she remembered that she had still to tell her about Cyril’s misbehaviour. Her anger immediately dissipated itself; it broke like some wave that has gathered itself high above the rest; the waters were resumed into the sea again, and Katharine felt once more full of peace and solicitude, and anxious only that her mother should be protected from pain. She crossed the room instinctively, and sat on the arm of her mother’s chair. Mrs Hilbery leant her head against her daughter’s body.",

However, speaking with those who have had to endure the nightmare and from personal experience, I found out that this wasn’t the case. The unfortunates had paid in full, constructing their homes with the proper permits, and to add insult to injury, shelled out well above the average, as they were forced to take showers, do laundry and wash dishes during hours in which utilities cost double.",
