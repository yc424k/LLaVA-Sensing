Himself, for instance, ensconced in the impenetrable prosperity of his wonderful marriage; herself too (unconsciously, dear soul!), so happily tucked away in a cranny of that new and spacious life, and no more able to conceive why existing conditions should be disturbed than the bird in the eaves understands why the house should be torn down. Well—he had learned at last what his experience with his poor, valiant, puzzled mother might have taught him: that one must never ask from women any view but the personal one, any measure of conduct but that of their own pains and pleasures. She, indeed, had borne undauntedly enough the brunt of their earlier trials; but that was merely because, as she said, the mother's instinct bade her heap all her private hopes on the great devouring altar of her son's ambition; it was not because she had ever, in the very least, understood or sympathized with his aims.",

There were no punctures, the chassis did not give way, and occasionally the headlights worked. We were less lucky on arriving at Tashkurgan. The hotel had closed up for the night and refused to admit us. The driver took us to a disused caravanserai and there we fought for floorspace. There was no water, no food, no loo and no beds.

As I entered, the lights automatically dimmed in the room. A little introductory music played and then—this was the enchanting part—a young woman about six inches high stepped out of one of the framed photographs and began moving around among the objects and talking about Cowra in the 1940s and the prison breakout. My mouth fell open. She didn’t just move about, but interacted with the objects—stepped around books, idly leaned on a shell casing—as she went through her presentation. As you can imagine, I got up and had a closer look and I can tell you that no matter how close you got to the glass (and I had my head pressed up against it the way children do when they wish to be amusing) you couldn’t see the artifice. She was a perfectly formed, full-color, charmingly articulate, rather dishy three-dimensional person right in front of me and only six inches high. It was the most captivating thing I had seen in years. It was obvious that it was a film projected in some way from beneath, but there wasn’t a stutter or bump, no scratchy lines or wriggly hairs. It was as real as an image can get. She was a perfect little hologram. The narrative, it is worth noting, was sympathetic and informative—a model of its type. I watched it three times and couldn’t have been more impressed.",

It is true that Captain Bruce found no variables on his traverse, and that he \"never could make easting on either tack.\" It was the variables or nothing with us, and we prayed for better luck than he had had. The variables constitute the belt of ocean lying between the trades and the doldrums, and are conjectured to be the draughts of heated air which rise in the doldrums, flow high in the air counter to the trades, and gradually sink down till they fan the surface of the ocean where they are found. And they are found where they are found; for they are wedged between the trades and the doldrums, which same shift their territory from day to day and month to month.",

Some American blacks have even sought political asylum in Cuba, like activists Assata Shakur and Nehanda Abiodun.

So Pappa acquired a new birth certificate and ‘To avoid the embarrassment of acknowledging this fraud, Fidel spent the rest of his life claiming to be a year older than he really was’.",

Regretfully the Iliad was put aside, the dream surrendered for the reality; my own paper-backed P. G. Wodehouse had lain untouched in my coat pocket. (I had been too ashamed to bring it out in such distinguished company. We highbrow poets have our pride.)",

He had heard of someone with several mules for sale: an unusual circumstance, probably connected with the drought. For miles we bumped over narrow tracks, the windows sealed against thick clouds of dust. Five campesinos gave us contradictory directions and it was 9 a.m. before we found our man, though he lives scarcely twelve miles from Cajamarca. ‘When you are trekking’, advised Federico, ‘never ask these people for help. It’s better to get lost your way than their’s.’",

Pioneers found earthworks shaped like cones, or truncated pyramids, or giant animals, including the quarter-mile-long “Great Serpent Mound,” which slithers across southern Ohio. Indians dwelling nearby, like those at Etowah, claimed no connection to the mounds. Nor, in the view of whites, were Indian “savages” capable of such monumental architecture. “It seems probable,” Cornelius wrote of Etowah’s mounds, that “they were erected by another race, who once inhabited the country.”",

Lobby is a courtesy word for the ground-floor hallway that accommodates the pensione’s lift, which has a mind of its own. The pensione occupies the third through the sixth floors of a postwar building that is otherwise occupied by psychiatrists and mysterious others with equally quiet pursuits. On the fifth floor are the reception area and a lounge that is full of yellowing old books and plump sofas and easy chairs covered with chintz, from which one can see the crenellated tower of the Palazzo Vecchio, gaunt, beautiful, and “too stony,” Henry James says, “to be brilliant.” The airy yellow breakfast room has the slightly sour smell of damp linen—a smell like that of yeast, a good, morning smell. Two of the gilded chairs in this room are wobbly, their legs uneven. Every morning one of the wobbly chairs is propped up by a folded napkin—but always only one, and one never knows which one it is to be.",

Sometimes he tried to talk to her, but she ignored his attempts and read on; if he persisted, she went away and left him. So he soon learned to lie, usually with his eyes closed, voyaging alone in the bleak and barren regions of his despair, while her voice flowed on and on above the remoter sounds that came up to them—Miss Jenny scolding Simon or Isom downstairs or in the garden; the twittering of birds in the tree just beyond the window; the ceaseless groaning of the water pump below the barn. At times she would cease and look at him and find that he was peacefully sleeping.",

The arched roof offered a bit of shade, but the air was hot and dry and smelled of diesel and dust. Twenty or so other passengers, all men, shuffled around the arcade and smoked and waited. One of the men, a towering Nubian, noticed me and marched across the hall. He interrogated me, about what I’m not sure. Once again, the only phrase I recognized was al Uqṣur. I shrugged, and said “Luxor.” The Nubian fellow mumbled a few more words, walked away, and leaned against the far wall. This was the first of several such conversations I would have that day, and they would each end in various degrees of success.",

Within a few centuries, only a few traces of the land bridge remained, including the Dogger Bank sandbank off the coast of Britain and the Frisian Islands of the Netherlands, sandy, grassy humps strung along the coast north of Amsterdam like stepping stones. The landscapes of the east of England and the southwestern Netherlands would remain strikingly similar.

He has become an icon for people all over the world. His three-time World Cup-winning feat, from four World Cup appearances, is unlikely to be matched. Pele scored a Guinness World Record?1,279 goals in 1,363 games?and also collected the following personal records along the way: Youngest winner of a World Cup?aged 17, top scorer of Brazil National Football Team and one of only 3 people to have scored in 4 World Cup events. Unbeknownst to many of his fans, Pele helped save the lives and improve the health of millions of children in Brazil. He also helped promote such worthy global causes as ecology and environment, sports and development and peaceful resolution of conflicts as goodwill ambassador for the UN, UNESCO and UNICEF. Because he is such an inspiration to me, meeting him will count, without a doubt, as one of the highlights of my life.",

A couple of hundred yards further on the path rounded a bend through the trees and ended suddenly, breathtakingly, in a viewing platform hanging out over a precipice of rock ? a little patio in the sky. It was a look-out built for the public, but I had the feeling that no one had been there for years, certainly no tourist. It was the sheerest stroke of luck that I had stumbled on it. I have never seen anything half as beautiful: on one side the town of Capri spilling down the hillside, on the other the twinkling lights of the cove at Anacapri and the houses gathered around it, and in front of me a sheer drop of ? what? ? 200 feet, 300 feet, to a sea of the lushest aquamarine washing against outcrops of jagged rock. The sea was so far below that the sound of breaking waves reached me as the faintest of whispers. A sliver of moon, brilliantly white, hung in a pale blue evening sky, a warm breeze teased my hair and everywhere there was the scent of lemon, honeysuckle and pine. It was like being in the household-products section of Sainsbury’s. Ahead of me there was nothing but open sea, calm and seductive, for 150 miles to Sicily. I would do anything to own that view, anything. I would sell my mother to Robert Maxwell for it. I would renounce my citizenship and walk across fire. I would swap hair ? yes! ? with Andrew Neil.",

Although they were experienced winter hikers and were well equipped, they couldn’t have imagined what they were letting themselves in for. On their second night, the winds rose to ninety miles an hour and the temperature plummeted to—32°F. I have experienced—25°F in calm conditions and can tell you that even well wrapped and with the benefit of residual heat from indoors it becomes distinctly uncomfortable within a couple of minutes. Somehow the two survived the night, but the next day Tinkham announced he could go no farther. Haas helped him into a sleeping bag, then stumbled on to the weather observatory a little over two miles away. He just made it, though he was gravely frostbitten. His friend was found the next day, “half out of his sleeping bag and frozen solid.”",

The idea was to encourage users to shift some of their electricity consumption to nighttime hours, thus spreading demand. So we bought timer devices and ran our washing machine, dryer, and dishwasher in the middle of the night and were rewarded for this small inconvenience with big savings on the electricity consumed during those hours. I would be pleased to continue the practice now, if only some utility would offer it to me.",

Wet gloves are worse than a wet hat, but not as bad as wet socks. When you stop for a short lunch in 40-degree rain under the dry tent of a low-branched spruce, is it better to take the wet gloves off, or leave them on? Eating lunch with wet gloves is horrible, and it’s hard to mine trail mix with a gloved hand. But taking the gloves off is bad, too, because your hands get cold (unless you keep them in your pockets, which you can’t do and still eat), and by the time everyone is shivering badly enough to prefer an extra fifteen minutes of heat-generating work over the rest of the entitled lunch break, the gloves will be soggy and freezing. Sliding a cold hand into a colder glove is like ripping off a Band-Aid; you know it’ll be over soon, but it still makes you cringe. You grit your teeth, tense up your stomach muscles, and hope no one notices your whining. But no one is watching. Their gloves are wet and cold, too, unless they’ve brought a spare pair. In that case, they pull them on and quietly gloat. Comfortable, yes, but then, their gloves will be soaked in ten minutes, and they forfeit the tortured satisfaction that comes from the tolerable, temporary suffering the rest of us share. Who comes out ahead?",

Well, I was far too hot and exhausted and sweat-slimed even to think of the effort of speech … So was this the final stage of sleep-deprivation as observed by Luke (probably backed up by hundreds of studies in what’s-the-point-of-sleep labs)? No, I thought, really not, this is called simple all-out pressurized physical labour when no one can speak… That’s all. And, oh god, my old back, how it hurts… So I repeated the mantra that I’d found a great help in jungles (but when I was more or less fit, and when I was young too), the incantation (on-and-on) that eventually saw you through those eight-or ten-hour so-called walks, those demi-runs that went on way beyond your idea of time, with the Iban or the Yanomami or the northern Congo pygmies: “This will all be over one day… This will all be over one day…”",

By 1993, even that operation ended, and so the curtain fell on my ten years of working for Trammell Crow. Meanwhile, the art business began to look interesting again, as artworks made unaffordable during the bubble days dropped in price.",

In its official statement, published in several newspapers, it acknowledged that there was still work to be done, but asserted that state institutions and secular organizations must take up the baton. It was a highly symbolic move which marked the end of an era, but – as many who opposed the closure of the Vicaría said – it did not mean that the work or the healing were complete. A quasi-replacement Vicariate for Social Action was established, to work in the field on behalf of the Church.",

As they gazed at each other each felt: Here am I – and then each felt: But how different! Hers was the pale worn face of an invalid, cut off from air, light, freedom. His was the warm ruddy face of a young animal; instinct with health and energy. Broken asunder, yet made in the same mould, could it be that each completed what was dormant in the other? She might have been – all that; and he – But no. Between them lay the widest gulf that can separate one being from another. She spoke. He was dumb. She was woman; he was dog.

The path eventually leads out of the forest into a huge field filled with tall yellow flowers. I start wading through them. The day is bright, and the sun emits a powerful and close heat. In the distance, I hear a car and, as it gets closer, loud music throbbing from it. The car—it’s black—streaks past on the road about sixty yards from where I’m walking. The car windows are rolled down, and there is the unmistakable sound of boisterously drunk young men. I forge ahead through the mass of flowers. A few minutes later the black car returns. This time it stops. The young men get out and walk toward me. There are five of them. I keep walking, wondering why they are approaching me, and I am seized by fear.",

So that, vexed as I was myself at the expense of the holiday that was to have been so cheap, I could not prevent a temporary good-humour taking possession of me, which is the invariable effect produced on me by other people’s crossness. Even then, with his hurt foot, Menzies-Legh was such a slave to duty that while I was in the very act of talking the recollection of something he ought to do made him struggle up from the low chair and rugs in which his wife had carefully placed him, and limp away; and I saw no more of him for a long while beyond an occasional glimpse of his sallow visage at the window in front of his van, where he sat all day in silence driving his horse.",
