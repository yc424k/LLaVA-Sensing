I hadn’t packed much clothing, so I had to buy basics on arrival. Instead, there were electrical and sound leads, adapters and unrelated technical components, none of them needed. My own internal circuits must have taken a beating and, clearly, some wires were loose. I was so wobbly, I bought a tall umbrella to use as a cane, but in time I was fine. On the beach, I just fell over into the sand. I may have looked drunk, but many people were, so no one much noticed or cared.",

The material came by mail from Baltimore, and in the season when the sun was gone for upward of a month the children worked by kerosene light (or gasoline-generated electric light), while their mother watched over them and licked the stamps. When Stanley reached junior high, he went to school in Fairbanks, and was ahead of his peers by a couple of levels. Education as a whole, though, was a patchwork affair, a hazard of the bush—correspondence, boarding homes, shuttlings to an apartment in Fairbanks. The Gelvins’ twins, Carol and Colleen, six years younger than Stanley, went to grade school in Fairbanks and high school by correspondence from Central—under the program run by the University of Nebraska. The course was “cattle-oriented,” according to Ginny. While they might better have been studying, say, aviation and geology in addition to fundamental subjects, they sat at the table in their log cabin at fifty degrees below zero in the penarctic twilight studying animal husbandry. Colleen stayed the course, but Carol went off to Colorado to finish high school from the home of an uncle. Stanley matriculated at the University of Alaska, intending to become a mining engineer. He stayed two weeks, leaving when he discovered that he had to study English, too. Only Betsy, the middle child, went on through college. There was no television in Central. The children could watch it in Fairbanks if they wanted to—and, in their mother’s words, “see the foolishness of it.” But Ginny always felt relieved that Central was, as it still is, beyond TV’s frontier. She had seen TV in a bar in Ohio in 1949 and had sensed what it could do to children.",

For more than twenty centuries, its people had turned their backs on the world at large and resolved to live alone, hidden behind the highest peaks on earth, disengaged from the march of time. Four decades ago, Heinrich Harrer had wandered by chance across the seemingly impassable mountains and stumbled into the heart of secrecy; during his seven years of living in Tibet, he later reported, only five other foreigners were sighted there. Indeed, in all of history until 1979, less than two thousand Westerners had ever set eyes on the Forbidden Land—most of them members of the Younghusband expedition, and the rest mostly madmen or wild adventurers disguised as Chinese nomads. “Isolation,” the Dalai Lama once wrote, “was in our blood.”",

Whatever sentence I extract whole and entire from this cauldron is only a string of six little fish that let themselves be caught while a million others leap and sizzle, making the cauldron bubble like boiling silver, and slip through my fingers. Faces recur, faces and faces—they press their beauty to the walls of my bubble—Neville, Susan, Louis, Jinny, Rhoda and a thousand others. How impossible to order them rightly; to detach one separately, or to give the effect of the whole—again like music. What a symphony with its concord and its discord, and its tunes on top and its complicated bass beneath, then grew up! Each played his own tune, fiddle, flute, trumpet, drum or whatever the instrument might be. With Neville, “Let’s discuss Hamlet”. With Louis, science. With Jinny, love. Then suddenly, in a moment of exasperation, off to Cumberland with a quiet man for a whole week in an inn, with the rain running down the window-panes and nothing but mutton and mutton and again mutton for dinner. Yet that week remains a solid stone in the welter of unrecorded sensation. It was then we played dominoes; then we quarrelled about tough mutton. Then we walked on the fell. And a little girl, peeping round the door, gave me that letter, written on blue paper, in which I learnt that the girl who had made me Byron was to marry a squire. A man in gaiters, a man with a whip, a man who made speeches about fat oxen at dinner—I exclaimed derisively and looked at the racing clouds, and felt my own failure; my desire to be free; to escape; to be bound; to make an end; to continue; to be Louis; to be myself; and walked out in my mackintosh alone, and felt grumpy under the eternal hills and not in the least sublime; and came home and blamed the meat and packed and so back again to the welter; to the torture.",

People sprang up everywhere; his father; his sister; old men got up from armchairs and said, You don’t remember me? Children he had left in the nursery were grown-up men at college; girls with pigtails were now married women. He was still confused by it all; they talked so fast; they must think him very slow, he thought. He had to withdraw into the window and say, ‘What, what, what do they mean by it?’",

    "target_paragraph": "IV\nOf the life of Benjamin Button between his twelfth and twenty-first year I intend to say little. Suffice to record that they were years of normal ungrowth. When Benjamin was eighteen he was erect as a man of fifty; he had more hair and it was of a dark gray; his step was firm, his voice had lost its cracked quaver and descended to a healthy baritone. So his father sent him up to Connecticut to take examinations for entrance to Yale College. Benjamin passed his examination and became a member of the freshman class.\nOn the third day following his matriculation he received a notification from Mr. Hart, the college registrar, to call at his office and arrange his schedule. Benjamin, glancing in the mirror, decided that his hair needed a new application of its brown dye, but an anxious inspection of his bureau drawer disclosed that the dye bottle was not there. Then he remembered—he had emptied it the day before and thrown it away.\nHe was in a dilemma. He was due at the registrar’s in five minutes. There seemed to be no help for it—he must go as he was. He did.\n“Good-morning,” said the registrar politely. “You’ve come to inquire about your son.”\n“Why, as a matter of fact, my name’s Button——” began Benjamin, but Mr. Hart cut him off.\n“I’m very glad to meet you, Mr. Button. I’m expecting your son here any minute.”\n“That’s me!” burst out Benjamin. “I’m a freshman.”\n“What!”\n“I’m a freshman.”\n“Surely you’re joking.”\n“Not at all.”\nThe registrar frowned and glanced at a card before him. “Why, I have Mr. Benjamin Button’s age down here as eighteen.”\n“That’s my age,” asserted Benjamin, flushing slightly.\nThe registrar eyed him wearily. “Now surely, Mr. Button, you don’t expect me to believe that.”\nBenjamin smiled wearily. “I am eighteen,” he repeated.\nThe registrar pointed sternly to the door. “Get out,” he said. “Get out of college and get out of town. You are a dangerous lunatic.”\n“I am eighteen.”\nMr. Hart opened the door. “The idea!” he shouted. “A man of your age trying to enter here as a freshman. Eighteen years old, are you? Well, I’ll give you eighteen minutes to get out of town.”\nBenjamin Button walked with dignity from the room, and half a dozen undergraduates, who were waiting in the hall, followed him curiously with their eyes. When he had gone a little way he turned around, faced the infuriated registrar, who was still standing in the door-way, and repeated in a firm voice: “I am eighteen years old.”\nTo a chorus of titters which went up from the group of undergraduates, Benjamin walked away.\nBut he was not fated to escape so easily. On his melancholy walk to the railroad station he found that he was being followed by a group, then by a swarm, and finally by a dense mass of undergraduates. The word had gone around that a lunatic had passed the entrance examinations for Yale and attempted to palm himself off as a youth of eighteen. A fever of excitement permeated the college. Men ran hatless out of classes, the football team abandoned its practice and joined the mob, professors’ wives with bonnets awry and bustles out of position, ran shouting after the procession, from which proceeded a continual succession of remarks aimed at the tender sensibilities of Benjamin Button.\n“He must be the wandering Jew!”\n“He ought to go to prep school at his age!”\n“Look at the infant prodigy!”\n“He thought this was the old men’s home.”\n“Go up to Harvard!”\nBenjamin increased his gait, and soon he was running. He would show them! He would go to Harvard, and then they would regret these ill-considered taunts!\nSafely on board the train for Baltimore, he put his head from the window. “You’ll regret this!” he shouted.\n“Ha-ha!” the undergraduates laughed. “Ha-ha-ha!” It was the biggest mistake that Yale College had ever made...",

This labour is not amenable to mechanisation and many vegueros (tobacco farmers) are reputed to talk encouragingly to their plants. Gauze netting covered several fields, protecting the wrapper leaves from too much sun: those must be more pliable than the rest. I ventured off the road to peer into one of the tall, windowless casas de tabaco, thatched barns crudely constructed of wood but precisely aligned east to west for consistent exposure to sunlight. These might have been built by the earliest vegueros; the twentieth century – never mind the twenty-first – has left no mark here. Objects made of metal, or any synthetic material, must never be allowed anywhere near these precious drying leaves; sewn together in batches, they hang from long horizontal poles for about two months before being packed in wooden chests and stored for three fermenting months. Then, after grading, they go to Cuba’s various factories to be carefully moistened and fermented for another two months. Again they are dried, packed in bales wrapped in palm bark and left to mature for four years before being rolled into the sort of cigars not many people can afford to smoke.",

You can no more rebuff it than you can a runaway train on a downhill slope. It’s hard, it’s made up, it’s cunning, you tell yourself, and then you go out into the streets and find yourself swept up in the sheer power and vigor of it all. On Sunday nights at six o’clock, all the motorbikes careen toward Notre Dame Cathedral in what was once John F. Kennedy Square, and there, in a novel version of the drive-in church, the parishioners simply park their bikes outside the church’s doors and stand in rows, beside their wheels, a hundred or more of them lined up in the street, the sermon broadcast through huge speakers almost entirely drowned out by the roar of traffic all around. Little kids skip around on holiday nights, blowing soap bubbles, making paper caterpillars, or posing, coquettish, in tiny, flouncy dresses. And often I found myself just standing on the street for twenty minutes or more, all but transfixed by the whole motorized carousel whizzing past. One of the most dangerous adventures in Vietnam is simply trying to cross the street in Saigon.",

In the center of town, on a corner that ought to have been a visual delight, there stood a small building occupied by a Lunn Poly travel agency. Upstairs the structure was half-timbered and quietly glorious; downstairs, between outsized sheets of plate glass covered with handwritten notices of cheap flights to Tenerife and Málaga, the facade had been tiled—tiled—with a mosaic of little multitoned squares that looked as if they had been salvaged from a British Rail toilet. It was just awful. I stood before it and tried to imagine what combination of architects, corporate designers, and town planners could have allowed this to be done to a fine timber-framed seventeenth-century building, and could not. And the thing was that it was really not a great deal worse than many other frontages along the street.",

We motor-sailed slowly southward hour after hour, the monotonous drone of the diesel and the warming sunshine making us all a little drowsy, especially after Cheryl served up a tasty lunch of ham, beans, rice, and sliced, vine-ripened tomatoes from the Castries market. As morning gave way to afternoon, La Soufrière gradually grew more imposing off our port bow, its smoldering crater veiled in clouds. The four-thousand-foot-high active volcano utterly dominates the northern end of St. Vincent. Actually, it comprises that part of the island. It last erupted in 1979 and will undoubtedly do so again some day. The massive eruption of May 7, 1902, which occurred just hours before the infamous eruption of Mount Pelée on Martinique, killed almost seventeen hundred people, and that was when the population was a lot lower than it is today. The power of La Soufrière is not to be lightly dismissed but it looked docile enough today.",

    "target_paragraph": "AT THE landing, before the long low stone house by the side of the canal, there were ducks laid out on the ground in rows.\nThey were laid in groups that were never of the same number. There were a few platoons, no companies, and, the Colonel thought, I barely have a squad.\nThe head game-keeper was standing on the bank in his high boots, his short jacket and his pushed back old felt hat, and he looked critically at the number of ducks on the bow of the boat as they came alongshore.\n“It was frozen-up at our post,” the Colonel said.\n“I suspected so,” the head keeper said. “I’m sorry. It was supposed to be the best post.”\n“Who was top gun?”\n“The Barone killed forty-two. There was a little current there that kept it open for a while. You probably did not hear the shooting because it was against the wind.”\n“Where is everyone?”\n“They’re all gone except the Barone who is waiting for you. Your driver is asleep in the house.”\n“He would be,” the Colonel said.\n“Spread those out properly,” the head keeper told the boatman who was a game-keeper too. “I want to put them in the game book.”\n“There is one green-head drake in the bag who is only wing-tipped.”\n“Good. I will take good care of him.”\n“I will go inside and see the Barone. I’ll see you later.”\n“You must get warm,” the head keeper said. “It’s been a bitter day, my Colonel.”\nThe Colonel started to walk toward the door of the house.\n“I’ll see you later,” he said to the boatman.\n“Yes, my Colonel,” the boatman said.\nAlvarito, the Barone, was standing by the open fire in the middle of the room. He smiled his shy smile and said in his low pitched voice, “I am sorry you did not have better shooting.”\n“We froze up completely. I enjoyed what there was very much.”\n“Are you very cold?”\n“Not too cold.”\n“We can have something to eat.”\n“Thank you. I’m not hungry. Have you eaten?”\n“Yes. The others went on and I let them take my car. Can you give me a lift to Latisana or just above? I can get transportation from there.”\n“Of course.”\n“It was a shame that it should freeze. The prospects were so good.”\n“There must have been a world of ducks outside.”\n“Yes. But now they won’t stay with their feed frozen over. They will be on their way south tonight.”\n“Will they all go?”\n“All except our local ducks that breed here. They’ll stay as long as there is any open water.”\n“I’m sorry for the shoot.”\n“I’m sorry you came so far for so few ducks.”\n“I always love the shoot,” the Colonel said. “And I love Venice.”\nThe Barone Alvarito looked away and spread his hands toward the fire. “Yes,” he said. “We all love Venice. Perhaps you do the best of all.”\nThe Colonel made no small talk on this but said, “I love Venice as you know.”\n“Yes. I know,” the Barone said. He looked at nothing. Then he said, “We must wake your driver.”\n“Has he eaten?”\n“Eaten and slept and eaten and slept. He has also read a little in some illustrated books he brought with him.”\n“Comic books,” the Colonel said.\n“I should learn to read them,” the Barone said. He smiled the shy, dark smile. “Could you get me some from Trieste?”\n“Any amount,” the Colonel told him. “From superman on up into the improbable. Read some for me. Look, Alvarito, what was the matter with that game-keeper who poled my boat? He seemed to have a hatred for me at the start. Pretty well through, too.”\n“It was the old battle-jacket. Allied uniform affects him that way. You see he was a bit over-liberated.”\n“Go on.”\n“When the Moroccans came through here they raped both his wife and his daughter.”\n“I think I’d better have a drink,” the Colonel said.\n“There is grappa there on the table.”",

None of the others in the boat had ever seen treeless country of the sort Charley described, but Muir pushed his team on to the mouth of Glacier Bay. “Here we made a cold camp on a desolate snow-covered beach in stormy sleet and darkness,” he wrote.

Aside from taking the rest his doctor had prescribed, Harriman seemed to have two primary goals for his summer in Alaska. He wished to return from his adventures with a trophy bear, so two taxidermists and a scout were hired to accompany the group. Harriman also, in the Carnegie-esque spirit of the age, hoped to render a philanthropic service by enabling scientists in various fields to survey the wonders of Alaska, enlarge their collections of specimens, and share their findings with an American public that had developed a passion for the natural history museums that were proliferating around the country. Merriam expanded the team to include three artists and a young photographer, Edward S. Curtis, who had guided Merriam and Grinnell to safety after they’d gotten lost while hiking on Mount Rainier in 1898. Rounding out the roster was a pair of America’s best-known authors in a genre?nature writing?that was growing in popularity as America’s wilderness vanished. One was John Burroughs, famous for his bestselling essays on birds and flowers, signed on to write the expedition’s official history.",

I knew that if I went on walking, they would only get worse, but like I said, I was sure that I wasn’t far from Curiplaya. I cut a branch from one of the trees to use as a walking stick. I put all of my weight on it as I walked. I kept looking for the landmarks Karl had described but saw no sign of them. Suddenly I realised that I didn’t have the machete with me. I wondered how I would get along without it. I remember that when I had broken off my walking stick, I had stuck it in the mud. I must have forgotten it there. I decided not to go back for it. My feet hurt so badly that retracing my own footsteps for hours seemed absurd.",

His hair was coarse, black, and thick, but he never let it grow too long. He had short dry hands, strong, and always coated deeply with chalk. When he passed near by, Eugene got the odour of chalk and of the schoolhouse: his heart grew cold with excitement and fear. The sanctity of chalk and school hovered about the man’s flesh. He was the one who could touch without being touched, beat without being beaten. Eugene had terrible fantasies of resistance, shuddering with horror as he thought of the awful consequences of fighting back: something like God’s fist in lightning. Then he looked around cautiously to see if any one had noticed.",

She before him was not the girl Grace Melbury whom he had used to know. Of course he might easily have prefigured as much; but it had never occurred to him. She was a woman who had been married; she had moved on; and without having lost her girlish modesty she had lost her girlish shyness. The inevitable change, though known to him, had not been heeded; and it struck him into a momentary fixity. The truth was that he had never come into close comradeship with her since her engagement to Fitzpiers, with the brief exception of the evening encounter under High-Stoy Hill, when she met him with his cider apparatus; and that interview had been of too cursory a kind for insight.",

During the voyage we see only the unvarying expanse of heaving green or gray, and an empty sky, and not very much of either – the horizon at sea is only twelve miles away. In other words the journey is the central thing, the expectation of what is to come; the ocean itself is merely a medium of travel. (Only a trip by air or space is more abstract, more synthetic, from the passenger’s point of view. When and if our astronauts are actually launched off to the moon or Mars through the cold black and white of space they will, I predict, be expertly drugged beforehand – how else could they endure the coffinlike confinement, the static surroundings, of such a venture?) The most appealing part of the sea, in fact, is its meeting with the land; it is the seashore which men love and not the ocean itself. (We are not writing here of the seafarer’s trade, or of the underwater world.)",

Surely there must still be some decent right-minded girls brought up in the old way . . . like Aggie Heuston, say! But Pauline’s imagination shivered away from that too . . .

Women with tubs were gutting salmon. It was a warmer day then. The sun was so fierce you looked away; you looked north. Up at the airstrip behind the town—a gravel strip, where we go now with our gear—was the Grumman canoe. It had been flown in, and cached there, long before. The helicopter, chartered by the government and coming in from who knows where, was a new five-seat twin-engine Messerschmitt with a bubble front. On its shining fuselage, yellow-and-black heraldry identified it as the property of Petroleum Helicopters, Inc. The pilot removed a couple of fibre-glass cargo doors, took out a seat, and we shoved the canoe into an opening at the rear of the cabin. It went in halfway. The Grumman was too much for the Messerschmitt. The canoe was cantilevered, protruding to the rear. We tied it in place. It was right side up, and we filled it with gear. Leaving the rest of us to wait for a second trip, Pourchot and the pilot took off for the Salmon River. With so much canoe coming out of its body, the helicopter, even in flight, seemed to be nearing the final moment of an amazing pregnancy. It went over the mountains northeast.",

    "target_paragraph": "His days and nights were now reversed. He would emerge from the bottom with the morning star or perhaps the actual sun and mount through the untended and abortive corn. He did not wash the shoes now. He would not always remove them, and he would make no fire but would eat standing from the pot of cold peas on the stove while they lasted and drank down to its dregs the pot of cold, stale coffee while it lasted, and when they were gone he would eat handsful of raw meal from the almost empty barrel. For during the first day or so he would be hungry, since what he was doing now was harder than any work he had ever done, besides the excitement, the novelty. But after that it was not new anymore, and by then he realised it could have but one ending and so it would last forever, and he stopped being hungry. He would merely rouse, wake, to tell himself, You got to eat, and eating the raw meal (presently there was nothing in the barrel but the dried cake on the sides which he would scrape off with a knife-blade) which he did not want and apparently did not even need, as if his body were living on the incorrigible singleness of his will like so much fatty tissue. Then he would lie down on the pallet bed in his overalls and shoes on which the freshest and most recent caking of mud had not even begun to dry, still chewing and with the lengthening stubble about his mouth still full of meal grains and, as though in a continuation of the lying down, plunge not into oblivion but into an eyeless and tongueless interval of resting and recuperation like a man stepping deliberately into a bath, to wake as though to an alarm clock at the same afternoon hour, the continuity unbroken between the lying down and the opening of eyes again, since it was only the body which bore and would bear the burden which needed the rest. He would build a fire in the stove then, although there was nothing to cook save the scrapings from the meal barrel. But it was the hot drink he wanted, though there was no more coffee either. So he would fill the pot with water and heat it and drink the hot water sweetened with sugar, then in the splint chair on the porch he would watch the night, the darkness, emerge from the bottom and herd, drive, the sun gradually up the slope of the corn-patch which even in dusk stood no less barren and yellow than in sunlight, and at last take the house itself. Then the hound would begin and he would sit there for perhaps ten or fifteen minutes longer, as the holder of the annual commuter’s ticket sits on his accustomed bench and continues to read his paper after the train has already whistled for the stop.",
