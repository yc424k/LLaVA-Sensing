Swordfish, which come from Arctic waters to spawn in these warm waters, are still harpooned by hand by native fishermen, as they were by Greeks before the birth of Christ. They do so in boats the like of which exists nowhere else in the world: The ontro has a steel mast over forty feet tall, on top of which is a tipsy caged platform from which the lookout man—the guardiano—spots the fish, steers the boat to it, and, with a harsh cry, alerts the fiocinatore, who spears his catch with a ten-foot-long harpoon from a catwalk or extended bowsprit called a passerella, which is nearly twice the length of the boat itself. Six men are required to heave one swordfish—usually two swordfish, because they tend to travel in pairs—onto the boat. Landed, the huge fish, which has an element of the ridiculous (imagine five hundred pounds of slippery flesh culminating in a three-foot swordlike bill), is carried on the heads of the women of Bagnara—the Bagnorote— to the market.",

They shelled peas, sifted rice and cut carrots in the doorway of their room; they cooked in the broom cupboard below the steps and washed their pots and pans at the garden tap; they turned part of the new turf to mud. Others threw their rubbish on the lawn; others spread their washing on the lawn. And I believed that the idyll was at an end when Aziz announced one day, with a well-managed mixture of enthusiasm and condolence, that twenty orthodox Indians were coming to the hotel for four days. Some would sleep in the dining-room; we would eat in the sitting-room. I was beyond condolence. Aziz recognized this and offered none. We waited. Aziz became morose, almost offended, in our presence. But the twenty did not turn up; and then for a day or two Aziz looked genuinely offended.",

    "target_paragraph": "In the fading light, I drove almost randomly around north-east Iowa. Every couple of miles I would pass a farmer on a tractor juddering along the highway, heading home to dinner on one of the sprawling farms up in these sheltered hills above the Mississippi. It was Friday, one of the big days of the farmer’s week. He would wash his arms and neck and sit down with his family to a table covered with great bowls of food. They would say grace together. After dinner the family would drive into Hooterville and sit out in the cold October air and through their steamy breath watch the Hooterville High Blue Devils beat Kraut City 28–7 at football. The farmer’s son, Merle Jr, would score three of the touchdowns. Afterwards Merle senior would go to Ed’s Tavern to celebrate (two beers, never more) and receive the admiration of the community for his son’s prowess. Then it would be home to bed and up early in the frosty dawn to go out hunting for deer with his best friends, Ed and Art and Wally, trudging across the fallow fields, savouring the clean air and the companionship. I was seized with a huge envy for these people and their unassuming lives. It must be wonderful to live in a safe and timeless place, where you know everyone and everyone knows you, and you can all count on each other. I envied them their sense of community, their football games, their bring-and-bake sales, their church socials. And I felt guilty for mocking them. They were good people.",

    "target_paragraph": "“Your uncle, the grand-vicar of the cathedral, has just turned under the gate,” observed Decoud. “He said Mass for the troops in the Plaza this morning. They had built for him an altar of drums, you know. And they brought outside all the painted blocks to take the air. All the wooden saints stood militarily in a row at the top of the great flight of steps. They looked like a gorgeous escort attending the Vicar-General. I saw the great function from the windows of the Porvenir. He is amazing, your uncle, the last of the Corbelàns. He glittered exceedingly in his vestments with a great crimson velvet cross down his back. And all the time our saviour Barrios sat in the Amarilla Club drinking punch at an open window. Esprit fort—our Barrios. I expected every moment your uncle to launch an excommunication there and then at the black eye-patch in the window across the Plaza. But not at all. Ultimately the troops marched off. Later Barrios came down with some of the officers, and stood with his uniform all unbuttoned, discoursing at the edge of the pavement. Suddenly your uncle appeared, no longer glittering, but all black, at the cathedral door with that threatening aspect he has—you know, like a sort of avenging spirit. He gives one look, strides over straight at the group of uniforms, and leads away the general by the elbow. He walked him for a quarter of an hour in the shade of a wall. Never let go his elbow for a moment, talking all the time with exaltation, and gesticulating with a long black arm. It was a curious scene. The officers seemed struck with astonishment. Remarkable man, your missionary uncle. He hates an infidel much less than a heretic, and prefers a heathen many times to an infidel. He condescends graciously to call me a heathen, sometimes, you know.”",

At Three Mile Cross Flush had mixed impartially with tap-room dogs and the Squire’s greyhounds; he had known no difference between the tinker’s dog and himself. Indeed it is probable that the mother of his child, though by courtesy called Spaniel, was nothing but a mongrel, eared in one way, tailed in another. But the dogs of London, Flush soon discovered, are strictly divided into different classes. Some are chained dogs; some run wild. Some take their airings in carriages and drink from purple jars; others are unkempt and uncollared and pick up a living in the gutter. Dogs therefore, Flush began to suspect, differ; some are high, others low; and his suspicions were confirmed by snatches of talk held in passing with the dogs of Wimpole Street. ‘See that scallywag? A mere mongrel! … By gad, that’s a fine Spaniel. One of the best blood in Britain! … Pity his ears aren’t a shade more curly … There’s a topknot for you!’",

Here, then, stood a grandiose edifice, slightly curved so as to follow the natural crescent of the island, with its larger facades fronting east and west. The nameless Siren-worshipper who designed this lordly pleasure-house had studied local conditions of landscape and ventilation; the site could not have been more happily chosen. In the hottest days of midsummer a sea-breeze rustled through those ample halls, and his view was superb, whether, in early morning, he let his eye wander over leagues of violet sea-calm towards Pzestum and the shapely peak of Alburno that fades into mist as the sun gains strength, or glanced westwards into the chaos of rocks and many-hued waters at his feet, with Capri and lerate in the background, shutting out the world beyond.",

Accordingly we drove past the two Baabe hotels, little wooden houses built on the roadside facing the line, with the station immediately opposite their windows. A train was nearly due, and intending passengers were sitting in front of the hotels drinking beer while they waited, and various conveyances had stopped there on their way to Göhren or Sellin, and the Lonely One seemed a very noisy, busy one to me as we rattled by over the stones, and I was glad to turn off to the left at a sign-post pointing towards Göhren and get on to the deep, sandy, silent forest roads.",

He wriggles his hands (paws?) through my pile of food until he gets hold of a banana and a tug-of-war commences.

He ultimately wins and I scold him but can’t stop laughing as I continue down the trail to the house. I guess I’ll be making four-banana bread instead of five!",

It was freezing cold and the diversions were icebergs, a morning of splendidly snafu manoeuvres, evasive action against submarines, the air rent by curses, and gunnery practice, nice and noisy. Fog shrouded us most of the way. The Captain was worried about day and night fog, his cargo and the risk of collision with Liberty ships which he regarded as more dangerous than submarines, saying angrily, “They try to handle them like a taxi.” I didn’t understand enough to be worried about anything and thought it a pleasant interesting trip though not a barrel of fun, rather lacking in excitement. I kept skimpy notes, the last one is: “The voyage has been a fine rest cure.”",

The steep slope is no longer grassy but concreted over and used as a litter dump. King Chao Anou built this wat in the nineteenth century; it was restored in the 1950s and enlarged in the 1970s when the monks’ quarters were much extended to form what closely resembles a row of whitewashed stables. From a distance the that looks quite elegant; seen close up, less so. The sim’s interior was bare but for the Lord Buddha gazing down at a mountain of tawdry tinselly offerings and bowls of rice and pieces of fruit and sticks of incense. One monk sat in a corner intently counting money – a lot of money. On the edge of the compound, under an ancient bodhi tree (planted in the tenth century?) a pile of rocks supports a giant statue of the Lord Buddha, sheltered by a tin roof. This, to me, was Wat Sikhotabun’s most sacred spot.",

As they stood on the pavement, Harney pale with the heat, and even Charity a little confused by it, a young man drove by in an electric run-about with a calico band bearing the words: “Ten dollars to take you round the Lake.” Before Charity knew what was happening, Harney had waved a hand, and they were climbing in. “Say, for twenny-five I’ll run you out to see the ball-game and back,” the driver proposed with an insinuating grin; but Charity said quickly: “Oh, I’d rather go rowing on the Lake.” The street was so thronged that progress was slow; but the glory of sitting in the little carriage while it wriggled its way between laden omnibuses and trolleys made the moments seem too short. “Next turn is Lake Avenue,” the young man called out over his shoulder; and as they paused in the wake of a big omnibus groaning with Knights of Pythias in cocked hats and swords, Charity looked up and saw on the corner a brick house with a conspicuous black and gold sign across its front. “Dr. Merkle; Private Consultations at all hours. Lady Attendants,” she read; and suddenly she remembered Ally Hawes’s words: “The house was at the corner of Wing Street and Lake Avenue…there’s a big black sign across the front….” Through all the heat and the rapture a shiver of cold ran over her.",

Then, distantly, sails of black rain came into view out to sea, and moved inland. Ghosts of longboats. The air the storm drove before it smelt salty and wet. The sea became quiet, its movements curved and gluey. Long compact waves rose foamlessly up and over the rocks at the base of the cliffs above which I walked. As the black sails reached the shore, I heard the fizz of rain on sea: rods of water driving down into planes of water.",

This hotel is built on a 1,000-foot cliff rising sheer from the valley floor and across the valley, distinct in the brilliant, early sunshine, I saw a 120-foot-high statue of the Lord Buddha standing, as it has stood for over 2,000 years, in a gigantic alcove in the golden sandstone mountain – both alcove and statue having been carved with extraordinary skill out of the rock. The whole face of this mountain is pitted with the caves of Buddhist monks and another, eighty-foot, statue stands about a quarter of a mile east of the giant one. Quite apart from this unique spectacle the valley itself is superbly beautiful; a depression in the centre of the mountains, fertile and neatly tilled, dotted with tiny villages and criss-crossed with lines of silver-barked sinjit trees, whose diminutive rosy buds were glowing softly in the early light. Even though I was mentally prepared for those Buddhas the impact was tremendous when I actually saw them presiding impassively over the valley.",

The social life of Santa Marina was carried on almost entirely by lamp-light, which the warmth of the nights and the scents culled from flowers made pleasant enough. The young women, with their hair magnificently swept in coils, a red flower behind the ear, sat on the doorsteps, or issued out on to balconies, while the young men ranged up and down beneath, shouting up a greeting from time to time and stopping here and there to enter into amorous talk. At the open windows merchants could be seen making up the day’s account, and older women lifting jars from shelf to shelf. The streets were full of people, men for the most part, who interchanged their views of the world as they walked, or gathered round the wine-tables at the street corner, where an old cripple was twanging his guitar strings, while a poor girl cried her passionate song in the gutter. The two Englishwomen excited some friendly curiosity, but no one molested them.",

The three of them, in fact, shared one quality in common: they were all magpies. And travelling about as they all did they were able to indulge their taste, and bring back to Cyprus a bewildering medley of objects, from Egyptian musarabiyas to Turkish mosque-lamps. They were steadily stripping the Arab world of its chief treasures, as Pearce said, and soon their houses in Cyprus would have everything, except the mosaics of St Sophia. My own ambitions were more hedge-hopping and my means forbade me to indulge in such delightful fantasies – happily perhaps. But I enjoyed these treasures vicariously, so to speak, and appreciated nothing more than one of the great palavers which went on when one or other of the friends had arrived back in Cyprus with something exotic – Persian tiles, Indian fabrics, a Kuwait chest, or simply perhaps the design for a window or door triumphantly stolen from Fez, Algiers or Istamboul. Its position in her house which as yet did not exist, was a subject of the most earnest, heart-warming debate.",

They’d have to wait until the weather cleared. He kept pouring warm milk down Mamen, pressing the tin cup to his lips and tipping it back, urging him to drink as he would a child. Mamen appreciated the gesture, nodding thanks and sipping the sweet liquid. He wanted badly to leave this place of death and prayed the milk would give him the strength to make it at least to Skeleton Island, if not all the way to Icy Spit. Anywhere but here. The thought of Malloch’s dead body so near gave him chills. He could neither eat nor sleep. “I don’t get a moment’s peace as long as I am here,” he wrote in his diary, conjuring the geologist in his death trance. “Malloch and his staring eyes are continuously before me.”",

There was a large cross behind it, and in front someone had put a bunch of fresh flowers in a tarnished silver vase. A fisherman told me later that the memorial had been erected to honour the dead of the Itata, which sank in the bay in 1922. Seventy crewmen made it to shore, but they died later, of dehydration. Nothing grew on that arid peninsula. At the windy coast skull-and-crossbone flags flapped from one or two antediluvian shacks. When I asked a crone sitting on the sand sewing up a net what these flags meant she said they were from the time when pirates were frequent visitors, adding darkly that many of them had been British.",

He echoed it because certain inflexions of her voice were always laughter-provoking to him, and he would have thought anything funny if her eyes and her dimple had told him it was. But in reality he did think the bust queer, and had never understood why Rebecca had given him a swollen throat, and big lumps on his forehead, as if he’d been in a fight and got the worst of it. And he remembered too, with a pang, the colossal photograph which Grandma Scrimser had had made of Grandpa after his death, with the hyacinthine curls and low-necked collar of his prime, a photograph which the family had all thought so “speaking” that even Mrs. Weston dared not grumble at the expense. . . . Still, Vance, since then, had had a glimpse of other standards, and as he studied through Halo’s eyes the rough clay head with tumbled hair and heavy brooding forehead he began to see that under her surface mannerisms Rebecca Stram had reached down to his inner self, that the image seemed, as Halo said, to body forth what he was trying to be.",

One moment, I’m staring at a rumbling puma, thinking there is nothing in this world that would make me go past her. The next, it’s done and I’m looking back, faintly touching my thigh where her fur has brushed my side. Then we’re running. I’m running. I see a flash of blue sky, a blur of green, but mostly all I can think about is Jane’s grip on my arm. Moving, not stopping and not breaking an ankle, running. Blood rushes to my ears and my lungs feel as if they’re about to pop. I can’t hear Wayra but I can hear Oscar and he’s behind me, crashing down the trail. Somewhere, between me and him, is her.",

    "target_paragraph": "I throw off my covers and feel the cold morning breeze on my skin. With my sheath knife, I carefully cut a slit through the top lip, foam tongue, and bottom lip of the tear. I break the tines off of the fork and slip the handle through the slit so that it sticks out of both sides like a bone through a cannibal’s nose. Conveniently, there are two holes in the handle, just to the top and bottom of the lips. I can lash across the patch and through the holes to keep the handle snugly in position. The line that I wind behind the handle cannot be forced off unless the handle breaks. First I use a light line to grab the middle of the lips and pinch them tight onto the tongue. Then I coil the thicker line around until it winds the lips back into a pucker and ultimately encloses the outside edges of the mouth. I know this thicker line is not effective in making the patch airtight. Its only purpose is to lie smoothly next to itself and pucker the lips. For the final seal, I loop a tourniquet behind the coil of thicker rope and wring it tight. The thicker rope will keep the tourniquet from rolling off the edges of the mouth when the tube is inflated.",
