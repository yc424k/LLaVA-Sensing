We were in the best place we’d likely be for a long time (for doing boat work) so rationalized that we should now do anything that might conceivably need doing anytime in the near future.

The stairwell descended into a maze of souvenir stands hawking everything from kites and pocketknives to sun visors and T-shirts—each branded somehow with Mao. Red Guards’ fists formed the hands of alarm clocks; Mao-shaped music boxes played “The East Is Red.” Photographs depicted the Helmsman at every stage of his life, including his current one.

I move on quickly, to gain altitude before the sun softens the snow, crossing a stream of icy boulders, climbing on. The trail made by the Tarakots and Jang-bu is easy to follow in the snow, and the high pack protects my brains from the rising sun, and my boots crunch reassuringly upon the crust. Soon the track enters the long white valley that rises to Jang La. How strange it seems that the blue sky is so much darker than the mountains! This morning the moon is centered in a crescent between the white peaks, off to the south. A neat fox foot trails snow-cock prints to three pools like black mirrors. The ice-free pools are springs of a stream that flows away under the snow and falls over a cliff into the Saure.",

When they were about fifty yards from the house the woman stopped and turned and jerked Temple up to her, and gripping her by the shoulders, their faces close together, she cursed Temple in a whisper, a sound no louder than a sigh and filled with fury. Then she flung her away and they went on. They entered the hallway. It was pitch dark. Temple heard the woman fumbling at the wall. A door creaked open; the woman took her arm and guided her up a single step into a floored room where she could feel walls and smell a faint, dusty odor of grain, and closed the door behind them. As she did so something rushed invisibly nearby in a scurrying scrabble, a dying whisper of fairy feet. Temple whirled, treading on something that rolled under her foot, and sprang toward the woman.",

After breakfast we set off on foot to follow an interesting little path around the flank of the nearby outcrop mountain, but it soon proved too interesting to be wholesome. It was about eighteen inches wide, covered with frozen snow and directly overhanging the Shyok. As we turned to retreat we found the way blocked by a dozen goats who showed no inclination to move politely aside; both above and below this apology for a path the cliff face was unattractive, even by goatish standards. However, the drop into the Shyok was scarcely thirty feet, and no rocks were visible, so our chances of survival seemed quite good. Then the goatherd appeared, a cretinous-looking youth with feet bound in leather thongs. He shouted angrily, whether at us or at his animals was not clear to me. But the goats took it personally and came straight towards us. I seized Rachel and forced her into a providential crevice I had just noticed in the rock face. Then I spreadeagled myself against the cliff and hoped for the best. As the goats passed, one young male – probably unnerved by our strange smell – did go over the edge, to the youth’s fury. But having been swept twenty yards downstream he was able to scramble out more easily than we could have done.",

Flashing her needles, glancing round about her, out of the window, into the room, at James himself, she assured him, beyond a shadow of a doubt, by her laugh, her poise, her competence (as a nurse carrying a light across a dark room assures a fractious child), that it was real; the house was full; the garden blowing. If he put implicit faith in her, nothing should hurt him; however deep he buried himself or climbed high, not for a second should he find himself without her. So boasting of her capacity to surround and protect, there was scarcely a shell of herself left for her to know herself by; all was so lavished and spent; and James, as he stood stiff between her knees, felt her rise in a rosy-flowered fruit tree laid with leaves and dancing boughs into which the beak of brass, the arid scimitar of his father, the egotistical man, plunged and smote, demanding sympathy.",

He gazed at her forehead–so candid, with something dove-like about it, with something extraordinarily good, and reassuring, and infinitely kind, but with faint lines on it as though she were worried. And then her grey eyes, beautifully spaced, very light grey with long dark eyelashes, had a pathetic look in them of having been crying. He hadn’t noticed that before. At the theatre they had shone. He hoped she hadn’t been crying, and wasn’t worried, and that her laughing now wasn’t only being put on for him, for the visitor.",

The holy man sat in a chair below the awning. From time to time women, as though unable to hold themselves in any longer, ran to the holy man and flung themselves before his chair. The holy man barely acknowledged them. But most of the pilgrims simply sat and stared. He was, in truth, finer than any of his admirers. His saffron robe revealed a well-built body of a smooth, warm brown; there was no touch of sensuality in his firm, regular face, which might have been that of a business executive.",

Port Sunlight was lovely, a proper little garden community, even cheerier in aspect than the huddled stone cottages of Saltaire. This had open green spaces and a pub and pretty little houses half hidden behind drifts of foliage. There wasn’t a soul about and nothing seemed to be open—neither the shops nor the pub nor the heritage center nor the Lady Lever Art Gallery, all of which was a bit of a pisser after the effort I’d taken to get there—but I made the best of things by having a long slog around the rainy streets. I was surprised to see a factory still there, still churning out soap as far as I could tell, and then I realized that I had exhausted all that Port Sunlight had to offer on a rainy Saturday out of season, so I trudged back to the bus stop where I had so recently alighted and waited an hour and a quarter in a driving rain for a bus onward to Hooton, which was even less fun than it sounds.",

I wanted to vacuum, but was frightened of what a vacuum might uncover. The next bubonic plague was likely hibernating inside my seat cushion. Through the back exit, I could see the greenish gray Ganges, the sacred river of India that snaked through that town. It was moving at a clip.

To avoid being rolled by the unsavory characters who rule the streets and freeway overpasses where he slept, he learned to bury what money he had before entering a city, then recover it on the way out of town. On February 3, according to his journal, McCandless went to Los Angeles “to get a ID and a job but feels extremely uncomfortable in society now and must return to road immediately.”",

Certainly modern man (anatomically modern man, Homo sapiens) has been roaming the Karoo for at least 100,000 years. Ten thousand years ago the San were in situ and for some 8,000 years remained Southern Africa’s only human inhabitants. When the pastoral Khoikhoi moved down from what is now northern Botswana there was space enough for both tribes. But then a white tribe arrived and, although the Khoikhoi at first showed willing to share grazing lands, Whitey wasn’t interested in sharing. He wanted to possess.",

We discussed the driftwood, tried to imagine the story of each stick or shard; where it had floated from, which river had washed it down to which sea. Roger could tell the wood-type of each curled or flattened piece: a waterlogged oak plank; an ash shard that had the brittle texture of cuttlefish bone; even a rare spiralling cherry bough, weathered to a silky silver-grey, like the handle of a well-used implement.",

We’ll drink vodka and get drunk.” The guy was big, large bellied, bristly haired, and his T-shirt said, in English, KALASHNIKOV: THE GREATEST HITS.

    "target_paragraph": "‘A mountain has an inside,’ Shepherd had written. It is a superbly counter-intuitive proposition, for we customarily imagine mountains in terms of their external surfaces and outward-facing forms: cliffs, plateaux, pinnacles, ridges and scarps. But mountains are also defined by their interiors: their corries, caves, hollows and valleys, and by the depths of their rivers, lochs and lochans. Once our eyes have learnt to see that mountains are composed of absent space as well as massy presence, then we might also come to imagine walking not ‘up’ a mountain but ‘into’ a mountain. Shepherd was always looking into the mountain landscape; again and again she pries through surfaces: into cracks in rocks, into the luminous interior of lochs or rivers. She stepped naked into the shallows of Loch Avon, she poked fingers down mouse-holes into the snowpack, and she recalled how as a child she would play in waterfall-pools by ‘pitching into them the tiniest white stones I can find, and watching through the appreciable time they take to sway downwards to the bottom’. ‘Into’, in The Living Mountain, is a preposition that gains – by means of repeated use – the power of a verb. She went into the mountains searching not for the great outdoors but instead for profound ‘interiors’, deep ‘recesses’.",

The walls were decorated with fans of Ottoman daggers and muskets, mounted fragments of Byzantine mosaic and fine Turkish kilims. Along the side of the room were lines of chairs, enough to sit maybe thirty or forty retainers coming to pay their respect to their feudal lord.",

By then my stomach churned in fits and starts; and the hot, dry air triggered my asthma. I hadn’t had an attack in years, and I didn’t bring an inhaler. I needed to rest, but Teresa would not have it. She paced across the room, tore open the patio doors, and pointed to the horizon. I should have confessed my ailments, but I couldn’t disappoint her again, not after Lisbon. Instead, I swallowed a handful of antacids and aspirin and washed them down with a glass of lukewarm tap water. “OK,” I said, “let’s go see the pyramids.”",
