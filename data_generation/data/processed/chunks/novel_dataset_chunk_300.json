    "target_paragraph": "MY LAST NIGHT in Leningrad, Michael and Josh and their American guide, who Michael assured me was CIA, met for a walk along the canals. I promised I’d show them the house where Raskolnikov killed the pawnbroker and her niece, but as we moved along the canal, all the houses looked the same. It could have happened here, I said, or here. It could have happened anywhere, in any house. Realizing I had failed in my mission, I offered to introduce them to Vladimir, whose apartment didn’t seem that far away.\nIt was eleven-thirty when we called, but Vladimir told me he doesn’t sleep on White Nights and he invited us up. This time he took out a bottle of wine and poured drinks all around. Then he began to tell his story again, the same story he told me the day before, the same details. The co-conspirator charges, losing his job, the documentary, the persecution of his children. Everything. Indeed, he was Dostoyevskian in his suffering, which did seem monumental. He was compelled to repeat his story over and over again. “Visa” we said as we toasted; “visa,” we raised our glasses dozens of times.\nWhen we left, it was two in the morning and broad daylight. The medical students walked me back toward my hotel, but then I invited them to the bar where I’d gone my first night in Leningrad. The Finnish men had gone back to Finland and now the bar was filled with tired prostitutes, makeup faded or running down their eyes, stockings torn, like the wicked stepsisters after the ball.\nThis was no longer pick of the crop. The beautiful women, the impeccably dressed, the women who could model anywhere in the world, were asleep, having completed their weekend’s work. In the morning they’d return to their jobs at desks where they sharpened pencils, filed their nails while sitting in the steno pool. What’s left here were the derelicts. The fat ones, the ugly ones. The ones nobody wanted. Discarded and sad. I walked in with three men and all the women at the bar perked up like deer at the scent of the hunter and stared at me with envy and disgust. I could see their minds doing a quick calculation of how much I would make that night.\nWe had not been sitting down long when a young woman came over. She introduced herself as Veronica and pulled up a chair next to Michael, who was still moaning for his girlfriend back home. Veronica had a wedding ring on. She pointed to the ring and said she was married to a Finn. “But he never visits,” she complained. “I never see him.” She ran her hand over Michael’s knee and he pushed her away. “I want a man,” she said. “You have three and I have none. Can’t I have one?” Veronica pleaded with me. “Just one.” She put her head down on the table and sobbed, “Just give me one.”\nThe next morning as I was leaving, a man helped me get my suitcase into the elevator. I thanked him in Russian. Then he asked me in broken English if he could buy my underwear. “My girlfriend likes American underwear.” I told him I was wearing my underwear and what I was not wearing, I needed. He thanked me anyway, somewhat sadly, then helped me again with my suitcase as we reached the ground floor.",

These were plump, big boletes, the smaller ones a clean mushroom-white on top and the larger ones as brown as a perfectly baked loaf of bread. Once I had noticed them, I realized that this place was in fact a boletes bonanza, like an Easter-egg hunt for three-year-olds, with the prizes barely hidden at all. I took off my baseball cap, filled it with boletes, and then began to put them in my pockets. Russians love wild mushrooms, and boletes often are edible, even tasty. I thought I’d present these to the residents of the fish camp cabin who were to be our hosts. Picking up a boletus bigger than any I’d seen in my life, I hurried back across the tundra to the cabin. Everyone in our party had gone in there to drink tea and vodka and get warm. I walked in—the small room was lantern lit, fogged with coal smoke, and crowded by a propane stove, a sleeping platform, and benches along the walls—and presented my mushrooms to the pregnant young Yupik woman standing by the stove. She took one look at them and laughed and said, “Starii,” which means “old.” I examined the mushrooms more closely and saw that they were indeed completely soggy from the recent rains, and starting to decay.",

In the morning he had the flagons brought to him. All were frozen solid except for the one stoppered with black fox fur. He thus learned which fur was warmest and driest.\n\nMas‘ūdī (1894), 63",

Measured in square miles, the country is not especially large. On a globe it looks like a swollen California. Within that space, though, are twenty-thousand-foot peaks, the world’s deepest canyon (twice as deep as the Grand Canyon), unmapped Amazon jungle and the driest desert on earth. Peru is an equatorial country that depends on glaciers for drinking water. It’s one of the world’s hot spots for seismic and volcanic activity. (Both Lima and Cusco have been leveled by earthquakes; the country’s second-largest city, Arequipa, sits beneath a smoking peak that could blow its top at any time.) Scientists have calculated that there are thirty-four types of climatic zones on the face of the earth. Peru has twenty of them. “In Inca Land one may pass from glaciers to tree ferns within a few hours,” Bingham wrote, still astonished years after arriving. I was about to see for myself.",

His parents, who made aliyah from Miami before he was born, deplored his activism. After several coffees (Saladin Street is in a ‘dry’ zone), he proposed a tour of East Jerusalem on the morrow, ending in Sheikh Jarrah where friends of his ran a rudimentary medical centre provided in 1993 by the Jerusalem Foundation. This group’s foreign donors usually fund only Jewish projects but Mayor Kollek had persuaded them to spare a little for Arabs – ‘in Israel’s interest’.",

The officials were given plenty of money and a free hand to organise the campaign. All the monks in Tibet were ordered to attend public services at which the Kangyur, the Tibetan Bible, was to be read aloud. New prayer-flags and prayer-wheels were set up everywhere. Rare and powerful amulets were brought out of old chests. Offerings were doubled and on all the mountains incense-fires burned, while the winds, turning the prayer-wheels, carried supplications to the protecting deities in all the corners of heaven. The people believed with rocklike faith that the power of religion would suffice to protect their independence. In the meantime Radio Peking was already sending out messages in Tibetan promising that Tibet would soon be freed.",

(I expect people in New York suffer similar terrors when you mention words like cornfields and county fair.) Lake Ahquabi, where I did all my formative swimming and sunburning, may not have the romance of Cape Cod or the grandeur of the rockribbed coast of Maine, but then neither did it grab you by the legs and carry you off helplessly to Newfoundland. No, you may keep the sea, as far as I am concerned, and every drop of water in it.",

There is something wonderful and slightly mad about waiters dressed in formal black and white under a blazing sun. It is no accident that al fresco, the term we use for eating or drinking outdoors, is taken from the Italian; Italian food is well suited for outdoor consumption, and the Italian temperament is uniquely qualified to enjoy the processional.",

With the gathering force of an essential thing realizing itself out of early ground, I faced in myself a passionate and tenacious longing—to put away thought forever, and all the trouble it brings, all but the nearest desire, direct and searching. To take the trail and not look back. Whether on foot, on showshoes or by sled, into the summer hills and their late freezing shadows—a high blaze, a runner track in the snow would show where I had gone.

And he had known the years of brown, dark lavish brown, the lost and hypocritical years, the thunder of the wheels and hooves upon the cobbles, the colour of bright blood – the savagery, the hunger and the fear.",

Here on the edge of the Bering Strait, five thousand miles from Moscow, almost within wafting distance of the U.S.A., the Russia-smell is exactly the same! I breathed it deeply. Yes, it was all there—the tea bags, the cucumber peels, the wet cement, the chilly air, the currant jam. About the only point of similarity between this smell and the one I’d just left in Nome was the overtone of diesel exhaust. But, still fresh from America, I understood that America’s essential smell is nothing at all like Russia’s. America smells like gift shop candles, fried food, new cars. America’s is the smell of commerce. The smell of Alaska that stays with me the strongest is that of the Cinnabon sweet rolls shop in the Anchorage airport; I’m sure the scent of Cinnabon is set adrift everywhere in that space intentionally, in order to ensnare passersby. The smell of America says, “Come in and buy.” The smell of Russia says, “Ladies and gentlemen: Russia!”",

So I guess Florence had not found getting married to me a very stimulating process. I had not found anything much more inspiring to say than how glad I was, with variations. I think I was too dazed. Well, the Hurlbirds were too dazed to say much. We had breakfast together, and then Florence went to pack her grips and things. Old Hurlbird took the opportunity to read me a full-blooded lecture, in the style of an American oration, as to the perils for young American girlhood lurking in the European jungle. He said that Paris was full of snakes in the grass, of which he had had bitter experience. He concluded, as they always do, poor, dear old things, with the aspiration that all American women should one day be sexless—though that is not the way they put it. …",

    "target_paragraph": "It is a curious fact, of which I can think of no satisfactory explanation, that enthusiasm for country life and love of natural scenery are strongest and most widely diffused precisely in those European countries which have the worst climate and where the search for the picturesque involves the greatest discomfort. Nature worship increases in an exact ratio with distance from the Mediterranean. The Italians and the Spanish have next to no interest in nature for its own sake. The French feel a certain affection for the country, but not enough to make them desire to live in it if they can possibly inhabit the town. The south Germans and Swiss form an apparent exception to the rule. They live nearer to the Mediterranean than the Parisians, and yet they are fonder of the country. But the exception, as I have said, is only apparent; for owing to their remoteness from the ocean and the mountainous conformation of the land, these people enjoy for a large part of each year a climate that is, to all intents, arctic. In England, where the climate is detestable, we love the country so much that we are prepared, for the privilege of living in it, to get up at seven, summer and winter, bicycle, wet or fine, to a distant station and make an hour’s journey to our place of labour. In our spare moments we go for walking tours, and we regard caravanning as a pleasure. In Holland the climate is far more unpleasant than in England and we should consequently expect the Dutch to be even keener country-fanciers than ourselves. The ubiquitous water makes it difficult, however, for season ticket holders to settle down casually in the Dutch country-side. But if unsuitable as building land, the soggy meadows of the Low Countries are firm enough to carry tents. Unable to live permanently in the country, the Dutch are the greatest campers in the world. Poor Uncle Toby, when he was campaigning in those parts, found the damp so penetrating, that he was forced to burn good brandy in his tent to dry the air. But then my Uncle Toby was a mere Englishman, brought up in a climate which, compared with that of Holland, is balmy. The hardier Dutch camp out for pleasure. Of Northern Germany it is enough to say that it is the home of the Wander-Birds. And as for Scandinavia—it is well known that there is no part of the world, excluding the tropics, where people so freely divest themselves of their clothing. The Swedish passion for nature is so strong that it can only be adequately expressed when in a state of nature. “As souls unbodied,” says Donne, “bodies unclothed must be to taste whole joys.” Noble, nude and far more modern than any other people in Europe, they sport in the icy waters of the Baltic, they roam naked in the primeval forest. The cautious Italian, meanwhile, bathes in his tepid sea during only two months out of the twelve; always wears a vest under his shirt and never leaves the town, if he can possibly help it, except when the summer is at its most hellish, and again, for a little while, in the autumn, to superintend the making of his wine.",
