The constant worry of being detected, occasional pangs of hunger and thirst, the physical effort of digging ourselves out of sand dunes, the day-time heat and the extreme night-time cold, all these different strains began to take their toll. Particularly unpleasant was the aggressive old man with whom we shared our coal slag. Our relationship got off to a bad start on the first day when, during a mid-morning cay stop, I blew my nose in his presence. For this unforgivable faux pas I earned myself a violent torrent of abuse. It appears that my crime was twofold: firstly blowing my nose while he was drinking, secondly using a handkerchief. Apparently polite Uigur etiquette demands that one walks away from any imbibing company, raises one’s left hand to the ridge of one’s nose and blows heartily through the nostrils, aiming to discharge the deposit onto the ground. Any overhang should then be wiped away, and the hand then cleaned on the shirt front. This was certainly how the old man approached the problem. It was on this same cay stop that my false front tooth finally fell out. This had a disproportionately lowering effect on my morale. It was now four days since my razor blades had been stolen and the combination of an unshaven yet unbearded face, a weatherworn visage and a gap-toothed smile was clearly an unpleasant one. It was several days before I next saw a mirror and was able to take in the full horror of it myself, but its effects on those around me was immediately obvious. It was about this time that little Uigur children began running away from me, screaming and shrieking for their parents.",

The Pizza Hut at the gates was full of undergraduates lounging around, making eyes at each other and spooning mountains of ice-cream into each other’s mouths. Noticeboards in the porter’s lodge advertised student raves alongside the rather more staid option of a forthcoming piano recital.

They do not worship anything, but call their great men ‘Lords’.36 When one of them asks his leader’s advice on something, he says: ‘Lord, what should I do about this or that matter?’",

It was not long before all of us, including Clito himself and the policemen, were splendidly tipsy. Frangos sat down in the traditional Cypriot fashion upon five chairs, one for the rump and one for each member, and taunted Clito into a few rather unsteady dance-steps. I obliged with a rendering of the ‘Forty Palikars’ which met with great approval. The policemen giggled.",

All around, the hillsides were hard and dry: compressed beds of geological strata rolled off in great undulating contortions into the distance; there was no tree, and barely a blade of grass visible in the whole great panorama. As I descended into the wadi, however, the path turned a corner, and far below, at the lowest point in the valley, there appeared a small oasis: a patch of the densest woodland made up of ferns, pines and palms. From where I was standing I could not see the spring itself, but I could clearly hear it. The distant sound of the running water filled the silence of the wadi, echoed and amplified as it bounced off the walls of the ravine. It was an unseasonably hot day, and I shouldered my pack and stumbled down the path towards the sound.",

How long he must have lived out of the world, on his engineering jobs, first in the Argentine, then in Australia, and since the war in Egypt—how out of step he must have become with the old social dance of New York, not to situate Cliffe Wheater at once as the big red-faced Chicagoan who was at Harvard with him, and who had since become one of the showiest of New York millionaires. Cliffe Wheater, of course—the kind of fellow who was spoken of, respectfully, as having “interests” everywhere: Boyne recalled having run across Wheater “interests” even in the Argentine. But the man himself, at any rate since his-marriage, was reputed to be mainly interested in Ritz Hotels and powerful motorcars. Hadn’t he a steam-yacht too? He had a wife, at any rate—it was all coming back to Boyne: he had married, it must be sixteen or seventeen years ago, that good-looking Mervin girl, of New York—Joyce Mervin—whom Boyne himself had danced and flirted with through a remote winter not long after Harvard. Joyce Mervin: she had written to him to announce her engagement, had enclosed a little snap-shot of herself with “Goodbye, Martin,” scrawled across it. Had she rather fancied Boyne—Boyne wondered? He had been too poor to try to find out . . . And now he and she were going to be deck-neighbours for a fortnight on the magic seas between Algiers and Venice! He remembered the face he had contemplated that morning in his shaving-glass, and thought: “Very likely she hasn’t changed a bit; smart women last so wonderfully; but she won’t know me.” The idea was half depressing and half reassuring. After all, it would enable him to take his observations—and to have his deck-chair moved, should the result be disappointing.",

Indeed, parts of the city look as if London had been transplanted into a tropical landscape and left to moulder for a century or two. Down near the docks are the British law courts with their imposing white Doric columns. The courts are still used for legal proceedings, and civil servants wearing sparkling white shirts tucked into thick silk longyi hurry between buildings, swinging faux-leather briefcases. Statues of lions, their lips garishly slathered with scarlet paint, gaze down from the roof of the old telegraph building. Above the entrance of the former British department store Rowe & Co. is a blank clock face, intricately bound in iron fretwork. The narrow alleyways that run behind Rangoon’s main roads are lined with colonial-era shop-houses. Through the doorways you can glimpse steep wooden staircases twisting upward into dark stairwells. Livid green moss grows along cracks in the plastered walls, and ferns sprout from the disintegrating stone pediments.",

That was because she had a sympathetic and delightful voice, due entirely to some special formation of her throat and the roof of her mouth, and having nothing whatever to do with what she was feeling. Nobody in consequence ever believed they were being snubbed. It was most tiresome. And if she stared icily it did not look icy at all, because her eyes, lovely to begin with, had the added loveliness of very long, soft, dark eyelashes. No icy stare could come out of eyes like that; it got caught and lost in the soft eyelashes, and the persons stared at merely thought they were being regarded with a flattering and exquisite attentiveness. And if ever she was out of humour or definitely cross— and who would not be sometimes in such a world?—-she only looked so pathetic that people all rushed to comfort her, if possible by means of kissing. It was more than tiresome, it was maddening. Nature was determined that she should look and sound angelic. She could never be disagreeable or rude without being completely misunderstood.",

In some of these basins there was a little water left over from the last flood, warm and fetid water under an oily-looking scum, condensed by prolonged evaporation to a sort of broth, rich in dead and dying organisms.

Most will identify themselves as being from a certain state and associated culture such as Punjabi or Keralan or Bengali. But, of course, occupation and caste also divide groups, and Non Resident Indians are now a caste of their own. Their Complex is a set of massive towers of flats that have been bought with American dollars by Indians living offshore or Indians who spend a lot of time overseas. It looks like a high-rise space station. Skyscrapers loom around a courtyard dominated by a tall obelisk like the pillar in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Behind the pod bay doors is a self-sufficient suburb of luxury, with apartment towers, a swimming pool, restaurant and kindergarten. It’s a bizarre bubble of cleanliness and uniformity. Foyers are decorated with Greek columns and Roman busts and porthole windows.",

    "target_paragraph": "The impetus for building the Delta Works had come almost sixty years previously, on the night of 31 January 1953, the date of the greatest natural disaster in the history of the Netherlands. An unprecedented combination of high spring tides, strong winds and a major storm had pushed sea levels along the Dutch coast to several metres higher than normal. The poorly maintained flood defences were quickly overwhelmed. As the country slept, water poured over the dikes. In Rotterdam, the first sign of trouble reportedly came when hordes of rats ran from subways and cellars, fleeing the rising tide. In a belated effort to warn people of the impending disaster, church bells were rung and rusted air-raid sirens were set howling into the fierce wind, but it was too late. In the village of Stavenisse, for example, a group of locals rushed towards a crumbling dike with tools in hand, only to be swept back when it collapsed, carrying them through the village on a twelve-foot wave. Houses near the dike were destroyed instantly, with beams and sections of wall turning into floating battering rams, punching holes through the houses behind them. One man and his wife awoke to find their upstairs bedroom knee-deep in water. As the water rose further, the wife climbed out of the window to call for help, only to see her husband swept out of the front door to his death. Similar stories played out across the country.",

Went to explore hamlets on high roadless hills west of Sighet; the steep tracks mucky, as first spring heat melts packed snow and iced mud. Photographed the most attractive of the all-wood houses, and the artistically built hay-ricks under their shingle roofs, and the long line of snowy USSR mountains in the near distance. Then was physically attacked by a youngish farmer who darted out from behind his hay-rick, twisted my left arm and tried to grab the camera. Naturally I was bewildered, the more so because he was appalled to discover my foreignness. Looking stricken, he apologised with tears in his eyes and invited me into his cosy wooden house for tuica. He and his wife (fair-haired and blue-eyed, with rotting teeth) tried frantically to explain the misunderstanding but left me baffled. We parted the best of friends, wife hugging me and stroking my hair and presenting me with an embroidered tablecloth. Later the mystery was solved by Mircea, my teacher friend. I had been mistaken for a ‘spy’ from a political party which advocates an immediate division of local collective farmland, giving equal shares to all. Sounds fine – but before collectivisation there were Big Farmers and Little Farmers and the descendants of the former don’t accept being put on an equal footing with the descendants of the latter. So they passionately oppose the plan and are suspicious of, and quite often violently antagonistic to, unannounced strangers who come to report on the lie of the land – literally! Since this isn’t a tourist area, my camera at once marked me as a ‘political spy’. The implications for the future of democracy are grim – if you deal with political opponents by assaulting them on sight …",

Once as we were resting in the bed of the stream between two rocky walls, some fishermen came by without noticing us. Another time when we stumbled upon some fishermen whom we could not avoid we asked in our broken Hindustani for some trout. Our disguise seemed to be convincing enough as the men sold us the fish without showing mistrust of us—indeed they cooked them for us—while conversing and smoking those small Indian cigarettes which Europeans find so distasteful. Marchese (who before our getaway had been a great smoker) could not resist the temptation of asking for one—but he had barely taken a couple of puffs when he fell unconscious, as if he had been poleaxed! Luckily he soon recovered and we were able to continue our journey.",

Parts of the story are fictionalized. Some chapters are simply poems. Nothing in it is linear, or conventional. It defies being placed in any particular genre, which is one of the reasons I loved it so much, and still do.",

It was a bitterly cold day and so misty that the new office blocks looming on the far side of the river, just a few hundred metres away, were all but invisible. The puddles of rainwater in the plaza were capped with thin sheets of ice, and my breath rose quickly through the air like smoke from a cigarette. Even wearing a thick coat, gloves and a woolly hat, I was very cold. The arctic conditions had, however, done little to detract from the enthusiasm of the crowd. Bundled up in puffy jackets (the adults) and brightly coloured costumes (the children), they fairly buzzed with excitement, constantly checking the time and asking one another whether Sinterklaas would be arriving soon. On the stage, a group of about half a dozen performers in sequinned outfits were dancing maniacally to booming festive music. Jester-like figures tottered on tall stilts through the crowd, handing out balloons and candy, and I counted no fewer than four face-painted clowns making balloon animals for shivering children.",

Chatting over hot tea, vodka, sweet clotted cheese and hard, dehydrated yoghurt, we learnt a lot about the family’s life and their concerns for the future. We discovered that 30 per cent of Mongolians still live a nomadic life, but the number is dropping as the city-dwelling population increases. In truth, these resilient people are the remnants of a disappearing culture that has survived for ages, mostly in harsh, isolated conditions. The Mongolian climate is extreme and often unpredictable, with winter storms, droughts and desertification, all of which threaten the nomads’ existence and affect their livelihood. Summer droughts have resulted in animals not gaining sufficient weight to withstand the ferocity of the freezing winters of late. Herding life is tough, and it seems winters have been even more severe than over the last decade.",

When the train stopped at Allahabad there was a great commotion on the platform: people were desperately trying to climb into the train, there were police everywhere, women were crying … Anyway; the train pulled out and I didn’t discover what had happened until the following morning. The Kumbh Mela [the great gathering of sadhus held once every decade] was being celebrated near Allahabad. Hundreds of holy men had massed and were marching down to the water to bathe when suddenly the elephants carrying the Naga Sadhus had run amok; in the ensuing panic hundreds were killed.",

What is it that leads to massacre? whence does that sudden frenzy spring, whither vanish? Like a tornado it bursts over the peaceful earth, blots out the daily life of town and village, destroys, uproots and slays?and passes. My thoughts were still busy with these unanswerable problems when we rode upon our way next morning. One of my muleteers was a Moslem, a ?ajji, a Mecca pilgrim. I had known him for many years and he had served me well during months of hard travel. When the road was long he had not wearied; when the sun was hot he had not complained; when the wind blew cold he drew more closely about him the duffle coat which I had given him in Aleppo, and every evening after the tents were pitched and the horses picketed, I had seen him building up the fire under the big rice-pot and stirring the savoury mess on which my camp was to sup. To-day as I looked into his simple honest face, I wondered what unexpected ferocity lay behind its familiar wrinkles.",

Then – men were watching us. Palestinian men, from a roadside, perhaps half a mile away. They had turned towards us, were talking. Raja watched them watching us, but didn’t say anything to me.

Every day, we hiked till sunset, averaging a distance of thirty kilometres a day, made all the more tiring because of the uneven sandy terrain. A steady rhythm was maintained, alternating fifty minutes of fast-paced walking with a ten-minute break and so on. This gave us a good cadence throughout the journey, with a short stop for lunch, usually around noon. Then onwards again, charging ahead all afternoon, lured by the serpentine curves of the Lut’s hypnotic landscapes. Walking, walking and more walking … The days seemed endless. During those hours and long days of walking, if I was not chatting with one of my teammates, my mind would go quiet naturally and I would slip into a meditative mindset, using the rhythm of the walk?left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot?as my point of gentle focus. By doing this, I could bring my mind to a place of rest where I could fully engage with the environment and the present moment. My mind would then wander and think about the women we were supporting via this special expedition. Had some of them crossed wide expanses like this, not by choice but to escape dangerous situations? It was a sobering thought and made me appreciate the opportunity I had to make a small difference in their lives.",

Vanity Fair magazine published a withering article about her in its August 1996 issue. A camera crew from the tabloid television program Hard Copy ambushed her outside her apartment. The writer Christopher Buckley used Pittman’s high-altitude tribulations as the punchline of a joke on the back page of The New Yorker. By autumn, things had gotten so bad that she confessed tearfully to a friend that her son was being ridiculed and ostracized by classmates at his exclusive private school. The blistering intensity of the collective wrath over Everest—and the fact that so much of that wrath was directed at her—took Pittman completely by surprise and left her reeling.",

All the cackle—even as much of it as gets into Baedeker—is cut, and one is left only with a telegraphic statement of facts and the photographs. Personally I have no great weakness for cackle (unless it be the cackle of genius) and so find Pampaloni perfectly satisfying. Many tourists, however, prefer a more literary guide. They like sentiment, and purple passages and states of soul in front of the Colosseum by moonlight, and all the rest. So do I—but not from the pens of the sort of people who write chatty guides. To me, even Baedeker seems at times rather too lyrical. I like my guides to be informative, unenthusiastic and, where practical matters are concerned, up-to-date—which Baedeker, by the way (reluctant, I suppose, for patriotic reasons to acknowledge the fact of the late War) is not. If I want cackle I take with me a better stylist than the Baron or his gushing substitutes.",

A man, it ought to be remembered, has to take several steps to each stride of an elephant, and, moreover, the man is somewhat less than resistant to thicket, thorn trees, and heat. Also (particularly if he is white) he is vulnerable as a peeled egg to all things that sting – anopheles mosquitoes, scorpions, snakes, and tsetse flies.

In fact, the restaurant was not sold lock stock barrel and goodwill, but gutted, moved intact even to the customers and without even a single whole day’s closure, into the new boarding house where Mrs Eck was now the landlady; moved intact past the rocking figure on the gallery which continued to rock there through mere legend and into landmark like the effigy signs before the old-time English public houses, so that country men coming into town and inquiring for the Snopes hotel were told simply to walk in that direction until they came to a woman rocking, and that was it.",
