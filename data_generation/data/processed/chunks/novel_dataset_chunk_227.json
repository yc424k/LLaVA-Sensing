I saw a documentary about Soviet orphanages back in high school, and the images had haunted me ever since—of malnourished children rocking back and forth on their haunches, ramming their heads against dingy walls, of babies lying in filth. I didn’t know enough Russian to work with adults, but I could probably hold my own with little kids. So I got off at a random Metro stop one day and roamed around, asking everyone who passed if they knew where I could find one. Amazingly, one lady actually did and led me through a labyrinth of concrete slab buildings before depositing me on a doorstep. A small blue sign read DYETSKII DOM, or CHILDREN’S HOME. My stomach tingling with nerves, I knocked on the door and a woman in a white lab coat and hairnet flung it open.",

This, she decided, was the best position after all; and thus she remained till a man’s step was heard on the stairs. Whereupon Lucetta, forgetting her curve (for Nature was too strong for Art as yet), jumped up and ran and hid herself behind one of the window-curtains in a freak of timidity.

It was virtually noon before we finally set off into the current on the short journey across the river. One ferryman, naked except for a loincloth, waded into the river pushing the raft in front of him. The passengers – elderly tribesmen clutching rifles and umbrellas – huddled together at one end of the raft. Suddenly we were caught in the flow. The raft shot off downstream, pirouetting in irregular circles. We hit some rapids and water cascaded over the boat. On we went, spinning and turning, eddying backwards and forwards. I bent over my camera bag, cursing that I had been stupid enough to bring all my film. But the raft was not out of control. At the far end sat two ferrymen. They clutched a pair of sturdy poles each strapped to wooden uprights. These they used as oars. Every time the ferrymen’s backs faced the far shore, they heaved at the oars and the raft shuddered off in the right direction.",

It scrupulously fixes and identifies every cricket ground and sewage works, every forgotten cemetery and wandering suburban close, and packs the densest names onto the tiniest, most obscure spaces. I flipped to the index and, for want of anything better to do, lost myself there. I calculated that there are 45,687 street names in London (give or take), including no fewer than 21 Gloucester Roads (as well as a generous slew of Gloucester Crescents, Squares, Avenues, and Closes), 111 Station Roads or similar, 35 Cavendishes, 66 Orchards, 74 Victorias, 159 Churches, 25 Avenue Roads, 35 The Avenues, and other multiples without number. There are, however, surprisingly few really interesting sounding places—Cold Blow Lane, Glimpsing Green, Hamshades Close, Cactus Walk, Nutter Lane, and The Butts more or less exhausted the list of names that could be called arresting. I read once that in Elizabethan times there was a Gropecunt Lane somewhere in the city, but evidently no longer. I spent half an hour amusing myself in this way, pleased to be entering a metropolis of such dazzling and unknowable complexity, and had the bonus pleasure, when I returned the book to the bag, of finding the half-eaten Mars bar, its leading edge covered in a small festival of lint, which didn’t do a great deal for the flavor but did add some useful bulk.",

Everything is memorized, even subjects like mathematics. Students do not understand why seven multiplied by three is twenty-one: they just remember it.

And she had arrived at thinking that Edward took little stock in women that made eyes at him. She had formed what was, at that time, a fairly correct estimate of the methods of, the reasons for, Edward’s loves. She was certain that hitherto they had consisted of the short passion for the Dolciquita, the real sort of love for Mrs. Basil, and what she deemed the pretty courtship of Maisie Maidan. Besides she despised Florence so haughtily that she could not imagine Edward’s being attracted by her. And she and Maisie were a sort of bulwark round him.",

Walking around tolerant, easy-going Amsterdam, most visitors remain unaware of a national dirty secret: the Netherlands was one of the world’s leading slave-trading nations.",

I decided to store my sleeping gear in the unused space when needed, instead of up above. Also, on Coach’s suggestion, I could take a picture. If we had an accident, I could take pictures of a dented fender or anything else that needed recording.",

One night I find myself in a nightmare; I see dead bodies hanging from the ceiling, my lungs black and putrid on the outside of my body, my back impaled on a pitchfork, and there’s a big beast sitting heavily on my chest. I’m gasping and retching and trying to push the thing off me but I’m blacking out and choking and gulping. The beast becomes the aghori sadhu, his trident has speared my lungs and back, his bloodshot eyes are gnawing into my pain. I know he has done this to me.",

    "target_paragraph": "Kashgar lies where the maps in people’s minds dissolve. The southern and northern Silk Roads converge here, and the desert dies against the mountains. Fifteen centuries ago, in its Buddhist days, its inhabitants were famously fierce and impetuous, and in time it grew to be a champion of Islam. To Europe it was barely known until the nineteenth century. Then, as tsarist Russia pushed south and east, Kashgar became a listening-post in the Great Game of imperial espionage, played out between the Russian and British empires beside an impoverished China.\nBut the game was China’s now. Through the soft sprawl of the Uighur town, the Chinese roads pushed like knife-blades. The crossroads of People’s Road and Liberation Road, carrying their white-tiled banks and emporia among serried offices, lay like a crucifix on the old city. And in People’s Square an antique, sixty-foot statue of Mao Zedong–too vast safely to dismantle–lifted his arm like a club. In these cold spaces the Arabic script vanished from the shop signs, displaced by Chinese. Official hoardings announced the friendship between the two peoples, betraying Beijing’s anxiety. The city was at flashpoint. In the year 1999 a long-planned railroad had arrived from the east, and was pouring in immigrants. Already the Chinese population had soared above its official ten per cent.\nI walked along People’s Road. The Construction Bank of China, China Unicom, the Agricultural Bank of China, ChinaTelecom: they marched together, trumpeting the new order. A high-tech centre called ‘Newyield Fast Foreign International Trade City’ was going up. I went into a shop selling videos of Chinese pop groups. They were called Power Station or WonderGirl, and pretended to be made by Miramax. The Uighur who walked these streets or sold trinkets on the bank steps looked suddenly out of date. A few were begging. Beside them the Chinese seemed hard and pale, the women’s tight skirts and faces–even their occasional silks–elaborately defined amongst the flaring colours of native headscarves and bodices. Each race reflected cruelly on the other.\nThen I turned into the labyrinth of the old town, and all was changed. Its alleys converged in walls of plaster and whitewash, tunnelling blindly through mud brick. The paving dipped and splintered underfoot. Often the houses lurched overhead until they spanned the whole way on timbered bridges. Only occasionally, in the blank corridors of lanes, a carved door was left ajar, a breeze blew its hanging aside, and I saw courtyards and beetling staircases, a child chasing a chicken, an old man asleep among oleanders.\nThen the way debouched into dinning markets of ironmongers, potters, wood-turners. In the crowds, at either pole of life, went little girls in iridescent caps, like old-fashioned dolls, and widows under coarse brown veils. The air reeked of resin and coal dust, and filled with the quavering music of Arabia. No Chinese was in sight. Central Asia was suddenly close and palpable. The turrets of streetside mosques scythed the sky with crescents, and stairs teetered up to prayer-rooms among painted pillars and potted flowers. Among the sheepskin hats and skull-caps of the Uighur went Kyrgyz herdsmen in white felt trilbies, and here and there were lean Tajiks from the Pakistan border, their women walking under high pillbox hats dripping with silver pendants. This resurgence of a once-nomadic world reached its crescendo in a teeming Sunday market where the bullocks, donkeys and wobbling chorus-lines of fat-rumped sheep mingled with the Barkol and Ili horses, and a few camels roared.",

Fifteen minutes later the tent was up and we were huddled within, devouring buns and squidgey sardines that looked extraordinarily like guano droppings. (Peruvian tinned sardines do not come intact and oiled.) Even had it been dry we couldn’t have made a fire; there isn’t a particle of fuel for miles around. This site is almost a bog; whenever we move the ground beneath makes rather rude sucking noises. As we munched we stared out at a limited twilit scene. The isolated sharp peaks on either side of us, and not much above, were obscured by a waterfall of rain and we could see only a small area of open brown moorland sloping up from our site.",

But at Jan Smuts airport, in September 1994, honesty was the worst policy. A small pot-bellied Afrikaner immigration officer, with thin sandy hair and angry pale blue eyes, demanded my work permit. Then I made mistake no. 2 by firmly asserting that in the new South Africa I didn’t need a work permit. Resentment of the new South Africa is strongest among exactly this category of Afrikaner: minor civil servant, immediately threatened by affirmative action. Moreover, I was, technically, wrong.

For as soon as I arrived at the game, I was surrounded by the other faces of the capital. Groups of young boys in torn shirts, with tangled shoulder-length hair, sat sullenly on stoops. An old woman with overbright yellow hair sold crosses. Six policemen on horseback paced up and down, and twenty-five riot police wielding staves stared back at their gun-toting leader. Every vendor who entered the place was thrown against a wall and frisked. And within the stadium compound itself—it seemed only apt—was a Justicialist Party office commemorated to Perón. Here, I thought, listening to the kids shouting ché, or buddy, to each other, were, quite literally, Evita’s descamisados, or shirtless ones. In the stands, twelve-year-old urchins huddled around a joint; one of them wore a cap that said THE MILLIONAIRES.",

A pair of bald eagles perched at the water’s edge on Russell’s south end eyeballed us, a two-on-two staring contest rigged in their favor. Muir had come to this very spot in 1879. Back then, the thousand-foot-high island had been half-embedded in ice, marking “the head of the bay” and the furthest reach of the glacier that in Vancouver’s time had stretched all the way to Gustavus. “A short time ago,” Muir wrote of the rock, “it was at least two thousand feet beneath the surface of the over-sweeping ice; and under present climatic conditions it will soon take its place as a glacier-polished island in the middle of the fjord.” And so it had.",

I swatted at myself like I was on fire, rinsed off what soap and bugs I could under cold water and ran up the hill to my tent, passing Mateo en route. “Poo-moo-blah-blah-blah!” he yelled after me, raising one water bucket in salute.

The stage of mental comfort to which they had arrived at this hour was one wherein their souls expanded beyond their skins, spreading their personalities warmly through the room. In this process the chamber and its furniture grew more and more dignified and luxurious; the shawl hanging at the window took upon itself the richness of tapestry; the brass handles of the chest of drawers were as golden knockers; and the carved bed-posts seemed to have some kinship with the magnificent pillars of Solomon’s temple.",

Reaching it, we find a faintly illuminated plaza, where twenty or so couples twirl slowly to Strauss’s “Blue Danube.” Nobody’s dressed up. They all seem to have hurriedly dried their hands on a dishtowel, perhaps leaving pots in the sink to come out to this open-air ballroom. A DJ manages a small boom box, its long power cord attached umbilically to the nearby street lamp. As he flips a CD and punches buttons for the right track, the dancers stand silent and respectful, as if frozen. He offers a polka, then a waltz, a foxtrot, and another polka. Since everyone’s partnered up and knows the flow, it seems they must meet here for outdoor dancing on a regular basis. No one wastes time talking. It’s all about the music, and if a woman doesn’t have a male partner, she dances with another woman.",

Thus began his long period of wandering. He ranged far over mountains and wastes, passing through narrow valleys and dark woods, shouldering through scrub of ivy and juniper, setting pebbles rattling on scree slopes, wading estuaries and walking on unsheltered hills in starry frosts and wind-blown snow, until he was clad in black ice. He moved up and down rivers, swimming from pool to pool, and he wintered among wolf packs. He made lairs and dens for himself: on mattresses of soft bog, in root-nooks at the foot of big trees, by waterfalls. Despite the severity of these places, Sweeney came to find their harshness beautiful, and to admire the rhythms of time and weather that they kept.",

She does not like her life. And when she is drunk, she says what is in her mind, what is in her heart.” Aren’t you worried, Rosa, I asked, that the same thing will happen to you, working here? She nodded grimly. “I know. I think of my sister often. But I can keep control. I do not drink. I do not smoke. I will work only as receptionist. I want to reach my ambition.” And you will really be able to avoid all this? “Yes,” she said, nodding slowly and with shaky determination. “My ambition is to become a journalist.”",

The rig just had to straighten out before takeoff. The wheels edged along, remaining on the pavement. I only had to complete the turn. I began to feel the warmth of joy and relief wash over me, but the feeling quickly drained to my shoes with the sound of a loud rush of air. What had happened? I wondered. My head snapped to the right looking at the arcing trailers on that side. The rig still curled along, but the sound got louder. For a moment, a feeling of alarm stealing over me, I nonetheless kept crawling forward, kept looking in front and glancing to the side. All the trailers remained upright. Then in the gray-blue sky above a movement had caught my eye. The rotors of a medical services chopper thrashed the air while the craft zoomed overhead and zeroed in on the site of the auto collision. The loud noise had come from the chopper. That u-turn had been at low speed and on solid ground, but I felt like I’d added another vertebra on my expanding trucker’s backbone.",

Here, in this room, are the abraded and battered shells cast on the shore. The door goes on opening. The room fills and fills with knowledge, anguish, many kinds of ambition, much indifference, some despair. Between us, you say, we could build cathedrals, dictate policies, condemn men to death, and administer the affairs of several public offices. The common fund of experience is very deep. We have between us scores of children of both sexes, whom we are educating, going to see at school with the measles, and bringing up to inherit our houses. In one way or another we make this day, this Friday, some by going to the Law Courts; others to the city; others to the nursery; others by marching and forming fours. A million hands stitch, raise hods with bricks. The activity is endless. And tomorrow it begins again; tomorrow we make Saturday. Some take train for France; others ship for India. Some will never come into this room again. One may die tonight. Another will beget a child. From us every sort of building, policy, venture, picture, poem, child, factory, will spring. Life comes; life goes; we make life. So you say.",
