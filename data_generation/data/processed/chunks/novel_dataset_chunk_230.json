She was pretty bossy. She had Clark make dinner, fetch water, open her bear canister, and even move logs for them as chairs. If she wasn’t sleeping with him, why was he acting like such a dog?

It may be all a question of cash and printing presses and armed police, but things have to be done with an air. Crudity as far as possible is avoided. For example, Mr King could not be the only candidate at the convention of the Unit True Whig Party; at some expense supporters for Mr Cooper had to be brought to the convention, even though it was known beforehand that Mr King would be nominated. I received on the morning of the convention a programme issued by the organizers, signed by Mr Doughba Carmo Caranda, the General Secretary, and attested by Mr Abayomi Karnga, the national chairman (the names indicated the policy of the party, Liberia for the Liberians, everyone had been busy finding themselves native names to contrast with the Dunbars, Barclays, Simpsons, Dennises of the Government). The proceedings, I read, were to end with a procession to the house of the nominated candidate, but rather ingenuously the route of the procession was given, by the Masonic Hall, up Broad Street, on to Front Street, ‘to the residence of the candidate’. It was Mr King who had a house in Front Street, not Mr Cooper, so that the programme took some of the edge off of the excitement. Rather damping, too, was the nonarrival of most of the delegates, for the second launch was not so successful as the one in which we travelled and stuck on a sandbank outside Monrovia. The convention was to open with prayer at two-thirty, but when we arrived at three-thirty they were still waiting for the marooned delegates. Afterwards things got rather rushed, for when we arrived back at five the convention was over. The brass band was trying to get out of the ground and head the procession, but the mob was too great, and our Legation car helped to block the road. Several delegates hissed feebly at the little flag on the hood and a fat perspiring black pushed his head in at the window and asked furiously whether we did not know that this was a national occasion. There was a reek of cane juice and a few people looked nearly drunk enough to throw stones.",

Tying up the remainders of our lunch in an eco nappy-bag, I worked my way down the carriage and squeezed the rubbish into the slot beneath the sink, which actually had a bin bag in place. At this point I was unaware that the bag would simply be thrown out of the door at the next possible opportunity. It was bright and warm outside and the train was yet to pick up pace, so I heaved open the door and sat down on the step. Behind me the carriage door opened and a lady wearing a tennis shirt and bootleg jeans leant out and tossed a plastic bag full of food straight over my head. Rice, dal and pickle came loose mid-air, the open bag landing on a bush already strung with blue and pink plastic ribbons. Every inch of the foreground sprouted plastic bags, foil and bottles, resembling the immediate aftermath of Glastonbury.",

Monks who run two hundred miles at a stretch, in a trance; others who can raise their body temperatures just through the intensity of their meditation. Monks who can levitate—seem to fly—and others who have perfected the psychic skills that have left Madame Blavatsky, Gurdjieff, Paul Brunton, and a host of notorious others transfixed. It all sounds highly implausible until you think of how a Tibetan villager might respond to the news that Americans have walked on the moon, that people can speak to one another across the globe on little wireless instruments they carry in their pockets, or that the Chinese god “Wang Dao” (or Michael Jordan, as we call him) can be seen flying over a basket ten feet above the ground.",

Seven countries might have ‘claimed’ a slice for themselves, and there might be pushing two hundred little ‘research’ camps, but the continent wasn’t really owned by anyone. It was like seeing the earth for the very first time, and I felt less homeless there than I had ever felt anywhere.

The gap started widening, and Bartlett saw that the floe they were on was drifting—so he quickly pulled out his knife and cut the traces and in one swift move leaped over to the other side, pulling the sled across by himself. He tossed Kataktovik a rope, and the Eskimo ran a few steps and leaped as Bartlett yanked him through the air.

It’s Julian the Apostate.",

I had originally assumed the name was an unfortunate colloquialism, but no – it seemed to be an accurate title for a massive piece of public art celebrating the union between a cheerful elf and a rocket-shaped toy.

While resting on a boulder, at the edge of another pasture, I heard distant singing and saw about twenty men and women marching, running and jumping across a wide expanse of brilliant grass. (This is only an approximate description of their peculiar method of progress: it seemed that they couldn’t wait for the dancing to begin at the bride’s home.) The men were wearing snow-white shammas over grubby European pants and the women were dazzling in white, full-skirted dresses with exquisitely-woven, richly-coloured borders. Two maidens, balancing injara-baskets on their heads, led the group, and on the lid of each basket a tall bouquet of shrub and herb fronds swayed gracefully as the girls came prancing through the grass. The older women followed, singing, skipping and laughing with un-matronly abandon, and the men leaped vigorously up and down every step of the way, brandishing their dulas over their heads and loudly chanting. (The women’s songs were more varied and at intervals they paused to ululate beautifully.) This little procession – so simple and gay against a background of smooth hills, wooded valleys and calm meadows – was among the most charming sights I have ever seen.",

The Siberian mammoth finds alone have been a bonanza, some of them not fossils but the actual creatures themselves, still frozen and almost intact, or mummified in frozen sediments. A museum in Yakutsk displays the fossilized contents of a fossilized mammoth stomach, in cross section, beside a whole preserved mammoth leg with its long, druidical hair still hanging down. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, discoveries of mammoth remains were so common that for a while mammoth ivory became a major export of Siberia.",

    "target_paragraph": "China was in a particularly confused condition then. The euphoria of the 1911 revolution, which had abolished the Manchu monarchy, had soon been dispelled by conflicts among the revolutionaries, by the emergence of the New Culture Movement which advocated the abolition of all tradition, by the birth of the Chinese Communist Party and by the marchings here and there of restless war-lords with their private armies. In 1921, Beijing being in war-lord hands, Sun Yat-sen, the father of the revolution, was elected president of the Republic in Guangzhou. He was repeatedly snubbed by the British, who regarded him as a rebel still, and preferred anyway to maintain, in the absence of any sensible policy, that whoever ruled in Beijing was the rightful ruler of all China. Sun Yat-sen further antagonized the British Empire in general, and Sir Reginald Stubbs in particular, by turning his regime sharply to the left, legalizing trade unions and welcoming help from the Soviet Union. Under its auspices a powerfully revolutionary and xenophobic movement arose, based upon Guangzhou, and inevitably turned its attention downstream to Hong Kong – that stranglehold of foreigners, the one corner of China where alien capitalists sat in sovereign state.",

I gathered control?and my nerves?and looked to see on which side the filler hole was, but I quickly realized that I had no side mirrors. Johannesburg drivers have been known to open fire for the most minor of errors, so I nervously held up traffic as I ran around the vehicle and found the filler hole, which the mechanic had moved so it was down low and involved acrobatics to get the nozzle into. I hastily climbed back in, overshot the pump, almost knocked it over when I tried to back up and the trailer jackknifed, and then went in to pay. I was convinced everybody was staring at me thinking, What an idiot. Let’s shoot him in case he breeds.",

    "target_paragraph": "Beyond Paddock Wood and its flat and dreary purlieus the road began to ascend and to wind, growing narrower and less draughty, with glimpses of a greener country and a hillier distance, in fact improving visibly as we neared Sussex. All this time I had walked by myself, and I was still too tired after the long march the day before to have any but dull objections. It would have been natural to be acutely indignant at Edelgard’s persistent defiance, natural to be infuriated at the cleverness with which she shifted the entire charge of our caravan on to me while she, on the horizon, gesticulated with Jellaby. I realised, it is true, that the others would not have let her lead the horse even had she offered to, but she ought at least to have walked beside me and hear me, if that were my mood, grumble. However, a reasonable man knows how to wait. He does not, not being a woman, hasten and perhaps spoil a crisis by rushing at it. And if no opportunity should present itself for weeks, would there not be years in our flat in Storchwerder consisting solely of opportunities?",

He looked back and the road was clear and unending; there was nothing to shield him from the soldier’s bullet. He turned and dashed into the church compound.

Allegedly they had prepared for themselves coffins of solid gold, but they ended up in crude wooden paupers’ coffins and again the camera lingered on their faces, showing them from every angle, and remaining steadily focused on each coffin while a white cloth was placed over the inmate and the lid was firmly closed. The scene then shifted to the burial site – evidently the corner of a cemetery – where large snowflakes were swirling softly. When the Ceausescus had been laid in shallow graves, a tall burly man stepped forward (Ion didn’t know who he was) and threw a handful of earth onto the coffins. The incongruously familiar noise recalled that both were born into peasant families in a Christian country. Each grave was then sealed with massive stone slabs. And the final shot showed a young soldier plastering cement over the cracks between those slabs.",
