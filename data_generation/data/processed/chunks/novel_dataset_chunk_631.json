A month later, Key Westers were baffled to see gigantic US Navy destroyers (‘half the size of our island!’) anchoring off-shore. Then the journalists arrived, packing every hotel and bar, poised to leave for Cuba to cover its rescue from Communism. When the Bay of Pigs invaders were defeated within seventy-two hours, the destroyers sailed away, leaving the journalists to deflect public attention from Washington’s humiliation by filing reports of colourful anti-Castro demonstrators marching up and down Duval Street.",

Lucetta, forming the third and haloed figure, was opposite them; Elizabeth-Jane, being out of the game, and out of the group, could observe all from afar, like the evangelist who had to write it down: that there were long spaces of taciturnity, when all exterior circumstance was subdued to the touch of spoons and china the click of a heel on the pavement under the window, the passing of a wheelbarrow or cart, the whistling of the carter, the gush of water into householders’ buckets at the town-pump opposite; the exchange of greetings among their neighbours, and the rattle of the yokes by which they carried off their evening supply.",

My lungs told me that this was our highest point yet in the Andes and the map suggested we were not far off 16,500 feet. We stood, all three panting, and gazed across a turmoil of ravines and valleys at Rosco Grande and Rosco Chico – aloof, chunky snow peaks apparently on a level with our summit. We were tempted to rest here, savouring our equality with those gleaming princes of the puna, but we dared not. That final climb had sweat-drenched us and at such a height, in the cold evening wind, hypothermia could strike.",

Ihr Wagen scheint ganz introuvable zu sein.’ Similar surroundings were the scene of another tale. Friedrich-August, the last King of Saxony, a fat, easy-going and proverbially good-natured man, loathed all court functions and especially the midsummer garden party at Dresden. Once, in liquefaction after a heat-wave afternoon, he was escaping, his duty done, to a cool drink in his study when he spotted, at the other side of the park under a tree, two aged and dismal-looking professors he had forgotten to greet. Hating to hurt anyone’s feelings he toiled all the way over to them and shook their hands limply. But the afternoon’s output had been too much for him: he just managed to croak ‘Na, ihr beide’ – ‘Well, you two’ – and tottered away again.",

Here are abundant old remains, but no trace of Minerva’s temple. Holstenius, who wrote his annotations to Cluver in 1666, and who seems to have visited the place, says that the temple (of the Sirens, he calls it) stood upon the site of the present Campanella tower, which was built with its materials; adding, however, “so the inhabitants say”–which makes his testimony almost worthless.",

Decades of dialectic materialism rammed down people’s throats had to produce a compensation mechanism, and in a way she embodied the spiritual void at the heart of absolute power. Anything can happen in a void. Soviet dogma had failed to replace the undercurrent of mysticism that runs through the Bulgarian psyche. People had lived close to the land for millennia, and a few decades of Soviet social engineering had made them scared and suspicious, but the land’s mysteries were still there. They spoke to those who could tune in. Lyudmila wanted to tune in.",

I wanted to be a pilgrim, stripped down to whatever I could carry on my back, trekking five hundred miles from St. Jean-Pied-de-Port in southern France to the final destination of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain, which purportedly contains the tomb of St. James. I pictured myself turning inward, timing my footsteps to my breath, meditating, unplugged from news, my computer, phone, fax and, most of all, social chitchat. Inane conversation about weather, whether or not to buy this or that, rehashing of TV shows, and minute dissections of who said what to whom grind my soul to ash. I wanted the simplicity of the medieval pilgrims who walked the Camino de Santiago de Compostela (a collection of pilgrimage routes also known as the Way of St. James). I yearned for a month-long spiritual undertaking, over hill and dale, pasture and plain, carrying the iconic scallop shell which signifies to others that you are, quite literally, walking the walk.",

In the days of early spring it had been pleasant, falling as it now did through his western window and across the desk where a white hyacinth bloomed in a bowl of glazed maroon pottery. But as he sat musing, gazing out the window where, beyond a tarred roof that drank heat like a sponge and radiated it, against a brick wall a clump of ragged heaven trees lifted shabby, diffident bloom, he dreaded the long hot summer days of sunlight upon the roof directly above him, remembered his dim and musty office at home, in which a breeze seemed always to move, with its serried rows of books dusty and undisturbed that seemed to emanate coolness and quietude even on the hottest days. And thinking of this, he was again lost from the harsh newness in which his body sat. The pen moved again.",

Some were standing with one foot on the step of the carriage drinking out of thick cups as if they were afraid to go far from their seats. She looked down the length of the train and saw the engine sucking water from a hose. It seemed all body, all muscle; even the neck had been consumed into the smooth barrel of the body. This was ‘the’ train; the others were toys in comparison. She snuffed up the sulphurous air, which left a slight tinge of acid at the back of the throat, as if it already had a tang of the north.",

When defied by Palestinians they tend to become vicious, when challenged by an exasperated foreign granny they tend to lose their nerve. This youth hastily returned my passport and waved me past the barrier. On the other side, five Nablus truck-drivers, who had witnessed our argument, leant out of their cabs to give me the V-sign. At such rural checkpoints, many soldiers tauntingly ignore lengthening vehicle queues while chatting among themselves. Twice I observed all drivers being ordered to leave their vehicles some twenty yards from the checkpoint, remove their shirts and walk slowly towards the barrier. For some Muslim men, this public exposure of bare torsos is deeply distressing.",

But memories would come on wings of light—a shining bird, high pines and sun, the fire in a floating leaf, the autumn heat in weathered wood, wood smell, a child, soft lichen on a stone—a light-filled immanence, shimmering and breathing, and yet so fleeting that it left me breathless and in pain. One night in 1945, on a Navy vessel in a Pacific storm, my relief on bow watch, seasick, failed to appear, and I was alone for eight hours in a maelstrom of wind and water, noise and iron; again and again, waves crashed across the deck, until water, air, and iron became one. Overwhelmed, exhausted, all thought and emotion beaten out of me, I lost my sense of self, the heartbeat I heard was the heart of the world, I breathed with the mighty risings and declines of earth, and this evanescence seemed less frightening than exalting. Afterward, there was pain of loss—loss of what, I wondered, understanding nothing.",

    "target_paragraph": "Among the first Dutchmen to recognise the opportunities outside Europe was Jan Huyghen van Linschoten. Little known today, he was, perhaps more than anyone else, responsible for launching the Golden Age. Van Linschoten was born in 1563 in the Dutch city of Haarlem, near Amsterdam. At a young age he moved with his family to Enkhuizen, a small fishing town some fifty miles north of the capital. Watching local fishing boats unload their catches in the compact harbour, he nurtured dreams of escaping his modest roots and exploring the high seas, later writing of his yearning to ‘see and travel into strange countries, thereby to seek some adventures’. When he was still in his early teens, van Linschoten followed an older brother to the Spanish city of Seville, where he spent four years before moving on to the Portuguese capital, Lisbon.",

By culture and custom, Mongolians are a nomadic people, kind and generous when they’re not conquering neighboring countries. They have a fine decorative sense, lining their mobile gers with exquisitely colored and carved interiors. Unfortunately, they’ve been beset by mining interests from China, with its insatiable need for all the minerals that exist under Mongolia’s parched lands. Rich in copper, coal, and gold, the issuance of mining licenses has turned Mongolia’s economy into the fastest growing in the world in 2011, and prompted some citizens to start calling their homeland “Minegolia.” Formerly open grazing lands have been fenced off to protect the new mines, leaving families without enough land on which to sustain their herds. Selling their animals in hopes of securing a job in town, they wind up with neither. Without animals, they can’t return to the countryside as they’d have nothing to live on if they did.",

The Ainu were altogether a different race from the Japanese. They spoke a different language, practiced a different faith. Ainu men – reputedly the hairiest in the world – grew thick beards that covered their chests. Ainu women tattooed their faces. To the Japanese who glimpsed them, spearing their fishes, murdering their gods, they must have seemed utterly alien.",

The first pair had now gone back in the studio, and when they came out again they were staggering beneath the trousered shank of a mighty leg and a booted Atlantean hoof, and as they passed, one of the other men, now returning for more of the statesman's parts, pressed himself against the wall to let them by and said:",

Parties at restaurants in China used to end when the last dish and the rice were cold and the guests had drunk their farewell cup of tea at a clean table. That night, though, the group still had a lot to say after that—they always did—and we stood around on the pavement outside carrying on a discussion of modern literature that had started at table. We were in that part of town called the Chinese city, across Soochow Creek, outside the boundaries of the foreign concessions. It was hot. A crumpled old paper made a scraping little sound like autumn leaves along the gutter, and the skirts of the men's long gowns stirred in the same wind. During dinner, they had spoken English out of courtesy, but now, in their excitement, they had long since switched to the Chinese language, and I stood there waiting for somebody to remember me and help me find a taxi, until Heh-ven said, \"Oh, excuse us for forgetting our foreign guest. We are all going now to my house. Will you come?\"",

The husband and wife aboard the Sunmore weighed anchor immediately and sped for the mouth of the bay, hoping to outrun danger. The wave caught them at the entrance and presumably dashed the boat and its passengers to pieces; an oil slick was the only trace of their final resting spot. The Badger, operated by William and Vivian Swanson, was still at anchor when the wave hit. The water carried their trawler across the low spit of land at the mouth of the bay, “riding stern first just below the crest of the wave, like a surfboard,” according to the U.S. Geological Survey follow-up report. “Swanson looked down on the trees growing on the spit, and believes that he was about two boat lengths (more than 80 feet) above their tops.” The Badger crashed down stern first. Ninety minutes later they were found by a fishing boat, freezing and in shock but alive.",
