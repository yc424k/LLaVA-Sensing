Boyne’s anger rose—evidently, he thought, old Mrs. Mervin had waited to communicate with her daughter before answering him. What cowardice, what treachery! He pictured all these grown up powers and principalities leagued together against the handful of babes he commanded, and the bitterness of surrender entered into him. It was not that any of these parents really wanted their children. If they had, the break-up of Judith’s dream, though tragic, would have been too natural to struggle against. But it was simply that the poor little things had become a bone of contention, that the taking or keeping possession of them was a matter of pride or of expediency, like fighting for a goal in some exciting game, or clinging to all one’s points in an acrimoniously-disputed law-suit. Boyne unfolded Mrs. Wheater’s telegram, and read: “You must come to Paris immediately bringing Chip I must see you at once do not disobey me stop telegraph Hotel Nouveau Luxe Mother.”",

As the folded ballot papers were pushed through the slits these Pioneers saluted smartly and together chanted – ‘Voto!’ It was important, said Alejandro, to educate young citizens about how Cuban-style democracy really works, to make them feel responsible for the boxes’ integrity and proud of contributing to the election of the best representatives to run their community. To prove that this involvement was genuine, not any sort of stunt or cosmetic gesture, Alejandro led me at 7.00 p.m. from a polling station to the nineteenth-century Asamblea Municipal del Poder Popular. As the polling station’s box was being transported, opened and emptied on to a counters’ table, two pairs of sharp little eyes watched every movement. According to Alejandro, this ‘catch ’em young’ policy explains why even today’s teenagers vote eagerly in municipal elections. At which point I recalled Professor Raby’s assessment:",

    "target_paragraph": "A comparison between these nearly contemporary architects—Brunelleschi was born some twenty-five years before Alberti—is extremely interesting and instructive. Both were enthusiastic students of the antique, both knew their Rome, both employed in their buildings the characteristic elements of classical architecture. And yet it would be difficult to discover two architects whose work is more completely dissimilar. Compare the interiors of Brunelleschi’s two Florentine churches with that of Alberti’s Sant’ Andrea. Brunelleschi’s churches are divided into a nave and aisles by rows of tall slender pillars supporting round arches. The details are classical and so correct that they might have been executed by Roman workmen. But the general design is not Roman, but Romanesque. His churches are simply more spidery versions of eleventh-century basilicas, with “purer” details. All is airiness and lightness; there is even a certain air of insecurity about these church interiors, so slender are the pillars, so much free space is to be seen.",

The truth of it was, they saw too many people. And so on and so on, more conjugal talk pattering softly and unintelligibly, until they were both ready to go down to tea.",

Marcus was a conscientious valetudinarian whom the world has agreed to take at his own valuation (that correspondence with Pronto has a sick-room air - the querulous note of expiring antiquity); in Hadrian were summed up all the romanticism and disordered curiosity of a soup-bubble renaissance.",

If he glued it together the next morning months might elapse before his wife noticed what had happened, and meanwhile he might after all be able to match the dish at Shadd’s Falls or Bettsbridge. Having satisfied himself that there was no risk of immediate discovery he went back to the kitchen with a lighter step, and found Mattie disconsolately removing the last scraps of pickle from the floor.",

I will count them, she thought, returning to her notebook, and had begun one, two, three, four… when a voice exclaimed behind her: ‘Peggy! Aren’t your ears tingling?’ She turned. It was Delia of course, with her genial ways, her imitation Irish flattery: ‘– because they ought to be,’ said Delia, laying a hand on her shoulder, ‘considering what he’s been saying’ – she pointed to a grey-haired man – ‘what praises he’s been singing of you.’",

The street frightened her, since it led either to the gallows or to the river. She floundered over the doorstep head forward, arms thrown out, like a person falling over the parapet of a bridge. This entrance into the open air had a foretaste of drowning; a slimy dampness enveloped her, entered her nostrils, clung to her hair. It was not actually raining, but each gas lamp had a rusty little halo of mist. The van and horses were gone, and in the black street the curtained window of the carters’ eating-house made a square patch of soiled blood-red light glowing faintly very near the level of the pavement. Mrs Verloc, dragging herself slowly towards it, thought that she was a very friendless woman. It was true. It was so true that, in a sudden longing to see some friendly face, she could think of no one else but of Mrs Neale, the charwoman. She had no acquaintances of her own. Nobody would miss her in a social way. It must not be imagined that the Widow Verloc had forgotten her mother. This was not so. Winnie had been a good daughter because she had been a devoted sister. Her mother had always leaned on her for support. No consolation or advice could be expected there. Now that Stevie was dead the bond seemed to be broken. She could not face the old woman with the horrible tale. Moreover, it was too far. The river was her present destination. Mrs Verloc tried to forget her mother.",

We are told to focus on its parts bit by bit and feel heat, cold, tingles, tickles, air, etc. I feel nothing except huge blocks of pain in my back and legs. We’re told to be aware, but not to react; then we’ll break down the barrier between the conscious and unconscious mind and be able to live in a state of equanimity. It’s mission impossible. Goenka has started to chant a Sanskrit tune at the end of each meditation that sounds just like the lullaby about Daddy offering to buy a child a rocking horse and a diamond ring. Inside I sing along. I have no self-restraint at all.",

Today is “See Ullapool Day” and much there is, although some of it is very touristy, especially on West Shore Road which fronts Loch Broom. I see my Airbnb host in a coastal rowboat with his mates enjoying a calm day. They row by an enormous sailboat that is visiting. As I admire the view, a RAF jet buzzes the town. Not flies by. Buzzes. If the jet is over 100 metres high I would be stunned. The noise is deafening. I ask a local what that is all about, in the lull before Number 2 jet does the same thing. The answer is, daily occurrence. What did poor Ullapool do to be a mythical target for training runs from the RAF base in Stornoway? Perplexed by why the locals tolerate it, I move on to sightseeing.",

But there is a kindling in the sky whether of lamplight or of dawn. There is a stir of some sort—sparrows on plane tree somewhere chirping. There is a sense of the break of day. I will not call it dawn. What is dawn in the city to an elderly man standing in the street looking up rather dizzily at the sky? Dawn is some sort of whitening of the sky; some sort of renewal. Another day; another Friday; another twentieth of March, January, or September. Another general awakening. The stars draw back and are extinguished. The bars deepen themselves between the waves. The film of mist thickens on the fields. A redness gathers on the roses, even on the pale rose that hangs by the bedroom window. A bird chirps. Cottagers light their early candles. Yes, this is the eternal renewal, the incessant rise and fall and fall and rise again.",

I looked with longing at the illuminated signs that advertised food and places to rest. Right then I didn’t want to be in a metal box high over the road struggling to control a big rig, driving unrelentingly to complete the run. I didn’t want to struggle for snatches and grabs of sleep on a bouncing, noisy bunk while someone else sat at the wheel.

Occasionally they stopped while Buddy and his father wrangled about where the quarry would head next, but usually they agreed, apparently anticipating the animal’s movements before it knew them itself; and once and again they halted their mounts upon a hill and sat so in the frosty starlight until the dogs’ voices welled out of the darkness mournful and chiming, swelled louder and nearer and swept invisibly past not half a mile away; faded diminishing and with a falling suspense, as of bells, into the silence again.",

Edwin Salem told me that when he was a kid he built a board rack to hitch to his bicycle, using scrounged plywood, two-by-fours, and wheels off a shopping cart. He would set off from the Sunset District two hours before the tide would be good at Fort Point because that’s how long it took to pedal there. Fort Point is a sloppy left under the south end of the Golden Gate Bridge. It gets crowded but is a relatively gentle wave. At twelve or thirteen, Edwin started riding the whitewater at Ocean Beach. Peewee, who was already one of the big guys there, told him that, before he could surf, he had to collect a lot of wood—good dry stuff for a bonfire that would be blazing when he came in. “I collected a lot of wood,” Edwin said. “And I took a lot of crap.” Slowly he became an Ocean Beach local.",

At about 9 p.m. an unprecedented commotion started up outside the bungalow and on investigating we learned that a search party was being formed. I felt certain that in these forests, at this season, the poor little scrap couldn’t possibly survive – but here I underestimated the toughness of Tiblets. Half an hour after the search party had set out a messenger who had gone to Macleod Ganj to notify the mother came rushing back with the news that Pema had made her own way to the hamlet, walking over two miles in pitch darkness, and that she was now asleep, safely snuggled down beside her ‘amela’ in sheepskins by the roadside. She was not brought back here today, as I feared she might be, so perhaps her gallant escape-march has had the desired effect.",

Eleanor, looking at the hills, hardly listened. ‘Oh, but there’s quite enough for everybody at present,’ she heard Celia saying. And for some reason she held the sentence suspended without a meaning in her mind’s ear, ‘… quite enough for everybody at present,’ she repeated. After all the foreign languages she had been hearing, it sounded to her pure English.

I shouldered through the entire population, come down to meet the train, passed between the flaring torches of the little row of candy booths, and went along the street, where drunken soldiers alternated with painted girls, walking arm in arm, to Doña Luisa’s Station Hotel. It was locked. I pounded on the door and a little window opened at the side, showing an incredibly ancient woman’s face, crowned with straggly white hair. This being squinted at me through a pair of steel spectacles and remarked,\n\"Well, I guess you’re all right!\" Then there came a sound of bars being taken down, and the door swung open. Doña Luisa herself, a great bunch of keys at her belt, stood just inside. She held a large Chinaman by the ear, addressing him in fluent and profane Spanish. \"Chango!\" she said: \"What do you mean by telling a guest at this hotel that there wasn’t any more hot cakes? Why didn’t you make some more? Now take your dirty little bundle and get out of here!\" With a final wrench she released the squealing Oriental. \"These damn heathen,\" she announced in\nEnglish, \"the nasty beggars! I don’t take any lip from a dirty Chinaman who can live on a nickel’s worth of rice a day!\" Then she nodded apologetically toward the door. \"There’s so many damned drunken generals around to-day that I’ve got to keep the door locked. I don’t want the —— —— Mexican ——s in here!\"",

The eyes of this species were mostly directed over the parapet upon the running water below. A man seen there looking thus fixedly into the river was pretty sure to be one whom the world did not treat kindly for some reason or other. While one in straits on the townward bridge did not mind who saw him so, and kept his back to the parapet to survey the passers-by, one in straits on this never faced the road, never turned his head at coming footsteps, but, sensitive to his own condition, watched the current whenever a stranger approached, as if some strange fish interested him, though every finned thing had been poached out of the river years before.",

Besides, he hadn’t come to call on her—he had come to administer a deserved rebuke. For, having written the letter to Ollier, and eased his anger a little in this way, it struck him that if he posted it the effect might be to bring him home at once; in which case his own period of peace and comfort in the marvellously run vicarage would come to an abrupt end, so that, on second thoughts, he laid the letter aside, instead of posting it. But he felt very strongly that something should be done, and the woman not be allowed to think she could behave as she chose with a churchyard; and by the afternoon of the day succeeding his discovery he could contain himself no longer, and went down to her cottage to relieve his feelings, and at the same time stop the scandal, by stern rebuke.",

I roll out of the bag, make sure the boats are still securely tied to the willows, and am about to wake up Ralph.

In fact, a lot of outside noise seems far away in Jackson. Slow and relaxing is how Temica describes it—a “place where you can come home and sit on the porch and say, ‘Oh, okay, okay.’”",

He let us in, then disappeared, leaving us in total darkness while he went off with his torch to get the diesel generator going.
