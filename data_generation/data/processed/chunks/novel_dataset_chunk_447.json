Krikor Bekarion looked pleased to see us. He was a Christian Armenian, he told us, whose family had fled from Erzurum in 1917 during the massacres, and had managed to get to Beirut where they had set up a shoe-making firm. Then in 1976 they had been driven out of Beirut and had moved to Aleppo where they started all over again. But Krikor did not like Syria (‘too much politics, not enough profit’), and so had moved to Germany where he ran a shady-sounding ‘import/export’ business. Finally he had ended up in Athens where he now possessed a restaurant, a nightclub, two girlfriends (one Greek, one English – it was she who wore socks under her sandals) and a Mercedes. He was coming to Aleppo only briefly, he said, to visit his brother, and was pleased to have us for company. He liked the English, and thought the people of Aleppo both dull and difficult – ‘always they make problems’.",

It had grown almost completely dark by now, and the Sint Laurenskerk was beautifully lit, its sturdy clock tower golden under a darkening navy sky. The bells tolled loudly as we went by. I saw a passing drunk amble over and address the front of the crowd, swaying gently as he announced: ‘Ik ben een Rotterdammer en jij bent een Rotterdammer.’ Yes, a man with a Jewish skullcap assured him, we are all Rotterdammers. Nul-tien is one. A group of cheerful young women in headscarves rushed ahead of the crowd and posed for a photo in front of it, taken by a young policeman who looked like he was enjoying the attention.",

She is comfortable in her surroundings, and is made nervous if she has to visit a populous place—even Fairbanks, a hundred and twenty-seven miles away, which she calls “town.” She does not like, among other things, being dependent for water and power on sources outside her family’s control. She has endured a flood in town, and the threat of earthquakes. At such times, she yearns for home. “Out here, anything can happen and it doesn’t bother you. We have our own power system, our own well. We have double systems generally. We have kerosene and propane light when we don’t want to run the generator.” With temperatures that snap toward seventy below, they also have snows that close the road six months a year and bears that visit in summer. She looks up sometimes and sees wolves in the yard. She says, “In town, I always feel insecure.”",

It was as though with the cessation of that interminable voice he had become aware not of silence but of elapsed time, that on the instant it had ceased he had retraced and resumed at the moment it began in the store at six oclock in the afternoon, and now he was six hours late. You’re trying too hard, he told himself. You got to slow up. So he held himself still for the space of a hundred, trying to orient himself by looking back up the slope, to establish whether he was above or below the tree, to the right or left of it. Then he went back halfway through the corn and looked back at the bottom from there, trying to recognise by its shape and position the tree where he had left the axe, standing in the roar not of silence now but of time’s friction. He thought of starting from some point which he knew was below the tree he sought and searching each tree as he came to it. But the sound of time was too loud, so when he began to move, to run, it was toward neither the bottom nor the cabin but across the slope, quartering, out of the corn and on into the road a half mile beyond his house.",

The truck belongs to him, really. He is a leggy dog, white with a brown spot. He is now stained red from all the blood. I wrinkle my nose. Charlie is in his work clothes, sodden up to his chest. He’s been walking cats since dawn. We went out together, with one of the ocelots, at five. Since then, while I’ve been in town, he’s been out to walk Rupi and feed at least four others. He shoves his hands into the pockets of his jeans. He’s tall and pale, and his too-long hair—which hasn’t been cut since he arrived at the park a year ago and is wrapped into a man bun—coupled with a chest-length auburn beard, wouldn’t look out of place in a hipster coffee shop in Melbourne.",

The English sky is softer, milkier than the Eastern. Something gentle has passed into it from the grass-rounded hills, something damp.

A barrel of aguardiente had been set up on a trestle in one corner, and beneath it sprawled Charlie himself, in his mouth a glass tube which syphoned up into the barrel. A tremendous wooden box of Mexican cigarettes had been smashed open on one side, the packages tumbling out upon the floor. In other parts of the room two more Chinamen slept the profound sleep of the very drunk, wrapped in blankets. The two who danced sang meanwhile their own version of a once popular ragtime song called \"Dreamy Eyes.\" Against this marched magnificently \"The Pilgrim’s Chorus\" from Tannhäuser, rendered by a phonograph set up in the kitchen. Charlie removed the glass tube from his mouth, put a thumb over it, and welcomed us with a hymn which he sang as follows:",

I am standing on the bow of Sobrius with one hand on the headstay, looking across the bright blue water of the harbor and the small beach of Garden Key, facing the wind. A fishing boat and a catamaran sit to my right, and behind me is another sailboat. Nobody else stirs in the early morning. It feels like a good day to continue my journey home.\nUnder bright blue skies, I sit on the foredeck and with gloved hands and pull on the anchor rode. Sobrius inches forward as I take in the rode and coil it in the anchor locker beneath me. I pull up both anchors. When the second anchor releases its grip from the seafloor, Sobrius begins to slowly drift downwind. I quickly stow the second anchor and walk back to the cockpit.\nThe motor is already running and warmed up, and I put us in forward gear and steer us around the sailboat behind us and toward the channel leading out of the harbor. Careful not to run into any reef, I steer us out and around Fort Jefferson, towards the great blue sea. The #3 jib is on deck, ready to hoist, and one reef is set in the main, also ready to hoist. I feel tension and fear about this leg of the journey. The incessant howling of the wind in the harbor has probably spooked me a bit. But we must get to St Augustine, and there’s only one way to do that: sail. I must rise above my fear and do what must be done.\nAs we pass the final buoy in the channel, I set the autopilot and go forward to the mast to hoist the sails. Clipped in to the jackline, I rest my back against a shroud, uncleat the main halyard, and begin pulling the sail up. But the first batten catches on the lazyjacks and stops my progress. I go back to the cockpit and free the mainsheet so the sail can swing behind the wind. Back at the mast I ease the tension on the lazyjacks and raise the main, winching it tight. I move to the other side of the mast and raise the jib, cleat it off and return to the cockpit, where I kill the engine, and the sounds of the wind in the sails and the water moving across the hull bring Sobrius to life.",

Last but not least we say hello to Zelda, an energetic red-footed tortoise whose homemade—and artificially humidified—wooden habitat has a rainbow Pride flag for a backdrop. Billy falls in love with “Zelly” at first sight, tenderly brushing the top of her scaly head with his index finger.",

Poe, like Coleridge whom he idolized, was another night-wandering man, obsessed by the Far South and by voyages of annihilation and rebirth—an enthusiasm he would pass on to Baudelaire. He had recently become acquainted with the theory of J. C. Symmes, an excavalry officer from St Louis, who claimed in 1818 that both Poles were hollow and temperate.",

He dedicated the book to a friend, Harry Hooton, with whom Thomas had walked ‘more miles …than with anyone else except myself’, and the Icknield Way – with its uncertain history, its disputed route and its debatable limits – becomes in Thomas’s hands a metaphor for the unknown domains that attend our beginnings and our ends.",

You look for such indications as wave formations as they hit a shore and bounce back out to sea, rising cumulus clouds that skyrocket to great heights from thermal currents over the land, phosphorescent lines in the water at night, and so forth. I haven’t detected any of these things. The most reliable method is to see land itself. But sighting land from a distance is always a tricky problem. When clouds are above you, they appear to move quickly. But as they near the horizon, you look through the atmosphere at an oblique angle and the clouds appear to move slower and slower while they also become darker. Cumulus clouds take on the illusory form of high volcanic rims or low, flat islands. Some remain still for so long that you begin to believe they are solid earth. Only by very long observation can the sailor distinguish land from clouds.",

All this was so. On the other hand, even after Germany and America went to war, Lindbergh never returned the medal.",

So we part in a huff; and next time we meet, which was tonight, he walks straight up to me, and says, “Go to the Devil!” That’s the sort of behaviour my mother complains of. I want to know, what does it mean?’",

This is Borromini's famous trompe l'oeil, which, even if one is prepared for it, comes as a delicious surprise: Only ten meters separate the gallery from the statue; the statue is not a giant but a dwarf. This is felt as well as seen. To understand the trick, you have to walk down the gallery (feel the mosaics under your feet), and even then—rising floor, descending ceiling, rapidly diminishing columns—you don't quite believe it, you think the change is not in art or nature but in you. You never, for one moment, have the sense that you have conquered space or bettered the giant (who is very sweet), and that is nice. You somehow don't have the sense that you've been gulled, either, and that's even nicer.",

She slumped in the bunker and ignored the crickets.\n\n“Where is Odenigbo?” she asked, after a while, grabbing Ugwu’s arm. “Where is your master?”\n\n“He is here, mah,” Ugwu said, looking around.",

It spent most of the day lying in the sun in the back yard, or during the hot summer days, in the cool dusty obscurity beneath the kitchen. But toward the middle of the afternoon it went around to the front and waited there quietly and gravely until the carriage came up the drive, and when Bayard had descended and entered the house it returned to the back and waited again until Isom led the mare up and Bayard came out and mounted. Then together they spent the afternoon going quietly and unhurriedly about the meadows and fields and woods in their seasonal mutations—the man on his horse and the ticked setter gravely beside him, while the descending evening of their lives drew toward its peaceful close upon the kind land that had bred them both. The young dog was not yet two years old; his net was too hasty for the sedateness of their society overlong, and though at times he set forth with them or came quartering up, splashed and eager, from somewhere to join them in midfield, it was not for long and soon he must dash away with his tongue flapping and the tense delicate feathering of his tail in pursuit of the maddening elusive smells with which the world surrounded him and tempted him from every thicket and copse and ravine.",

The Signora takes a charitable and motherly view of them on the whole; they have caused her no trouble; and it rather pleases her, perhaps because any literary recognition is better than none, that so many of the other young people who actually go up the stairs are above all entranced by mementoes of William Godwin (Political Justice, free love; “Godwin-perfectability” as Keats put it), his daughter Mary Shelley (Frankenstein) and her mother Mary Woll-stonecraft (Vindication of the Rights of Woman.) For sex mores, Shelley’s “Epipsychidion” would be timely too, leaving out the brainy side of bed-hopping, but that would require opening a book—inadvisable: it might reveal what a disagreeable hypocrite and money-grubber Godwin was, for instance. For sweet illusion’s sake it is better for all this stuff, along with Byron’s and Shelley’s revolutionary and libertarian outpourings, to be more heard about than read, though it would be interesting to see what tags and scraps of the political notions of those well-heeled rebels would fit into the lowest-level current bombast of our maniacs of social protest, the kidnappers et al., if they were only larded with scatology and obscenity every few words. True, tyranny for a Greece under the Turks or Venice and Lombardy under the Austrians, like social injustice in the England of the idiot George III, had forms with only the shakiest parallels in industrial countries today, though the crimes of rulers may be as bad. The ancient Greeks those liberty-lovers loved would not have thought their innocence excusable, but some of it was; nobody in 1820, least of all poets, was foreseeing the ghastly turnabout of Liberty and Social Justice, to use the Romantic capitals, brought on by the Russian Revolution; what does amaze is that the poets in question had learned nothing from the French Revolution.",
