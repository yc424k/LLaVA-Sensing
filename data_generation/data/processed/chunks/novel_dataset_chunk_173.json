Then I unroll my silk-lined, Japanese high-altitude sleeping-bag and insert it into my bulkier, quilted sleeping-bag, before spreading both on the blanket. Then I remove my long, very heavy, lined Parka jacket, which I have been wearing all day, and spread that over the flea-bags, before folding the top half of the astronaut’s blanket over the lot. Finally I remove my boots, but not my woollen socks, and put on my husky bootees; these match my husky jacket and pants, which are never removed. (By now I have quite forgotten which sweaters and slacks I am wearing beneath them.) Then I gently wriggle into bed, with book and torch, taking great care not to dislocate the various layers of the structure. Having zipped up one fleabag and buttoned the other only a small ventilation hole remains open and the temperature can – and does – drop to 40º below freezing without my noticing.",

And it gives them its oblivion, too. It says to them: “Here I am, and I am yours; take me, use me as you will; be young and proud and beautiful here in your young might.” And at the same time it tells them that they will be nothing here, no more than a grain of dust; that they can come and sweat and swink and pour into the vortex of the city’s life all of the hope, the grief, the pain, the passion, and the ecstasy that youth can know, or that a single life can hold, and, so living, die here and be charioted to swift burials and at once forgot, and leave not even a print of a heel upon these swarming pavements as a sign that a blazing meteor has come to naught.",

The fare (one pound eight shillings and fourpence all the way to Nepal) covered reservation of a slatted wooden shelf, on which I slept quite well last night, but by morning a gale-force wind was whipping a dust-storm across the endless, arid, grey-yellow plain, and this diabolical torture by Nature continued until dusk. Visibility was down to about a hundred yards, the hot sky was sullen with dust, and dust and sweat formed a mask of mud on my face. All morning I sat in a semi-coma, reflecting that at last I was experiencing real hardship; compared with such a journey cycling to India is just too easy.",

She descended the steps, though as soon as she reached the level earth and began to retreat, the gray folds of the garment once more lost all inference and intimation of locomotion, so that she seemed to progress without motion like a figure on a retreating and diminishing float; a gray and blasted tree-trunk moving, somehow intact and upright, upon an unhurried flood. The clerk in the doorway cackled suddenly, explosively, chortling. He slapped his thigh.",

Soon I met a few women and girls carrying loads to the market; some held flaming torches of banana stems, their smoke incense-like. As I forded the Nam Kay a water snake was caught in my torchlight, his (her?) little head held high. Scared, s/he swerved sinuously away. In Mr Nuhak’s ban cocks were crowing raucously on all sides but there was no one astir. Between chinks in some walls I could see candles or mini-oil-lamps flickering in front of ancestral shrines.",

Then he towed her, like a poodle behind. And thus, like a poodly-bitch, she attracted hangers-on in the briny seas. And these poor polyp inamorati were the victims. They were lifted as prey on board, where I looked with horror on their grey, translucent tentacles and large, cold, stony eyes. The she-polyp was towed behind again. But after a few days she died.",

The earlier sails, by Leif, Thorvald, and Karlsefni, were evidently judged a success, as “the trip seemed to bring men both wealth and renown.” So Eirik the Red’s illegitimate daughter, the hot-tempered Freydis, decided to try her luck. She contracted with two brothers from Iceland to sail in convoy and share profits from the voyage. Each ship was to carry thirty “fighting men,” but “Freydis broke the agreement straight away,” stowing five extra warriors on her ship.",

Then suddenly a small oval valley lay far below, completely enclosed, intensively cultivated, a cluster of bohios at one end – the last dwellings on my route. Soon after the path vanished on the edge of a recently ploughed field so precipitous that no tractor could ever have violated its rich red-brown soil. Garcia told me that when the oil ran out the oxen-wise farmers in such mountainous regions were much in demand as agricultural instructors.",

They each had two beds in them, and she and Lady Caroline had had the extra beds taken out at once and put into two of the other rooms. In this way there was much more space and comfort. Lady Caroline, indeed, had turned hers into a bed-sitting-room, with the sofa out of the bigger drawing-room and the writing-table and the most comfortable chair, but she herself had not had to do that because she had her own sitting-room, equipped with what was necessary. Lady Caroline had thought at first of taking the bigger sitting-room entirely for her own, because the dining-room on the floor below could quite well be used between meals to sit in by the two others, and was a very pleasant room with nice chairs, but she had not liked the bigger sitting-room's shape—it was a round room in the tower, with deep slit windows pierced through the massive walls, and a domed and ribbed ceiling arranged to look like an open umbrella, and it seemed a little dark. Undoubtedly Lady Caroline had cast covetous glances at the honey-coloured room, and if she Mrs. Fisher, had been less firm would have installed herself in it. Which would have been absurd.",

The door was kicked open and banged to. Whenever that happened he looked up. Was it Wilson? Could it possibly be Mr Browning? Or Miss Barrett? But no – it was only another thief, another murderer; he cowered back at the mere sight of those draggled skirts, of those hard, horny boots. Once he tried to gnaw a bone that was hurled his way. But his teeth could not meet in stony flesh and the rank smell disgusted him. His thirst increased and he was forced to lap a little of the green water that had been spilt from the pail. But as Wednesday wore on and he became hotter and more parched and still more sore, lying on the broken boards, one thing merged in another. He scarcely noticed what was happening. It was only when the door opened that he raised his head and looked. No, it was not Miss Barrett.",

The path had been trampled into dust, inches thick, that rose at every step. It was important not to overtake or be overtaken. Dust overcame the dampness below wet rock; dust powdered the hard snow in gullies. Over one such gully a skull-capped Kashmiri had made himself the harassed master. He had a spade and feverishly dug up snow, which he offered, for a few coins, to pilgrims. The pilgrims, continually pressed from behind, could not stop. Nor could the Kashmiri: he frantically dug, ran with extended spade after the pilgrims already departing, did a lightning haggle, took his coins, ran back, dug again. He was all motion: it was a one-day-a-year trade.",

This is illegal, and I had visions of him reporting me to two guys in trench coats, but he was only too pleased to get his hands on hard currency and took me the nine miles into the city for $10. The cab, an ancient Moskvich, was propelled by a series of smoky blue explosions from the exhaust. It would move ten feet, pause and then lurch another ten feet with the aid of a fresh explosion.

Everyone loved his dad’s letters. He pushed the image out of his head and picked up the sympathy letter from Tudi that was now sitting on the table. The last letter his father had written was to Tudi a month earlier when her beloved husband Gus, his dad’s best friend, had died of cancer at the end of February. God, he thought they died just a month apart, and both of them from cancer. His mind drifted back to the days of his youth, and the day when Gus had pulled up in their driveway in his Air Force flight suit and handed him his helmet – a fighter pilot’s helmet. He couldn’t believe Gus had given it to him. He remembered he was the coolest kid on the block for weeks.",

His whole family gets into his canoe—a lovely eighteen-foot Chestnut—and goes up to discover the daily catch. Oddball pulls the canoe. He stands in harness on the edge of the river, and a long rope runs from the middle of his back over water to the bow quarter thwart. Potts speaks. Oddball advances. The canoe—carrying, say, five hundred pounds—begins to slide upstream. Steering with a paddle, Potts keeps the bow a few degrees off the grain of the current, maintaining tension on the rope. The mighty Yukon drives one way, mighty Oddball the other. Oddball defeats the river with ease. He jumps logs, he swims around sweepers—responding to remarks from Potts. The trip is not slow. The canoe fairly rips along. Caught by the gills, pike and grayling are waiting. (“Stay close to Potts,” Jim Scott has urged me. “If for nothing else, for the northern pike.”)",

I sat on an iron chair to consult this – then leaped up with a burnt bottom. Clutching that scrap of paper I crossed the park diagonally, pausing to admire the sphinx statues in each corner, the fake nineteenth-century lamps and the enchanting Glorieta Morisca, designed by a Granada architect, where the municipal band plays regularly and bridal couples pose for photographs. Most such Cuban agoras are in all-day use but here not even one bench was occupied. Although my casa particular was quite close, I felt slightly dizzy on arrival.",

After packing my bag, however, I had an attack of altitude sickness, called soroche in South America. I threw up my breakfast, had a tight headache that aspirins wouldn’t dislodge, and felt weak. It wasn’t only oxygen deprivation which made life punishing up there: it was viciously cold at night, too. I had worn all my clothes to bed, including hat and gloves, and in the morning there was always ice in front of the hut. But during the day the sun was remorseless. I sat still inside the hut, recovering, and in an attempt to entertain me Umberto turned to Princess Anne’s signature in the visitors’ book, and asked me if I knew her. I wondered if she had suffered from altitude sickness.",

The hangings were of gilt Cordovan leather, and a heavy gilt chandelier with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down from the black and white ceiling. Underneath a great canopy of gold cloth, on which the lions and towers of Castile were broidered in seed pearls, stood the throne itself, covered with a rich pall of black velvet studded with silver tulips and elaborately fringed with silver and pearls. On the second step of the throne was placed the kneeling-stool of the Infanta, with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue, and below that again, and beyond the limit of the canopy, stood the chair for the Papal Nuncio, who alone had the right to be seated in the King's presence on the occasion of any public ceremonial, and whose Cardinal's hat, with its tangled scarlet tassels, lay on a purple tabouret in front. On the wall, facing the throne, hung a life-sized portrait of Charles V. in hunting dress, with a great mastiff by his side, and a picture of Philip II. receiving the homage of the Netherlands occupied the centre of the other wall. Between the windows stood a black ebony cabinet, inlaid with plates of ivory, on which the figures from Holbein's Dance of Death had been graved—by the hand, some said, of that famous master himself.",
