There were no windows, no exit signs, just endless rooms, all with subdued lighting and with carpet that looked as if some executive had barked into a telephone, ‘Gimme 20,000 yards of the ugliest carpet you got.’ It was like woven vomit. I wandered for ages without knowing whether I was getting closer to or further from an exit. I passed a little shopping centre, restaurants, a buffet, cabarets, dark and silent bars where people brooded, bars with live music and astonishingly untalented entertainers (‘And gimme some astonishingly untalented entertainers while you’re at it’), and one large room in which the walls were covered with giant TV screens showing live sporting events – major league baseball, NBA basketball, boxing matches, a horse race. A whole wallful of athletes were silently playing their hearts out for the benefit of the room’s lone spectator, and he was asleep.",

We stayed in a ramshackle hotel which charged Rs.5 a night for what might be hyperbolically described as ‘a double room’, and on our return to Islamabad one of my young Pathan friends, who takes an unusual interest in the world beyond her own circle, asked me wistfully what it felt like to stay in a doss-house. The undertones of envy in her voice made me consciously value, as nothing else had ever done, my own freedom of movement. We European women take this completely for granted. Yet no Pakistani woman, however independent-minded or strong-willed, could possibly travel alone through her own country sharing the life of the poor. Granted, not many Pakistani women would ever want to do such a thing. But suddenly I found the fact that they could not strangely disturbing. Antipathetic as I am to Women’s Lib, its indirect influence may yet do some good in Asia.",

Only two days before he had been transferred from Marka, on the sweltering Mozambican border. ‘You see me dying of cold! But I’m happy to be away from those refugees, 980,000 Mozambican refugees are in our country – nearly one million and we are only eight million! The aid agencies give them food – but not enough so they become thieves, making big problems. In February our government told Mozambique they must go home, by July all food reserves will be gone – but still more come!’ Mr Mayinga paused to light a cigarette, then wondered plaintively, ‘Why am I here? No one crosses this border, the road is too bad.’",

He knows that men should not defile themselves in this way, so he keeps out of his room as much as possible. But what can he do? Where can he go? In the terrible streets of the city there is neither pause nor repose, there are no turnings and no place where he can detach himself from the incessant tide of the crowd, and sink unto himself in tranquil meditation. He flees from one desolation to another, he escapes by buying a seat “at some show,” or snatching at food in a cafeteria, he lashes about the huge streets of the night, and he returns to his cell having found no doors that he could open, no place that he could call his own.",

Not from any peculiar moral weakness but simply because such well-adapted administrators are themselves believers in a policy of economic development. ‘Resource management’ is the current term. Old foot trails may be neglected, back-country ranger stations left unmanned, and interpretive and protective services inadequately staffed, but the administrators know from long experience that millions for asphalt can always be found; Congress is always willing to appropriate money for more and bigger paved roads, anywhere – particularly if they form loops. Loop drives are extremely popular with the petroleum industry – they bring the motorist right back to the same gas station from which he started.",

Late prehistory,” I said, as we drove gently through Thurso, the most northerly resort on the mainland (a town that is part hotels-and-pleasure, part wind-raked desperation). “The early iron age—I’ll have to check—3,000 years ago? And Luke, I know, I really do, it’s not the same—our own history in these islands is so short term, so parochial. That’s what you were going to say, isn’t it? Ten thousand years of settlement, no more than that; we’ve only been here from the end of the last ice age. Whereas in central or east Africa we first mutated into Homo sapiens sapiens—when? OK—it depends on which timing on the molecular clock you believe—certainly 200,000, maybe 250,000 years ago. But you see, I have a mad hunch: I’m sure that some of us were here right through the last ice age: on St. Kilda. Because if an animal as absurdly fragile as the St. Kilda wren could survive, then so could an isolated group of our robust hunter-gatherer forefathers.”",

Near the path were rounded boulders, the size of cottages, sculptured into Henry Moore shapes by aeons of sandstorms and summer floods. And on our right vast slopes of grey shale – the very epitome of aridity – swept up and up to merge at last with the greyness of the sky. By the time we got back to the Jubilee it was penetratingly cold and we could see snow falling on the surrounding mountains.",

We followed the road for another mile or so, but never found the bus station or any more signs for the bus. Instead, we found a few more resorts, and an occasional glimpse of the Red Sea, but soon the empty lots of sand and gravel outnumbered the cafes and storefronts and taxis. We were running out of town, and Teresa was livid. Hurghada, from the comfort of an air-conditioned suite, with a glass of cold juice in one hand and a good book in the other, is quite pleasant. Hurghada on the edge of the desert, surrounded by humid, salt air, is quite miserable.",

    "target_paragraph": "It is morning and we are about 35 nautical miles east of Melbourne, where I went to college at Florida Institute of Technology (FIT) many years ago and fell in love with the ocean through surfing and SCUBA diving. Both sports fostered a deep connection with the ocean and led me to develop skills and knowledge helpful in my sailing. Surfing causes one to develop an understanding of waves, currents, wind, and tides. It also develops balance while standing on a vessel moving across waves on the ocean, a necessary skill while standing on the deck of a sailboat raising a sail or adjusting a line. Sailboats ride waves when sailing downwind, and the control and motion of the boat is similar to that of surfing. Surfing makes one comfortable in the ocean in all kinds of conditions, from tranquil to extremely rough. It helps one develop an intuitive understanding of waves and their motion and habits. It helps me to enjoy my time on the water, regardless of the conditions or the vessel.\nAs we sail past Melbourne memories flood my conscious mind: sailing small boats in the wide Indian River, learning through trial and error, running aground, kedging off a sandbar, sinking a Sunfish, learning to surf and feeling the irresistible urge to surf every day, SCUBA diving in The Bahamas while taking a summer ecology class, falling in love and then being heartbroken, partying too much and studying too little.",

On the plane, he was in business class and she was in coach, and so he ran champagne and warm nuts back to her during the flight and discovered she would be staying with some model friends just a couple of blocks from his brother’s cathedral! So lucky! So she and some Latvian models were now part of our party. And were the center of attention. I didn’t need to worry about my pimple being noticed … or any of the rest of me.",

There, just ahead, lay what looked like a pile of driftwood. He staggered a few more steps and saw, with his diminished eyesight in the dim light, the outline of a sled. He was on Icy Spit. He fell to his knees and hugged little Molly, thanking her, in a hoarse whisper, for saving his life. In one long, torturous day she’d led Chafe over a rough and serrated snow and ice trail for thirty miles. He untied her from his wrist and patted her on the head, then stood and wobbled toward the Shore Camp.",

    "target_paragraph": "A flood on the Fortymile for the time being killed the good life. It might have killed the partners. It utterly destroyed their suction dredge. The partnership broke up; Dungan went to Fairbanks and took a job. He planned to work until he had bought a truck, a cabin in Eagle, and a new dredge. First as a cook and later as a jug-hustler, chain man, and shooter, he worked for Geophysical Service, Inc., using seismic instruments in the search for oil. From the air, six months of the year, large parts of the green surface of Alaska appear sutured with seismic trails. A jug is a geophone, and as many as two thousand may be set in the ground, usually in straight lines, to monitor the waves from dynamite blasts as they reflect from underground formations. After each blast, jugs from the rear are moved to the front. Day after day—usually in winter, to reduce damage to the terrain—the procession moves cross-country. Dungan worked on seismic crews from the North Slope to southeastern Alaska—walking a hundred and ten miles once in the Arctic in winter, calling in helicopters to drive off grizzlies in summer, and saving the money he earned. He once worked a line down the Susitna Valley, and on winter nights could see the lights of Anchorage. He went no closer. “Jesus Christ, you go in there and there goes your winter’s paycheck. I just stayed in camp.” He saved enough to buy his cabin in Eagle and, later, a three-quarter-ton green Ford pickup. He was about ready to buy his new suction dredge when he came back to Eagle on leave from a job in the Brooks Range, May 14, 1974.",

For among all the impressions of the evening’s talk one was of the nature of a revelation and subdued the rest to insignificance. Thus one looked; thus one spoke; such was love.",

It was easy to tell what progressive state of intoxication he had reached simply by observing his method of locomotion. No one ever saw him stagger. He did not weave drunkenly along the pavement. Rather, when he approached the saturation point, he walked very straight, very rapidly, but with funny little short steps. As he walked he kept his face partly lowered, glancing quickly and comically from side to side, with little possumlike looks. If he approached complete paralysis, he just stood quietly and leaned against something--a lamppost or a door-way or the side of a building or the front of the drugstore. Here he would remain for hours in a state of solemn immobility, broken only by an occasional belch. His face, already grown thin and flabby-jowled, with its flaming beacon of a nose, would at these times be composed in an expression of drunken gravity, and his whole condition would be characterised by a remarkable alertness, perceptiveness, and control. He rarely degenerated into complete collapse. Almost always he could respond instantly and briskly to a word of greeting.",

Far to the southeast, along the India-Nepal frontier, colossal thunderheads drifted over the malarial swamps of the Terai, illuminating the heavens with surreal bursts of orange and blue lightning.",

Flights departed for Samara, St. Petersburg, Chelyabinsk, Volgograd. The girl reading Maugham left, after saying a polite “Goodbye” in English. A middle-aged woman replaced her. When she got up after boarding was announced for the flight to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatka, I asked if she lived there. She said yes. I said, “That’s very far,” and she replied, “It’s nothing! A nine-hour flight!” At one of the gates the microphone didn’t work and the gate attendants were making the boarding announcements without it. A flight was leaving for Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. It was strange, and moving, to hear the final summons for a place more than four thousand miles away called out by an unaided human voice.",

Fifty yards from his camp was the terraced road cut of the George Parks Highway, the road that would take him to the Stampede Trail. He woke early on the morning of April 28, walked down to the highway in the predawn gloaming, and was pleasantly surprised when the first vehicle to come along pulled over to give him a lift. It was a gray Ford pickup with a bumper sticker on the back that declared, I FISH THEREFORE I AM. PETERSBURG, ALASKA. The driver of the truck, an electrician on his way to Anchorage, wasn’t much older than McCandless. He said his name was Jim Gallien.",
