I stamped on the brake, so that the car skidded and then stood still in the middle of the street, its door swinging open, as we ran for cover.

As he moved through the boxes small heaps of pebbles and sand, the point was not lost on him that a guy could move a whole stream bed with a big machine, and when that day came a guy would have to be able to maintain the machine. For ten dollars, he bought from a neighbor a pre-Second World War Chevrolet. It was long since dead on the road. He sent off for piston rings and gaskets from Sears in Philadelphia. The bearings were babbitted and could not be replaced, so he took out the shims and adjusted them for proper clearance. He was seven years old. He had a book on auto mechanics. He did a valve job. He installed the new gaskets and rings. The engine sat up in its coffin.",

Suddenly, she gets my scent and turns quickly to stare at my still form in the dust below. She does not move but simply stands, eyes round. In her tension, the black marks on her legs are fairly shivering; she is superb. Then the first ram comes to her, and he, too, scents me. In a jump, he whirls in my direction, and his tail shoots straight up in the air, and he stamps his right forefoot, venting a weird harsh high-pitched whinny—chirr-r-rit—more like a squirrel than any ungulate. (Later I described this carefully to GS—so far as we know, the first datum on the voice of the blue sheep.) Boldly this ram steps forward to investigate, and the rest follow, until the mountain blue is full of horned heads and sheep faces, sheep vibrations—I hold my breath as best I can. In nervousness, a few pretend to browse, and one male nips edgily at a yearling’s rump, coming away with a silver tuft that shimmers in the sun. Unhurriedly, they move away, rounding the slope toward the east. Soon the heads of two females reappear, as if to make sure nothing is following. Then all are gone.",

After a while Dinghy began to acclimatize himself to his new lifestyle. On July 19, I wrote in my logbook, “Dinghy finally ventured outside and even stayed a while. With his black and white coat, he looks like a dinner guest in tie and tails. I’m finding little fish stranded on deck and offer them to him, but he turns up his nose. I awoke this morning to find him in good spirits, mutilating all my rolls of toilet paper.”",

We drove to the Foreign Office, where hot-red English ramblers were climbing over iron railings; to the hotel, where there was writing-paper in each bedroom; to the Russian Legation, where they had had no answer to M. Bouriachenko’s telegram; to the German shop, where they refused to sell us hock without a permit from the Minister of Trade; and finally to our Legation, where the Minister, Sir Richard Maconochie, has asked us to stay. It is a white house, dignified with pillars and furnished as it would be at home, without any mosquito-nets or fans to remind one of the Orient.

A quarter mile to the east, pinched between the Nuptse Wall and the West Shoulder of Everest, the Khumbu Icefall spilled through a narrow gap in a chaos of frozen shards. The amphitheater opened to the southwest, so it was flooded with sunlight; on clear afternoons when there was no wind it was warm enough to sit comfortably outside in a T-shirt. But the moment the sun dipped behind the conical summit of Pumori—a 23,507-foot peak immediately west of Base Camp—the temperature plummeted into the teens. Retiring to my tent at night, I was serenaded by a madrigal of creaks and percussive cracks, a reminder that I was lying on a moving river of ice.",

We stopped often, for Rachel to rest and me to be ecstatic, and as we sat on one boulder, sweating in hot sun, a frail, sweet sound suddenly came to us through the intense stillness of the heights. Immediately that song swept me back to the Tibetans on a wave of nostalgia, but for some moments we could not locate the singer. Then my eye was caught by the movement of distant goats, beyond a snow-filled gully, and at last we saw the goathered sitting on a rock, wrapped in his rock-coloured blanket and singing his timeless song. It seemed at once robust and plaintive, merry and poignant, and each note came to us distinctly through the thin, pure air.",

Over the last few months, as he’s been finalizing a complicated IT project, late nights have become the norm. Sometimes he’s up until 3 a.m., resolving critical glitches over the phone. Though he’s always energetic when we’re together, he can’t conceal his exhaustion—his eyes are underscored with dark circles, his skin is pale and waxy, and he drifts off into dazes for minutes at a time.",

Our driver was about to pass, when the other lorry suddenly moved forward. The bridge quivered and sagged. In a cloud of dust and sticks, to the sound of screams and gasps and rending timbers, the lorry turned a slow side-somersault into the river, where it landed with its roof submerged and its chassis indecently exposed, while its wheels fluttered helplessly in the air. The passengers had dismounted, and the driver, whose cabin was tilted up by the opposite bank, climbed out unhurt. But someone shouted there were women inside, and with superfluous gallantry Christopher and I flung ourselves on the wreck, hacking away at the ropes that bound the outside and clearing out the bales from within, to discover there was no one there at all. As the bales were rescued from the current, the whole country grew gay with borders of herbaceous chintz, orchards of pink satin caps and swards of carpet, all laid out to dry.",

This blockage lasted more than twenty minutes; only when the shepherds signalled that every last lamb was safely down on the river bank did any vehicle move. Most Rumanians remain close to their rural background and shepherds hold an honoured place in traditional society. They are also among the richest people in modern Rumania; as Communism never impinged on them, for obvious reasons, capitalism flourished in the mountains while elsewhere falling into ruin.",

If I had taken a left instead of a right at Bridgend I would have found a nifty store and hotel (which would have had no room anyway). Bowmore further along is busy but focused on the visitors. I change buses, pass the Islay Airport, a big hotel/golf complex, roar through Port Ellen, and watch three distilleries go by. The pedestrian traffic here is voluminous, requiring a large pedestrian way linking these three distilleries. I could be in a downtown urban centre given the industrial distilleries and quantity of people. I can’t bear to get off the bus and wait until we turn around, heading back the way we came. I have now seen all of Islay. I have seen enough.",

About his name there lingers a romantic association of courage and patriotism, crowned by a wise and honoured age full of authority and the power lent by wealth, for the ’Abd ul Kādir family own all the quarter in which they reside. The house, like any great Damascus house, made no show from the outside. We entered through a small door in a narrow winding street by a dark passage, turned a couple of corners and found ourselves in a marble court with a fountain in the centre and orange trees planted round. All the big rooms opened into this court, the doors were thrown wide to me, and coffee and sweetmeats were served by the groom of the chambers, while I admired the decoration of the walls and the water that bubbled up into marble basins and flowed away by marble conduits. In this and in most of the Damascene palaces every window sill has a gurgling pool in it, so that the air that blows into the room may bring with it a damp freshness. The Amīr ’Ali was away, but his major domo, who looked like a servant de bonne maison and had the respectful familiarity of manner that the Oriental dependant knows so well how to assume, showed us his master’s treasures, the jewelled sabre presented to the old Amīr by Napoleon III, ’Abd ul Kādir’s rifles, and a pair of heavy, silver-mounted swords sent as a gift last year by ’Abd ul ’Aziz ibn er Rashīd — there is a traditional friendship, I learnt, between the Algerian family and the Lords of Hail. He showed us, too, pictures of ’Abd ul Kādir; the Amīr leading his cavalry, the Amīr at Versailles coming down the steps of the palace with Napoleon, bearing himself as one who wins and not as one who loses, the Amīr as an old man in Damascus, always in the white Algerian robes that he never abandoned, and always with the same grave and splendid dignity of countenance. And last I was led over a little bridge, that crossed a running stream behind the main court, into a garden full of violets, through which we passed to stables as airy, as light and as dry as the best European stables could have been. In the stalls stood two lovely Arab mares from the famous studs of the Ruwalla and a well-bred mule almost as valuable as they. There was a sad-looking man who accompanied us upon our round, though he did not seem to belong to the establishment; his face was so gloomy that it arrested my attention, and I asked Selīm Beg who he was. A Christian, he answered, of a rich family, who had been persecuted to change his religion and had sought sanctuary with the Amīr ’Ali. I heard no more of his story, but he fitted into the picture that ’Abd ul Kādir’s dwelling place left upon the mind: the house of gentlefolk, well kept by well-trained servants, provided with the amenities of life and offering protection to the distressed.",

Scores of yelling (sometimes jeering) children followed us to the edge of the town where we found a new, gradually descending carretera – a dry-weather motor-road to the selva. Today its muddy surface bore no tyre marks. Here an almost-dry river-bed took up the whole floor of a yellowish-brown valley bearing many earthquake scars. No vegetation grew on the fissured cliffs, which at intervals were still collapsing onto the track. No fields or dwellings were visible until we came to a small wooden shack by the roadside. From this, as we passed, Ramón emerged – a neatly-dressed, diminutive young man with uncommonly dark skin, a trim black moustache, very bad teeth, Indian features and a smattering of English. He shyly appointed himself our guide and led us down to the river-bed, through the Rio by an approved ford and into a narrow, vividly green side-valley filled with the noise of a leaping, gleaming, foaming torrent. Twice we had to ford this tributary, getting soaked to the waist. Lest we might be swept away, I hung on to Juana’s neck and Rachel hung on to a strirrup; it would have been too risky to ride across, so unstable were the rocks underfoot. After the second fording we were on a fearsome Inca path, overhung by thorny scrub, which went straight up from about 8,500 feet to 11,400 – the sort of climb Juana, being a Peruvian, likes to tackle briskly. One of her abrupt upward rushes almost knocked poor Rachel over a precipice, so Ramón smilingly took the leading-rope and he and Juana disappeared, moving companionably at the same unnatural pace. Even trying to keep up with them (not that we tried very hard) totally exhausted Rachel and me. By gringo standards we’ve both acclimatised well but we don’t have the Indians’ physiological adaptations; their lungs and hearts, in conspicuous barrel chests, are not at all like ours.",

Smitten at an early age with religious fervor and “disgust at the profligate ways of his companions” (also standard) he vowed to dedicate himself to God. In order not to be guilty of disobedience toward his parents (sic) he married the girl they had picked out for him and walked out on them all the same night, and proceeded to wander around the Mediterranean with no money until he was a physical wreck. Then deciding it was better to accept charity from his family than from strangers, he returned to the palace, hardship having made him unrecognizable, and lived as a beggar under a ladder in the cellar for seventeen years, hearing his virgin wife and his family weeping for him upstairs. As he was about to die the family and the Pope, who were at mass in Saint Peter’s, were struck by an illumination and rushing to the palace cellar found the saint wreathed in heavenly light and holding some kind of paper of identification in his hand. The odd object hanging over his tomb in the church is a piece of the ladder; there is a 9th C. fresco of the legend in the lower church of S. Clemente; the story is untainted by any suggestion of Christian charity.",

An exhibit about Arsenyev in the regional museum said that an Intourist hotel had been built on the spot where the house used to be. The exhibit had a photo of Arsenyev—a slim, well-built man in an army uniform—along with his notebooks, compass, and eyeglasses. The glasses showed hard use and had been repaired at the bridge with twine or wire. Nearby, a 360-degree painting of the Battle of Volochaevka on the wall of a circular room devoted to war memorabilia put Sergei back into his historically sad frame of mind. He remained somber and withdrawn as we left the museum and went for a walk along the riverfront esplanade. Today was Sunday and the populace had all turned out on this early fall afternoon. I noted, as had become routine, the great number of beautiful women. I thought I observed a more windblown, “California-girl” look among them here. From the esplanade I climbed up to a prominence where a heroic statue of Muraviev-Amurski, China’s bane and the cousin of Bakunin, stood high against the blue of the sky surveying his self-appropriated empire. I could see the crowds along the esplanade, and speeding motorboats, and, far into the distance, the Amur whipped to waves by the breeze.",
