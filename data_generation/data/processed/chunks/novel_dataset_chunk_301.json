Only the undersides of the iron man’s feet show on the surface. Two days before coming to walk the Broomway I’d slipped off my shoes and socks and stood barefoot in the rusty prints, sole to sole with that buried body. Now that act of doubling had itself been unexpectedly repeated out here on the sands. Everywhere I looked were pivot-points and fulcrums, symmetries and proliferations: the thorax points of a winged world. Sand mimicked water, water mimicked sand, and the air duplicated the textures of both. Hinged cuckoo-calls; razor shells and cockle shells; our own reflections; a profusion of suns; the glide of transparent over solid. When I think back to the outer miles of that walk, I now recall a strong disorder of perception that caused illusions of the spirit as well as of the eye. I recall thought becoming sensational; the substance of landscape so influencing mind that mind’s own substance was altered.",

It was one of the most messed-up things in American history.” A month after the Japanese attack on Dutch Harbor, 881 Aleuts living in Unalaska and elsewhere?who were American citizens?were informed that they would be evacuated within twenty-four hours. They were allowed to take one suitcase, containing clothes only, no personal effects. Unalaska’s whites were allowed to remain. The Aleuts were deposited at abandoned canneries in the southern Alaska panhandle, where they lived in squalor until the war’s end. “After three and a half years, they were brought back and dropped off here in Captains Bay,” Dickrell said. “Of course, while they were gone, ten thousand GIs had been here kicking in doors and pissing on everything.” Dutch Harbor’s cathedral, which the army had used for storage, was severely damaged from rain, snow, and wind. When Attu’s survivors returned from Japan, they were prohibited from returning to their home island because it was too expensive to provide government services there.",

In March 2018, a few weeks after he died, single-candidate elections were held for provincial delegates and National Assembly members. Lili enthusiastically handled her responsibilities as president of the CDR and member of the neighborhood electoral commission. The elections—though criticized outside Cuba as largely ceremonial and nonrepresentative—were too important for Lili to let any personal issue, no matter how intense, stand in the way.",

He speculates about atmospheric ions that affect depression, as in the mistral winds of southern France (there are recent speculations16 that negative ions, which seem to be positive in their effect on animals and plants, may be somehow related to prana, the “life energy”), and we agree that one is clumsy when depressed, but he feels that his own stumbling is a sign of incipient sickness, a cold coming on or the like. Perhaps he is right, perhaps I imagine things, but earlier on this same ledge, as if impelled, my boots sought out the loose stones and snow-hidden ice, and I felt dull and heavy and afraid; there was a power in the air, a random menace. On the return, an oppression has lifted, I am light and quick. Things go better when my left foot is on the outside edge, as it is now, but this cannot account for the sudden limberness, the pleasure in skirting the same abyss that two hours ago filled me with dread. Not that I cease to pay attention; on the contrary, it is the precise bite and feel and sound of every step that fills me with life. Sun rays glance from snow pinnacles above and the black choughs dance in their escadrilles over the void, and dark and light interpenetrate the path, in the all-pervading presence of the Present.",

It was mostly a boundless conifer plantation, a sort of farm for trees, and it seemed eerily, preternaturally still and lifeless. It was the kind of setting where you half expect to stumble on a body half covered with leaves, which is my great dread because the police would interview me and I would immediately become a suspect on account of an unfortunate inability to answer questions like “Where were you on the afternoon of Wednesday, the third of October, at four P.M.?” I could imagine myself sitting in a windowless interview room, saying, “Let’s see, I think I might have been in Oxford, or maybe it was the Dorset coast path. Jeez, I don’t know.” And the next thing you know I’d be sewing mailbags in Wormwood Scrubs prison.",

Instead he worked hard and graduated with honors. After Amherst, he crossed the Connecticut River to nearby Northampton and there studied law in the offices of Hammond and Field, whose partners were also Amherst men. In 1899, he impetuously ran for a seat on the city council and was elected. It was the beginning of a long political career. In 1905, over the strident objections of the bride’s mother, who thought him weedy, Coolidge married a teacher of the deaf, Grace Goodhue, a fellow Vermonter whom he’d met in Northampton and who was as outgoing as he was retiring. Grace was a great support and did all the talking for both of them in social situations. He doted on her and called her “Mamma.”",

Sylvia Tietjens considered that, being privileged to go everywhere where one went and to have all men at her feet, she had no need to change her expression or to infuse into it the greater animation that marked the more common beauties of the early twentieth century.

    "target_paragraph": "CHAPTER II\nThe return to secular life was made two days later, when we left our monastery and set out to drive across the Aprica pass to Edolo. Retracing for a mile or two the way toward Sondrio, we took a turn to the left and began to mount the hills through forests of beech and chestnut. With each bend of the road the views down the Valtelline toward Sondrio and Como grew wider and more beautiful. No one who has not looked out on such a prospect in the early light of an August morning can appreciate the poetic truth of Claude’s interpretation of nature: we seemed to be moving through a gallery hung with his pictures. There was the same expanse of billowy forest, the same silver winding of a river through infinite gradations of distance, the same aërial line of hills melting into illimitable sky.\nAs we neared the top of the pass the air freshened, and pines and open meadows replaced the forest. We lunched at a little hotel in a bare meadow, among a crowd of Italians enjoying the villeggiatura in their shrill gregarious fashion; then we began the descent to Edolo in the Val Camonica.\nThe scenery changed rapidly as we drove on. There was no longer any great extent of landscape, as on the other side of the pass, but a succession of small park-like views: rounded clumps of trees interspersed with mossy glades, water-falls surmounted by old mills, campanili rising above villages hidden in foliage. On these smooth grassy terraces, under the walnut boughs, one expected at each turn to come upon some pastoral of Giorgione’s, or on one of Bonifazio’s sumptuous picnics. The scenery has a studied beauty in which velvet robes and caparisoned palfreys would not be out of place, and even the villages might have been “brushed in” by an artist skilled in effects and not afraid to improve upon reality.\nIt was after sunset when we reached Edolo, a dull town splendidly placed at the head of the Val Camonica, beneath the ice-peaks of the Adamello. The Oglio, a loud stream voluble of the glaciers, rushes through the drowsy streets as though impatient to be gone; and we were not sorry, the next morning, to follow its lead and continue our way down the valley.",

Further light years away, it’s morning in California; light is spilling into the dining room where Sister the cat is warming her fur on the table under the windows. We walk the long promenade into town and have bowls of soupe au pistou and grilled fish. Early the next day we drive to Nice and fly away.

The men are tasked with different jobs: there are catchers, killers, scorchers, scrubbers, pluckers and pilers. The cliff-men head down, roped, on ledges slippery with guano, with long nooses on poles and cudgels in hand. Reach, noose, grab, crack. The corpses are returned to the summit of Sula Sgeir, where ‘the Factory’ has been established. The birds are plucked, singed, seared. Then their wings are chopped off, they’re scrubbed again, split open and emptied of their innards, and their evacuated bodies are placed on ‘the Pile’ – a great altar-cairn of guga corpses. So it proceeds. On the middle Sabbath comes rest, prayer and song. If summer storms blow in, the men sit them out in the bothies, for there’s no working the Rock in big wind or big waves. Once the effort is over, they sail south again for Lewis. Crowds await their landfall at the Ness harbour, eager to buy and eat the birds. On a guga hunter’s last visit to the Rock, before he becomes too old to return, he builds a cairn to mark his relationship with the island. Seen from the sea, Sula Sgeir’s outline is prickly with these cairns.",

Many drivers don’t even look at each other. Pass another truck and out comes the wave, an automatic token of camaraderie among truckers. Months had gone by before I’d even been able to see, never mind respond, to the trucker wave while I sat at the wheel. But in time I’d grown accustomed to giving and receiving the wave also.",

He was so strong that he could carry a horse under his arm as if it were a goat. He could also crush the leg of a horse and cut through its nerves with his hand, as if it were a bundle of herbs. The king of Bulghār ordered a cuirass made for him, which he used to transport in a cart, and a helmet the size of a huge cauldron. He fought with the trunk of an oak, which he brandished in his right hand as if it were a walking stick. He could have killed an elephant with a single blow. Despite all this he was an extremely modest person. When we met – and my head didn’t even reach his belt – he used to greet me, make me welcome and heap honours upon me – may God have mercy upon him!",

The land simply stretches on and on; eventually you feel you’re in the farthest, extra, out-of-sight section of the parking lot, where no one in the history of civilization has ever bothered to go. Only on the sea can you travel as far and still be in apparently the same place. The deeper into Siberia, the farther from the mitigating effect of temperate oceans, the harsher the climate’s extremes become. Summers in the middle of Siberia are hot, sometimes dry and dusty, sometimes hazy with smoke from taiga fires. In the winters, temperatures drop to the lowest on the planet outside Antarctica. In the city of Verkhoyansk, in northeast-central Siberia, the cold reaches about −90°. When I mentioned this frequently noted Siberian fact to my friends and guides in St. Petersburg, they scoffed, as Russians tend to do. Then they said they knew of someplace in Siberia even colder.",

The ballet girls seemed to be waiting about for something more to happen; no men waited in the shadows of the opera door. The girls were mostly ugly, and some of them were old. Their faces were vacuous and so stretched with fatigue that they would have fallen apart save for the cordlike muscles developed by years of hard breathing. Their necks were pinched and twisted like dirty knots of mending thread when they were thin, and when they were fat the flesh hung over their bones like bulging pastry over the sides of paper containers. Their hair was black with no nuances to please the tired senses.",

It usually didn’t, but I had waves that teased me two, even three times, with the daylight hole speeding ahead, outrunning me, and then pausing and miraculously rewinding back toward me, the spilling lip seemingly twisting like the iris of a camera lens opening until I was almost out of the hole, and then reversing and doing it again, receding in beautiful hopelessness and returning in even more beautiful hope.

But I don’t know if that’s what I want to be doing with my life. I want to make art. I want to be a freelance photojournalist and tell stories that are important. But this is a risk. I don’t know if I can make money being a freelancer and maybe it is a stupid idea to leave a steady job that many people would want to become an artist.

    "target_paragraph": "Sautéed Dorado with Creole Tomato Sauce\n“First, catch a 3-foot dorado,” my step-by-step notes for this recipe begin. That part over, the preparation is simple—all that fabulously fresh fish requires. With white-fleshed, delicate fish such as dorado, I prefer to garnish it with the sauce, rather than cook it in the sauce, as Daphne did with her tuna in Bequia.\nFor the sauce\n4 tablespoons olive oil\n2 cloves garlic, chopped\n2 medium onions, sliced thinly\n3 sweet bell peppers (a combination of red, green, and/or yellow), thinly sliced and slices cut in half\n1⁄2 teaspoon hot pepper, seeded and finely chopped\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\n2 green onions, thinly sliced on the diagonal\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n2 tablespoons cilantro, chopped\n3–4 tomatoes, chopped\n1⁄2 cup white wine (approx.)\nFor the fish\n2 limes\n2 1⁄2–3 pounds dorado or other fish fillets\n1 cup flour\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons butter\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n2 cloves garlic, thickly sliced\n1. To make the sauce: In a large, heavy pan with a lid, heat the olive oil. Add the garlic and onions and cook gently over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the onions are meltingly soft and translucent (but not brown), about 10 minutes.\n2. Add the sweet and hot peppers, and cook about 10 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper and add green onions, thyme, cilantro, and tomatoes. Cover and cook until the sauce has thickened a bit, about 10 minutes.\n3. Add the white wine and simmer a bit longer for the flavors to blend. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding a bit more wine, stock, or water if the sauce seems too thick. Keep warm over low heat.\n4. Meanwhile, squeeze the limes over the fish, and rub with the pith. Season the flour with salt and pepper and dredge the fillets in the mixture.\n5. In a large skillet, heat the butter and oil. Add the sliced garlic cloves and allow them to sauté for about 5 minutes over low heat.\n6. Remove the garlic and raise the heat to medium. Sauté the dorado fillets, about 4 minutes per side (if thick), turning only once. Fish is done when it just flakes. Serve with rice and the warm tomato sauce.\nServes 6",

Certainly this has been a silent time, and a hallucinatory inner journey, too, and now there is this sudden loss of altitude. Whatever the reason, I am coming down too fast—too fast for what? And if I am coming down too fast, why do I hurry? Far from celebrating my great journey, I feel mutilated, murderous: I am in a fury of dark energies, with no control at all on my short temper.",
