He used to take a nap halfway through and then, waking up refreshed, laugh at us youngsters for being already so far gone, which of course made us more uproarious than ever. But one evening he sobered us effectually. He had lain down with a beaming countenance as usual, and we were beginning to wonder when he would wake up again, for it was considered right never to disturb him, the sleep being good for his heart, as he explained (he was far too fat ever to mean what he said). Beside myself, only the theologian and an Aesculapius had remained articulate at that hour; the latter, I remember, was setting forth the symptoms of hydrophobia to the hostess, who listened with an air of abstraction, having heard the story before. A shred of conversation still lingers in my mind.",

He had a deep, shy voice and he did look like the TV character he’d been cruelly named after—the lugubrious butler on The Addams Family. He had sad eyes, a broad forehead, a wisp of mustache, and he walked hunched over, hoping to disguise his height. Normally he skulked away from insults, but this time something must have gotten under his skin. He stopped. Glenn was standing near him. He told Lurch to keep moving. Lurch didn’t move. Glenn approached him. They got into a shoving match. Then they started throwing punches.",

The hantours followed us for awhile, but, one by one, they fell behind, and the drivers’ catcalls drifted to the wind. One driver, though, persisted far longer than dictated by common decency. He leapt from his carriage and walked in the street, at my side, for half a mile. His horse, out of loyalty or boredom, I’m not sure which, trailed right behind, and I drew some comfort from the rhythmic hoof clops. The driver, Sonny, knew all the best restaurants, he told us, and he knew all the best vendors at the market, and he swore, hand to his heart, that we were going the wrong way, which was strange, given that he repeatedly asked where we were going without ever waiting for an answer. Between pitches, Sonny peppered us with dire predictions for our health and welfare if we continued on without him. “It is not safe for you. It is very dangerous that way,” he pleaded. “There is nothing to see. Come with me. The market is this way.”",

They bore south a few miles and managed to find a route through, then pushed on across rubble ice alternating with thigh-deep snow that slowed them to barely two hundred yards per hour. By the afternoon—traveling solely by compass, as they could see neither the sun nor any island—they’d made an arduous fifteen miles. They were exhausted, and the snow was poor and wouldn’t bind together well, so it took them two hours to make their igloo. They had strength enough only to make tea and bolt down some pemmican; then they slept.",

Along the waterfront, the headquarters and warehouses of the trading companies that once serviced the entire commercial and industrial core of Medellín lie in ruins, like a film set, frozen in time, with bits and pieces dating to the three decades beginning in 1925, when a thriving economy allowed every merchant to bounce back overnight from a devastating fire that torched the entire town, save the railway yards. The Hotel Magdalena, where men in white tuxedos and women in lace danced to the music of Matilde Díaz, the Lucho Bermúdez Orchestra, perhaps the Black Stars, in a palm-studded courtyard overlooking a broad meandering river, is today a lifeless officers’ club surrounded by chain-link fences and barbed wire, accessible only to high-ranking members of the army.",

It was at this third and final house of God that we chose to seek sanctuary.

The river was known to be the home of crocodiles, but none had ever attacked anybody locally. So several of the party scampered down to the water’s edge, stripped to their underwear, and splashed in. Ms. Wruck apparently thought better of leaping in, so she merely stepped a foot or so into the water. As she stood there watching the happy frolicking, she idly leaned over and trailed a hand through the water. Just at that instant the water split in a flash of movement and poor Ms. Wruck was gone, never to be seen again. ‘There was no sound, no scream,’ reported one witness. ‘It was so quick that if you had blinked an eye you’d have missed the whole thing.’ That is what a crocodile attack is like, you see—swift, unexpected, extremely irreversible.”",

She and her neighbors agreed to share the cost, but the municipal government shot down the idea. Trash pickup was not one of the private businesses approved by Raúl’s government; only the state could collect garbage. In response to Cary’s complaint, the city had delivered the five new plastic trash bins and positioned them on the corner near her house. But it took only a week or so for each one to be tipped over in the middle of the night and stripped of its wheels. Self-employed vendors used the wheels to build pushcarts for the vegetables or candy they sold on the street. In time, the containers themselves also would disappear. When no one was watching, they would be hauled off to clandestine workshops where they’d be chopped up, melted down, and recast into brooms, dust pans, and cheap plastic toys that were sold at the La Cuevita flea market, along with everything else that the black market offered but state-run stores did not.",

Silly as it sounded—something whispered “no” to anything that meant stopping, attaching, giving someone else the power. He reminded me of those bad boys from my youth, with their cocky attitude that said they could have anyone they wanted. The ones I thought I was no longer attracted to . . . even when they scared me.

Stand in front of the massive Higashi Hongan-ji Temple in Kyoto, and you realize that fully three-quarters of the total height of the building is roof. Think about the Forbidden City in Beijing, or the Royal Palace of Bangkok, and you will find that you are thinking almost exclusively of roofs. Thus, when the administrators of Kyoto and Nara set about destroying these cities, they began with the roofs. In the case of Kyoto, they built Kyoto Tower and dealt a mortal blow to the city’s roof line. In Nara, the jutting concrete ridges of Nara Prefectural Office had the same effect. Ever since its completion in 1965, generations of tourists have had to screen its unsightly concrete spears out of their photographs. It was as strong an attack on the roof line of Nandaimon and its neighbors as could be imagined. Luckily, however, Nara does not suffer from the self-hatred which afflicts Kyoto, so subsequent developments in the park are more promising. A large civic building, recently completed, has sweeping tiled roofs very much in the spirit of Nara architecture.",

    "target_paragraph": "At the end of the ’90s Natenel Ozeri, a fervent young follower of Meir Kahane and Baruch Goldstein, set up an outpost near Hebron known as Plot 26. He had his own fervent followers among the ‘hilltop youth’ and he ignored several High Court of Justice orders to move. When two Palestinians shot up his mobile home in January 2003 he died beside his injured five-year-old daughter. His widow, Livnat, was the daughter of a Shaul Nir terrorist who earned a life-sentence in the mid-’80s by helping to kill students in Hebron’s Islamic College. (That was in revenge for the killing of six yeshiva students outside Beit Hadassah.) Livnat wanted to bury Natenel beside their hero, Goldstein; his father wanted him buried in Jerusalem. By way of compromise, Livnat decided that his remains should rest on Plot 26, to seal ‘a covenant of blood with the sacred land on which the Patriarchs trod’. But no – Rabbi Dov Lior intervened in favour of Hebron’s old cemetery. The frenzied Ozeri funeral has become legendary. Its start was delayed for hours, until the IDF allowed the illegal Kach movement to play a part. When the CO gave in and the Kach hordes swarmed onto the scene they seized Natenel’s corpse from the truck-hearse, insisted it must be buried on Plot 26 and, showing contempt for Jewish law, exposed the face ‘because he is a martyr’. For the next twelve hours they dragged their ‘martyr’ around the countryside, damaging many acres of Palestinian crops and fighting their way through checkpoints and over roadblocks. By midnight 800 soldiers had been deployed, their arrival provoking the customary yells – ‘Nazi! Nazi!’ When at last the body-snatchers gave in Natenel ended up in the old cemetery, to Rabbi Lior’s satisfaction.",

Over this projects from the wall a smoke-blackened canopy of bamboo-matting laid over wooden slats – something I have never seen elsewhere; it is about five feet above the fire and appears to be used as a hot-press-cum-larder.

Flies feast on my sweat and mosquitoes spear my slippery skin. Drums begin to beat, becoming louder and faster as we approach the bank. My heart takes up the ominous rhythm. I shut my eyes, fearing I’m being sucked into the heart of darkness.",

The Tore reach their highest elevation immediately behind Sorrento. Here, in the early morning, when sea-mists on either side shroud the two gulfs from view, the wanderer has all the illusion of being on some lonely Alpine meadow - not a sign of human habitation or handiwork; a chill nip in the air; browsing cattle with deep-toned bells round their necks, and real, close-cropped turf under foot. This, I imagine, is the track which the wolves follow when they leave their fastnesses on the Sant’ Angelo in winter to scour the richer country.",

At least one shop in three in the town center was empty and most of the rest seemed to be barely hanging on. Soon after this visit, Rackham’s, the main department store, would announce it was closing. Such life as there was had mostly moved indoors to a characterless compound called the Arndale Centre. (And why is it, by the way, that sixties shopping centers in Britain are always called the Arndale Centre? I have yet to find anyone who can supply an answer.)
