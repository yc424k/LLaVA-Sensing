When I sit on the toilet, my knees are bumping into the sink. Air conditioning doesn’t seem to exist anywhere in this town. But look on the bright side – we have wifi, which John uses until late in the night trying to figure out what could be happening to this, allegedly indestructible, engine of ours.",

Who could have dreamed, she thought, that miles could be so long? It was a good thing she was full inside of hope and determination, for by the time she had done four, though her spirit, because of all this hope, was as brisk as ever, her feet weren’t, and began to get in her way a good deal, and by the time she had done five, it was plain to her that of the two cottages the first she came to would be the most suitable. But it was, in any case, the better one, having the great advantage of being furnished—simply but adequately, said the Churchgoer—and of costing, even furnished, only as much a week as the Cherry Lidgate one was to cost with nothing in it; so that, except that it hadn’t got an orchard, and after all orchards weren’t everything, it really was the more desirable of the two.",

He was a small youngish man, a pale somewhat meagre-looking little Jew with a sharp ferret face: he, too, was a person who goes to ‘fill in’ those vast swarming masses of people along the pavements and in the subway – the mind cannot remember them or absorb the details of their individual appearance, but they people the earth, they make up life. Mr Friedman had none of the richness, colour, and humour that some members of his race so abundantly possess; the succession of grey days, the grim weather seemed to have entered his soul as it enters the souls of many different races there – the Irish, the older New England stock, even the Jews – and it gives them a common touch that is prim, drab, careful, tight and sour. Mr Friedman also wore goloshes, his clothes were neat, drab, a little worn and shiny, there was an odour of thawing dampness and warm rubber about him as he rubbed his dry little hands saying: ‘Chee! How I hated to leave that good wahm bed this morning! When I got up I said, “Holy Chee!” My wife says, “Whatsa mattah?” I says, “Holy Chee! You step out heah a moment where I am an’ you’ll see whatsa mattah.” “Is it cold?” she says. “Is it cold! I’ll tell the cock-eyed wuhld!” I says. Chee! You could have cut the frost with an axe: the wateh in the pitchehs was frozen hahd; an’ she has the nuhve to ask me if it’s cold! “Is it cold!” I says. “Do you know any more funny stories?” I says. Oh, how I do love my bed! Chee! I kept thinkin’ of that guy in Braintree I got to go see today an’ the more I thought about him, the less I liked him! I thought my feet would tu’n into two blocks of ice before I got the funniss stahted! “Chee! I hope the ole bus is still workin’,” I says. “If I’ve got to go thaw that damned thing out,” I says, “I’m ready to quit.” Chee!

I always walked fast in the morning, and the sidewalks were always wet. By the time I had rounded the Museum's flanks and reached the pillared portico, the backs of my legs were so splashed with black that they looked like a Dalmatian's. Breathlessly, I crossed the enormous entrance hall. (Everything about the Museum is outsize, as if the officials wanted always to be prepared for giants who might happen to drop in for tea.)

Some half-a-mile away, on our left, lay the lake, hidden by a fringe of tall, feathery reeds, and soon after five o’clock the path vanished at the edge of a swamp. This was a much swampier swamp than our last one, but it was also more predictable; the reeds were only two or three feet high and beyond I could see trees along the horizon and black dots that meant grazing cattle. Yet the next fifty minutes were unpleasant enough, for I was wading through waist-high water, slushy with rotted vegetation. As always in hours of peril I held trustfully on to Jock’s halter, but the slippery ground remained solid underfoot. The stink of decay was nauseating, and at every step we disturbed clouds of mosquitoes and other sharp-stinging flies. Later, when we arrived here, I looked at my legs and saw that they were covered with immense, swollen leeches. After burning them off I bled so profusely that my hostess came over all queer and had to sit down in the middle of preparing supper.",

War-boats drifted silently in the dark lane or, anchored, floated motionless with a loud ripple. That night there was much paddling in a canoe and walking at his master’s heels for Tamb’ Itam: up and down the street they tramped, where the fires were burning, inland on the outskirts of the town where small parties of men kept guard in the fields. Tuan Jim gave his orders and was obeyed. Last of all they went to the Rajah’s stockade, which a detachment of Jim’s people manned on that night. The old Rajah had fled early in the morning with most of his women to a small house he had near a jungle village on a tributary stream. Kassim, left behind, had attended the council with his air of diligent activity to explain away the diplomacy of the day before. He was considerably cold-shouldered, but managed to preserve his smiling, quiet alertness, and professed himself highly delighted when Jim told him sternly that he proposed to occupy the stockade on that night with his own men. After the council broke up he was heard outside accosting this and that deputing chief, and speaking in a loud, gratified tone of the Rajah’s property being protected in the Rajah’s absence.",

The most that William could do was to stand at the head of the stairs and say good night. He could not offer to go with them. He could not insist that she should stay. He watched her descend, rather slowly, owing to the dusk of the staircase, and he had a last sight of Denham’s head and of Katharine’s head near together, against the panels, when suddenly a pang of acute jealousy overcame him, and had he not remained conscious of the slippers upon his feet, he would have run after them or cried out. As it was he could not move from the spot. At the turn of the staircase Katharine turned to look back, trusting to this last glance to seal their compact of good friendship. Instead of returning her silent greeting, William grinned back at her a cold stare of sarcasm or of rage.",

Agni was the god of the fire that the Aryans used to perform their religious sacrifices. Rudra was god of the strong harsh winds. Sita was god of the furrow of the plowed field. Varuna was god of the earth. Savitar was the giver of life; and Surya, sometimes called Mitra or Wisnu, was god of the sun. Dyaus, the personification of the sky itself, was perhaps the most important of the early Vedic gods. The Sanskrit word deva, or dewa, originally meant \"bright.\" It later came to mean \"divine.\" Since the names of these deities were handed down to us in the Sanskrit language, and since many Sanskrit sounds do not occur in English, spellings vary.",

It was a small story at the bottom of the front page noting that the dengue fever epidemic in Port Douglas had slowed at last. The article noted that since the epidemic had started, 485 cases had been reported in the area. Although the pace was slowing, this was not grounds for complacency, a spokeswoman for the Tropical Public Health Unit warned.",

The Gelvins’ D9 Cat, meanwhile, was collecting snow in the mountains. They planned to bring it out. It had made two cuts, and when the hundreds of tons of gravel had passed through the box the cleanup both times was disappointing. They had hoped for coarse gold, but were getting only fine. Mining money, they were not quite making it. They had no intention of quitting the claims. They would keep them, and bide their time, and watch the price of gold. Meanwhile, taking into account the current price, the cost of equipment and fuel, the amount of water, the quantity of ground to be moved, they folded their mountain show. A helicopter, taking off in Circle, tilted crazily and flew sidewise into Frank Warren’s Citabria. The Gelvins —opportunistic—bought it from the insurance company for seven thousand dollars. They were fixing it to sell for fourteen. On an ice-fishing trip, Ed and Ginny, in their own repaired Citabria, were forced down by weather and, in “a squirrelly wind,” smashed into a stand of trees. Well over a hundred miles north of home, they camped for three days and nights, wreckbound. When they did not come back, Frank Warren went out and found them. They meant to salvage that plane, too.",

But what of such things? They could be fixed in Honolulu, and in the meantime think of the magnificent rest of the boat! It is true, the engine in the launch wouldn't run, and the life-boat leaked like a sieve; but then they weren't the Snark; they were mere appurtenances. The things that counted were the water-tight bulkheads, the solid planking without butts, the bath- room devices—they were the Snark.

The floats that trundle through the narrow streets with their portable shrines and tubs of sakè on them are preceded by an American-style marching band in red dragoon tunics. The carnival controllers who walk beside the floats wear pale blue-and-yellow kimonos. In their right hands they carry paper fans to direct the floats; in their left hands they carry walkie-talkie radios to direct each other. At every street corner the policemen, who astonishingly permit traffic to cross the procession, blow their whistles and wave their arms in blithe independence of the traffic lights. The result is that drivers, having no idea whether they are supposed to obey the whistles, arms, lights, or paper fans, end up obeying none of them, the floats slowly jam themselves into an immovable line of buses and trucks, and the entire event begins to resemble the aftermath of a major natural disaster.",

The path is no more than a ledge in many places and, on the northward face of each ravine, is covered by glare ice and crusted snow. Even on the southward face, the path is narrow, and concentrating hard on every step, I come upon what looks like a big pug mark. Because it is faint, and because GS is too far ahead to summon back, and because until now we have found no trace of leopard, I keep quiet; the mark will be there still when we return. And just at this moment, looking up, I see that GS has paused on the path ahead. When I come up, he points at a distinct cat scrape and print. The print is faded, but at least we know that the snow leopard is here.",

It’s late afternoon before we reach the city of Tyumen. Like Omsk before and as I’ll soon see, Yekaterinburg and Perm after, it exudes a grimness that even its broad, straight avenues can’t hide. The heavy Stalinist architecture is ominous, big concrete, blocky apartment buildings pressing down on the saplings lining the road. It’s sunny, but there’s no lightness in the air. Electric wires span the streets like so much spaghetti, tangled evidence that the city’s infrastructure hasn’t kept up with recent growth. Store windows are drab, no thought given to displaying merchandise in a colorful or attractive way. There’s something disturbing about how people walk through the streets. Sidewalks are packed, but there’s no air of relaxation. Instead, pedestrians seem bunched tight into themselves, scuttling toward their destination, tight posture implying “better move along before someone sees me.” Even I have a hard time mustering enthusiasm for a stroll down these streets.",

Mrs. Spragg was easily induced to take the same view, but Mr. Spragg had resisted, being at the moment unable either to sell his house or to let it as advantageously as he had hoped. After the move was made it seemed for a time as though he had been right, and the first social steps would be as difficult to make in a hotel as in one’s own house; and Mrs. Spragg was therefore eager to have him know that Undine really owed her first invitation to a meeting under the roof of the Stentorian.",

The disturbances were hardly more than communal grumbles at first, almost undetectable upon the Peak; but after the death of Sun Yat-sen, in 1925, and following anti-foreign troubles in Shanghai, they erupted into a full-scale General Strike, together with a boycott of all trade between Hong Kong and the province of Guangdong, which included Guangzhou itself and provided most of Hong Kong’s food. It was very nearly the rising that the British had feared, on and off, ever since the Indian Mutiny. For a few weeks the economic life of the colony was frozen. Seamen, students, hotel staffs, stevedores, domestic servants, bus and tram drivers all walked off the job. Even rickshaw men refused custom. Food prices soared, and there was a run on the banks.",

F-grade celebrities get the sperm-covered letters without the sex, the death threats without the protection and the stalkers without the psychological assistance. A persistent, psychologically troubled bloke had been pestering me for the last year, and while one of my bosses thought it must have been “flattering,” it just made me feel scared, vulnerable and violated. Stalkers colonize your mind and I wanted mine back. Leaving my wonderful job was the hardest thing I’ve ever done but perhaps I didn’t do it just for love. A part of me wanted to reclaim myself, to redefine my identity, to grow up professionally, to embrace anonymity and to get rid of the stalker. In some ways I’m already regretting my move away from the good life but right now I’m enjoying the fact that here in India I’m famous for just being white.",

As I was walking back into the city, over a footbridge across the Slivnica River and down some anonymous residential street, it struck me that this really was quite a beautiful city. More than that, it was the most European of all the cities I had been to. There were no modern shopping centres, no big gas stations, no McDonald’s or Pizza Huts, no revolving signs for Coca-Cola. No city I had ever been to had more thoroughly resisted the blandishments of American culture. It was completely, comprehensively European.

It would have been much easier to remove the head in two halves if it were not for the sludge that dripped on the cabin floor. As I extricated the broken head and threw it overboard, it leaked an odiferous trail the entire length of the cabin sole. The situation quickly went from bad to worse. With the head gone, the open hoses were exposed. The full intensity of a waste system that had been closed for the past 25 years was now venting. It was time to do the manly thing.

But just above us, on a level with the top of the wall, was the wind. The snowflakes that it carried made its speed visible. It filled the ears with sound. I was reminded, as I stood there, of a rather ludicrous and deplorable version of David Copperfield, which Beerbohm Tree used sometimes to stage at His Majesty’s. Tree himself acted two parts—Micawber and Peggotty; the former, I may add parenthetically, very well indeed (for he was an admirable comedian) the latter, in his more pathetic manner, with less success. But let that pass. Dressed as Peggotty, Tree never made an entrance without the wind; it was in the bluff nautical part. Every time he opened the door of his ship cottage on the sands of Yarmouth there came from the outer darkness a noise like the witches’ sabbath. It never blew less than a full gale during the whole run of David Copperfield. Whoo-oo-oo-oo-oo—crescendo and decrescendo. In the dress circle ladies reached for their furs, men turned up the collars of their coats. It was horrible. I had hoped then that I should never hear a wind like that outside His Majesty’s. And I never did till that icy March day when we paused beneath the Grand-Ducal wall on the road from Florence to Bologna. There, for the first time, I heard nature rivalling Sir Herbert’s art. A perfect site, I reflected, for the Castello Browning.",

    "target_paragraph": "In 1910 the director of the cemetery, Signor Trucchi, gave an account of the Shelley plot, beginning with a reference to 1823. “At that time the administration of the affairs of the cemetery was very irregular and the name of the purchaser of the ground remained unregistered, but my father remembered having been told of the purchase. Many years passed and as I had never heard from the owner of the ground I supposed that he had died. To my great surprise, however, in the latter part of 1880 I received from England a letter signed Trelawny, in which the writer stated that, as he was the owner of the plot of ground near the grave of Shelley and that, as he was an old man and could not expect to live much longer, he thought it was time for him to prepare his grave. He gave me an idea of the measurement of the box that would contain his ashes. . . .” Trelawny was then eighty-eight. In October of the next year, 1881, an English lady turned up unannounced, with the box, “about four o’clock in the afternoon,” but as she had known nothing about needing certain official documents she had to take it home with her, presumably to a hotel room. Everyone was very kind, and within a fortnight Trelawny was “moored at last on the stormless shore,” as Swinburne had already expressed it immediately after the old man’s death in August (“Lines on the Death of Edward John Trelawny”). “Heart of hearts, art thou moved not, hearing/ Surely, if hearts of the dead may hear,/ Whose true heart it is now draws near?/ Surely the sense of it thrills thee, cheering/ Darkness and death with the news now nearing—?/ Shelley, Trelawny joins thee here.”",

How could they? It was as if an entire civilization were sliding into calamity and taking the world with it. We talked much of these things and once, as we were walking to our rooms late at night, he stopped in the passage and said ‘I feel I ought to set out like a kind of Don Quixote,’ then added with a sad laugh, ‘but of course I won’t.’",

(Regrowth two years later at 80 percent.) The bike trail and the VC looked spit-shined and the finished product silenced the critics who thought we’d bitten off more than we could chew. Even the road crew, the guys who bemoaned us novices—a bunch of wing nuts borrowing their trucks, who forgot hard hats, traffic vests, seatbelts, safety glasses, those kids who ran back and forth on the job site—even they had to admit we done good. And the boss? Ralph leans back in his desk chair, arms in the air. He gets out of the office far less than he did when the project started, but that doesn’t mean he won’t get his share of the credit: “I told you we could do it!”",

The rectory itself, a great, warm-looking manor house of very old red brick, was abutted on to by one of the largest tithe barns that Macmaster had ever seen; the church itself, with a primitive roof of oak shingles, nestled in the corner formed by the ends of rectory and tithe barn, and was by so much the smallest of the three and so undecorated that but for its little belfry it might have been a good cow-byre. All three buildings stood on the very edge of the little row of hills that looks down on the Romney Marsh; they were sheltered from the north wind by a great symmetrical fan of elms and from the southwest by a very tall hedge and shrubbery, all of remarkable yews. It was, in short, an ideal cure of souls for a wealthy clergyman of cultured tastes, for there was not so much as a peasant’s cottage within a mile of it.",

If the service brakes won’t function, the emergency brakes do. However, the emergency brake system isn’t a back up operating system. Its sole function is to bring the truck to a complete stop and hold it there. From highway speed to zero, the emergency brakes engage, if the service brakes fail while driving.",

Ages have consecrated this hour, and the most majestic of all domestic actions, to talk of love between women; but Miss Warrington being alone could not talk; she could only look with extreme solicitude at her own face in the glass. She turned her head from side to side, tossing heavy locks now this way now that; and then withdrew a pace or two, and considered herself seriously.",

I failed to realize that similar conditions haunt those who live in the larger cities. Our discards were now satisfying a group of young men I had previously viewed as bothersome. And it is with a touch of humility and loads of embarrassment that I remind readers that the Air France Sky Club is less than two hundred meters away from where these young freelancers sought to be of assistance. So while the wealthy are walking away from half-filled plates to catch a flight home, these folks are tipping over trash cans to get the tiniest tidbit of discarded food.",

    "target_paragraph": "Therefore the police and the civic authorities took extraordinary precautions as the August anniversary approached. They put up their wartime barbed-wire barriers again on most of the roads running between Frenchtown and the Settlement. French-town was policed by the French, and the International Settlement was managed by a mixed \"municipal council,\" on which a number of countries, including Britain, the United States, Germany—even Japan—were represented. Everybody passing through the lines was liable to search and Chinese were patted all over to make sure they carried no firearms or grenades. Suspicious-looking foreigners were patted all over, too, for though it had been announced that Generalissimo Chiang and the Communists were kissing and making it up out in Hankow, you never know with these Reds, said the police. Even some Japanese were searched, though they objected shrilly. Their leaders protested, too, but the police had their orders.",

    "target_paragraph": "Rachael’s energy today is the furthest thing from afraid and ashamed. She looks happy. It’s too hot outside for her to comfortably wear her wig, and she’s dressed in thin, comfortable clothes so that she can ride her motorcycle around town. Her hair is drawn back in a ponytail and there are two swatches of eyeliner on the rims of her eyelids. As we sit and talk, she waves to the locals who recognize her. After closing the café two years ago due to rising rents, Rachael found a job as an insurance agent for New York Life—a gig that provides more stability than operating a restaurant. She shares joint custody of her three kids with her ex-wife; the youngest just graduated from Indiana University.",
