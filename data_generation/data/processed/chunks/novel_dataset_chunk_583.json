Several figs seem to thrive near the well. Beside the front steps there’s a large hazelnut. Then, proximity to one of the most superb towns I’ve ever seen.

Uighurs greeted passersby with hearty shouts of “Peng-you!”—Friend!—and rigorous back patting before dragging them into the grotty confines of their restaurants, where Arabic music blared from the speakers.

One of the things they do in Europe that has always impressed me is let advertisers put colourful neon signs all over the roofs and top floors of the buildings around their main squares. You don’t notice the signs in the daytime because they are so high up, so the buildings preserve that air of stern magnificence appropriate to their function, but when darkness falls and you could do with a little gaiety, the same buildings suddenly light up with bright advertisements that illuminate the square and colour the faces of the people below.",

I see out of the window over his shoulder some unembarrassed cat, not drowned in light, not trapped in silk, free to pause, to stretch, and to move again. I hate all details of the individual life. But I am fixed here to listen. An immense pressure is on me. I cannot move without dislodging the weight of centuries. A million arrows pierce me. Scorn and ridicule pierce me. I, who could beat my breast against the storm and let the hail choke me joyfully, am pinned down here; am exposed. The tiger leaps. Tongues with their whips are upon me. Mobile, incessant, they flicker over me. I must prevaricate and fence them off with lies. What amulet is there against this disaster? What face can I summon to lay cool upon this heat? I think of names on boxes; of mothers from whose wide knees skirts descend; of glades where the many-backed steep hills come down. Hide me, I cry, protect me, for I am the youngest, the most naked of you all. Jinny rides like a gull on the wave, dealing her looks adroitly here and there, saying this, saying that, with truth. But I lie; I prevaricate.",

I have no money, my boyfriend moves out when I’m at school, and two days later my bicycle is stolen. I’m struggling through The Divine Comedy in a graduate seminar I’m taking. On a hot July afternoon, I am reading Purgatorio. I already want to be a writer, but I have no idea where to begin or how to go about it. Then I fall asleep and have this dream.\nI dream that I’m walking down a street in Paris and pass a café. Inside I see Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, and F. Scott Fitzgerald drinking Campari and soda. The café has its name written above the doorway. It is: Lasciate Ogni Speranza, Voi Ch’entrate—Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Café. Strange name, I think, but I know that if I want to be a writer I have to go inside. So I do. I sit at a bistro table and order my own Campari and soda, and as I do my chair falls into a deep, dark hole in the center of the earth. I am inside what was called in medieval times an oubliette. A place where you are forgotten.\nThe darkness that surrounds me is absolute and as far as I can tell there is no way out. Suddenly six men appear, and they are carrying a coffin. They place it in front of me and leave and I understand that the only way out of this hole rests inside that coffin and it is my task to open it. So I do. And the coffin turns into a rolltop desk and paper for eternity.\nA few weeks later I pack up my apartment in Cambridge and move to New York.",

Sunlight flooded the center of the room through the glass-paneled ceiling. Concrete columns supported the second floor much like the peristyle halls we would soon tour in the old temple complex. Large-format, black-and-white photographs decorated the walls with historic images of the site, much like the frescoes that adorn the temple walls outside. The air was cool and quiet and inviting. We stopped to rest on a bench, when I noticed something wonderful. A scale model of the temple complex filled the center of the visitors’ center. It was huge, at least twenty feet across, with fine architectural details like brickwork, trees, and sand-swept bedrock. The model presented the temple complex as it appeared, in its entirety, before monotheism and time took their toll. I inspected the model for a long while, lost in the detailed complexity of the ruins that stood just outside. Teresa moved on to the photography exhibit. The images dated back to the nineteenth century and showed the complex in various stages of excavation and restoration. The prints confirmed what the scale model suggested: that the temple complex spread across the valley for miles, and we would be busy that day.",

The effect of that swift, sinuous upward movement was quite eerie, as though we were being privileged to witness some secret elemental rite. ‘I imagine,’ said Rachel, ‘we’re seeing clouds being born!’ The natural result of seeing clouds being born promptly followed: they enveloped us. Then a gusty wind got up, and through the hesitantly dispersing mist we glimpsed vast nearby chasms and distant snow-streaked ranges.",

It was an architecture focused on details: a window here, a verandah there. The emphasis was still on natural materials, but now they were combined in fanciful and elaborate ways, with curved pillars in the tokonoma, lattices of unusual woods, and antique roof tiles and the bases of old columns placed for effect in moss gardens. In roofs, it produced a mix of thatch, tile, bark and copper, with eaves projecting every which way.",

The lake was still too high to drain the water from the plane, but Hal finally got the Goose airborne. “We got about five hundred feet up in the air and the water rushed to the back of the plane,” Harry said. “The plane just stood straight up, with the nose pointed at the sky. Hal somehow got the plane down to about forty-five degrees. We hit the water hard.” As water poured into the cockpit, Harry remembered an old episode of Sea Hunt in which Lloyd Bridges had survived a similar crash by sticking his head into an air pocket near the cabin ceiling. He took a lungful of air but couldn’t open his window, which he later learned had been wired shut. He followed Hal out the pilot-side window. The two stood on a wing and considered their options. “Then we started sinking.”",

The Heads expanded the lodge and named it Mena House, in honor of Menes, the famed, if not apocryphal, pharaoh who united Upper and Lower Egypt. Two years later, the Heads sold the lodge to the Locke Kings, another British family, who then converted the lodge to a hotel. By then, Britain and France had effectively colonized Egypt, and, thanks to the advent of mass tourism spawned by Thomas Cook, a new generation of Europeans marched across the country, not with cannons, but with cameras. The pyramids were a highlight of any tour, and Mena House was the obvious lodging choice for elite travelers. The hotel offered all the trappings of upper-class, British leisure, but with warmer weather. Those trappings included stables, croquet, tennis, a royal fireplace (a very unusual feature in Egypt), and a swimming pool (reportedly the first in Egypt). Electricity was installed throughout the hotel sometime around 1900, and trams, trains, and horse-drawn coaches made daily trips from Cairo. Mena House was then fit for a king, but poor Isma’il died in 1895. He never saw what became of his beloved hunting lodge.",

There were a few more green ones but they abruptly ended when they exited the south end of the Mosquito Shoal, and the water deepened. What a relief he thought as he pulled out the cruising guide. Gillian had gone below to sort out the mess. There was a mountain of wet clothes and foul weather gear down there.",

The bridge beneath my feet is vibrating with the buzz of a human zoo of millions joined in symphonic song. On percussion, the rumble of trucks and the growling of generators. On brass, the beeping of buses, the duck calls of rickshaws and the tings of bicycle bells. On vocals, a cacophony of chanting, singing, screaming and whistling. Rising even higher is a melody of keyboards, cowbells and sitars. Loudest of all is the constant ranting of lost and found announcements distorted through loudspeakers—a roll call of children and elderly who may never be claimed. Together, this noise could be the hubbub of the three hundred and thirty million gods of Hinduism chatting at a heavenly cocktail party, or perhaps the collective roar of souls in hell.",

A standout feature of this island at the time we were visiting was a three story castle that a couple from California had built as their island retreat. They had purchased their five acres several years ago and began hauling all the necessary supplies to the island by landing craft and cargo containers at tremendous cost. They had few visitors and were more than eager to show us around the castle. Designed by a California architect it looked pretty good for a one-family detached castle. Its striking appearance would not have been out of place in an English country side. The high turreted roof was covered with wind generators and solar panels which supplied power for their power hungry appliances. They had it all. Two sets of washers and dryers, electric heating and AC, dish washers, freezers, refrigerators, massive electric stoves: all the conveniences that one would expect to find in a luxury house on Malibu beach in Southern California.",

Parking is a terrible problem in Milan; people park on sidewalks when they think they can get away with it, which is often, or they say, “I've brought my car,” by which they mean their car is a mile away, and your final destination two miles away. The medieval streets that wind around Via Spadari were not made for cars.",

I think he must have known that he would not come back.”\nMy Dear Dorothy,—You will think this is a very singular bequest. But I want you to see that my memory is fairly good.\nThe very singular bequest was a Bible, with three cigarette-lighters for markers, and a date on the fly-leaf: “July 5th, 1912.” The cigarette-lighters referred her to Psalm cxliv., and Isaiah xxxv. and xl., and pencil marks to the verses:\nBlessed be the Lord my strength which teacheth my hands to war and my fingers to fight. …\nAnd an highway shall be there … the redeemed shall walk there, and the ransomed of the Lord shall return …\n… They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.\nAnd their last hour came back to her with its mysterious, sweet and powerful passion that had no fear in it; and she laid hold again on the Reality they had seen and felt together.\nThe moment passed. She wanted it to come back, for as long as it lasted she was at peace.\nBut it did not come back. Nothing came back but her anguish of remorse for all that she had wasted.",

I watched the news on a small black-and-white TV, sitting cross-legged on the foot of my girlfriend’s bed. Her name was Charlene. We were fifteen. She was asleep, believing I had left after our evening’s usual heated, inconclusive cuddle. I had stopped, however, to watch the TV after I saw that Kennedy had been shot. It was after midnight and Charlene’s parents were out watching the voting results with friends. They were Republican Party activists. I heard them pull in the driveway and come in the house. I knew that Charlene’s father, who was an older man, always came in to kiss her good night, and I knew, well, the way out her window and how to catfoot it down to the street. Still, I sat there, unthinking yet cruelly resolved, until the bedroom door opened. Her father did not have a heart attack at the sight of me, calmly watching TV in my underwear, though he could have. I snatched up my clothes and dived out the window before he said a word. Charlene’s mother called my mother, and my mother gave me a serious talk about different types of girls, emphasizing the sanctity of “good girls,” such as Charlene, who belonged to some debutante club. I was embarrassed but unrepentant. Charlene and I had never had much to talk about.",

The leopard may still be present on this slope, for the rams are skittish. Even so, the rut is near, activity is constant, and GS scribbles in his notebook. “Oh, there’s a penis-lick!” he cries. “A beauty!” The onanism is mingled here and there with fighting, especially among the older rams, which rear repeatedly on their hind legs; remarkably, another rears at the same instant, and the two run forward like trained partners, coming down together with a crash of heads. For most creatures, such an encounter would be fatal, but bharal are equipped with some two inches of parietal bone between the horns, together with a cushion of air space in the sinuses, thick woolly head hair, and strong necks to absorb the shock, and the horns themselves, on the impact side, are very thick and heavy. Why nature should devote so many centuries—thousands, probably—to the natural selection of these characters that favor head-on collisions over brains is a good question, although speaking for myself in these searching days, less brains and a good head-on collision might be just the answer.",

Varner took a drink himself from the jug and shoved it back under the bed where a circle of dust marked the place where it had sat for years, and went to sleep. He entered his accustomed state of unsnoring and childlike slumber and did not hear his daughter mount the stairs, to remove this time the dress which had her own blood on it. The mare, the buggy, was gone by then, though McCarron fainted in it again before he reached home. The next morning the doctor found that, although the break had been properly set and splinted, nevertheless it had broken free since, the two bone-ends telescoping, and so had to be set again. But Varner did not know that—the father, the lean pleasant shrewd unillusioned man asleep in the bed above the whiskey jug twelve miles away, who, regardless of what error he might have made in the reading of the female heart in general and his daughter’s in particular, had been betrayed at the last by failing to anticipate that she would not only essay to, but up to a certain point actually support, with her own braced arm from underneath, the injured side.",

Marie elected to drive me up the mountain switchback as her racing car made much better time than mine on the steep gradients, and we set off one faultless morning, to sweep across the Mesaoria towards the foothills before the sun had fully breasted the bas­tions of the Gothic range and set the dust rising from the brittle and arid soils in which, by high summer, nothing more would grow until the autumn rains. The ugliness of the plain was, so to speak, at the height of its beauty – a range of tones vibrating with the colours of damson, cigar-leaf, putty and gold-leaf. Here and there upon a skyline, diminished by distance and somehow made the more significant for being so isolated and so small, a team of camels oozed across the dusty screen. Their riders wore coloured turbans, spots of cobalt or crimson or that resonant dark blue – a vitreous marine blue – which is so characteristically Turkish in tone.",

I reassured myself that it was mostly water and that I’d be fine. But I knew that the math definitely didn’t add up. I was still barely capable of taking in two thousand calories a day.
