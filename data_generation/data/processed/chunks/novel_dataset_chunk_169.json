Instead, she went outside and sat on the backyard steps and watched a hen near the lemon tree, guarding six chicks, nudging them toward crumbs on the ground. Ugwu was plucking avocados from the tree near the Boys’ Quarters. She was not sure how long she sat there before the hen began to squawk loudly and spread its wings to shield the chicks, but they did not run into the shelter quickly enough. A kite swooped down and carried one of them off, a brown-and-white chick. It was so fast, the descent of the kite and the gliding away with the chick grasped in hooked claws, that Olanna thought she might have imagined it. She couldn’t have, though, because the hen was running around in circles, squawking, raising clouds of dust. The other chicks looked bewildered. Olanna watched them and wondered if they understood their mother’s mourning dance. Then, finally, she started to cry.",

The air-conditioned restaurant serves good food at reasonable prices, beer is no dearer than in a Drankwinkel and at sunrise a waiter brings coffee around – or what passes for coffee in South Africa.",

The cams are online video feeds from cameras mounted here and there—on deck railings, burglar bars—and aimed at the ocean in places known to get waves. On days when the window of good surf is only a couple of hours, the cams tend to tell you what you missed. If it looks good, that is, on your screen, it’s probably too late. Conditions will deteriorate before you get there. You dash on an educated guess.",

It bulged distressingly under his exploring hand, and he removed the bottle in mounting desperation. He struck another match, setting the bottle down at his feet to do so, but there was nothing in which he might wrap the thing. His impulse was to grasp it and hurl it against the wall: already he pleasured in its anticipated glassy crash. But Mr. Talliaferro was quite honorable: he had passed his word. Or he might return to his friend’s room and get a bit of paper. He stood in hot indecision until feet on the stairs descending decided for him. He bent and fumbled for the bottle, struck it and heard its disconsolate empty flight, captured it at last and opening the street door anew he rushed hurriedly forth.",

Every once in a while I would pass a distant farmhouse whose windows were pools of yellow light, warm and inviting. Occasionally there would be a larger town, with a much larger pool of light scooped out of the darkness – the high school football field, where the week’s game was in progress. These football fields lit up the night; they were visible from miles off. As I drove through each town, it was clear that everybody was out at the game. There was nobody on the streets. Apart from one forlorn teenaged girl standing behind the counter in the local Dairy Queen, waiting for the post-game rush, everyone in town was at the football game. You could drive in with a fleet of trucks and strip the town during a high school football game in Iowa. You could blow open the bank with explosives and take the money out in wheelbarrows and no-one would be there to see it. But of course nobody would think of such a thing because crime doesn’t exist in rural Iowa. Their idea of a crime in these places would be to miss the Friday football game. Anything worse than that only exists on television and in the newspapers, in a semi-mythic distant land called the Big City.",

As he was being strapped into the chair, he cried out in Italian, “Long live anarchy!” then added in English, “Farewell, my wife and child, and all my friends!” (In fact, Sacco had two children; the error was attributed to nerves.) An unfortunate delay arose at this point because the head covering he was to wear could not be found. As Elliott and other officials searched for it, Sacco continued jabbering nervous farewells to friends and relatives. The headgear was found wedged under Madeiros’s body on a stretcher in a corridor and was hastily retrieved and plonked on Sacco’s head.",

But after sitting awhile the latter lady shivered no less than Grace as the warmth imparted by her hasty walking began to go off; and they felt the cold air drawing through the holly leaves which scratched their backs and shoulders. Moreover they could hear some drops of rain falling on the trees though none reached the nook in which they had ensconced themselves.",

It had all happened too fast; there had been talk of suitors the last time he visited, but she had spoken of Onyeka in such an indifferent way that he did not think she would accept his proposal so quickly.

The sun was well down the sky when I set out, and by nightfall I found myself in a mildly spurious kind of hunters’ tavern in a valley only five miles further on. There was an open stove and the walls were laden with guns, hunting knives, horns, animal traps, badgers, moorhens, weasels, pheasant and deer. Everything was made of wood, leather or horn and the chandelier was an interlock of antlers. There were even some genuine foresters among the people out for the evening from Krems. A tireless accordionist accompanied the singing and through the thickening haze of wine, even the soppiest songs sounded charming: ‘Sag beim Abschied leise “Servus”’, ‘Adieu, mein kleiner Gardeoffizier’, and ‘In einer kleinen Konditorei’. Songs from the White Horse Inn followed, and regimental marches of the most unmilitary kind, like the Deutschmeistermarsch (‘Wir sind vom K.u.K. Infanterieregiment’), the Kaiserjäger and Radetzky Marches and the Erzherzog-Johann-Lied. Musically speaking, London never plucks at the heart-strings. But Paris, from Villon to Maurice Chevalier and Josephine Baker, never stops, nor does Naples, nor, above all, does Vienna: ‘Goodnight Vienna’; ‘Ich möcht mal wieder in Grinzing sein; Wien, Wien, nur du allein!’ – they followed each other staunchlessly and the eyes of the singers grew mistier and mistier with homesickness. Then we moved on to the rival dreamland of Styria and the Tyrol: peaks, valleys, forests, streams, cowbells, shepherds’ flutes, chamois and eagles: ‘Zillertal, du bist mein Freud’!’, ‘Fern vom Tirolerland’, ‘Hoch vom Dachstein an’ … Everything became blurred and golden. The one I liked most was the Andreas-Hofer-Lied, a moving lament for the great mountain leader of the Tyrolese against Napoleon’s armies, executed in Mantua and mourned ever since. I found myself, with two new friends, still singing it in the small hours as we descended the valley. We passed the luminous vision of a watermill fossilized in ice and snow. When we reached the river, we rowed across to a circular bastion and a tall belfry glimmering among the trees on the other bank. As we climbed the steps into the starry town of Pöchlarn, a window opened and told us to stop making such a noise.",

Then an elderly woman noticed me, looked scared, called the doctor. He appeared in his underpants with soap suds in his hair; he had spent the day touring his district on foot – the paths were too steep for a riding-mule. A handsome young black, Sofiel towered over the stocky locals. Anxiously I asked if this was the path to Los Arroyos – it was.

They cannot get away from South Carolina, and if they get away they are no good. They drawl beautifully. There is the most wonderful warmth, affection, heartiness in their approach and greeting, but the people are afraid. Their eyes are desperately afraid, filled with a kind of tortured and envenomed terror of the old, stricken, wounded “Southness” of cruelty and lust. Sometimes their women have the honey skins, they are like gold and longing. They are filled with the most luscious and seductive sweetness, tenderness, and gentle mercy. But the men are stricken. They get fat about the bellies, or they have a starved, stricken leanness in the loins. They are soft-voiced and drawling, but their eyes will go about and go again with fear, with terror and suspicion. They drawl softly in front of the drug store, they palaver softly to the girls when the girls drive up, they go up and down the streets of blistered, sun-wide, clay-dust little towns in their shirt-sleeves, and they are full of hearty, red-faced greetings.",

An expat who shares my wavelength commented sadly, ‘In ’92 you could walk across any city street without looking left or right.’ Since then scores of magnificent trees have been felled to make way for a sudden proliferation of motor vehicles. This disastrous UNDP-funded ‘highway project’ also involves the razing of people’s homes and the concreting over of fish-filled canals and ponds which provided free protein for the poor. The loss of so many tall, wide-spreading trees rouses local anger for practical reasons. During the long hot dry season Vientiane’s temperature can reach 104 degrees F and pedestrians need tree-shaded routes. Moreover, many hawkers trade in the shade, their tiny stalls often seeming an integral part of some gigantic root system. Will ‘developed’ Vientiane offer hundreds of displaced hawkers an alternative way of living? They doubt this.",

Instead, the porter smiled, led us up the stairs and through a revolving, wooden door. The lobby was charming but dark and quiet. A clerk stood behind the desk and smiled at us. I just stood there, next to the porter, with my backpack strapped over my sweaty shoulders, and marveled at the room around me. The dark woods and marbled floors suggested wealth and luxury. The cool air filled my lungs and calmed my nerves. I didn’t even notice that Teresa had left my side. She found a huge, leather chair on the far side of the lobby and curled up for a nap.",

He was now past fifty and crippled by arthritis, yet he trailed the peripatetic royal court on mule-back, vainly pleading for the privileges and riches he felt were still owed him. One of his last surviving letters, asking the monarchs for “restitution of my honor and losses,” captures the self-pitying despair of his final years. “I am ruined,” he wrote, “alone, desolate, infirm, daily expecting death. . . . Weep for me, whoever has charity, truth and justice!”",

She had a round, nutbrown, soft face, all fine wrinkles, large, bright red lips (she chewed betel assiduously), and screwed up, winking, benevolent eyes. She was constantly in movement, scolding busily and ordering unceasingly a troop of young women with clear brown faces and big grave eyes, her daughters, her servants, her slave-girls. You know how it is in these households: it’s generally impossible to tell the difference. She was very spare, and even her ample outer garment, fastened in front with jewelled clasps, had somehow a skimpy effect. Her dark bare feet were thrust into yellow straw slippers of Chinese make. I have seen her myself flitting about with her extremely thick, long, grey hair falling about her shoulders. She uttered homely shrewd sayings, was of noble birth, and was eccentric and arbitrary. In the afternoon she would sit in a very roomy arm-chair, opposite her husband, gazing steadily through a wide opening in the wall which gave an extensive view of the settlement and the river.",
