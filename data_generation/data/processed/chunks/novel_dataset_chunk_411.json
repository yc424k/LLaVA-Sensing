Randy, tall and athletic-looking, was teetering restlessly from one foot to another as his glance went back and forth along the windows of the train in search of him. Margaret's strong, big-boned figure was planted solidly, her hands clasped loosely across her waist, and her eyes were darting from car to car with swift intensity. And as George swung down from the steps of the pullman and, valise in hand, strode towards the platform across the rock ballast of the roadbed and the gleaming rails, he knew instantly, with that intuitive feeling of strangeness and recognition; just what they would say to him at the moment of their meeting.",

Porphyreon was clearly still a prosperous place at a period when most of the other trading ports of the Levant were already in fast decline, and presumably this prosperity was linked to the olive-oil mills that the archaeologists dug up in their rescue excavations. After all, oil was a very valuable commodity, needed by cities around the Mediterranean for both cooking and lamplight, and its price was clearly marked up considerably in the process. St Augustine, used to the cheap oil of his rural North African childhood, could not believe the cost of lamp oil when he arrived in Rome for the first time, and complained bitterly about the expense it imposed on reading at night. But as the rich spread of mosaic-work around me demonstrated, the merchants of Porphyreon had used their profits well.",

She gazed with something almost like awe at the woman who had had the teaching of Stephen.\n‘Oh, but yes,’ smiled Mademoiselle Duphot, ‘I teached her. She was terribly naughty over her dictée; she would write remarks about the poor Henri—très impertinente she would be about Henri! Stévenne was a queer little child and naughty—but so dear, so dear—I could never scold her.\nWith me she done everything her own way.’\n‘Please tell me about that time,’ coaxed Mary.\nSo Mademoiselle Duphot sat down beside Mary and patted her hand: ‘Like me, you love her. Well now, let me recall—She would sometimes get angry, very angry, and then she would go to the stables and talk to her horse. But when she fence it was marvellous—she fence like a man, and she only a baby but extrêmement strong. And then…\nThe memories went on and on, such a store she possessed, the kind Mademoiselle Duphot.\nAs she talked her heart went out to the girl, for she felt a great tenderness towards young things: ‘I am glad that you come to live with our Stévenne now that Mademoiselle Puddle is at Morton. Stévenne would be desolate in the big house. It is charming for both of you this new arrangement. While she work you look after the ménage, is it not so? You take care of Stévenne, she take care of you. Oui, oui, I am glad you have come to Paris.’\nJulie stroked Mary’s smooth young cheek, then her arm, for she wished to observe through her fingers. She smiled: ‘Very young, also very kind. I like so much the feel of your kindness—it gives me a warm and so happy sensation, because with all kindness there must be much good.’\nWas she quite blind after all, the poor Julie?\nAnd hearing her Stephen flushed with pleasure, and her eyes that could see turned and rested on Mary with a gentle and very profound expression in their depths—at that moment they were calmly thoughtful, as though brooding upon the mystery of life—one might almost have said the eyes of a mother.\nA happy and pleasant visit it had been; they talked about it all through the evening.",

Across the street, a few women chatted at a snack bar and I inquired about the mud. One of the women walked me back over, stepped across the rope and explained the mud bath procedure. The attendant had probably wanted to go home early, she said. So, I went back to my room, put a suit on under my clothes and returned. The pool was very shallow, not all that warm and extremely slippery. I decided not to submerge or go near the bubbling hot spots, but reached down and scooped up the slimy mud from the bottom smearing it on my arms and legs. There was a slight burning sensation every so often and when I scraped the mud off, following the instructions on the posted signs, my skin was amazingly soft if not a little blotchy.",

More recently, police started working with electricity companies to identify the high power bills that were a tell-tale sign of warming lamps being used to grow cannabis. One study reported that some 6000 Dutch cannabis-growing sites were identified and closed in two years alone.",

From a world exclusively occupied in feeding wagons with sacks, half obliterated too in a fine yellow fog, they got neither help nor attention. It seemed a miracle when an old man approached, guessed their condition, and proposed to row them out to their ship in the little boat which he kept moored at the bottom of a flight of steps. With some hesitation they trusted themselves to him, took their places, and were soon waving up and down upon the water, London having shrunk to two lines of buildings on either side of them, square buildings and oblong buildings placed in rows like a child’s avenue of bricks.",

I went to Nirvana Café to talk to the travel agent. The agency was outdoors — made up of only one desk in the sand. After much deliberation, I chose to move on to Pondicherry, which was on the coast, all the way on the eastern side of the subcontinent in a state called Tamil Nadu.",

Then the weather turned cold, and the coal bill went up with a rush. The bungalow was not meant for winter, and Vance had to buy a couple of stoves and have the stovepipes pushed up through the roof. But in spite of these cares he was still hardly conscious of the lapse of time, and might have drifted on unaware to the end of the year if the old familiar money problem had not faced him. What with the coal and the stoves and the hired woman, and buying more blankets and some warm clothes, the monthly expenses had already doubled; what would it be when winter set in? Still, they had the derelict place for a song, and it would perhaps cost less to stay on there than to move.",

But eventually, after much twiddling of thumbs, the Libyans gave up and got forlornly back into their bus. Our passports were stamped and the chief official wished us ‘Bienvenu au Liban.’",

She stopped at a street-corner, drawing long panting breaths as if she had been running a race. Then, slowly and aimlessly, she began to saunter along a street of small private houses in damp gardens that led to the Avenue du Bois. She sat down on a bench. Not far off, the Arc de Triomphe raised its august bulk, and beyond it a river of lights streamed down toward Paris, and the stir of the city's heart-beats troubled the quiet in her bosom. But not for long. She seemed to be looking at it all from the other side of the grave; and as she got up and wandered down the Champs Elysees, half empty in the evening lull between dusk and dinner, she felt as if the glittering avenue were really changed into the Field of Shadows from which it takes its name, and as if she were a ghost among ghosts.",

Moving the rig through the streets on the way to the highway felt different from leaving the shop in Memphis with only a cab and a whole day to ramble back to Fort Worth. Today I had two trailers to pull and eight hours of driving when I could rely on no one but myself. Like any driver, if anything went wrong mechanically, I could call Wayne or the fleet service that had towed the overheated truck that Hilda and I had driven months ago. But it could take hours for anyone to reach a truck out on the open road. The phrase, “Where the rubber meets the road,” became a little more real.",

He was not a descendant of the eponymous Harris of Harrisburgh. He had found his own lode in Anchorage in the nineteen-forties when he quit as a deliveryman for a dry-cleaning company and, with another driver, borrowed something over three thousand dollars and started the Alaska Cleaners, 610 Fireweed, Anchorage—a hanging-clothes forest, wherein someone presses a button and twenty miles of garments begin to move. Frank Harris is a lean man, bald, gentle in voice, with long jaws, an English face. He was elected to the Alaska State Senate in 1966, defeated in 1968. The urge to move the capital came over him during those two years. Sessions began in January and ran on at least three months (of late they have been extending through June), and Harris in Juneau developed what he called “a complete feeling of isolation—stuck there.” He found Juneau “a dilapidated city, buildings unpainted, streets dirty, sidewalks crumbling,” and could not imagine “people having pride in a state capital in such condition.” He lived in a big concrete coop that was painted pink—the Mendenhall Apartments. The wind blew so hard it seemed to come through the paint. He covered his windows with sheets and masking tape, and, even so, he could not stay warm. “The Capitol Building was cold, too, if you could get to it, leaning into the Taku wind. The rain didn’t bother me. I come from Oregon. I could not imagine how any place could be so isolated. People couldn’t get at you. You were in a cage. You talked to the hard lobbyists every day. Every day the same people. What was going on there needed more airing.” So he sponsored a bill to move the capital. The day he introduced it, the news went out over the radio, and when he went to have lunch in the Baranof Hotel a waitress refused to serve him. In the State Affairs Committee, a legislator from Juneau killed the bill. Each of the three times that a capital-move initiative has appeared on the Alaska ballot, it has been as a result of a people’s petition. “The legislature could do it,” Harris has explained, “but they don’t have the guts.”",

The sanitation workers and the train employees and the national airline all went on strike on the same day. A study has just been released saying that 36 percent of Italian children have an allergy to the gluten needed to make pasta, pizza and bread, so there goes Italian culture. Even worse, I recently saw an article with the shocking headline: “Insoddisfatte 6 Donne su 10!” Meaning that six out of ten Italian women are sexually unsatisfied. Moreover, 35 percent of Italian men are reporting difficulty maintaining un’erezione, leaving researchers feeling very perplessi indeed, and making me wonder if SEX should be allowed to be Rome’s special word anymore, after all.",

At every point in my journey, there is an intersection where my world touches the newly discovered world; at this intersection there is a give and a take. I take something from the world I visit, but I also give something to it. I am transformed, but I transform it too. Most of the time these interactions happen naturally, unconsciously, without any premeditation. My world may be said to be “entering” the world I visit, just as the latter enters my world. My interactions with the village kids in Papua and India, for example, may have planted the seed of desire in one single curious child to travel outside his country—such indirect and hidden influences may end up marking the life of people in enormous ways. In the few photographs where locals had asked me to pose with them, and which are now scattered around the world in photo albums, the intersection of the two worlds is vividly captured and preserved forever.",

The presence of a responsible white man seemed a rest at once. We had several more gulches to cross, but none of them were dangerous; and we rode the last seven miles at a great pace, though the mire and water were often up to the horses' knees, and came up to Onomea at full gallop, with spirit and strength enough for riding other twenty miles. Dry clothing, hot baths, and good tea followed delightfully upon our drowning ride. I remained over Sunday at Onomea, and yesterday rode here with a native in heavy rain, and received a warm welcome. Our adventures are a nine days' wonder, and every one says that if we had had a white man or an experienced native with us, we should never have been allowed to attempt the perilous ride. I feel very thankful that we are living to tell of it, and that Deborah is not only not worse but considerably better. E— will expect some reflections; but none were suggested at the time, and I will not now invent what I ought to have thought and felt.",

It soaks into the spirit of the wanderer; his heart is dull with the grey weariness of despair, it aches with hunger for the wilderness, the howling of great winds, the bite and sparkle of the clear, cold air, the buzz, the tumult and the wild exultancy. The wet, woollen air is all about him, and there is no hope. It was there before William the Conqueror; it was there before Clovis and Charles ‘the Hammer’; it was there before Attila; it was there before Hengist and Horsa; it was there before Vercingetorix and Julius Agricola.",

The smoke drifts and the flames move, perhaps towards someone else’s land. It is only then that we’re able to breathe properly, and it’s only then that we can truly see. Our trail, the highway, divides two different worlds. Closest to the mountain, it’s a sprawling grey-black desert. The only things left are occasional trees, limbs scorched like survivors of a dark apocalypse. Vultures circle in ever-decreasing clumps, shadow creatures hunched over for the feast. But on the other side . . . I can’t believe it. It’s the jungle as I know it, thick, endless and baffling, shining from the inside out with a glow like sunlight through glass. The only clue that things aren’t right is the silence. Other than the caw of the vultures, there is very little noise at all. There aren’t any frogs or crickets. No monkeys, owls and butterflies. Everyone has gone.",

The idea of resuming the drudgery of his duties at Princeton, once merely unpleasant, was now unthinkable. Within days of his return from Colombia, he was off to Yale to plead his case with President Hadley once again. Unbeknownst to Bingham, Hadley had already surveyed the members of the history faculty, who had reacted coolly to his inquiries about hiring Bingham as a junior professor in their department.",

Every morning, I took a pail up to the big house for my allowance of milk. At intervals, a Mexican with a cart brought me a load of firewood, and I was given kerosene for my lamps. I was also given a horse named Tom, who lived and grazed in the yard around the house. Included in his outfit was a pair of saddlebags for weekly shopping expeditions, when I would jog into Taos, hitch him to the post in the plaza, and lay in a supply of canned food. Sometimes I stabled Tom at Maria's, in Taos, for the night, so that we could go to a dance. After the party, warm under enormous eiderdowns, we would talk about Boston until her mother yelled at us to shut up. In the morning, I would jog back, clippety-clop, to Ranchos through the snow. I got awfully cold as winter came on, but the fireplace was efficient, and in the stencilling room was a red-hot stove. The other stencillers and I used to talk as we worked—about Life and Art and Right and Wrong. Sometimes we were called on to supply a verse or a motto, always in a hurry, when Mr. Kirwan dashed in from the printshop demanding two or four lines. I was proud of the verse I produced one morning:",

Anyway, Faye said, she was desperate to see a hairdresser and they wanted to visit Cairo. So, promising to write, we wished each other luck, and after yet another sad goodbye, returned to the boats.
