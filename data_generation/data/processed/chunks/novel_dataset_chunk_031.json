The driver patted the dust off his front seat and, with a flourish, presented me with the place of honor beside him (a rather mixed blessing, I felt, since the person in the front seat had to enjoy the gearshift thrust between his legs). A woman—a rather thick peasant woman—bundled into the front seat beside me, one snot-nosed issue perched on her lap, another suckling furiously at her breast. Seven or eight other unfortunates piled into the gloom behind us. The woman held her nostrils and violently expelled the contents of her nose. A man behind me—rather inauspiciously, I thought—began muttering a series of prayers. The others tuned up with a preparatory series of coughs, groans, and sneezes. And so we rattled off toward the breakneck curves.",

The flocks of vacationers, overwhelmingly Italian, had long since returned to the cities. The seaside businesses had packed up their lounge chairs, umbrellas, dressing cabins, bathrooms and entire restaurants and nightclubs, all stored away in an undisclosed location, to be taken out and reconstructed again the following June. One large, abandoned central building and a lone fisherman’s shelter were left behind. On Sundays this ‘men’s only’ beach refuge boasted animated conversation and card games. During the week, the occasional net was repaired, and boat cleaned and painted. At the other end of the beach, a group of fishing boats pulled up onto the sand served as an ad hoc fishmonger, where early birds could buy fresh fish from the briny hands of those who had caught them. Nearby, an unsmiling, kerchiefed old woman sat out in front of her house in cold weather, her back to the sea, her black clothes absorbing the warmth of the sun as it reflected off her bright, white wall.",

Vertically, the distances between the pairs are equal. But horizontally, the distance between each window is more than twice the distance between it and the inside of the corner buttresses. Apart from windows, the walls are decorated with a pattern of small shallow niches, oblong and upright, which cut across the joints of the stonework as if they were clamps—though clamps with the light and shade reversed, in the manner of a photographic negative.",

He laughed at my puns, learned to waltz and two-step because I loved dancing, let me correct him when he charmingly pronounced English words in the French way, calling a Viking a “weeking” and Levi’s jeans, “leh-wiss.” He admired my knowledge of Mozart and Chopin, called me “cherie adorée.”",

His pitying emotion at the marks of time upon the face of that woman, the air of frailty and weary fatigue that had settled upon the eyes and temples of the “Never-tired Señora” (as Don Pépé years ago used to call her with admiration), touched him almost to tears. “Don’t go yet.

My fears were needless; it was something wholly preferable. In the doorway stood the hotelier. He was holding a breakfast tray. A few minutes later he returned with a bucket of piping-hot water. He bowed as magnificently as an Abyssinian slave from The Arabian Nights and withdrew. This was more like it. I washed, got back into bed, rolled into the comfortable mid-mattress trough, and demolished the contents of the tray: sliced tomatoes, olives, crusty bread and white feta cheese. Sipping a tulip glass of tea, I looked out of the window at the bustling bazaar.",

    "target_paragraph": "My hotel was huge, half ruined and the only one left: a monument to Stalin which rang with my footsteps. Four policemen gazed stonily from an office across the hall, and concierges still slumped at their corridor desks. In the cavernous dining-room canned dance-music played for nobody.\nI walked in the streets without knowing where to go. I wondered vaguely if I were being followed. The sallow people wandering the pavements could be thinking whatever you ascribed to them. It was oddly quiet. A populace of old men sat remote in the arid squares, and spoke with me in dislocated phrases and half-smiles. They were Latvians and Ukrainians, exiled long ago, and were taking the air with reticent surprise.\nFor it was warm, with a dense, midsummer stillness. By eight o’clock in the evening the sun was still high, and at eleven the sky held a limpid, refracted light, as if it were illuminating the town through black gauze. But not one in ten windows was lit. Lost in its suburbs, I had a fantasy that the past, like something viscous and unreconciled, was leaking back in, inhabiting abandoned rooms, reclaiming the factories. Those who had died here far outnumbered the living. They had built the city in chains, and lie beneath it. Yet at midnight people were still walking their mongrels in the roads, and reading newspapers.",

Searching the Internet for a place to stay, I discovered that many hotels and the large, all-inclusive vacation complexes were closed most of the year. When traveling alone without a car, I searched for accommodations accessible by train that had a congenial, helpful staff. I found a small, family-run, two-star property in Nicolò di Ricadi that had the sort of reviews I was looking for—excellent food, warm hosts and tranquil location in the country. The hotel opened on Easter weekend with the father in the kitchen, daughter at the front desk, son at the bar and other family members, young and old, dispersed in various occupations. I was their first customer of the season and my clean, brightly decorated room with private bath had a sea view with the Sicilian island of Stromboli in the distance. Pensione completa (full room and board) came to forty-three Euros a night with beverages being an extremely reasonable extra. I had chosen wisely. The two-star rating was an enigma.",

The Six-Day War sent most Palestinians fleeing into Jordan from dwellings that for generations had been clustered around the mosque. When the village’s total demolition took place in 1971 those remaining (200 or so) were ‘relocated’ to a hamlet that at first sight seems abandoned. Then I noticed two new houses at the edge and associated them with the IDF’s masts – gigantic constructions, visible from the Old City walls. Until 1986 this isolated community had to buy water from far away; both their springs had been requisitioned for the benefit of Ramot, a nearby settlement. All building is forbidden; Nabi Samuel is not even allowed to maintain its tracks and pathways. Nor may its inhabitants use personal cars; they must walk to the main road, then take a taxi. The Apartheid Barrier now cuts them off from 90% of their land and Monika told us the surrounding area (part of the West Bank) had just been set aside for development as a ‘National Park’ to be run by Israel’s tourist authority.",

The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out. There was the bargaining with the cabman. The moment was lost in vulgar details. It was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove away. She was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted. She consoled herself by telling Sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be, now that she had only one child to look after. She remembered the phrase. It had pleased her. Of the threat she said nothing. It was vividly and dramatically expressed. She felt that they would all laugh at it some day.",

There was a policeman on duty, but he did nothing to interfere with the continually growing crowd beyond checking it when it threatened to overflow into the main street, because he too wanted to listen; for the preacher's were the words that go straight to every heart, and most men would like, if possible, to be saved.",

It was paid for by a soul lost and by a vanished life. The blank stillness of awe was succeeded by a gust of immense pride.

At length, emboldened by the modest success of these beginnings and feeling that a clever young journalist should display an intelligent curiosity about the current affairs of the nation to which he is a visitor, he asked a question about the government of the period, of which Herriot was the leader and which was dominantly socialist.",

As for the conventional wisdom that Mubarak was alienating large swathes of the population by the heavy-handedness of his measures, that was not the story you heard on the streets. While no one denied that the police were capable of behaving extremely roughly with suspects, people complained less about the abuse of human rights than about the fact that the crackdown had been so long delayed.",

The fireworks lasted an hour, the dance music an hour longer. At twelve, three young men on motorcycles came zooming over the damp sand, gunning their engines and shouting at the tops of their voices. For twenty minutes they raced up and down the beach, passing within three yards of my feet. At twenty past twelve, the most daring of them decided to race through the shelter where I was lying, but by leaping up, screaming, and frantically flapping my arms at his headlamp, I managed to spare the doctors at Niigata Hospital the inconvenience of conducting a midnight postmortem.",

She saw by degrees that since their first and only encounter his mobile face had grown more thoughtful, and had acquired a young man’s shapely moustache and beard – the latter of the palest straw colour where it began upon his cheeks, and deepening to a warm brown farther from its root. Under his linen milking-pinner he wore a dark velveteen jacket, cord breeches and gaiters, and a starched white shirt. Without the milking-gear nobody could have guessed what he was. He might with equal probability have been an eccentric landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman. That he was but a novice at dairy-work she had realized in a moment, from the time he had spent upon the milking of one cow.",

The mice, singularly quiet for a change, make themselves scarce. The snake is passive, apparently contented, and makes no resistance when I pick him up with my hands and drape him over an arm or around my neck. When I take him outside into the wind and sunshine his favorite place seems to be inside my shirt, where he wraps himself around my waist and rests on my belt. In this position he sometimes sticks his head out between shirt buttons for a survey of the weather, astonishing and delighting any tourists who may happen to be with me at the time. The scales of a snake are dry and smooth, quite pleasant to the touch. Being a cold-blooded creature, of course, he takes his temperature from that of the immediate environment – in this case my body.",

I have perhaps an inflated fondness for it because on my first visit there, in 1993, I arrived by way of Johannesburg, where I had just been robbed in a fairly hair-raising manner, in broad daylight in the city center, by a party of cheerfully menacing youths with twitchy knives, and it was such a relief to find myself in a city where I could wander without fear that I might be bundled into an alley, liberated of my possessions, and liberally incised with sharp instruments.",

These utterly desolate pampas emit a sultry heat during the day, though as with all desert climates it is considerably cooler by night. The thought that Valdivia came through this way with his handful of men, traveling 50 or 60 kilometers a day without discovering a drop of water or even some shrub to shelter from the hottest hours, leaves a strong impression. Knowledge of the terrain actually crossed by the conquistadors automatically elevates Valdivia’s feat to one of the most notable of Spanish colonization, without doubt superior to those that endure in the history of America because more fortunate explorers found wealthy kingdoms at the end of their adventurous wars, turning the sweat of their conquest into gold.",

I can see my daughter and her boyfriend, slathered in tanning oil, reading novels on chaise longues, a pitcher of iced tea between them. The terrace floor is just like the floors in the house, only the tile is beautifully weathered and mossy. Signor Rizzatti, however, regards the tiles with a frown. When we go downstairs, he points to the ceiling of the limonaia, just underneath the terrace, which also is caked with moss and is even crumbling in some spots. Leaks. This looks expensive.
