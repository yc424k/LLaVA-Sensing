The upper reaches of the Elqui valley have become a kind of mystic spiritual centre, attracting a range of disparate tranquillity seekers from Vedic sects to devotees of the extra-terrestrial. We had come across various hippy types in the valley playing plangent guitar music and chanting in incense shops run by women in kaftans. A combination of geographical and atmospheric factors, notably the Humboldt current offshore, the vast cloudless Atacama desert to the north, and the laminar air flow over the Andes (whatever that is) creates the clearest sky on the planet right over the Elqui valley, and it has consequently been labelled ‘a window to the heavens’ and ‘the magnetic centre of the earth’ – hence its concentration of ‘spiritual’ disciples. Naturally the valley has attracted the scientific community too, and three of the most important astronomy centres in the southern hemisphere have been built, with foreign capital, in the region.",

But neither the Briton nor the American moved. They just sat there while across the table from them the German general sat with his lifted and rigid glass; he said, indomitable and composed, not even contemptuous: ‘So then. All that remains is to acquaint your Commander-in-Chief with what part of our earlier discussion he might be inclined to hear. Then the formal ratification of our agreement.’",

Once opened, the small vent hatch’s metal grid blocked debris from coming in the truck, but allowed air to enter swiftly with the speed of highway travel. The truck rolled along the Kentucky highway in what I called the scary forest, the stretch of road that had reminded me of Oz. We had already passed the few truck stops near Louisville and were at least an hour away from any others near Cincinnati.",

He had already telegraphed to his friend that he would be at the mills the next day; but the southern express did not leave till the afternoon, and he still had several hours in which to consider what he should say to his wife. To postpone the dreaded task, he invented the pretext of some business to be despatched, and taking the Subway to Wall Street consumed the morning in futile activities. But since the renunciation of his work at Westmore he had no active concern with the financial world, and by twelve o'clock he had exhausted his imaginary affairs and was journeying up town again. He left the train at Union Square, and walked along Fourth Avenue, now definitely resolved to go back to the hotel and write his letter before lunching.",

    "target_paragraph": "Miami to St Augustine\nJanuary, 2017\nOn the ocean we have ample time to think, meditate, observe, listen, to notice the colors in the sky, the flickering of the stars, the sounds of the wind and the water. We appreciate things we would otherwise overlook, like the texture of the water and the patterns in the way it moves in all three dimensions. We see animals and have ample time to ponder their existence, to attempt to communicate with them telepathically. It doesn’t matter if the rest of the world would think this ridiculous, because we are at sea and they are not. We have the time to do as we please, and time is the greatest resource to have, so much of it is claimed by other obligations; it is precious.\nAlone at sea as a solo sailor, undistracted by others, I can sort through my past experiences and lessons, appreciate the glory of the present moment, and plan for the future. I re-organize my priorities based on all the knowledge I have gained so far in this life, and I re-define what is good. I appreciate the value of simple things, like breathing clean air, staying afloat, being alive. I appreciate the power of a clean mind, the euphoria of sobriety. I appreciate a dream realized.\nThe Earth is a school, and the ocean is a classroom, a gymnasium, a playground, and a detention center. Nature is a place to learn and grow. We learn and grow on land among other people as well, but it is the solo experience deep in nature that mankind is currently deprived of and hungers for, knowingly or unknowingly. It is here that we expand our minds and heal our souls. It is here that we reconnect with our ancient past. This is where we used to live. This is where we evolved. It is only in recent human history that we left nature and built civilizations cut off from her. Returning to nature is essential to inner peace and spiritual fulfilment, and the deeper one ventures into nature, the deeper this experience, the greater the reward, and the greater the risk.",

I spent the closing hours of the afternoon studying a map of Stockholm and waiting for the weather to clear. At about five the sky brightened. I immediately pulled on my damp sneakers and went out to explore the streets between Norrmalmstorg, a nearby square, and Kungstradgarden, a small rectangular park that ran down to the waterfront. Everything was much better now. It was a Saturday evening and the streets were full of people meeting friends or partners and repairing in high spirits to the little restaurants and bistros scattered around the neighbourhood.",

A peacock butterfly now spread himself upon the teasle, fresh and newly emerged, as the blue and chocolate down on his wings testified. Mrs Pascoe went indoors, fetched a cream pan, came out, and stood scouring it. Her face was assuredly not soft, sensual, or lecherous, but hard, wise, wholesome rather, signifying in a room full of sophisticated people the flesh and blood of life. She would tell a lie, though, as soon as the truth. Behind her on the wall hung a large dried skate. Shut up in the parlour she prized mats, china mugs, and photographs, though the mouldy little room was saved from the salt breeze only by the depth of a brick, and between lace curtains you saw the gannet drop like a stone, and on stormy days the gulls came shuddering through the air, and the steamers’ lights were now high, now deep. Melancholy were the sounds on a winter’s night.",

Its sunny, white churches, covered bridges, tidy farms, and clustered villages are an ideal complement to the rich, earthy colors of nature. Moreover, there is a variety in its trees that few other areas achieve: oaks, beeches, aspens, sumacs, four varieties of maples, and others almost beyond counting provide a contrast that dazzles the senses. Finally, and above all, there is the brief, perfect balance of its climate in fall, with crisp, chilly nights and warm, sunny days, which help to bring all the deciduous trees to a coordinated climax. So make no mistake. For a few glorious days each October, New England is unquestionably the loveliest place on earth.",

Lady Otway sighed, it may be at the faded relics, and turned, with resignation, to her balls of wool, which, curiously and characteristically, were not an ivory-white, but rather a tarnished yellow-white. She had called her niece in for a little chat. She had always trusted her, and now more than ever, since her engagement to Rodney, which seemed to Lady Otway extremely suitable, and just what one would wish for one’s own daughter. Katharine unwittingly increased her reputation for wisdom by asking to be given knitting-needles too.",

She had also painted in two eyebrows and drawn around her daughter’s eyes, so she now resembled a cartoon character. I glanced in the mirror at my own reflection. I looked like I had slept in a bin.

As the train rolled towards the town, women dried laundry by riverbeds, boys covered in soap showered under hosepipes hung over branches of blossoms, and a man handed out snacks to a herd of goats, giving a greedy one a quick slap across the face. Our bags were stacked in the doorway and as the train pulled into Nagercoil, passengers pushed the load aside and jumped off while the train was still moving.",

At times, I felt as if I were walking into a scene from Jurassic Park, as the shrill calls of birds and macaque monkeys echoed off the limestone and drifted in from the unseen world beyond the skylight. The vegetation is extremely diverse with lush and green foliage in parts where sunrays break through the openings; and practically non-existent in the inner sanctum of the cave.",

He received us with splendid teasing ceremony, always addressing my chaperon as Monsieur le Chargé d’Affaires des États-Unis. He asked to what he owed the extreme honour of this visit. He then telephoned to a military chum and colleague whom he must have seen the night before if not that morning. With the same beautiful stateliness he began, “Mon Colonel, je profite de l’occasion de vous rendre mes hommages respectueux,” and went on to outline the situation: une dame Américaine de haute distinction wanted to fly on one of their planes to the Tibesti. It appeared this could be done. The fare was discussed, far from cheap; the plane would not be going for four days, and one had to take another plane back within two days or be stuck in the desert for over a week. It all began to seem more trouble than it was worth.",

(In terms of per-capita income, Aomori is the second poorest of all the forty-seven prefectures, Yamagata is the ninth, Akita the sixteenth.) This is partly due to the long, harsh winters, the heavy snows of the Japan Sea coast, and the fogs that roll in from the north Pacific to blight the towns and sour the farmers. Most Japanese, for all their complaints about population density, have grown so used to big city comforts that they no more want to live in Tohoku than they want to live in Hokkaido. The climate is too bitter, the living too hard. And so in recent years as the old cottage industries of rice-straw weaving and charcoal burning have declined to the level of picturesque jokes, and as television has broadcast throughout the country its slick versions of the urban gospel, the population of Tohoku, despite the region’s size and the richness of much of its soil, has dwindled to a bare eight percent of the nation’s total.",

Walk along the main national highway, unpaved a few minutes out of town—a lone cyclist peddling past in the rustic, languid light—and you can feel yourself in some sepia-colored dream of a temple in a jungle from an earlier time. But tugging at you from the edge of the idyll is a girl who stops at the waist, rolling towards you in her aged wheelchair, and pulling you back into something primeval—atavistic— where all the lights are off and you can’t tell right from wrong.",

Working by night, he held candles in the slipfaces of the dunes - their ‘undercliffs’ - in order to determine the ‘wind regimes’ that controlled the behaviour of sand there. In the heat of the day, he walked for miles through what he called ‘the streets’ - the corridors of low ground that the dunes preserved between themselves, even as they moved - and he walked along the fine lines of the trailing wing-tips of barchan dunes, which reached up to ninety feet high. In an effort to determine the different possible liquidities of quicksand, he took to jumping up and down on the surface of the firmer pools, and recorded that such leaps could make ‘a real circular wave radiate outwards for several metres in the undulate sand’. In prose of beautiful precision, Bagnold catalogued the dunes and the physics of their behaviour: their serpentine crests, their rounded windward shoulders, and their steep leeward slipfaces, ‘where the slope of the dune surface reaches the limit of steepness imposed by the angle of shear of the deposited material’.",

    "target_paragraph": "Roddy began to fill me in on who some of the other guys were. The fat guy who appeared on bigger days, taking off far outside and ripping so hard that the rest of us stopped surfing to watch, was Ben Aipa, he said. (Years later, Aipa photos and stories began to fill the mags.) The Chinese guy who showed up on the biggest day I had seen yet at Cliffs—a solid, out-of-season south swell on a windless, overcast afternoon—was Leslie Wong. He had a silky style, and he only deigned to surf Cliffs when it was exceptionally good. Leslie Wong caught and pulled into the wave of the day, his back slightly arched, his arms relaxed, making the extremely difficult—no, come on, the ecstatic—look easy. When I grew up, I wanted to be Leslie Wong. Among the Cliffs regulars, I slowly got to know who was likely to waste a wave—fail to catch it, or fall off—and then how to quietly snag the wave myself without showing disrespect. Even in a mild-mannered crowd, it was important not to show up anyone.",

Would you go see the world’s third largest whirlpool in a boat slightly larger than your family car? The words “ticket scalping” come to mind. The churn at the counter is at such a fever pitch that I can’t elbow my way in to make an announcement about the unexpected availability of one seat.

In fact, Jakarta, with a population of more than 10.5 million people, is sinking. Like many coastal cities around the world, it is vulnerable to sea-level rise. Built on what was once a swamp, the city has serious water supply problems as well, and the air is severely polluted. It is one of the fastest-sinking cities in the world. If this goes unchecked, parts of the megacity could be entirely submerged by 2050. As a result, the Indonesian government plans to move the capital to East Kalimantan, on the island of Borneo.",

After taking a walk we went to the library, where the assistant, extremely agitated, rushed in to tell us that El Cisne was sailing at 11:30 a.m. It was already 11:05. We gathered our things together quickly and, because I was still suffering from asthma, took a taxi which charged us half a Peruvian libra for Iquitos’ eight blocks. We reached the boat and discovered it wasn’t leaving until three, though it was required that we board by one. We weren’t brave enough to disobey and go to eat at the hospital and, at any rate, it was more convenient not to, because now we could ‘forget’ the syringe they had loaned us. We ate terrible and expensive food with an Indian belonging to the Yagua tribe, strangely attired in a red straw skirt and a few necklaces of the same straw; his name was Benjamín but he spoke almost no Spanish. Just above his left shoulder blade he had a scar from a bullet shot at almost point-blank range, because of ‘vinganza,’fn2 according to him.",

Only two other customers are here, local men bent over their bowls of penne, each eating as though he were alone. We order pasta with black truffles, a carafe of wine. Afterward we walk around in the quiet, quiet streets. A few boys play soccer in the empty piazza. Their shouts ring in the cold air. The outdoor tables are stored, the bar doors closed tight with everyone inside breathing smoke. No cars. A lone dog on a walk. Totally emptied of foreigners, except us, the town reveals its silences, the long nights when men play cards way past the nine o’clock bells, the deserted streets that look returned to their medieval origins. At the duomo wall, we look out over the lights of the valley. A few other people lean on the wall, too. When we’re really freezing we walk back up the street and open the bar door to a burst of noise. The cocoa, steamed on the espresso machine, is thick as pudding. One day back and I’m falling in love with winter.",
