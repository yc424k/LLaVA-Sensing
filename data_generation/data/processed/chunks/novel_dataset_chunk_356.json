    "target_paragraph": "This was more than many people could countenance. At a convention of the American Jewish Congress in New York, the keynote speaker, Bernard S. Deutsch, attacked Laughlin in the bitterest terms. “Dr. Laughlin’s ‘purification of race’ theory is as dangerous and as spurious as the purified Aryan race theories advanced by the Nazis, to which it bears suspicious resemblance,” Deutsch said. The Carnegie Institution, the Eugenics Record Office’s chief source of funding, appointed Herbert Spencer Jennings, a respected geneticist from Johns Hopkins University, to review Laughlin’s work. Jennings found that Laughlin had falsified data, manipulated findings to support racist conclusions, and generally perpetrated scientific fraud for over a quarter of a century. Laughlin was forced to step down from the ERO, which was effectively closed in 1938. Laughlin retired to Missouri, but a huge amount of damage had been done.",

    "target_paragraph": "Even walks were incalculable excepting on Saturdays, when at noon Anna turned out the schoolrooms. Then—unless to Miriam’s great satisfaction it rained and they had a little festival shut in in holiday mood in the saal, the girls playing and singing, Anna loudly obliterating the week-days next door and the secure harbour of Sunday ahead—they went methodically out and promenaded the streets of Hanover for an hour. These Saturday walks were a recurring humiliation. If they had occurred daily, some crisis, she felt sure would have arisen for her.\nThe little party would file out under the leadership of Gertrude—Fräulein Pfaff smiling parting directions adjuring them to come back safe and happy to the beehive and stabbing at them all the while, Miriam felt, with her keen eye—through the high doorway that pierced the high wall and then—charge down the street. Gertrude alone, having been in Hanover and under Fräulein Pfaff’s care since her ninth year, was instructed as to the detail of their tour and she swung striding on ahead, the ends of her long fur boa flying out in the March wind, making a flourishing scrollwork round her bounding tailor-clad form—the Martins, short-skirted and thick-booted, with hard cloth jackets and hard felt hats, and short thick pelerines almost running on either side, Jimmie, Millie and Judy hard behind. Miriam’s ever-recurring joyous sense of emergence and her longing to go leisurely and alone along these wonderful streets, to go on and on at first and presently to look, had to give way to the necessity of keeping Gertrude and her companions in sight. On they went relentlessly through the Saturday throng along the great Georgstrasse—a foreign paradise, with its great bright cafés and the strange promising detail of its shops—tantalisingly half seen.\nShe hated, too, the discomfort of walking thus at this pace through streets along pavements in her winter clothes. They hampered her horribly. Her heavy three-quarter length cloth coat made her too warm and bumped against her as she hurried along—the little fur pelerine which redeemed its plainness tickled her neck and she felt the outline of her stiff hat like a board against her uneasy forehead. Her inflexible boots soon tired her.... But these things she could have endured. They were not the main source of her troubles. She could have renounced the delights all round her, made terms with the discomforts and looked for alleviations. But it was during these walks that she began to perceive that she was making, in a way she had not at all anticipated, a complete failure of her rôle of English teacher. The three weeks’ haphazard curriculum had brought only one repetition of her English lesson in the smaller schoolroom; and excepting at meals, when whatever conversation there was was general and polyglot, she was never, in the house, alone with her German pupils. The cessation of the fixed readings arranged with her that first day by Fräulein Pfaff did not, in face of the general absence of method, at all disturb her. Mademoiselle’s classes had, she discovered, except for the weekly mending long since lapsed altogether. These walks, she soon realised, were supposed to be her and her pupils’ opportunity. No doubt Fräulein Pfaff believed that they represented so many hours of English conversation—and they did not. It was cheating, pure and simple. She thought of fee-paying parents, of the probable prospectus. “French and English governesses.”",

The landscape was inexpressibly bleak, just mile after tedious mile of snowy waste and scraggly birch forest. Reindeer grazed along the roadside and often on it itself, coming out to lick the salt scattered on the ice. We passed through a couple of Lapp villages, looking frigid and lifeless. There were no Christmas lights in the windows here. In the distance, the sun just peeked over the low hills, lingered uncertainly, and then sank back. It was the last I would see of it for three weeks.",

That was Nizar. I looked at his face and trusted him. I invited him to come to the Chicken Shack with me. It was something for him to do. But to leave the perimeter of the camp, Nizar had to take along his ID, a piece of paper that had his name, photograph, and civic status which said: ‘Status pending’.",

Yet few dispute the need for an election soon; this self-appointed interim government is too unsettling, something more noticeable in Bucharest than elsewhere. Here many shops, hairdressers, hotels, offices, pharmacies, restaurants and so on have closed, or open only briefly and irregularly, and there is a general sense of passive anarchy – of a society close to collapse. I find the city unexhilarating despite ‘Incredible!’ being constantly in use to express the joy of being free to display and discuss political documents stating precisely what the individual thinks, wants, believes. Too much violence and terror, too many deaths and injuries have left the citizens with long-term shock in their eyes. And there’s an odd hush over Bucharest, apart from those geysers of political debate. People queue or walk, or ride on the Metro or trolleybuses, in silence and unsmiling. When a whole city is behaving thus, the feeling is quite eerie.",

For any one who had enjoyed the friendship of such men as Langley Wyndham and Flaxman Reed, there was bathos in the step; it seemed an ugly concession to actuality. It may have been; for Audrey was nothing if not modern, the daughter of an age that has flirted with half-a-dozen ideals, all equally fascinating, and finally decided in favour of a mature realism. She may have learned that hardest lesson of the schools, the translation of life's drama from fancy into fact; found out that all the time the grey old chorus has been singing, not of love and joy, as she once in her ignorance imagined, but of unspeakable rest on the great consoling platitudes of life, where there is no more revelation because there is no mystery, and no despair because there is no hope. The text of that chorus is often corrupt, but the meaning is never hopelessly obscure. In other words, she may have married Mr. Jackson in a fit of pessimism.",

After a complicated drive through narrow alleyways we stopped at the entrance to an untidy, shrine-crowded courtyard and found the Brahmin priest sitting cross-legged in a corner of his first-floor room. Before him stood a low table, covered with geometrical signs, and when Donbahadur had briefly explained our problem the soothsayer picked up a handful of dry earth, scattered it over the table, consulted a dog-eared book that had been lying on the ground beside him and began to draw or write in the earth with a four-inch glass cylinder. Meanwhile an old woman who was threshing rice in another corner went on tossing her trayfuls of grain, ignoring us, and the setting sun turned the chaff to a golden cloud.",

Jeffreys is rocky but not especially shallow. It’s a facey wave, a broad canvas for sweeping long-radius turns, including cutbacks toward the hook. It’s fast and it’s powerful but it’s not particularly hollow—it has no bone-crushing sections à la Kirra. Some waves have flat sections, or weird bumps, or go mushy; others close out. The rule, however, is a reeling wall, peeling continuously for hundreds of yards. My pale blue New Zealand pintail loved that wave. Even at double-overhead, dropping in against the wind, it never skittered. Some of the biggest sets that week nobody wanted, at least not out at the main takeoff spot, where the walls on the big days were massive and intimidating. You want it? No, you go! And the moment would pass, the beast unridden. Farther down the line, at a less scary juncture, somebody might jump aboard. These were the best waves I had ridden since our first trip to Nias, more than a year before. It was different, surfing in a wetsuit, and the famous Jeffreys was nothing like the equatorial obscurity of Lagundri, but technically it was as if my board and I picked up almost exactly where we had left off. Big right wall, power over the ledge, jump up, pick a line, pump for speed, run and gun. Try to keep from screaming from joy.",

One moment he was a dark-haired, watchful boy, skating and sledding, playing trumpet in a dance band. Then, at twenty, discharged from the Navy, he was suddenly middle-aged. He smoked a pipe, wore a fedora, looked intent at a typewriter, contented at a chessboard. He married at twenty-three, became a father at twenty-four. That in itself wasn’t strange in my parents’ world, but my dad seemed to take on adulthood with unusual relish. He wanted to be forty. It wasn’t that he was a cautious, measured person; if anything, he was moody and rash. He just seemed to want to put youth behind him.",

We found Taverna, as advertised, on a narrow but busy road a block behind the Metropole, inconveniently next door to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant. The sidewalks were jammed with shoppers, many of whom carried large boxes of pastries and fresh loaves of hot bread. A cook, dressed in the classical black-and-white checkered uniform, stood in front of a shawarma spit outside. The grilled meat looked and smelled absolutely delicious. A nearby menu listed the restaurant’s selection and prices, but the cook refused our order. He shook his head and pointed to the restaurant’s front door. There I saw a man slouched against the doorjamb, and I wondered whether he were asleep. He smiled weakly and welcomed us to Alexandria, as he half-heartedly pleaded with us to follow him upstairs. I recognized the trap, but Teresa insisted we give it a try. “It gets high marks in the book,” she said.",

Also, there was the languid pace of isolated, small-town life, where motivation is easily sapped by the relaxed ethos and days pass chatting with neighbors, helping get wood in, lending a hand. But more than that, Cordova’s outdoor rhythms, as in much of nonurban Alaska, were dictated by the necessity of subsistence in a way I had never imagined in the Lower 48. Cordova is cut off from the road system and groceries are expensive, so most families supplemented the American diet with all the wild food they could bag, net, or shoot. Halibut trips were referred to as “grocery runs” and the vigorous, end-of-berry-season canning frenzy really felt like “putting up.”",

We had a stop-over in Bangkok, and having visited the city before, and eager to impress my new travel partner, I suggested we visit 'a little bar I know on Sukhumvit Road.' It was a longer walk than I remembered, and I was soon regretting my bizarre decision to wear jeans and trainers for our first evening in the muggy heat of the Thai Capital. Eventually a blue neon glow came into view, in the approximate area I recalled there previously being a rustic local music bar. Where the old bar had open-plan frontage facing onto the busy road, the large windows were now tinted with dark glass, preventing us from seeing inside. A pounding bass thudded away in time with the flashing bright white lights around the door, and it was obvious the bar had seen a change of ownership since my last visit. This no longer looked like my type of place. However, Kirsty was a few years younger than me, so, eager to show I was still 'down with the kids,' I looked as enthusiastic as I could and pushed open the door.",

Though often deluded on land, he was utterly clear-eyed at sea. “Only by looking at a cloud or by night at a star, he knew what was going to happen and whether there would be foul weather,” a shipmate observed. Using simple instruments of the day—quadrant, compass, sand-filled half-hour glass—Columbus set a course due west. He may not have realized where he was headed, but he knew how best to get there: by dead reckoning along a latitude that put the prevailing winds at his back, propelling him across the ocean. These breezes, now known as the trade winds, move clockwise in a giant circle in the middle of the Atlantic; they later helped carry Columbus back to Europe.",
