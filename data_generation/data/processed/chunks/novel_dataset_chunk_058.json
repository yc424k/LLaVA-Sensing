She walked over to where the disgruntled man was standing and got into his face. “Understand this,” she told him, loud enough for the others to hear. “I can’t put myself in a tank of bleach and make myself white. Nor can I turn myself into a man. I’m a woman. And I am black. Is everybody else okay with that?”",

These included shelling new tourist hotels from off-shore ‘fishing-boats’, planting a bomb in José Martí airport and attacking Viazul buses. When Cuban protests to the US and the UN were consistently ignored, Havana’s Ministry of the Interior deployed the Five to infiltrate the relevant gangs in Miami, as a safeguard against future attacks. Leonard Weinglass, the Five’s lead attorney, had repeatedly made clear that ‘By US law, no US citizen can take up arms against another country. And the classic definition of terrorism is: attacks directed against civilians to change policy’. Every country is entitled to use anti-terrorist agents to protect the homeland and the Five were breaking US federal laws only by failing to register as foreign agents (impractical, in the circumstances) and using false names – comparatively minor offences.",

When the paddy-fields had been left behind I overtook the Tibetans, whose walking pace was apparently geared to that of laden yaks, and soon they were all behind me and I was happily alone in a fresh and lovely world of high, forested cliffs, glinting water and herb-sweet air. Occasionally fifty-foot waterfalls came leaping strongly off the cliffs, and in places the valley broadened enough for the path to wander briefly away from the river’s edge across new green grass between silvery rocks. After about forty minutes I came to another fording place – and now I saw why Chimba had been apprehensive. Here the current was so powerful and the water so discoloured that it was impossible to judge depth and one had to feel with a stick before taking each step, all the time bracing oneself against the force of the water. But this river was no more than fifteen yards wide and I was soon across; the most disconcerting thing during such fordings is the shifting of stones on the river-bed beneath one’s feet.",

I wasn’t hankering to dip my hands into what seemed like thick hot mud but didn’t believe him. To entertain the rich lunatic they were paid to paddle, the crew threw some mushy grub they had been eating into the water which at once boiled. The food was yanked below and the river flowed smoothly on, with all its charms hidden. I kept my hands to myself and wondered if these tree trunks ever capsized.

On hearing this I winced, remembering the pride with which, in January 1959, the Revolutionary leaders opened Cuba’s beaches, clubs, parks, race courses, golf links and other public spaces to all citizens free of charge – the easiest and one of the most popular reforms, soon to be followed by fifty per cent reductions in rent, electricity and telephone charges.",

For two days we tramped footpaths and old ways through the late-summer East Anglian countryside: along the Anglo-Saxon earthwork of Fleam Dyke, which runs like a raised and linear wildwood across the chalk valley to the south of Cambridge, through ripe fields of corn and barley, our arms raised up above the crops as though in surrender, along cliff paths out on the crumbling Suffolk coast, and at last onto the great shingle spit of Orford Ness, formerly a nuclear weapons testing site, where the buildings and debris of the Cold War decades now dilapidate in the salt air. ‘I look forward to a time,’ said Raja, ‘when the landscape of my own country has been demilitarized in this way, and we in Palestine are able to regard the artefacts of war as museum objects, rather than as live threats.’",

For the first time in over a week, I return to my yoga routine, first spreading out my cushion and sleeping bag to cushion the dorados’ blows. The hemorrhoids are purred out again, and my hollow butt provides little protection. I sit up, bend one scrawny leg until my heel rests firmly in my crotch, and then touch my head to the knee of my straightened leg, while grasping the foot of that leg with both hands. I perfect a twisting exercise while hanging on to the handline. Then I lie on my stomach and lift my head as if doing a pushup, but I keep my legs and hips on the floor and bend my spine back into a wheel. I scoot forward, lie on my back, raise my legs over my head, and bring them around until my feet hit the floor behind me. My body weaves about like a stock of kelp swaying in the currents. I have not only sea legs but sea arms and a sea back, perhaps even a sea brain.",

We carried on for another mile with the Mercedes virtually hanging off our rear bumper, headlights flashing and horn occasionally sounding, the dark tinted windscreen making it impossible to see the faces of our pursuers. Suddenly, on a long straight stretch of road, the driver made his move and accelerated to pull alongside us, maintaining his position as I attempted to accelerate away. Slowly, the passenger window opened, and a blood-stained hand slowly emerged, closely followed by the familiar, grinning face of one of the roadside butchers. As Kirsty and I breathed a huge sigh of relief, the smiling youth signalled that we were to follow their car, and swerved in front of me. A hair raising ten minutes later, after we'd car-chased the Mercedes on a complicated, high speed route, we reached a large intersection, where the kindly boy-racer butchers pointed us in the correct direction. They then executed a spectacular U-turn and screeched back the way they'd come, with a final blast on the horn and smoke pouring from their rear tyres.",

Trains in the 1920s lacked cooling systems, and in hot weather the players generally sat around in their underwear. Babe Ruth had a private compartment, as did Huggins. The rest of the team shared curtained enclosures with upper and lower berths?“rolling tenements,” as they were drolly known. When Ruppert was with the team, an extra car was hooked on for him alone. On all road trips, there was a lot of time to talk, play cards, and fool around. Ruth played a great deal of bridge or poker, betting wildly on the latter. The more serious or scholarly among the players read or wrote letters. Benny Bengough practiced the saxophone.",

One reason for this, no doubt, was that after the bland monumentality and mechanical bustle of the rest of China, Tibet was, in every sense, a breath of fresh air; an antithesis to the communal vacancy of the mainland, and an antidote to it. The cities of China were drab and dusty and dour; Lhasa, by contrast, was a festival, a revelation, an explosion of brilliant flower boxes and golden symbols and gaily painted awnings. The dull-eyed Chinese were generally withdrawn, even sullen toward foreigners; the Tibetans, by contrast, were incorrigibly merry, with quick animation in their faces, ready at any moment to break into ruddy smiles that felt like benedictions. China, it was, ironically, that felt closed and remote; Tibet was jolly and rainbowed and welcoming.",

I have found that the issue is not the wet and cold. It is the grey depressingness of it. My mental health cycles wildly with the grey (depressed) and sunny (euphoric). The solution is: put the yellow lenses in my sun glasses. If you put in the yellow lenses, the world looks brighter, sometimes sunnier, and always greener.

I had been advised to buy a bicycle for use in Pokhara (it would of course have to be flown there, as not even a mule-track connects the two valleys), but at first I wasn’t very enthusiastic about the idea, having only seen Indian models here and knowing from previous experience how difficult it is to come to terms with these parodies. Then yesterday morning, while wandering through the bazaar, I spotted a likely-looking second-hand Russian cycle, tried it, found it congenial and bought it for £10.16s.8d. (Leo, a brother for Roz). Leo is sky-blue and at least twice as heavy as Roz, but he is beautifully balanced and very comfortable on rough tracks, with his huge, well-sprung saddle and broad tyres. He has a bewildering multiplicity of accessories. None of my previous cycles sported a mirror, foot-brake, milometer, toolcase, carrier, front-wheel dynamo, automatic stand and built-in lock with two keys – in addition to the statutory bell and pump. At present the foot-brake is a menace as I am in the habit of casually back-pedalling when going downhill – but I’ll soon get adjusted; and this is only one of the many hazards of cycling in Kathmandu.",

We bought bottled water, plus each floor had a water treatment machine, well except at the end of my first year when I moved to the other side, which was considered the Mongolian side because mostly Mongolians lived there and they just drank the water—no treatment machines. So I had to walk down four flights of stairs, fill up my water bottles, and shlep once again up to the fourth floor. (I mentioned there were no elevators in the apartment complex.) Other buildings in town, like State Department Store, had elevators, but not us. But hell, it was worth the shlepping to see those goats and the moon rising so majestically over those hills!",

This man now speaks fluent Amharinya and has successfully adapted himself to the local way of life. These Yemeni small-town traders are more integrated with the highlanders than any other foreigners, yet the moment I met Hussein I was aware of a strong bond between us. He doesn’t speak one word of English, but he and I have established the kind of intuitive understanding that could never exist between me and the local English-speakers. As I now feel so at ease with the highlanders this is a significant measure of the extraordinary degree of ‘ingrown-ness’ that marks their character.",

It was getting very hot, so I took off my shirt, put it under a bush and told Dig to wait there for me until I got back, which I thought would be about half an hour at most. She was already panting and thirsty. She hated being left behind but it was for her own good, and she obeyed. I was now into rough uninhabited country – there was no one and nothing for countless miles. I was vaguely wondering what on earth could have induced the camels to wander this far, this fast. But I wasn’t worried. I was hot on their trail – their droppings were still moist. I could see from the tracks that one of them had broken a leather strap and was dragging a chain. And I walked. And I walked. And I walked. I crossed the Todd River and immersed my boiling body in a cool pool and drank as much as I could. I wet my trousers and wound them around my head. And still I walked. My speed slowed down now as I was in stonier country. And all the while I was thinking, ‘What’s happening here? Has someone chased them? What’s going on, for Christ’s sake?’ I walked thirty miles that day, tantalized by the belief that they were just a minute ahead of me, but I heard nothing but phantom bells dinging inside my own skull, and saw nary a camel. I returned late at night to find poor Diggity almost fretted away, still sitting under the bush, her pink tongue dry as a bone, and a groove of worried dog-prints a hundred yards in the home direction, and a hundred yards in my direction. But she had stayed, faithful creature, despite what must have been an unbearable anxiety and an equally unbearable thirst. She was so relieved to see me, she almost turned herself inside out.",

It’s empty and flat and rimming it all round are low swells of dunes and trees and red-berried salt bushes. Some of the trees have smooth pink trunks, like shot silk, which glow crimson in the evening sun, and their leaves are deep deep shining green. Now, I know most people would drive through that three miles of heaven and not even gasp, let alone pull out the prayer mat, but it sent ripples to the pit of my stomach. I wish I could explain it to you. What a piece of country – so moving, so subtly powerful. Didn’t stop long though. Dookie’s foot-hole was growing in my consciousness like a triffid in the tropics.",

He brought out what he called the visitors’ book, a big scrapbook filled with memos, photos and illustrations entered by the crews of cruising yachts that had visited Wreck Bay in years past. He was the current “keeper of the book” by default, and he took the responsibility seriously. The entries went back decades, to the days when only a handful of boats called at Wreck Bay in an entire year. We studied it with great interest. It contained recent entries by a few crews that we knew personally as well as some older ones by sailors we knew only by their reputations and fame within the cruising community. We added our own entry and thanked Fernando for sharing the book with us. We had gained a new respect for him and I felt a little ashamed that my first impression of him had been less than fully favorable.",
