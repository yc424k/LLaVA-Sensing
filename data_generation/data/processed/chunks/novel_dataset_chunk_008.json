The exception, the Astoria, is closed for the winter, apart from its grotty bar where all the men were AWB types with foot-long bushy beards, collar-length hair, narrow eyes, aggressive voices and guns in their belts. Then Dan arrived, an extrovert young Capetonian who soon decided I must stay with friends of his, an 82-year-old New Zealander and his English-speaking wife. Both are good company and seem to enjoy having a guest. Life must lack variety in midwinter Hermanus; many of the permanent residents are retired couples or lonely widows and widowers.",

And yet she had imagined she was prepared for it, had expected it, was already planning her future life in view of it—an effaced impersonal life in the service of somebody else's children—when, in reality, under that thin surface of abnegation and acceptance, all the old hopes had been smouldering red-hot in their ashes!

A single dingy electric bulb burned in the center of the ceiling behind a wire cage like the end of a rat-trap. It had been burning when they were herded into the room shortly after dawn this morning, and, since it was American electricity, or that is, was already being charged daily one day in advance to the Service of Supply of the American Expeditionary Force, it had been burning ever since. So as the day succumbed to evening, the faces of the thirteen men sitting quietly on the floor against one wall did not fade wanly back into the shadows but rather instead emerged, not even wan but, unshaven and therefore even more virile, gathering to themselves an even further ghastly and jaundiced strength.",

I’m sorry my husband is away in Hanoi, at a wedding. He would like to talk to you about our difficulties here, he talks good English.’",

Tourism was the island’s lifeblood. After the bombs in 2002 and 2005, visitor numbers contracted by a third and employment figures sank.

To be absolutely precise, if you have a long version of the SLC6A4 gene, you are very probably easygoing and serene, whereas if you have the short version you can’t leave home without saying at some point, “Stop the car. I think I left the bathwater running.”",

We see, again and again, in different contexts, people waving as on a distant ship, as if about to voyage off (as Sebald might put it) to the other shore. We revert frequently to a man (now the narrator, now Dr. K.) lying in a small hotel room, arms crossed behind his head, as the sounds of life come to him from the street outside. We see glimpses of “dust-blown expanses and tidal plains” that are, we are told, the landscape of the future. The force of these recurrences—even a sign above the narrator, when arriving in Milan, says LA PROSSIMA COINCIDENZA—is to make us feel as if we’re simply sleepwalking through some diabolical plot that we can’t follow. More than once, the narrator notices, in Italy, two men, always walking together, watching him from afar; later we learn that two men, always walking together, have been arrested in connection with the ritual murders.",

    "target_paragraph": "But, in Rumanian annals, Sighişoară is singled out, in the middle of the fifteenth century, by a strange and perplexing figure; except for one foible, he would have entered history as a hero. Vlad III of Wallachia, sprung from the great Basarab dynasty, was the great-grandson of Radu the Black, grandson of the warrior prince Mircea the Old and son of Vlad the Dragon – so called, it is thought, because the Emperor Sigismund, his overlord, ally and enemy, had hung the Order of the Dragon round his neck. Given as a hostage to the Sultan when he was a boy, the third Vlad mounted the Wallachian throne later on and fought against the Turks with energy and skill. Chastisement for his success lay with the Sultan, Mehmet II, the conqueror of Constantinople. But the march of this punitive army was suddenly halted by an unspeakably terrible scene: a wide valley, that is, populated by many thousands of Turkish and Bulgarian corpses from the year before, transfixed on a forest of spikes and rotting in mid-air, with the Sultan’s general ceremoniously robed on the tallest spike of all. The Sultan, whose aquiline features and snowy globular turban we know from Bellini’s painting and the engraving by Pisanello, had been brought up on blood, like a falcon: he recoiled in horror – some say in respect for the ruthlessness of his rebellious vassal – and burst into tears. For Vlad’s lifelong foible was impaling. Many contemporary woodcuts show the Prince feasting in Carpathian glens, like a shrike in his larder, among groves of skewered foes.",

The next day Win replaced the cracked radiator coupling that had caused the leak, said the reason we didn’t die was that the cabin was a mile from airtight. With the door closed against cool fall air, it could have been a death trap, but those cracks under the walls, the gaps where warp lifted frame from floor box, the spaces we stuffed with dish towels too gross to use—the cracks saved us. Win cackled at the thought of a cabin being too crappy to kill you. He invited us up for dinner that night. I took a shower. We played hearts and drank whiskey and toasted our narrow escape.",

It is not easy to get English-language books in Burma, but his collection numbers over a thousand volumes, the result of decades spent scouring second-hand bookshops. As he puts it, he ‘retired from the world’ in his early twenties and for the past forty years has lived a hermit-like existence in Mandalay, sequestered with his library and one spinster sister in a two-storey wooden house that they inherited from their parents. The interior of the house was dark and cool. The front room was crammed with sagging wooden furniture. An empty teacup sat on the arm of an old planter’s chair, and the glass-fronted book cabinets were filled with old newspapers, their corners orange and crackling with age. Two grandfather clocks stood in opposite corners of the room, each telling a different time.",

Suddenly he closed his eyes, raised his hand with an effort, and threw away the heavy end of his cigar. A great brush swept smooth across his mind, sweeping across it moving branches, children’s voices, the shuffle of feet, and people passing, and humming traffic, rising and falling traffic.

One dragged between two walkers, his arms around their shoulders. A mere boy reeled along with the limp body of his father on his back. A horse passed with his nose to the ground, two bodies flopping sideways across the saddle, and a man walking behind and beating the horse on the rump, cursing shrilly. He passed, and we could hear his falsetto fading dissonantly in the distance. Some groaned, with the ugly, deadened groan of uttermost pain; one man, slouched in the saddle of a mule, screamed mechanically every time the mule took a step.\nUnder two tall cotton-wood trees beside an irrigation ditch a little fire glowed. Three sleepers with empty cartridge-belts sprawled snoring on the uneven ground; beside the fire sat a man holding with both hands his leg straight out to the warmth. It was a perfectly good leg as far as the ankle—there it ended in a ragged, oozing mess of trousers and shattered flesh. The man simply sat looking at it. He didn’t even stir as we came near, and yet his chest rose and fell with calm breathing, and his mouth was slightly open as if he were day-dreaming. By the side of the ditch knelt another. A soft lead bullet had entered his hand between the two middle fingers and then spread until it hollowed out a bloody cave inside. He had wrapped a rag around a little piece of stick and was unconcernedly dipping it in the water and gouging out the wound.",

While we stood under an enormous chenar, in the sudden grey coolness that comes when the sun has slipped behind the mountains, our ‘guardian’ conducted a vigorous and lengthy argument with several shrill-voiced women who glared at us from the edge of their roof as though we had the plague. Everybody spoke so quickly and vehemently that I could gather nothing of what was being said, but obviously we were extremely unwelcome. I was about to suggest to Rachel that we should push on to the next hamlet, visible three miles away, when our ‘guardian’ suddenly shook both his fists at the women and shouted some infuriated threat which abruptly ended the argument. He then beckoned us up the steep path to their house, which has a new room built on to the original structure and seems to be the poshest in the hamlet. While I was unloading and unsaddling – none of the dozen men standing around offered to help – Rachel found that the new wing is entered through a window. The men whispered and sniggered while they watched me carrying the load and tack to the room, which is about ten feet by thirty and has a big over-fed woodstove. Soon Rachel and I were sweltering, so accustomed have we become to living in cold rooms and depending on our clothes for warmth. While writing this – on the floor, by the light of my own candle, in a corner as far as possible from the stove – I am dripping sweat; and poor Rachel, though exhausted, is unable to sleep because of the heat plus noise. Everyone in the family seems to have a wracking cough – inevitably, when they exchange this temperature for the Balti cold while clad only in rags.",

It was a sad-faced, miserable little man who emerged from the narrow passage into the bustle of the broad thoroughfare. He walked with the nerveless gait of a tramp going on, still going on, indifferent to rain or sun in a sinister detachment from the aspects of sky and earth. Chief Inspector Heat, on the other hand, after watching him for a while, stepped out with the purposeful briskness of a man disregarding indeed the inclemencies of the weather, but conscious of having an authorised mission on this earth and the moral support of his kind. All the inhabitants of the immense town, the population of the whole country, and even the teeming millions struggling upon the planet, were with him—down to the very thieves and mendicants. Yes, the thieves themselves were sure to be with him in his present work. The consciousness of universal support in his general activity heartened him to grapple with the particular problem.",

The extent to which Palestinian villages are entrapped and deprived of their farmland was so evident that involuntarily my fists clenched. Monika pointed west and south to Har Ha’dar and Giv’at Ze’ev, and to Ramot and Ramat Shlomo just beyond Jerusalem’s municipal border. Much closer – almost within earshot – was the hi-tech industrial estate of Har Hotzvim, offering no jobs to Palestinian manual workers. More than 220,000 settlers now live on this confiscated land.",

Mrs. Draper thought Effie had been very wise to give up young Manisty for Mr. Stuart-Gore. She wrote in a postscript: \"Maurice Jourdain has just called to ask if I have any news of Mary. I think he would like to know that that wretched affair has not made her unhappy.\"\nMamma was smiling in a nervous way. \"What am I to say to Mrs. Draper?\"\n\"Tell her that Mr. Jourdain was right and that I am not at all unhappy.\"\nShe was glad to take the letter to the post and set his mind at rest.\nIt was in June last year that Maurice Jourdain had come to her: June the twenty-fourth. To-day was the twenty-fifth. He must have remembered.\nThe hayfields shone, ready for mowing. Under the wind the shimmering hay grass moved like waves of hot air, up and up the hill.\nShe slipped through the gap by Morfe Bridge and went up the fields to the road on Greffington Edge. She lay down among the bracken in the place where Roddy and she had sat two years ago when they had met Mr. Sutcliffe coming down the road.\nThe bracken hid her.

There she is with plenty of money, and a house and farm, and horses, and comfort, and here am I living from hand to mouth – a needy adventurer. – Besides, it is no use talking now; it is too late, and I am glad of it: I’ve been seen and recognized here this very afternoon. I should have gone back to her the day after the fair if it hadn’t been for you talking about the law and rubbish about her getting a separation; and I won’t put it off any longer. What the deuce put it into my head to run away at all I can’t think. Humbugging sentiment – that’s what it was. But what man on earth was to know that his wife would be in such a hurry to get rid of his name!’",

    "target_paragraph": "‘We could hear in the shop Blake upbraiding Egstrom in an abusive, strained voice. They had been associated for many years, and every day from the moment the doors were opened to the last minute before closing, Blake, a little man with sleek, jetty hair and unhappy, beady eyes, could be heard rowing his partner incessantly with a sort of scathing and plaintive fury. The sound of that everlasting scolding was part of the place like the other fixtures; even strangers would very soon come to disregard it completely unless it be perhaps to mutter “Nuisance,” or to get up suddenly and shut the door of the “parlour.” Egstrom himself, a raw-boned, heavy Scandinavian, with a busy manner and immense blonde whiskers, went on directing his people, checking parcels, making out bills or writing letters at a stand-up desk in the shop, and comported himself in that clatter exactly as though he had been stone-deaf. Now and again he would emit a bothered perfunctory “Sssh,” which neither produced nor was expected to produce the slightest effect. “They are very decent to me here,” said Jim. “Blake’s a little cad, but Egstrom’s all right.” He stood up quickly, and walking with measured steps to a tripod telescope standing in the window and pointed at the roadstead, he applied his eye to it. “There’s that ship which has been becalmed outside all the morning has got a breeze now and is coming in,” he remarked patiently; “I must go and board.” We shook hands in silence, and he turned to go. “Jim!” I cried. He looked round with his hand on the lock. “You — you have thrown away something like a fortune.” He came back to me all the way from the door. “Such a splendid old chap,” he said. “How could I? How could I?” His lips twitched. “Here it does not matter.” “Oh! you — you —” I began, and had to cast about for a suitable word, but before I became aware that there was no name that would just do, he was gone. I heard outside Egstrom’s deep gentle voice saying cheerily, “That’s the Sarah W. Granger, Jimmy. You must manage to be first aboard”; and directly Blake struck in, screaming after the manner of an outraged cockatoo, “Tell the captain we’ve got some of his mail here. That’ll fetch him. D’ye hear, Mister What’s-your-name?” And there was Jim answering Egstrom with something boyish in his tone. “All right. I’ll make a race of it.” He seemed to take refuge in the boat-sailing part of that sorry business.",

The place had a large-screen TV, a sort of staircase balcony overlooking a spacious living room, and a kitchen twice the size of Nina’s. Ira brought me up to the room on the second floor where I would sleep. I was understanding perhaps one sentence out of every ten she said. I couldn’t shake the misgiving that some dangerous mafia overboss lived here and would show up unexpectedly. Back downstairs, Ira asked if I’d like to watch a movie and I said yes. She put on a cassette she said she really liked. Its title was Bolshee chem Zhizn’. I looked at the box—I had seen this movie and liked it, too. In English the title is Larger Than Life. It stars Bill Murray and is about a man who inherits an elephant. My friend Roy Blount wrote the screenplay.",

Then rain again, so hard and fast that it appeared as cylinders rather than drops, as if I were seeing through reeded glass, and at last sun again and the air re-pristinated. I sheltered in a copse of ash, oak and high-trunked beeches, and ruefully considered Hippolyte Taine’s pastoral claim that ‘the first music of England’ is to be heard in ‘the fine patter of rain on the oak trees’.

There seems to be no perspective to them either, so that when we shift our viewpoint one building does not move with any grace against another – just a clump here, a splodge there, sometimes a solitary pillar of glass or concrete. Across the water they loom monotonously behind the Kowloon waterfront, square and Stalinesque; until 1995 they were limited to a height of twenty storeys there, because of the nearby airport. On the sides of distant mountains you may see them protruding from declining ridges like sudden outcrops of white chalk. Many are still meshed in bamboo scaffolding, many more are doomed to imminent demolition. If we look down the hill again, behind the poor Governor’s palace immolated in its gardens, we may see the encampment of blue-and-white awnings, interspersed with bulldozers and scattered with the labouring straw-hatted figures of construction workers, which shows where the foundations of yet another skyscraper, still bigger, more splendid and more extravagant no doubt than the one before, are even now being laid.",

Once we were discovered during the morning and as the peasants kept asking us all manner of indiscreet questions, we packed up our traps and hurried onwards. We had not yet found a new hiding-place when we met eight men who shouted to us to stop. Our luck seemed at last to have deserted us. They asked us innumerable questions and I kept on giving the same answers, namely that we were pilgrims from a distant province. To our great astonishment we seemed somehow to have stood the test, for after a while they let us go on our way. We could hardly believe that we had done with them, and long after we had moved on we thought we heard pursuing footsteps.",

The pleasure of a coin-operated washing machine does not go unappreciated, and I drop to my knees and thank the sweet Virgin Mary rendered in hologram for mankind’s electrical miracles. There is nothing quite as unromantic as having to scrub the crotch of your partner’s underwear by hand. After a machine wash, the clothes come out of the dryer as lighter, perfumed versions of their previous selves.",
