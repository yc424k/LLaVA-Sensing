Once when a traffic cop shouted at him, “Hey, this is a one-way street,” Ruth responded, “I’m only driving one way!” The sportswriter Red Smith became convinced that Ruth possessed a first-rate brain, one that combined shrewdness with simplicity and innocence with penetrating perception. “It was, in its special way, a great mind,” he insisted.",

I imagined the causeway that once led from the Temple of Hatshepsut, down the hill and to the riverbank. During the New Kingdom, priests carried ceremonial barques down the causeway, across a pontoon bridge, and through the First Pylon into the courts of Karnak. I imagined the colorful banners whipping in the breeze and the columns of palm trees soaring majestically over the processional way. What a sight it must have been.",

Even from a mile away we could see their reds and blues, bright against the snow, and we could hear the cries of the children and the crunch of the toboggans over old snow. We skied down to the low ground between the hills hushing through the snow, which lay so lightly that it plumed off the tips of our skis. When we reached the gateway, we climbed Walker’s Hill to the long barrow on its summit, whose contours were encased in crisp layers of ice. Twilight: the sky streaked purple and crimson. The tobogganers on the opposite hill yelled and slid and laughed. A boy in a duffel coat ran down the slope with his arms outstretched. Lift is created by the onwards rush of life over the curved wing of the soul.",

The bluff approaches sheer, and its face is rough with crags and ledges and plunging tight ravines. Slowly, surely, the thirteen creatures descended, almost every move a feat of balance and decision. Poised there, each avoiding a fall to destruction, they gave Hansen and whoever else may have been watching plenty of time to wonder why they had chosen that route. They could readily have swung wide of both the town and the bluff. Finally, they reached the ice and started across the river. Everywhere around the lead, the ice was solid to the farther shore. Yet the thirteen caribou one after another jumped into the open water. The current drew them to the downstream end, where it sucked them under the ice.",

    "target_paragraph": "Mr. Fish slowed the car while I took a few blurry pictures of Italianate mansions set among empty husks of multi-story apartment blocks. I didn’t know it then, but the development is part of a broader national policy to build new cities in the country’s vast, open desert. The idea behind the government project, called New Urban Communities, is to reduce urban crowding, but also to protect agricultural land. The project, in theory, makes a lot of sense. Most of Egypt’s cities crowd the Nile, but the Nile is also the only naturally arable land in the country. Something has to give, and it’s easier to move people than the river, or so you might think. In all, the plan includes twenty-eight new cities, some of which are complete (El Asher City, near Cairo, was the first), though others are stalled in byzantine planning processes or waiting for funding that will never come. The houses and apartment blocks we saw were part of a settlement called New Thebes, or New Tiba, depending on the translation. Founded in 2000, New Thebes is a sister city of Luxor, built on 10,000 or so feddans, about ten miles to the northeast of the historic city for which it is named. When, and if, the city is ever completed it may house 200,000 people, but the government estimates that today it houses about 19,000. Even that may be an overestimate. What we saw was, to be polite, a work in progress. I wondered what Bruce would have thought of New Thebes. I doubt it would have been kind. “New Thebes is no town, but some sand and a few bushes so called,” he might write.",

President Tubman is small, solemn, very black, dressed like a prosperous Southern undertaker (he looks highly American), smoking a cigar in a gold holder. Then the Presidents entered a big open American car and, followed by their dignitaries in all the available cars (my Citroën, sketchily dusted, was used by some lower-downs with briefcases), the cortège whizzed off. They passed the line of chiefs at forty miles an hour; not kosher, they slipped up there; the Queen of England, the President of the United States would never have made such a disdainful gaffe. The rest of us got out of the blazing heat as best we could.

An occasional trolley clanged and crashed up Royal street, but this was but seldom, and when it had died away there was no sound save the monotonous merging clatter of the typewriter.

It was hard to imagine the hands of a fisherman's son as I looked at his cultivated digits, now more accustomed to stethoscopes than fishing lines. A silver Waterman pen with a blue cap twinkled in his single breast pocket. Doubtless his forebears were illiterate. On his wrist, a plain Swiss watch was framed in the soft black hair of his forearm. His father kept time with the rise of the sun and the fall of the tide, perhaps even praying moored at sea. This family had gone from fishermen to physicians in the brief space of half a generation.\n“My father still fishes, but of course he doesn't need to. He enjoys it. He is in his seventies now and we have bought him a better boat, Mashallah, but he loves the sea. He wanted me to have an education, Qanta, it was very important. You see, my father cannot read.”",

He called himself unexpansive and unromantic; he confessed to small understanding, small veneration, for artistic effects. The beauty of a man's character moved him more strongly than the beauty of any picture or any landscape. Yet, on arriving next afternoon at the upper plateau of Nepenthe he could not help being struck by the strange and almost compelling charm of the \"Old Town.\" It was so different from the lower regions—so calm and reposeful.",

From the dreadful moment when he was faced by her empty cottage, and all his flaming hopes and longings were flung back at him frustrated, he had hardly known what he was doing. Fear lest something awful should have happened had sent him wildly striding through the night, instinctively making for London. Over the dew-drenched downs, through sleeping villages, along deserted roads, James wildly rushed, and when he got to Amberton, and found there was no train before the workmen’s train at six, whipped by fear and love he pushed on ten miles farther, to the mainline junction.",

Now that the sun had retired from its brutal throne, the wind had become wicked enough to throw me off balance and slice into flesh with freezing precision?even though I had put on a wind shirt. As the moon rose overhead, I was thankful to have its light augmenting my wan headlamp. I had forgotten to include batteries in the box I’d mailed to Hikertown and there were none to buy there. I would be in total darkness once this set died completely. It was a nearly unforgivable omission on my part, but I had to let it go. Release it to the currents of air swirling past.",

Here in Sicily with its dreadful poverty, real life is never far from anyone’s mind. The Mafia has been the only successful business in Sicily for centuries (running the business of protecting citizens from itself), and it still keeps its hand down everybody’s pants. Palermo—a city Goethe once claimed was possessed of an impossible-to-describe beauty—may now be the only city in Western Europe where you can still find yourself picking your steps through World War II rubble, just to give a sense of development here. The town has been systematically uglified beyond description by the hideous and unsafe apartment blocks the Mafia constructed in the 1980s as money-laundering operations. I asked one Sicilian if those buildings were made from cheap concrete and he said, “Oh, no—this is very expensive concrete. In each batch, there are a few bodies of people who were killed by the Mafia, and that costs money. But it does make the concrete stronger to be reinforced with all those bones and teeth.”",

I don’t know if this is the true number, but I do know that not a single soldier or politician has been indicted. Many of those 415 were buried in unmarked graves by the soldiers who had shot them. They were Germans, Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, Chechens, and other citizens of the Soviet Union, usually young couples, solo travellers, or pairs of friends. Their reasons for taking this desperate step were diverse: social entrapment, family disputes, troubled love, shirking military service, wanting to be reunited with family or lovers in the West. Bulgaria had a deceptively friendly reputation for its ‘green border’, much easier to cross than the Berlin Wall. The most frequent victims of this border, however, were the Bulgarians; over the course of the Cold War, hundreds were shot, sometimes women and children. Hundreds escaped too.",

Rich enough to hire another nigger to get up in his stead on the cold mornings and go out in the wet and damp to feed not only the beef cattle which he sold at the top fat prices because he could afford to hold them till then, but that blooded stallion too, and even that damn hound running beside the horse he thundered up and down the road on, until a fellow that never had anything but his own two legs to travel on, would have to jump clean off the road into the bushes or the son of a bitching horse would have killed him too with its shod feet and left him laying there in the ditch for the son of a bitching hound to eat before Houston would even have reported it.",

This piece of tact put him in a good-humour, but no more; he was still disinclined to take official responsibility for the safety of a foreigner inside the Shrine. Nevertheless, our call on him led indirectly to acquaintance with an amiable young schoolmaster in suède gloves, who offered to help us for the fun of the thing—for the fun, that is, of striking a blow for knowledge against the forces of ecclesiastical darkness. We met him last night to discuss matters, having first taken a room at the hotel so as to keep our plans secret from the Consulate. By the time he arrived I had become a Persian; at least he thought so, greeting me in Persian fashion and being astonished when the seedy Oriental with eyes cast down and hands folded in his sleeves burst into a rude guffaw. This clinched it. He will take us tonight.",

It did a jackknife, a triple somersault, and a belly flop, though I am prepared to believe that its acrobatic talents owed as much to the three bottles of beer I had drunk as to any bodily contortions. (Later on I tried viewing the Umbrella Pine through my thighs, but it was much less frisky and looked nothing like an umbrella.)",

Although the pool looked cool and inviting, I felt as big as a walrus and feared that if I got in there would be no room for the water, so instead we sat outside our bungalow listening to the birds and watching the monkeys watching us.\nWhen we set off later it was warm and hazy, and Kilimanjaro was hidden behind cloud. I didn’t expect that we would see much in the way of wildlife either in this barren landscape that did not look as if it could support any life form apart from reptiles and insects.\nBut we began to see large herds of zebra and wildebeeste together, all plump and glossy as they scraped around among the withered scrub in the dust, and I was wondering how they managed on an apparent diet of grit and dead wood, when we arrived at a marshy area fed by the snow melt from the mountain, where herds stood fetlock-deep in the water, grazing lush grass.\nI have always loved the wildebeeste, or gnu. They are one of my favourite beasts with their glossy metallic pelts, their wise beards and the way they will suddenly kick up their heels, bucking, running, twisting and turning, just for fun.",

A fisherman on a flat skiff was spearing fish, like the gold figure of Tutankhamen in the Cairo museum; nearby children were wading in the shallows.",

It has been at other times of my life, but it isn’t right now. Therefore, Rome’s word, as it spins through the streets, just bumps up against me and tumbles off, leaving no impact. I’m not participating in the word, so I’m not fully living here. It’s a kooky theory, impossible to prove, but I sort of like it.",

In this region all sorts of animals were used for transport—donkeys, horses, cows and bullocks. One saw only yaks in the caravans, as the peasants had not enough pasture to feed herds of them. Everywhere we saw the villagers irrigating their fields. The spring gales would come later, and if the soil were too dry it would all be blown away in dust. It often took generations before constant watering made the soil fertile. Here there is very little snow to protect the winter seed and the peasants cannot grow more than one crop. The altitude has naturally a great influence on agriculture. At 16,000 feet only barley will thrive and the peasants are half-nomads. In some regions the barley ripens in sixty days. The Tölung valley through which we were now passing is 12,300 feet above sea-level, and here they also grow roots, potatoes and mustard.",
