Inside, one wanders through a circular vastness of artificially lit wasted space – lavishly carpeted, furnished with groups of deep armchairs, decorated along one wall by many yards of a kitschy tapestry depicting the conquest and gradual Westernization of Zululand. To get anywhere one must go round and round and round, seemingly for miles, or up and up and up in state-of-the-art lifts. Briefly we sat just inside the main portal to the windowless parliament chamber, its mock-daylight derived from countless spotlights set in the gold-painted ceiling. Opposite us, suspended above the former Chief Minister’s dais, hung an ornate gilded metal representation of the kwaZulu coat of arms. This, and the kwaZulu mace, depressed me. Such imitations of the Mother of Parliaments speak of a people conquered spiritually as well as territorially, their notion of ‘progress’ the adoption of the external symbols of their conqueror’s culture – symbols arcane and ancient and incomprehensible, rooted in a past as unlike the Zulu’s as you could get.",

    "target_paragraph": "Alison had been a surprise addition to the trip. She and Peter had only recently met. She was thin, strong, acerbic, endlessly game, black-haired, also a commercial illustrator. They both drew constantly—in cafés and airport lounges, crosshatching away, she reaching over to add ink to his work in progress. “Don’t be afraid of black!” They faxed their work from hotels and car-rental agencies to clients back in the States. The two of them were stylish, low-maintenance, nothing-daunted travelers. But they could be mercurial. The day after we arrived in Madeira, before we had found waves, they announced that they wanted to go back to mainland Portugal, which had looked more fun. That was out of the question, I said. I was silently horrified. What was wrong with these people? Peter had started sporting a beret—another bad sign. Then we started getting waves. First at Ponta Delgada, and then, a few miles east of there, we found a chunky, consistent reefbreak that Peter named Shadowlands. The cliff there was so tall—nearly three thousand feet—that the winter sun never reached the shore. We wore thin wetsuits—long arms, short legs—and slowly worked out how to thread the surprise barrel section at low-tide Shadowlands.",

Since the landscape just west of Weymouth is not particularly, or even fractionally, memorable, I took a taxi to Abbotsbury, and began my walk midway along Chesil Beach. I don’t know what Chesil Beach is like toward the Weymouth end, but along this stretch it consisted of great drifts of small, kidney-shaped pebbles worn to a uniform smoothness by aeons of wave action. They are nearly impossible to walk on, since you sink to your ankle tops with every step. The coast path is on firmer ground immediately behind the beach, but leaves you unable to see over the stony dunes. Instead, you just hear the sea, crashing into the shore and the other side and sending endless successions of pebbles clattering along the water’s edge. It was a walk of consummate tedium and my blisters soon began to throb. By the time I reached West Bay, early in the afternoon, I was ready for a good sit-down and something to eat.",

The driver is going about his repair with a few measly tools, while his assistant tends a little pot of food heating on a gas burner. They’ve stretched a tarp from the truck frame for shelter. It’s a sobering thought that they’re camped here till the fix is done. To make sure their truck doesn’t roll, they place cinderblock-sized rocks under each wheel. Good plan, I think. With one small deficiency. I begin to notice large rocks in the middle of the road, left there by a repaired truck that’s driven away. Until we reach our hotel, I scan the road for rocky obstacles and ponder the unavailability of roadside assistance should Roxanne break down.",

In late 2007, Xiaopei went to a conference of gay Chinese men discussing how they could make use of the law to protect themselves. Men got up and presented their stories, with testimonies about being harassed by police and bullied by their family members. Out of the blue, a woman raised her hand and asked if she could share her story. He Xiaopei and the men turned around in their chairs to face her. They had seen this woman on the way in, but no one knew who she was. She had arrived at the conference alone.",

On the garden side of the wall, there were no cars or trucks or feces or urine. Instead, we found peace and quiet and clean air and acres of palms and ferns and hedges. A path wound through the park, and we soon found a spur that led toward the riverbank. Overhead, bouquets of yellow and blue flowers sprouted on canopies fifteen feet high. A bed of ferns ringed the trail. Their blood-red leaves looked like they had been dipped in Kool-Aid and left to dry in the sun. The path twisted and turned and forked around trees and grasses and bushes that we could never hope to identify. I saw something that looked like a bushy elm tree. It was covered in vines and the vines were covered in berries. The path turned sharply and followed a dense stand of reeds on the water’s edge. Teresa poked and prodded but there was no way to reach the river. Thwarted once again, we retreated to dry land.",

Their walk and run are prissy and feminine and incredibly fast. We stopped at a water hole to watch a tribe of brown antelope—there must have been several hundred—crowded together like sheep, horns and heads clear against the sky, queuing for their turn at a drink and a wash. The water hole was lined with drinking and wading and rolling bodies; when the occupants were finished they moved off, still in that close silent formation and were lost under the trees, while newcomers took their place.

Mummy put Gladys Toy next to him as a reward—for what?” She smiled at her mother’s simplicity in imagining that he was having what Pauline called a “harmless flirtation” with Mrs. Herman Toy. That lady’s obvious charms were no more to him, Nona suspected, than those of the florid Bathsheba in the tapestry behind his chair. But Pauline had evidently had some special reason—over and above her usual diffused benevolence—for wanting to put Manford in a good humour. “The Mahatma, probably.” Nona knew how her mother hated a fuss: how vulgar and unchristian she always thought it. And it would certainly be inconvenient to give up the rest-cure at Dawnside she had planned for March, when Manford was to go off tarpon-fishing.",

Again the wind had strengthened (evidently an afternoon phenomenon) and white breakers were being driven towards an exposed shore from which a line of dark battlemented rocks extended far into the ocean. This sand was unusually soft and deep and Zea flagged, requesting a piggy-back.

    "target_paragraph": "For this ostensibly Christian monument is only barely converted from paganism, and the thinnest veneer of Christianity rests uneasily on what is unashamedly a pagan classical pyramid. Looking at the great porphyry caskets, I wondered whether the calm certainty of the mausoleum was a sham – a brave attempt to maintain classical values in a world where the surface of ancient life was being betrayed at every turn: in the new-fangled clothes that were being worn, in the beliefs that were held, in the strange chants of the Syrian monks and the prophecies of the stylites. Or did it in fact represent the reality? Did the people in these sarcophagi still lead a version of the old life of the late classical landowner: their youth spent in the law school at Beirut or the School of Libanius at Antioch; a period as a provincial official posted to Hippo or Harran; or perhaps a spell in the army on the Rhine frontier, peering over the cold battlements of Cologne or Trier to catch a glimpse of a Gothic raider padding across the ice into Roman territory; then the return to the home estate and the comforts of the richest and most civilised part of the Empire, with winters of hunting and feasting, the occasional marriage party of a neighbouring landowner or a trip to the theatre at Apamea; of afternoons wallowing in the baths at Serjilla and evenings spent reading Homer by the light of an oil lamp. Wandering through the Byzantine villa, through a succession of cool, high-ceilinged rooms, the stone still fitted perfectly, joint by joint, a classical pediment on every window frame, I felt sure that more of the ancient world had survived for longer in the Byzantine East than any of the surviving sources – including John Moschos – now indicate.",

Rodney’s room was the room of a person who cherishes a great many personal tastes, guarding them from the rough blasts of the public with scrupulous attention. His papers and his books rose in jagged mounds on table and floor, round which he skirted with nervous care lest his dressing-gown might disarrange them ever so slightly. On a chair stood a stack of photographs of statues and pictures, which it was his habit to exhibit, one by one, for the space of a day or two. The books on his shelves were as orderly as regiments of soldiers, and the backs of them shone like so many bronze beetle-wings; though, if you took one from its place you saw a shabbier volume behind it, since space was limited. An oval Venetian mirror stood above the fireplace, and reflected duskily in its spotted depths the faint yellow and crimson of a jarful of tulips which stood among the letters and pipes and cigarettes upon the mantelpiece. A small piano occupied a corner of the room, with the score of Don Giovanni* open upon the bracket.",

The everlasting stillness of the earth now met the intimate, toiling slowness of the train as it climbed up round the sinuous curves, and he had an instant sense of something refound that he had always known--something far, near, strange, and so familiar--and it seemed to him that he had never left the hills, and all that had passed in the years between was like a dream.",

She is a young strawberry-blonde Englishwoman, and has two children—four-year-old Tilly, who has big blue eyes and blonde ringlets, and one-year-old Ruskin, with green eyes and a gregarious manner. Ruskin was born in India and he knows that as a boy child he can get away with anything. He runs into security zones and X-ray machines, jumps on the pilot as he prays to Mecca under the stairwell, takes away a mullah’s walking stick and nearly knocks over a fish tank. The Indian ground staff and Pakistani passengers watch adoringly, occasionally picking him up and giving him a hug and a kiss. On the Pakistan Airlines plane we take off with a wing and a prayer to Allah, and Ruskin is passed close to the cockpit to meet the captain. The events of September 11 have tarnished the Muslim world, but so far our greatest danger is not fanaticism but overfriendliness—Ruskin’s chubby cheeks are constantly pinched adoringly by the captain, the crew and the passengers. By the time we get to Lahore he has red marks. Tilly remains relatively unscathed, though, because she holds up her hand when anyone gets close and yells, “Neh. Bus.”—No. Stop.",

(One of my recurring dreams that year in Moscow was of getting crushed at the bottom of the escalator after a long line of Metro riders toppled over me like dominoes.) The stations also come equipped with microphones, which the attendants utilize at whim: “Respectable passengers, keep to your right. I said the right, not the left.

No dwellings were visible but small herds of cattle wandered through ragged scrub, avidly cropping the short new grass. An occasional cow ambled on to the road to drink from muddy lakelets, then stood surveying me with that intense bovine curiosity which seems so absurdly flattering – why should one be of such interest to any fellow-creature? Previously, young warriors guarded the herds; now, in this area, no predators remain and the children in charge – usually boys, sometimes girls – smiled at me shyly, or waved from a distance; none begged for money. The Masai are shocked to hear that in our ‘advanced’ countries it is no longer always safe for children to roam alone.",
