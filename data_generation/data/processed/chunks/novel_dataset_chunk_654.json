If his companions could run thriving businesses in Cuba and live the kind of lives they wanted, maybe it wasn’t necessary for him to separate from family and friends. Maybe it was possible to make money in the new Cuba. He started to think that instead of asking for asylum as soon as he landed in Miami, he’d attend the classes at FIU, learn what he could about business, and then, just before the program ended, present himself as a refugee if that was still what he wanted. Waiting would give him time to figure out what was the right move. And no matter what he decided, what he’d learn there would make him better prepared to run his own company, wherever it was located.",

And after a while I wasn’t twenty-five, then not even thirty-five, and nothing was quite as good. But in all these years I don’t remember a moment of discouragement. I saw honest men through moods of suicidal gloom – some of them gave up and died; others adjusted themselves and went on to a larger success than mine; but my morale never sank below the level of self-disgust when I had put on some unsightly personal show. Trouble has no necessary connexion with discouragement – discouragement has a germ of its own, as different from trouble as arthritis is different from a stiff joint.",

Mohamed offered to take us around again, but we declined. We were exhausted, physically and mentally, and needed to decompress. Mohamed asked whether we were happy with our tour, and asked if we would like to tour the Valley of the Kings on the left bank of the Nile. His sales pitch was practiced and specific: three sites, including transportation to and from our hotel. He rattled off a list of sites, their entrance fees, and other fine details. The entire trip, he told us, would take four or five hours, depending on our interest, and should start as early in the day as possible to avoid the extreme heat. Teresa and I nodded with enthusiasm. We agreed to meet, at our hotel, in two days.",

There is little reason to go there unless your name happens to be Bryson, and even then, I have to tell you, the pleasure is intermittent. I got a room in the Bennett’s Court Motel, a wonderful old place that appeared not to have changed a bit since 1956, apart from an occasional light dusting. It was precisely as motels always used to be, with the rooms spread out along a covered verandah overlooking a lawn with two trees and a tiny concrete swimming pool, which at this time of year was empty but for a puddle of wet leaves and one pissed-off looking frog. Beside each door was a metal armchair with a scallop-shaped back. By the sidewalk an old neon sign thrummed with the sound of coursing neon gas and spelled out BENNETT’S COURT/VACANCY/AIR-CONDITIONED/GUEST POOL/TV, all in green and pink beneath a tasteful blinking arrow in yellow. When I was small all motels had signs like that. Now you only see them occasionally in small forgotten towns on the edge of nowhere. Bennett’s Court clearly would be the motel in Amalgam.",

All was silent, no works visible – perhaps because the day was Friday? But what could this be? Walking on, I came to an entrance, a pole-bar in front of a black metal gate flanked by low crenellated towers. And above the gate was the explanation, in English and Arabic: ‘The Palestinian Security Sciences Academy’. By then the sun was hot but suddenly I felt chilled. Here foreign security services will train PASF recruits, like my Ramallah friends, to do dirty deeds in their post-Oslo role as US stooges. Walking on, I found it hard to combat despair.

All activities were severely regimented and everyone had to be up and dressed, ready to clean the dormitory communal areas, such as toilets and showers, every morning at 8 a.m. sharp. Having grown-up with a somewhat privileged lifestyle in Manila, with maids and drivers at my beck and call, this change in my life took some serious adjustment. Sister Takagi, who was the headmistress of our dormitory, reprimanded me often about the quality of my cleaning, which, to be fair, was probably not up to scratch because I invariably rushed through it sleepily and without much focus. As a result, she took a special interest in me and monitored me closely.",

For thirty seconds all heads were inclined the same way—to the window. Choosing a pair of gloves—should they be to the elbow or above it, lemon or pale grey?—ladies stopped; when the sentence was finished something had happened. Something so trifling in single instances that no mathematical instrument, though capable of transmitting shocks in China, could register the vibration; yet in its fullness rather formidable and in its common appeal emotional; for in all the hat shops and tailors’ shops strangers looked at each other and thought of the dead; of the flag; of Empire. In a public-house in a back street a Colonial insulted the House of Windsor,* which led to words, broken beer glasses, and a general shindy, which echoed strangely across the way in the ears of girls buying white under-linen threaded with pure white ribbon for their weddings. For the surface agitation of the passing car as it sunk grazed something very profound.",

I found a place, as I thought, free from risk, and gave Kahele a feed of oats on my plaid, but before he had finished them there was a rumbling and vibration, and he went into the ground above his knees, so snatching up the plaid and jumping on him I galloped away, convinced that that crack was following me! However, either the crack thought better of it, or Kahele travelled faster, for in another half-hour I arrived where the whole region steams, smokes, and fumes with sulphur, and was kindly welcomed here by Mr. Gilman, where he and the old Chinaman appear to be alone.",

Cats hymning their loves, and canaries voicing their despairs, were abhorrent to him. Dogs he detested, and wouldn’t suffer to cross his threshold. The house lived an almost inaudible existence. In silence its daily routine was gone through. Quiet voices and soft footsteps were fixed habits. The doors had the best-oiled hinges in London. There was a clock on the stairs which ticked rather coarsely, and there was the inevitable tapping of Jen’s typewriter, but otherwise all was subdued, muffled, reverential.",

No one knew exactly how the miracle was accomplished. She was indolent, passive, the caustic even called her dull; but dressed like an idol, hung with pearls, growing younger and blonder and more beautiful each year, she throned in Mr. Beaufort's heavy brown-stone palace, and drew all the world there without lifting her jewelled little finger. The knowing people said it was Beaufort himself who trained the servants, taught the chef new dishes, told the gardeners what hot-house flowers to grow for the dinner-table and the drawing-rooms, selected the guests, brewed the after-dinner punch and dictated the little notes his wife wrote to her friends. If he did, these domestic activities were privately performed, and he presented to the world the appearance of a careless and hospitable millionaire strolling into his own drawing-room with the detachment of an invited guest, and saying: \"My wife's gloxinias are a marvel, aren't they? I believe she gets them out from Kew.\"",

When I visited I found a bustling little town much like any other in the region but for the string of white stone crosses laid flat in the pavement, with a ‘B’ on one side and an ‘NL’ on the other. The narrow streets were jammed with Belgians stocking up on Dutch Edam cheese, and Dutchmen loading their cars with strong Belgian beer. I couldn’t resist joining the hordes of tourists posing for photographs straddling the equator-style white lines curving through the town, one foot in a Dutch-speaking land of beer and bicycles, and the other in the Netherlands.",

All went well for a week or two. One night I was propped up in bed writing as usual, when I smelled an odor of something burning. It smelled awful. Like rubber and several other things equally disagreeable smouldering. I stood it as long as I could in bed, and then I got up and called Lucille, who slept in the room next to mine. We went about looking for the source. When we got to the salon which was directly over Joseph’s room the smell was overwhelming, so I concluded he was responsible for it.",

His ears became intensely crimson, and even the clear blue of his eyes was darkened many shades by the rush of blood to his head. His lips pouted a little, trembling as though he had been on the point of bursting into tears. I perceived he was incapable of pronouncing a word from the excess of his humiliation. From disappointment too — who knows? Perhaps he looked forward to that hammering he was going to give me for rehabilitation, for appeasement? Who can tell what relief he expected from this chance of a row? He was naive enough to expect anything; but he had given himself away for nothing in this case. He had been frank with himself — let alone with me — in the wild hope of arriving in that way at some effective refutation, and the stars had been ironically unpropitious. He made an inarticulate noise in his throat like a man imperfectly stunned by a blow on the head. It was pitiful.",

In a newish but grotty restaurant, where waves were splashing through open windows on to grey plastic tiles, I was the only customer. Five waitresses, sitting chatting around a central table, at first ignored my beckoning. When I loudly demanded a beer one sour-puss strolled over, grunted in response to my greeting, then indicated a wall notice. Alcohol must not be consumed on the premises. Five minutes later she sauntered back with the menu and before I could order rejoined her compañeros, took out a pocket-mirror and comb, did some hair-fixing, applied lipstick (a scarce commodity) and pretended to forget me. This team wore neat orange-and-blue uniforms. Two of them were playing chess which somehow added a surreal note to the episode.",

I can read a few lines, savor or analyze them, read a few more, sometimes just repeat a few words of the poem; this meditative strolling seems to free the words. The rhythm of my walking matches the poet’s cadence. Ed finds this eccentric, thinks I will be known as the weird American, so when I get to the town gate, I put away my book and concentrate on seeing Maria Rita arranging vegetables, the shopkeeper sweeping the street with one of those witch brooms made of twigs, the barber lighting his first smoke, leaning back in his chair with a tabby sleeping on his lap.

Then, lest the flesh should again be weak, she crept upstairs without any shoes and slipped the note under his door.",

My understanding was that Emilio was a fisherman that was helping out at the resort on a temporary basis. Finn had to attend to some unspecified business and Emilio was to gather supplies for the cay. The morning sun warmed our backs as the boat eased out of the anchorage. When we reached open water Emilio cracked open the big Yamaha’s throttle, brought the boat up onto a plane and aimed for Belize City, eighteen miles to the northwest. Brilliant sunbeams splintered on the wave tops, sparkling like diamonds scattered on a deep blue cloth. We skipped across the surface, keeping our eyes peeled for the big manatees that often feed in the shallows. We sped past Middle Long Cay and The Triangles, over the aptly named Twelve Feet Bank and finally across the slightly deeper waters of The Flat. In little more than half an hour we were closing on Baron Bliss Light, the beacon that sits at the easternmost point of the city.",

The procession was down the steps and slowly setting off; but when the waiting band moved in behind us and struck up the opening bars of a slow march, the notes were instantaneously drowned. Wheels creaked overhead, timbers groaned and a many-tongued and nearly delirious clangour of bells came tumbling into the night; and then, between these bronze impacts, another sound, like insistent clapping, made us all look up. An hour or so before, two storks, tired by their journey from Africa, had alighted on a dishevelled nest under one of the belfries and everyone had watched them settle in. Now, alarmed by the din, desperately flapping their wings and with necks outstretched, they were taking off again, scarlet legs trailing. Black feathers opened along the fringes of their enormous white pinions and then steady and unhastening wing-beats lifted them beyond the chestnut leaves and into the sky as we gazed after them. ‘A fine night they chose for moving in,’ my neighbour said, as we fell in step.",

He paused again, and this time murder sweltered in his heart and was legible upon his face. Softly with the tread of a cat he stepped toward the door, and paused as if getting ready to spring, while it opened: the class waited tensely with held breath. Then, as slowly as the door had opened, a face was thrust in through the opening: it was the face of one of the hall guards, the face of an old man, a face of unutterable melancholy and of the most dismal sourness: the old dull face with its dry sagging flesh and its small watery eyes turned slowly on its scrawny neck, surveying Eugene, the class, and the four walls of the room in a glance full of dislike and suspicion. Then slowly and craftily, as it had come, as if it had been thrust forward on a stick by some unseen hand, the face withdrew, and the door swung to silently once again.",

    "target_paragraph": "Raja had been walking the hills and paths of the Ramallah region for more than forty years. When he began walking, before the Six-Day War of 1967, the appearance of the hills was largely unchanged from the time of the Roman occupation, and it was possible for him to move more or less unimpededly among them: to conduct what in Arabic is known as a sarha. In its original verb-form, sarha meant ‘to let the cattle out to pasture early in the morning, allowing them to wander and graze freely’. It was subsequently humanized to suggest the action of a walker who went roaming without constraint or fixed plan. One might think the English equivalent to be a ‘stroll’, an ‘amble’ or a ‘ramble’, but these words don’t quite catch the implications of escape, delight and improvisation that are carried by sarha. ‘Wander’ comes close, with its word-shadow of ‘wonder’, as does the Scots word ‘stravaig’, meaning to ramble without set goals or destination, but best of all perhaps is ‘saunter’, from the French sans terre, which is a contraction of à la sainte terre, meaning ‘to the sacred place’; i.e. ‘a walking pilgrimage’. Saunter and sarha both have surface connotations of aimlessness, and smuggled connotations of the spiritual.",

According to Berry, that night, the crowd slept in the streets of Louisburgh. It was a clear night, and the temperature dipped consequently low. The next morning, an estimated 200 people were found dead where they lay. The survivors began the long walk south, up over the Stroppabue Pass, and down round Doo Lough. There was no road at that point, and they walked on sheep tracks. Nor were there bridges over the rivers, and at two points the marchers had to ford the Glankeen River, which was turbulent with water from the previous days’ rain.",

Or she might have thought of days earlier yet—days of childhood—when her mouth was somewhat more ready to receive a kiss from his than was his to bestow one. However, all that was over.

He watched them dully and without astonishment as they emerged from blackness and swirled sluggishly and consumed themselves and reappeared, each time a little fainter as his mind cleared. And yet, somewhere blended with them, yet at the same time apart and beyond them with a tranquil aloofness and steadfast among their senseless convolutions, was a face. It seemed to have some relation to the instant itself as it culminated in crashing blackness; at the same time it seemed, for all its aloofness, to be a part of the whirling ensuing chaos; a part of it, yet bringing into the red vortex a sort of constant coolness like a faint, shady breeze. So it remained, aloof and not quite distinct, while the coiling shapes faded into a dull unease of physical pain from the jolting of the car, leaving about him like an echo that cool serenity and something else—a sense of shrinking yet fascinated distaste, of which he or something he had done, was the object.",

At each of our three stops, the shopkeeper inquired about how the kayak business was shaping up for summer, how David and Brittney were doing on their search for a piece of property in town, and how Brittney’s side business making and selling botanical lotions and sprays was doing. At two of those stops we lingered long enough that Brittney herself showed up. Pickings were a little slim at Toshco, a market that resold stuff that the owner purchased at the Costco in Juneau, because the ferry was a day behind schedule. We had better luck at the natural foods market (where David sometimes worked part-time) and at Pep’s Packing, a shop that sold large plastic packages of smoked wild salmon that cost less per pound than some of the lunch meats at Toshco and tasted better than any sashimi I could recall having eaten.",

    "target_paragraph": "Federal 17B easements have their root in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971, which revoked Alaska Native claims to their indigenous lands for a one-time land-and-cash buyout and resulted in the formation of autonomous Native corporations. At $963 million and 44 million acres (10 percent of Alaska’s total acreage), this was no small real estate deal, and the politics of ANCSA are muddled. Seen by some as progressive, the act was a clear improvement over the reservation mentality that had typified the United States’ previous attempts at “compensation” to Native people for their displacement. But it was still typically rapacious, a policy that, spurred by the wet dream of a pipeline economy, forced subsistence cultures into a structure they would not have chosen, and triggered internal battles over extraction versus preservation. Better or worse, there’s no noble way to see a land grab.",
