However after several attempts the military blew up the Shinto-blessed Temple of the Divine Wind, which the Japanese never had time to complete; today only its cyclopean foundations can be seen, acting as podium to the three apartment blocks called Cameron Buildings, above Magazine Gap, and commanding still one of the most triumphant views in Asia.",

They neither of them moved. ‘Tell me the truth,’ he repeated. He felt that he was grinding against something physically hard; she was unyielding. She was like iron, like flint, rigid up the backbone. And when she said, ‘It’s no use. It’s no use. This is the end’—after he had spoken for hours, it seemed, with the tears running down his cheeks—it was as if she had hit him in the face.

    "target_paragraph": "By the closing decades of the nineteenth century, the veneration of height was almost automatic. For those inhabitants of Europe who didn’t care to run the risks of stepping on to a hillside, or couldn’t afford to, the experience of being at height was available in a multitude of forms. Books of landscape photographs and engravings, expedition journals and knockdown editions of Romantic poetry all provided stay-at-homes with at least second-hand versions of the facts and the feelings about altitude. Following the lead of earlier continental mountain painters such as Salvator Rosa and Josse de Momper, nineteenth-century artists including Philippe de Loutherbourg, J. M. W. Turner, Alexander Cozens and John Martin filled their canvases with precipitous scenery, using distorted scales, unconventional viewpoints and disrupted horizons to unbalance their viewers and pull them into the vertiginous worlds of their images. At the Leicester Square Rotunda or the Panorama Strand in the 1820s and 1830s, spectators could wander in the darkened central circular platform, while around them for 360° stretched a multiple vanishing-point painting of the Mont Blanc massif – an ‘alporama’. There for an hour or two they could fill their heads with the startling geometries of the mountainscape: the glint of snow and ice, and the black ribs of rock. The ambition of the alporama was hyperrealism, and it was successful – visitors had been known to experience acute disorientation, and even vertigo. And after the 1850s, what one passenger called the ‘delightful velocity’ of the railways hastened the return journey to Zermatt from sixty-six days to fourteen, and the entrepreneurship of one Thomas Cook – dubbed ‘The Napoleon of Excursions’ – brought the masses to see the Matterhorn: such a bracing shock after the low-altitude skylines of Britain’s cities.",

George Street, the core of the New Town (as the less old part of central Edinburgh is misleadingly called), presented an unquestionably fine, if damp, prospect with its statues and stately squares, but far too many of the Georgian buildings had been clumsily abused by the addition of modern frontages. Just around the corner from my hotel was an office supply shop with plate-glass windows that had been grafted onto an eighteenth-century frontage in a way that was nothing short of criminal, and there were others in like vein here and there along the surrounding streets.",

He was back on the platform above the outboard, concentrating on his poling and watching Allen’s fly rod handiwork when he saw what looked like a black cloud coming toward them from the mangroves. Within seconds they were enveloped in a cloud of mosquitoes – millions of them. Allen dropped his fly rod, and he dropped the pole. Allen grabbed a can of mosquito repellant and sprayed it directly in their faces and then all over the rest of them from head to toe. The mess was unbelievable – millions of dead mosquitos swimming in insect repellent all over every exposed bit of their skin. The spitting, blowing, and spluttering lasted for quite a while as they emptied three cans of repellant over themselves.",

Here long grass grew lush beneath flowering shrubs, above a flashing green river, and the air was soft with warm content. We had enjoyed an autumn zone too, during our long descent, seeing shining red, black and brown berries and nuts, and walking through the crispness of crimson, orange and russet leaves.",

Hot with skating and with love they would throw themselves down in some solitary reach, where the yellow osiers fringed the bank, and wrapped in a great fur cloak Orlando would take her in his arms, and know, for the first time, he murmured, the delights of love. Then, when the ecstasy was over and they lay lulled in a swoon on the ice, he would tell her of his other loves, and how, compared with her, they had been of wood, of sackcloth, and of cinders.* And laughing at his vehemence, she would turn once more in his arms and give him, for love’s sake, one more embrace. And then they would marvel that the ice did not melt with their heat, and pity the poor old woman who had no such natural means of thawing it, but must hack at it with a chopper of cold steel. And then, wrapped in their sables, they would talk of everything under the sun; of sights and travels; of Moor and Pagan; of this man’s beard and that woman’s skin; of a rat that fed from her hand at table; of the arras that moved always in the hall at home; of a face; of a feather.

For generations the Trinitarios have been fixated on their song-birds – black, swallow-sized, with white-flecked wings.

Putting his satchel on his head he descended to the road where, on seeing me, he genuflected. Most children in rural areas greeted me thus – I hope (and believe) merely because I’m an elder, not because I’m a mzungu.

Everything is coated with a thick layer of desert dust. Tables and chairs, bookcases and floors, carpets and doors, beds and lamps, fridges and stoves, paintings and lamps are all brown. And so am I. At night I wash a putrid paste out of my ears, nose, hair and mouth; it’s a cocktail of dust and chemical residue mixed with a dash of Indian sweat. I now smell like a local as the spices from Rachel’s cooking seep from my skin. Indian sweat has an aroma like nothing else in the world—it’s a sickly sweet mix of onions, turmeric, chili and chutney. A cloud of thick, tangy perspiration hangs over Delhi, pulled down by the stench of boiling diesel fuel, rotting garbage and fetid drains.",

White-haired and sweetly unobtrusive, Jenny is easily the wonder of the lot. If you saw her in a supermarket you would take her for a schoolteacher or civil servant. In fact, for 25 years she has gone wherever there is danger—to Chechnya, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Rwanda. She is fearless and evidently indestructible.

One of the first of these reports was a letter by a Mr Muraltus, published on 9 February 1673 in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, London’s foremost intellectual institution. It was accompanied by a rough illustrative plate of the Lower Grindelwald glacier which showed an army of icy pinnacles marching down a steep-sided valley. ‘The Icy Mountain,’ began Muraltus confidently, ‘deserves to be view’d.’ He continued:",

One boy, thin and laughing and fourteen, told me that he had quit school because he was “lazy.” He had a Japanese comic book that got passed around the ferry roof. The book was a bizarre mash-up: cutesy children’s cartoons, hairy-armed war stories, nurse-and-doctor soap opera, graphic pornography. A ferry crewman frowned when he got to the porn, tore each page out, crumpled it, and threw it in the sea. The boys laughed. Finally, with a great bark of disgust, the sailor threw the whole book in the water, and the boys laughed harder. I watched the tattered pages float away in a glassy lagoon. I closed my eyes. I felt the weight of unmapped worlds, unborn language. This was what I was chasing: not the exotic, but a broad-beamed understanding of what is what.",

The smell of fresh doughnuts drifted across the water from a bakery near Wise’s shop. On the horizon a container ship was steaming toward the Gate. We decided we were too far out. As we began paddling back toward the takeoff area, gliding watchfully over the swells, I asked Edwin about the surf in Argentina. I knew he still made occasional trips there to visit family. He laughed. “After this place, I couldn’t believe how easy it was to surf there,” he said. “The water was so warm! The waves were so mellow! There were girls on the beach!”",

The plan was to head to the Vava’u Group which would take them on a route that would take them near Beverage Reef which was a coral seamount with a navigable pass and a reasonable anchorage that was fine in settled conditions, but not if there was a blow. Several boats on the net mentioned that it was a good place to stop mid-way on the run to Tonga. The route would also take them right past the island of Niue which was also reported to be a good spot, but it too had an anchorage that was only suitable in settled conditions.",

At other moments past and present were enveloped in a dull fog of rancour which distorted and faded even the image she presented to her morning mirror. There were days when every young face she saw left in her a taste of poison. But when she compared herself with the specimens of her sex who plied their languid industries under the palms, or looked away as she passed them in hall or staircase, her spirits rose, and she rang for her maid and dressed herself in her newest and vividest. These were unprofitable triumphs, however. She never made one of her attacks on the organized disapproval of the community without feeling she had lost ground by it; and the next day she would lie in bed and send down capricious orders for food, which her maid would presently remove untouched, with instructions to transmit her complaints to the landlord.",

For forty-five years she has been in Mexico, and thirty or more years ago, when her husband died, she began to keep the Station Hotel. War and peace make no difference to her. The American flag flies over the door and in her house she alone is boss. When Pascual Orozco took Jimenez, his men began a drunken reign of terror in the town. Orozco himself—Orozco the invincible, the fierce, who would as soon kill a person as not—came drunk to the Station Hotel with two of his officers and several women.\nDoña Luisa planted herself across the doorway—alone—and shook her fist in his face. \"Pascual Orozco,\" she cried, \"take your disreputable friends and go away from here. I’m keeping a decent hotel!\" And Orozco went....",

To this day, most Catholic churches in Britain mark the third of February with the ceremony of the Blessing of the Throats, when two unlighted candles are held against the necks of the faithful.

The goal grew nearer. There was the main gate. There the little tunnel.

Along them in the Iron Age moved Cornish tin, art motifs, domesticated animals and precious metals. Along them in the Dark Ages moved the heavy freights of violence, trade and religion. Along them in the Middle Ages moved stone, lime, rope, pantiles, timber, wood-carving techniques, vernacular violin-playing, songs and airs (one of Robert Burns’s most perfect songs, ‘The Gallant Weaver’, is set to a Scandinavian tune).",

And the RLG was a mirage, not even as solid as a façade! For years there’d been no relationship between them and the people. Except for the Pathet Lao’s liberated zones, Laos was run by USAID on behalf of the CIA. They’d hijacked all administrative power, even openly running essential services. Junior Lao staff in USAID departments were paid more than senior officers in the Royal Ghost Government, as the Pathet Lao called it. The peasants couldn’t know all this but felt no obligation to a government that didn’t relate to them in any way. No taxes were demanded because the US wanted to keep people loyal to its puppet – so the RLG offered nothing. All money, for us or the peasants, came from Washington. Think how that weakened the state! Society disintegrated everyway round. In this province the nouveaux riches started buying up the best agricultural land and we’d our first landlordism problem – peasants reduced to seasonal work or menial casual jobs in the city. And traditional co-operation in the villages was threatened by economic rivalry – what Mouhot wanted to see! The Party, once in power, did try hard to put Humpty-Dumpty together again – with some success but they gave up too soon. The mess we’re in now comes of uneducated peasants running the show. Brave men, great soldiers, idealists who truly cared about their fellow-peasants and believed Communism could help them. But not people able to govern a country in such chaos. If only they’d had the wisdom to stick with the coalition! The middle class would have stayed to work with them and they could have hung on to their socialist principles – not too alien to Lao culture. During the Second World War the Pathet Lao emerged as a straightforward anti-colonial movement but the Cold War left no space for a little country like Laos to work out its own salvation. First we’d the French, then the Americans sitting on our necks. Not to mention the Vietcong needing to use us – and Ho Chi Minh was truly inspiring, a great and good leader. So the young Lao who’d started out as unaligned freedom fighters became old men rigidly committed to Marxism. Now those are being replaced by younger leaders trying to walk the tightrope between state control and the free market – not a pleasant sight. Here in the city tourists are buying drugs and children are gambling, something against the ’89 Criminal Code. And no one believes the official story about prostitution being under control. You can’t count the “hostesses” in the discos and night-clubs – at $15 from a Lao and $35 or more from a falang.’",

Madeira has no continental shelf. It is like Hawaii that way. Giant storm swells from the north and west cross very deep water unimpeded and strike the island full force. But even Hawaii has, in many places, offshore reefs to absorb the impact, and sandy beaches. Madeira supposedly has a beach, somewhere on the east side, but in a decade of chasing waves there I never saw it. The shore was rocks and cliffs, which often multiplied the danger quotient, which was already high, by a large factor. We were mining a rich lode of bliss. But disaster never felt far away.",

She headed for Regla, where she knew of a store that sold old hotel sheets. Like the aluminum discs that Novalum turned into pots and pitchers, she considered the soiled and torn sheets her raw material. Back home, she laid them out on a table and cut out the stains and worn spots. Her idea was simple. Cuban women traditionally buy elaborate crib sets, called la canastilla, for their newborns. The sets consist of necessities such as tiny sheets, blankets, and pillows, along with playful extras like shiny piping or cartoon characters sewn into mosquito netting. Times might be tough, but new mothers always seemed to find enough money to outfit their newborns in finery. She sat down at the sewing machine with a clear picture in her mind of what she wanted to make, but no matter how hard she tried, her hands refused to do what she wanted. She had watched the seamstresses in the Puntex workshops zip through yards of material in machine-gun bursts, but her Union Special just wouldn’t move the way she intended. Material bunched up, stitches wavered crazily, seams didn’t match.",
