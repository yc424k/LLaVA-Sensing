The young attendant loaded my magazine with the rounds of ammo I'd purchased, and said something which, at the time, I didn't understand. He obviously took my bemused expression as an affirmative, so clicked a couple of switches on the machine gun and handed it back to me. I soon realised that his question was whether I wanted the rifle on automatic fire mode. Unfortunately, I only realised this upon squeezing the trigger. I was wearing ear protectors but the upward jolt of the rifle away from my shoulder as I squeezed the trigger, dislodged them. The force of the weapon's recoil caused me to stagger backwards, while still spraying bullets into the air with a deafening report. With my large black ear defenders knocked askew on my head, I must have looked like Mickey Mouse on a suicide mission. I crashed into the attendant, who seemed unmoved by the incident, but quickly surveyed the sky above us, presumably to ensure I hadn't brought down any passing aircraft.",

In earlier times this was necessary to keep out the cold of winter and to protect the privacy of an extended family, but today there is much less need for such partitions. So the first thing to do when renovating a Japanese house is to remove the shoji and fusuma. The corridors and verandahs merge with the inner rooms, enlarging the space dramatically. When I moved into Chiiori, black wooden doors so heavy you could hardly move them blocked off the rooms. Taking them out banished to a large extent the oppressive darkness the young girl had complained of in her diary.",

So were most of the passengers. Through the airport window I saw two Aeroflot pilots squatting on their haunches in that way Russian men do, each enjoying a smoke on the tarmac not far from the planes. When I stepped into the cabin, the density of the fumes in there would have been sufficient to smoke meat. (Sometime after that I learned that Aeroflot had changed its policy; now, like other airlines, it does not allow smoking on its flights.)",

Eleven years ago, as an awkward postadolescent, this annoyed me intensely, but now I see it’s a fair exchange for my voyeurism.",

Kanye West was playing on the sound system and perhaps 300 people were jumping energetically to the music, many of them still with their sunglasses on. It didn’t seem like many of them had looked at the art, although I did see one girl in a ‘FUCK WARHOL’ T-shirt. Nervous security guards loitered at the gallery entrances, battling to maintain a cordon between the heaviest drinkers and the priceless antiquities beyond. Near the entrance to the new Asian art pavilion, a man with a long beard and a thick sleeve of tattoos passed a small plastic bag of white pills to his girlfriend.

Its countless coves, fjords, passages, and arms are particular paradise for kayakers. The semiprotected waters confer safer travel for small crafts than the open seas of the Gulf of Alaska; frequent landforms and the sinewy curves of glaciated topography give respite from fetch, tempering the winds that billow over open water. On Prince William Sound, you could poke around in a kayak for decades and never visit the same place twice. Even at a faster traveling pace, say a twelve-glaciers-in-twelve-days push or a months-long expedition, the breadth of the Sound is difficult to fathom. From the air it looks like a shape-shifting amoeba, organic limbs snaky on all sides.",

An older couple runs a B&B, and I take the second story room with excitement. Their attached house is connected to the local Coop (supermarket)! Food will never be far away. I discover that the older couple smoke but have developed a system where they open a skylight whereby the smoke is sucked out, and the stairway to my room is made frigid. The lady of the house has kindly turned my electric blanket on “high” where it remains for two days. Tobermory is a tourist town and as one Scot said to me, “We all seem to have developed economies that depend on us visiting each other.” I think this a fairly deep thought and probably right. Certainly it is in Tobermory, although there is also a smaller complementary local economy based on fishing and agriculture.",

But no; it was the mystery of her eyes—those eyes which, as Kate had told her, she had chosen for herself from some forgotten ancestral treasury into which none of the others had dipped. Between olive and brown, but flecked with golden lights, a little too deep-set, the lower lid flowing up smooth and flat from the cheek, and the black lashes as evenly set as the microscopic plumes in a Peruvian feather-ornament; and above them, too prominent, even threatening, yet melting at times to curves of maiden wonder, the obstinate brows of old Mrs. Clephane.

    "target_paragraph": "This time he used the hound’s voice for a bearing from the start. When he entered the bottom he thought about wind and paused to test it. But there was no wind, so he went straight on toward the howling, not fast now since he was trying for silence, yet not slow either since this would not take long and then he could return home and lie down before midnight, long before midnight, telling himself as he moved cautiously and steadily toward the howling: Now I can go back to sleeping at night again. The howling was quite near now. He slanted the gun forward, his thumb on the two hammers. Then the dog’s voice stopped, again in midhowl; again for an instant he saw the two yellow points of eyes before the gun-muzzle blotted them. In the glare of the explosion he saw the whole animal sharp in relief, leaping. He saw the charge strike and hurl it backward into the loud welter of following darkness. By an actual physical effort he restrained his finger before it contracted on the second trigger and with the gun still at his shoulder he crouched, holding his breath and glaring into the sightless dark while the tremendous silence which had been broken three nights ago when the first cry of the hound reached him and which had never once been restored, annealed, even while he slept, roared down about him and, still roaring, began to stiffen and set like cement, not only in his hearing but in his lungs, his breathing, inside and without him too, solidifying from tree-trunk to tree-trunk, among which the shattered echoes of the shot died away in strangling murmurs, caught in that cooling solidity before they had had time to cease. With the gun still cocked and presented, he advanced toward the place where he had seen the dog fall, panting through his bared clenched teeth, feeling about with his feet in the undergrowth. Then he realised suddenly that he had already passed the spot and that he was still advancing. He knew that he was about to start running and then he was running, blindly in the pitch darkness, speaking, hissing to himself: Stop. Stop. You’ll bust your damn brains out. He stopped, panting. He got his bearings anew on a patch of sky, yet he forced himself to remain motionless until even the panting stopped. Then he let the hammer of the gun down and went on, walking now. Now he had the booming of the frogs to guide him, blending and fading then rising again in choral climax, each separate voice not a single note but an octave, almost a chord, in bass, growing louder and louder and nearer and nearer, then ceasing abruptly too into a second of frozen immobility followed by a swift random patter of small splashes like hands striking the water, so that when he saw the water it was already shattered into fluid ceaseless gleams across which reflected stars slid and vanished and recovered. He flung the gun. For an instant he saw it, spinning slowly. Then it splashed, not sinking but disintegrating among that shattered scurrying of broken stars.",

With dispassionate despair, with entire disillusionment, I surveyed the dust dance; my life, my friends’ lives, and those fabulous presences, men with brooms, women writing, the willow tree by the river—clouds and phantoms made of dust too, of dust that changed, as clouds lose and gain and take gold or red and lose their summits and billow this way and that, mutable, vain. I, carrying a notebook, making phrases, had recorded mere changes; a shadow, I had been sedulous to take note of shadows. How can I proceed now, I said, without a self, weightless and visionless, through a world weightless, without illusion?",

He had been anxious and distressed, but he hadn’t moaned. The moaning had been done, she remembered, exclusively by her. George had been her comfort, her rock. What comfort could Virginia have got that day out of Stephen? And it was after all Virginia who was having the baby.",

Around a score of large expensive vehicles the atmosphere was festive; this might have been a Bank Holiday crowd gathered at some beauty-spot. Picnic baskets were opened, tapes of favourite pop groups competed disharmoniously, older children noisily played hide and seek amidst the trees, toddlers tried out their new toys, Daddies drank furtively inside their vehicles (alcohol is forbidden within the precincts), Grannies sat on camp-chairs dandling babies and Mummies rummaged in ice-boxes for cool-drinks. One can scarcely ask, ‘What’s he in for?’ but I did feel intensely curious, observing these prosperous and conventional family groups. Were they visiting political prisoners? Or drug dealers? Or fraudsters?",

Her charming husband had lost all the land she inherited from her parents, who owned a big corner of South Georgia. On Sunday rides, she’d always want Mother to drive her by the property she’d lost. She couldn’t see when we got there but she could smell peanut and cotton crops in the humid air. “All this,” she’d mutter, “all this.” I’d look up from my book. The brown earth on either side of the car spread flat to the horizon. From there, who could believe the world is round? I first thought of her when we had the terraces plowed and the upturned earth was ready for planting. Fertile earth, rich as chocolate cake.

The sun had shifted, leaving me in the shade, so I guessed I'd been asleep for around an hour. My mouth was dry and my body still ached, though my shivers had subsided. I slowly turned my head to the left to see what had woken me, and my gaze was met by a pair of large brown eyes staring back at me from around five feet away. It was a male Chital deer, sporting an impressive set of three-pronged antlers. Grazing close by were a female and two fawns, their golden coats flecked with bright white spots, explaining the species' other name, the Ceylonese Spotted Deer. The deer family seemed unworried by my presence, and I remained still, watching the adults graze on buttercups, as their offspring amused themselves skipping about the clearing, chasing butterflies. Lying in the shade of a thousand-year-old ruin, in a peaceful sunlit forest, with only the forest creatures for company, I reflected that there were much worse places to be ill.",

The new har-mattan winds blew dust everywhere, and Baby joined the thin children who ran around with their naked bellies wreathed in brown. Many of the children collected pieces of shrapnel, played with them, traded them. When Baby came back with two bits of jagged metal, Olanna shouted at her and pulled her ear and took them away. She hated to think that Baby was playing with the cold leftovers of things that killed. But Kainene asked her to give them back to Baby. Kainene gave Baby a can to store the shrapnel. Kainene asked Baby to join the older children making lizard traps, to learn how to mat the palm fronds and place the cocoon full of iddo ants inside. Kainene let Baby hold the dagger of the emaciated man who paraded the compound, muttering, “Ngwa, let the vandals come, let them come now.” Kainene let Baby eat a lizard leg.",

This feudal overlord—who by this decree ensured that peasants and shepherds would be completely dependent upon him—was not a pleasant fellow. He often shot at the water pitchers women carried on their heads (he seems to have suffered from boredom); sometimes he missed and shot the women instead. He skinned monks alive. The trulli are thought to have evolved from tumuli, or mounds, under which prehistoric tribes of Asia Minor—whose rudimentary utensils and arrows have been unearthed in Puglia—buried their dead. A trullo may present itself to the imagination as a Pyramid domesticated and brought to human scale. . . . To numbers of visitors it has seemed, instead, like a fairy-tale dwelling; for them, neither the Pyramids nor the Orient but Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs come to mind.",

She was not happy to meet us and had little news to give. She was off to her Hindu ashram after all; later she would be joining her husband. Now she was busy: she had to find her bus. It was a bus of the Radhakishun service. She turned this name to the more familiar ‘Radha Krishna’; her mind still ran on the Hindu legends. Krishna was the dark god, Radha the fair milkmaid with whom he sported.",

The inhabitants were in a state of suppressed alarm and ready, at the least provocation, to burst out into some fiendish act of folly. And the Russians, especially those latest arrivals, could not withdraw themselves from the subtle influence of the sound wind, the frank stimulation of a cloudless sky; it made them fell, after their gloomy forests and lowering horizons, like wild beasts that rush from darkened cages into some sunny arena. Everyone lost his wits. The appearance of a constable, far from restoring order, was the signal for an uproarious tumult; the FRACAS, as the French artist was heard to declare, promptly developed into a MELEE. Nobody troubled about the merits of the case further than that it was a question of Apostles VERSUS Gentiles.",
