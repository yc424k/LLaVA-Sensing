Overcome by the sight of the cool and limpid flood, we unsaddled in a shady field about the size of a paddock, took off all our clothes, climbed down through the reeds and watercress and dived in. Swimming downstream with lazy breast-stroke or merely drifting in the shade of the poplars and the willows, we talked and laughed about our recent fellow guests. The water was dappled with leafy shade near the bank and scattered with thistle-down, and a heron made off down a vista of shadows. Fleets of moorhens doubled their speed and burst noisily out of the river, and wheat, maize and tiers of vineyard were gliding past us when all at once we heard some singing. Two girls were reaping the end of a narrow strip of barley; going by the colours of their skirts and their embroidered tops, braid sashes and kerchiefs, they had come for the harvest from a valley some way off. They stopped as we swam into their ken, and, when we drew level, burst out laughing. Apparently the river was less of a covering than we had thought. They were about nineteen or twenty, with sunburnt and rosy cheeks and thick dark plaits, and not at all shy. One of them shouted something, and we stopped and trod water in mid-Maros. István interpreted, ‘They say we ought to be ashamed of ourselves,’ he said, ‘and they threaten to find our clothes and run off with them.’",

For him it’s hundred yard dash after hundred yard dash.

What I do not say is the truth: After that weather report, better I should be in the breakfast room being watched rather than in my room where I may crawl into the bathtub and slit my wrists. Breakfast is ample and yummy. Black pudding has yet to cross my lips. Thoughts of it are so revolting I ask for it to be left off the plate. I discover that belying its looks, a potato scone is not a leaden, grease filled triangle of dough but a rather light and tasty addition. Wrangling the bags down two flights of stairs is only a slight improvement over dragging them up. I ride back to Kilwinning and take a left hand turn. The ferry awaits.",

It was warmer here. And after awhile he was right: there was nobody here save himself; on a suitable bench he lay down, drawing and huddling his knees up into the buttoned jumper, looking no larger than a child and no less waif, abandoned, when something hard was striking the soles of his feet and time, a good deal of it, had passed and the night itself was now cold and vacant.

She’d been overcome with relief when she learned that Harris was safe at Camp Four. Now, however, Hall’s wife back in Christchurch, Jan Arnold, would have to do the unthinkable: call McPherson back to inform her there had been a horrible mistake—that Andy was in fact missing and presumed dead. Imagining this phone conversation, and my role in the events leading up to it, I fell to my knees with dry heaves, retching over and over as the icy wind blasted against my back.",

It would fly above the pack ice that locks the channel between Spitzbergen and Greenland. It would pass, as all things meridian must, over the Pole. From there, without changing direction, it would fly south past the ice-bound island of Vrangelya in the Chukotse Sea. Only after many hours would it reach ground as high as Hope again: a nameless peak in the mountains of north-western Siberia, where the temperature is so cold that steel splits and larch trees shower sparks at the touch of an axe. As I drove east to the mountain from Kinlochbervie, I imagined Ben Hope and this nameless peak rhyming in their altitude, across thousands of miles of cold space, each northering towards the other.",

So much in Buenos Aires was built on a bombastic scale, fit for a city of kings; so much was erected to be worthy of a country named after a precious metal, its capital of Good Airs built on the River of Silver. The buildings that remain now are an admonition almost, a reminder of splendors that never quite materialized. The downtown tearooms, like the Richmond or the Ideal, were built on a heroic scale, rich with mirrors, fleurs-de-lis, and thick leather chairs; gray-haired old waiters still stand on a vanished dignity as they dish out boiled potatoes and pots of strong tea. But there is something increasingly dusty about these places now, and frayed—the architectural equivalents of those lonely, charming con men in Graham Greene who go around abroad in Old Etonian ties. The pathos grows more piquant when Argentines, translating their terms into English, speak never of “decay” but, always, “decadence.”",

No one seemed to know how long the strike would last, but it had begun the previous day, and a helpful English-speaking traveller provided the unhelpful answer I didn't want to hear - definitely no buses today. Maybe none tomorrow. For us, this was a big problem. At best, we would miss the delights of the Mendoza region and arrive just in time to catch our flight to the capital. At worst, we would miss that flight. (Booked well in advance, at the cheapest fare, and obviously totally non-refundable). Had we been on a longer trip, the obvious response to the situation would have been to return to our hotel and check-in for another day or two, then continue to enjoy our time in Chile's laidback capital. For us though, on a tight two week schedule, we had to cling to any faint hope that the dispute would be resolved quickly. That meant hanging around the bleak compound with the other stranded hordes, resting on our bags in a dusty corner, monitoring the expressions of the hi-vis officials, and trying to decipher the latest rumour with our limited Spanish. I'd spotted a party of around forty eleven-year-olds with their teachers, all wearing matching red baseball caps emblazoned with their school name, and guessing correctly that the teachers would speak better English than I speak Spanish, I sidled over and engaged a bearded, red-capped Geography teacher in conversation.",

His white-headed father spoke nothing but Magyar and his eyes, deep-set in wrinkles, lost all their caution as we worked our way down the bottle. I could just make out that the deer, betokened by spread fingers for their missing antlers, belonged to a föherceg (which later turned out to mean an archduke). Continuing in sign-language, the younger swineherd grunted, scowled fiercely and curled up his forefingers to represent the tusks of the wild boars that lurked in brakes hereabouts; then he twirled them in spirals which could only mean moufflon. The sign-language grew blunter still when he jovially shadowed forth how wild boars broke in and covered tame sows and scattered the pens with miscegenate farrow. I contributed some hard-boiled eggs to their supper of delicious smoked pork: they sprinkled it with paprika and we ate it with black bread and onions and some nearly fossilised cheese.",

She recoiled at the mere idea, and feeling a chair behind her, she obeyed the suggestion of the touch, and sat down. Her intention had been simply to get outside the door for ever. And if this feeling was correct, its mental form took an unrefined shape corresponding to her origin and station. “I would rather walk the streets all the days of my life,” she thought. But this creature, whose moral nature had been subjected to a shock of which, in the physical order, the most violent earthquake of history could only be a faint and languid rendering, was at the mercy of mere trifles, of casual contacts. She sat down. With her hat and veil she had the air of a visitor, of having looked in on Mr Verloc for a moment. Her instant docility encouraged him, whilst her aspect of only temporary and silent acquiescence provoked him a little.",

    "target_paragraph": "When Mass was over the Governor summoned me into the church, the chief priest dispensed me from removing my boots and one of the debtaras handed me a prayer-stick – a five-foot staff, with a curved horizontal silver handle on which one can lean comfortably while taking part in the long Coptic ceremonies. We then walked around the straw-strewn outer ambulatory to a raggedly carpeted section in front of the torn sanctuary curtain, which is pulled aside at certain times during Mass so that the male congregation may see the altar. Here we paused for a few moments, because the choir – at the Governor’s request – were now chanting a special prayer for my safety in the Semiens. (This Dawit explained later, and I was touched by Ato Gabre Mariam’s so nicely expressed concern – as indeed I have often been, during the past two days, by his various gestures of friendship. I only hope the final gesture won’t be the provision of an armed guard tomorrow morning.) Then four priests stepped down into the ambulatory and performed one of the traditional religious dances. Facing each other in pairs they advanced and retreated with stylised but vigorous movements, wielding their prayer-sticks as though they were spears, while the congregation clapped their hands rhythmically and drums were beaten and bells rung and sistra shaken. Next I was shown the few Ge’ez manuscripts – inscribed on goatskin parchment, bound in wood and richly illustrated – which have survived. These were thrown in a dirty chest on the floor of the inner ambulatory and obviously no one here deserves to have the care of such precious volumes; it is revealing to contrast the neglect of these books with the reverence shown towards any volume of the Buddhist scriptures by even the least educated Tibetan monk. As we left the church I echoed Dawit’s ‘Savages!’ under my breath. People who blow their noses into the fire hardly qualify for this epithet, but people who abuse centuries-old illuminated manuscripts most certainly do.",

The outstanding error of judgement in flying over the Sudd, as a matter of fact, was made by a man – the late Ernst Udet let himself run out of petrol while crossing it during the dry season and forced-landed on a ridge of hardened mud, where, after several anxious days, he was found by Tom Black, whose understanding of the Sudd was such that he was willing to spend days trying to get somebody out of it. Udet himself was hardly worse for the experience, but his mechanic was near death from mosquito bites.",

All the stupidity and pomposity of the Old South seemed to be encapsulated in those five golden syllables. Maybe things were picking up. Maybe now I would see chain-gangs toiling in the sun and a prisoner in heavy irons legging it across fields and sloshing through creeks while pursued by bloodhounds, and lynch mobs roaming the streets and crosses burning on lawns. The prospect enlivened me, but I had to calm down because a state trooper pulled up alongside me at a traffic light and began looking me over with that sort of casual disdain you often get when you give a dangerously stupid person a gun and a squad car. He was sweaty and overweight and sat low in his seat. I assume he was descended from the apes like all the rest of us, but clearly in his case it had been a fairly gentle slope. I stared straight ahead with a look that I hoped conveyed seriousness of purpose mingled with a warm heart and innocent demeanour. I could feel him looking at me. At the very least I expected him to gob a wad of tobacco juice down the side of my head. Instead, he said, ‘How yew doin’?’",

It’s a lonely creature. It is the incandescence of the water. Cast up with eyes made of agate, onyx, those words if you attack them blatantly mean nothing. She said I was deciduous, but that word is cottony. Mrs. Rabb said, ‘You mean cotton-y?’ Cotton is most words; frizzle, sizzle those thoughts that go up like newspapers in a bonfire.

    "target_paragraph": "Many years later, climbing the marvellous covered stairway that leads to the first platform of the Shwe Dagon pagoda in Rangoon, I stopped half-way and tried to remember what this steep ascent called to mind; and, in a moment, I was back a couple of decades and climbing a windy staircase under beams and shingle and a steep wooden roof in Transylvania. The Saxon steps lifted us to the town’s grassy summit, whose battlements in the sky encompassed leaning gravestones, tall trees and an old gothic church. A roof as steep as a barn’s, with all the semicircular scales discoloured by lichen, rose from the mottled walls; and indoors airy space ascended to a mediaeval web of vaults. There were pointed arches once again and lancets, trefoils and cusps, and in the chancel, traces of fresco three-quarters flaked away, a crucifixion or a transfiguration, perhaps: the exact memory has dropped away too. Armorial tombstones were piled at random under the bell-sallies, and the organ must have broken down, for somebody practising on a harmonium rumbled and wheezed in the gallery. The theme of the Danube School altarpiece has dimmed as well. ‘A marvellous mixture of rough stone,’ my diary says, ‘faded brick and plaster, scalloped doorways, age piled on age, all first rate and all with that untouched, musty feeling one treasures.’ I thought it was a Catholic church at first, but the absence of sanctuary lamps and the Stations of the Cross hinted otherwise. So it was Lutheran, and much less bleak and stripped than Calvinist and Unitarian interiors. There were other hints. Pews, as opposed to chairs, seemed a distinguishing mark of the Reform.",

My method, which actually works pretty well, is to treat as a weed anything that hasn’t flowered by August and to sprinkle everything else with bone meal, slug pellets, and whatever else I find lying around the potting shed. Once or twice a summer I tip everything with a skull and crossbones on the label into a spray canister and give everything a jolly good dousing. It’s an unorthodox approach and occasionally, I admit, I have to leap out of the way of an abruptly falling tree that has failed to respond to ministrations, but generally it has been a success and I have achieved some interesting and novel mutational effects. I once got a fence post to fruit, for instance.",

Drifting past charred fields and tangles of slash, he saw in the future of the Magdalena only devastation. The entire drainage, he predicted, would be ravaged by settlers—some desperate with hunger, others blinded by greed, all foolish enough to believe that the destruction of tropical forests, surely among the most precious of God’s creations, was a sign of the upward march of civilization. The scabrous openings and scarred earth along the Magdalena’s shores represented not progress to Bolívar but, rather, the spreading shadows of Armageddon. Touched by fever, he shouted at his secretaries, spitting out words and phrases that were less bitter than apocalyptic. As his small party approached Mompox, they discovered that even the river had turned on him, shifting its flow from his beloved city to the Brazo de Loba near Magangué.",

It was therefore something of a surprise to suddenly see the gardener, silhouetted against the rising moon, begin to cry out in pain and flail his arms wildly, to such an extent that it seemed he was about to tumble off the roof. Gaston and I exchanged puzzled glances, until, a couple of seconds later, we also came under attack. The tickly itch of insects on my skin and hair was suddenly replaced by the sensation of being jabbed repeatedly with sharp pins. Alerted by our squeals of pain, Kirsty peered from the porch to witness Gaston and I performing a bizarre dance in the moonlight, hopping from foot to foot around the flaming foliage, slapping our heads and bodies, while swearing in French and English. We were soon joined by the gardener who flew down the ladder like a fireman on a pole, before disappearing into the darkness, howling in pain, having borne the brunt of the ants' attack.",

In March 1867, Muir was attempting to remove the belt from a circular saw. A file he was holding slipped and flew into his right eye. “When he opened the eyelid, the liquid filling the space between the lens and the cornea dripped into his hand,” according to Muir biographer Donald Worster. By day’s end, sympathetic blindness had left him sightless in both eyes.",

Our hopes rose when we found an active irrigation channel but on trying to follow it our way was blocked by an impenetrable thorn hedge. So instead we followed a stream a few inches deep, with an almost invisible pathlet beside it. For lack of anything else, we decided this must be the Camino Real: tomorrow will prove us right or wrong. Here we were climbing again, following a river-bed no less stoney than the Rio Negra’s. At 5.40 we came to this site, which is very beautiful but remarkably inconvenient from several points of view. We could have continued for another half-hour in search of grazing but my nail-hole was being tiresome. The Rio Negra had long since removed its bandage and too many wettings, plus sand in my sock, had not soothed it. So for this evening I decided to put myself before Juana, much to Rachel’s disapproval.",
