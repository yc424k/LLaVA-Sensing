I amused myself by picking out shapes – a small llama, a boomerang, a set of geometric figures. We flew over Patagonia, khaki and spotted with ochre pools. It was very flat. Finally we circled the Magellan Strait, the same dull silver as the plane’s wing. The Strait and the cold waters around the tip of the continent evoked the names of great voyagers: Ferdinand Magellan in the Trinidad, Francis Drake in the Pelican, which he renamed the Golden Hind while he was down there, Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa in various ships, Pringle Stokes in the Beagle (Stokes shot himself on board), Robert FitzRoy, also in the Beagle (he committed suicide later) – and the list goes on. But it was the Mariner’s spectre-ship I saw when I looked out of the thick pebble window towards the Southern Ocean: ‘We were the first that ever burst/Into that silent sea’.",

He told me the lieutenant had gone in search of a free lift to Pietermaritzburg, where a relative might be able to find them jobs. Last night they came from Pretoria by train – had only enough money to get to Colenso – spent the day by the roadside trying to hitch a lift – had kept R10 for food but were mugged, hence that gash. Dad is a panel-beater, his daughter and son-in-law used to pick up odd jobs in fast-food outlets and supermarkets. ‘But now all those jobs go to blacks,’ said Dad – speaking without bitterness, simply stating a fact.",

When I was a gunner in the Asia Minor campaign in 1920, we captured a Turkish bimbashi in the hills outside Eskishehir. Our lance-bombardier came from a village near Serres in Macedonia. “It’s Galip bey!” he shouted. “Petro!” the Turk shouted back. They nearly embraced! The Turk was the son of the owner of a tchiflik—a farm—near Petro’s village!”’ (Macedonia was under the Turks till the First Balkan War in 1912.) ‘They’d known each other as boys. The Turk was very smart: astrakhan fez, khaki tunic, leggings, sword, pistol, binoculars—we soon had those off him—and a little lacquered moustache.’ Andreas’s forefingers planted two inverted commas in mid-air. ‘He and Petro sat up all night smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee as if they were back in Macedonia. The bimbashi’s job was interrogating prisoners. Sometimes they were marched in with their hands tied. He questioned them for hours. Dead silence! They were dumb! Then he saw what was wrong and told the guards to untie their hands and out streamed a flood of words! All lies, of course.’ Andreas laughed. ‘The first time he found this out the Greeks knocked over the guards and ran for it.’ The fingers of Andreas’s left hand rippled over the valley outside the nearside window. ‘They vanished like the dew! So you see! But it was a terrible war. Appalling things happened. Nobody fought with kid gloves on, believe me.’",

It’s been used as a film location 142 times—in A Town Like Alice, Mad Max 2, and about every Australian beer commercial ever made. It now gets by, evidently, on the visits of film crews and of occasional tourists like us.",

Adil made a beeline for the bar, which was propped up by a trio in tight T-shirts, working their way through a stock of Blue Label. The host, a hazel-eyed Hrithik Roshan lookalike, stood behind the bar, his pelvis jutting out in the direction of a light-haired girl wearing turquoise contact lenses.

Where the river’s slope steepened, I leaned forwards and steadied myself, using hands and fingertips to gain purchase on the ice, feeling the florets of this solid water. At the short steeper falls, I moved from rock to rock where it was possible, and where it was not, I went to the angled banks of the river, and found a way up there, before returning to the ice.",

    "target_paragraph": "My aunt rose. ‘The deal, I think, must have been concluded,’ she said. ‘Come, Henry.’ But I let her go without me. I walked away from the house towards the trees. The stars were so brilliant in the low sky that I must have been easily visible to anyone watching from the trees. A small warm breeze blew around me the scent of orange and jasmine. It was as though I had plunged my head into a box of cut flowers. As I entered the shade a light flashed on my face and went out again, but this time I was ready for it and I knew exactly where the man stood. I had kept a match ready and I struck it. I saw leaning against a lapacho a little old man with long moustaches; his mouth had fallen open with surprise and perplexity so that I could see the toothless gums before the match burnt down. ‘Buenas noches,’ I said, which was one of the few expressions I had picked up from my phrase-book, and he mumbled something in reply. I turned to go back and stumbled on the uneven ground and he flashed on his torch to aid me. I thought to myself that Mr Visconti could not as yet afford much in the way of a bodyguard. Perhaps with the second load from Panama he would be able to afford something better.",

Leaving the windmills behind, I walked towards the Maas, pausing at a small gift shop to buy a postcard for my mother. Nearby, a sign pointed out the modern replacement for the windmills: a pair of giant metal screws, each the size of a minibus, which could churn excess water up over the dikes and into the river. As I took a photo, a large yellow tour bus pulled up and deposited a flabby couple in the car park, unmistakably American in pristine running shoes and neatly pressed polo shirts, their baggy sleeves flapping in the wind like wings. The man raised a wrinkled hand and pointed at the windmills in the distance. ‘Honey, do you want to walk over and take a closer look?’ ‘I think we’ve pretty much seen it,’ his wife replied, already turning to get back on the bus.",

How would it unfold, I wonder: the creeping decline, or the sudden collapse? Would we one day find the shop shelves bare? (In the spring of 2020, we learned how fast that can happen.) How long until the phone lines go silent, until the taps run dry, until we lose the ability to access our hard drives and we display them on shelves built of planks in the Slab City library?",

At first, everyone remaining in camp thought something bad might have happened to them. Perhaps they were attacked by bears or had fallen through the ice. Whispers and speculation moved through the camp, worrying Auntie and the girls. But on May 8, Kuraluk showed up with one small seal. He said that there were three more seals with Hadley at the pressure ridges, thirty miles out on the ice. Everyone was deflated that their hunt had yielded so little, and then Kuraluk said he planned to take his family away from Icy Spit and out to the ridge, where the chances for more seals were better. Several of the men started shouting, claiming that Kuraluk and Hadley were keeping all the seals for themselves. Amidst the yelling and blaming, someone said that if Hadley and Kuraluk didn’t share the seals evenly among the rest, they’d shoot the scoundrels.",

In each glade stands a house or office or theatre of such appalling aspect, so vilely reminiscent of a German Kurhaus and the back parts of Pimlico, that it is impossible to imagine where Amanullah could have found the architects to design them, even as a joke. But no; they are not a joke. Untenanted, shoddy, and obscene, they defile the woods and streams and the view of the plain beneath, where narrow shady lanes go winding among the irregular fields. The climax of this pseudo-civilisation is a racecourse, no larger than a cricket-field, round whose hairpin corners elephants were forced to compete.",

The track was flanked by high thorn hedges, limiting our field of vision to the route ahead and giving us no clue as to the whereabouts of the hotel. Kirsty was groaning in discomfort, and as I glanced across towards her, my attention was drawn to a flash of colour in the hedgerow. I subconsciously moved my foot towards the brake, which most probably averted disaster, as a huge Kudu antelope suddenly appeared in mid-air in front of us, having vaulted the hedge. An adult Kudu can weigh over 250kg, and a direct hit would have wiped out both our VW Polo and the animal, so my instinctive jab on the brake was literally a life-saver. The shocked deer landed inches from our front bumper, and wild-eyed with fear, immediately took off again, leaping the hedge on the opposite side of the track to disappear into the bush.",

There must have been a sound of it almost everywhere; you would have moved from room to room, taking various kinds of spaces as rooms, through the flash of crystal and the pull of narcissism, among thousand-faced mobiles or clear shallows where perhaps fish from the Indian Ocean moved in stigmatic flickers of turquoise, silver and pomegranate. Versailles could never have been so bright or so profound. And it seems the imagination was as inexhaustible as the medium; it needed only more space, more time to produce still other poems in water.",

It was an Opposition boat and the presence of a white man on board seemed to the politicians to have deep significance. Before we reached Monrovia every delegate was convinced that England was behind them. There was to be a Convention in Monrovia of the Unit True Whig Party to elect a Presidential Candidate to oppose President Barclay and the True Whig Party. All is fair during a Liberian election and the Government agent at Cape Palmas had tried to arrest the owner of the boat and hold it up till the Convention was over. Some of the delegates were supporters of a Mr Cooper, some of ex-President King, so though they all belonged to the same party, they had plenty to argue about, and the arguments got fiercer after midday, after the tin basins of cassava roots had been handed round (for meals were included in the tariff) and the bottles of cane juice. The cane juice in the midday heat worked quickly; almost immediately half the hundred and fifty politicians were roaring drunk. They couldn’t do anything about it, because if they moved more than a foot the boat heeled over, and once there was a panic on board at a loud crash which reminded them of the rock they had hit the night before. Some tried to stand up and others shouted to them to be still as the boat heeled towards the glassy sea and the captain was heard shouting that he would put any man who moved in irons. I couldn’t move because the Methodist minister was asleep on my shoulder, and the panic soon subsided. We hadn’t hit a rock, somebody had passed out under the cane juice and his head had hit the deck.",

He knew that it was a diaper, freshly washed, even before she said: “I made a fire in the stove. I guess I overstepped.”",

About twenty minutes into the journey, our driver—a crusty man in his early forties—began waving down other taxis and stopping on the side of the road to talk to them. We soon accrued a considerable tab and appeared to be leaving the city limits. When we asked where we were going, however, he grunted something unintelligible and swerved into another lane. Ming and I exchanged anxious looks as the traffic started thinning and apartments blocks became spaced farther apart. Where was this crazy man taking us?",

Tourists and Alaskans alike wax eloquent on its “extensive charms,” its “lifetime of exploring possibilities.” True as they are, these accolades can ring as hollow as a chamber of commerce brochure. Longtime Sounders, those who have worked and explored the waters for years, speak of Prince William in intimate tones, tinged with possessive humility. They’ve seen the panoramic vistas on a day trip, and have also lived weeks out in damp fog under head nets to keep out mosquitoes, or been turned back from a destination by a wind that lasted days. They’ve admired the photo-shoot puffin colonies, and have also held crude-soaked birds in their gloved arms. They’ve hauled out fish-heavy nets and also mended them at night in oil-lamp cabins, puked in the cockpit while riding queasy swells, and fallen to sleep in narrow berths, cradle-rocked with cramped knees. Such an old-timer is a partner to the Sound, like half of a long-married couple who have shared the span of years, only to realize how much they still don’t know.",

    "target_paragraph": "the final day of sailing\nI check my phone and I see a message from Cristina in Miami. She and Frank have been following my progress, and Cristina has forwarded a message from Frank. He suggests I go inland through Ponce Inlet to avoid northwest winds. I switch on my VHF and listen to the weather forecast again; Ponce Inlet is still in view, and I think of hamburgers and hotel rooms, warm showers and soft beds, hot coffee.\nThe forecast is the same as it was earlier – west winds this afternoon and tonight with cold temperatures dropping into the thirties. Sobrius continues to slowly tack upwind, making slow northwest progress. More dolphin visit, and they make me smile.\nMid-day my patience for tacking wears out and I start the engine. There is no logic to this decision, as it may put me in St Augustine before dawn; we are only 60 nautical miles south of home. Yet I don’t want to be here anymore. Perhaps it is the beckoning of Ponce Inlet that I need to be free of, and we can lie hove-to off St Augustine Inlet and wait for dawn should we arrive before first light. I further justify the decision by noting that the sky has been cloudy for the past two days, and the batteries might need to be charged. But it might just be the perception of warmth that the running engine brings that I crave. I’ve been cold for at least 24 hours now. We motor north and Ponce Inlet disappears off the chartplotter, no longer beckoning.\nAn hour later I pull back on the throttle and put us in neutral. The wind vane on top of the mast is pointing west. Finally, the wind has shifted in our favor. I kill the engine and trim the sails for a beam reach, quickly accelerating to six knots as the sun drops toward the horizon.\nWe sail along in the calm waters three miles off the beach. I can hear the distant roar of racecars as we pass what must be Daytona Beach. I’m starting to feel like we are back in my neighborhood; the buildings along the coast start to look like home. After 2 ½ weeks and nearly 1000 nautical miles, it is somewhat disorienting to be here in the little sailboat that I bought on the other coast of Florida. I wonder how long it’s been since Sobrius last sailed in the Atlantic.\nThe sun sets in a quick explosion of color, fades to grey-blue, purple, then black. There are no ships around. The cold wind is blowing from the shore, and I feel it is safe to get some sleep. I’m glad to be below and out of the cold. I’m thankful that the sea is calm and the motion of Sobrius is that of a relaxed vessel gliding across the water like a horse that smells the barn. Tonight below deck is comfortable, not at all like last night.\nTwenty minutes later (I fixed the timer) I poke my head up and check the horizon. The air is bitter cold, like it must be in the thirties. I quickly scan for ships and see none, and draw my head back into Sobrius like a turtle. I lay down and quickly fall back asleep. I repeat this process two more times before seeing a ship behind us. I creep out of my shell and into the cold cockpit. A container ship is approaching from behind. The AIS sounds its alarm, and I steer east, out of the ship’s path miles before it passes us and I shut off the alarm from the cockpit, thankful of my work in moving the AIS to within reach.\nAnother ship is detected by the AIS, but I can’t see it. The instrument says it is “engaged in a diving operation.” Who could be diving tonight, I wonder. It should be directly to port, but still I can’t find it. Apparently the dive boat has no lights on. Maybe this is on purpose, serving some function that I don’t understand. Maybe it’s a beacon marking a dive location. But I must assume the signal could be coming from a ship hiding in the dark just ahead. Vigilantly I scan the horizon, both to port and in front of us. The icon of the invisible dive boat moves to aft on the screen of the AIS, and no other ships are visible. I venture back below, welcomed by the relatively warm interior of Sobrius. I lay down and cover my legs and feet with a blanket. Peace and serenity overcome me. We are getting close to home.\nI sleep and get up to check the horizon and the instruments every 20 minutes until I arise and recognize the 312 bridge, the Bridge of Lions, the Vilano Causeway, and the St. Augustine Lighthouse. I am now truly in home-waters. The beach at 11th St where I surf, where I walk with coffee in the morning, passes by. The state park is clearly distinguishable from its lack of lights. A shrimp boat lies still just outside St Augustine Inlet. I become fully awake.\nThe familiar setting is disorienting. It’s hard for me to believe that I’ve sailed this little boat all the way around from the other side of Florida. I bought Sobrius in St Petersburg, yet somehow we are now just off St Augustine. Two worlds collide. I’m really here.\nWe sail past the inlet, looking for the safe-water buoy, flashing white in a Morse-A pattern. It hides in the forest of lights from shore. We tack through the west wind, turn 180 degrees, and sail back to the south. I decide a bit of late-night sailing would be fun. It is a beautiful night, with stars and crisp, cold air. The lights of home shine on the horizon.\nI can’t believe I’m here.\nAfter tacking around in the cold and dark for a pleasant hour, I find the safe-water buoy – I can hear its lonely fog-horn, I can see clearly its slowly flashing dot-dash white light. We pass it to the south and I tack without releasing the jib-sheet. Sobrius points just off the wind and we come to a near stop. We are hove-to outside St Augustine Inlet, as planned. The journey is almost over.\nI go below and make a hot bowl of soup, but I have no need for a bowl and eat the soup straight from the pot. It warms my body and tastes like success. A powerful feeling of happiness is overcoming all my senses as I come to terms with the fact that I have nearly completed the journey and realized my dream of becoming a singlehand-sailor.",

There are very few vehicles on Easter Island, though there is said to be a bus that runs sometimes on Sundays in the summer. Occasionally a taxi churned past, but then it was gone again, and the place was emptiness and roaring winds once more. And so I continued to walk, down a long, straight, silent road—Polynesia set in Scotland, so it seemed—the silence stretching out on every side of me. There is only one town in Rapa Nui (in resource-poor Easter Island the word stands for the place itself, its language, and its people), and until recently none of the island’s three thousand residents was allowed to live outside its narrow limits. There is only one main road in Hanga Roa—the “Navel of the World,” as the town is called—and on this particular morning, the world had yet to arrive. A man with long brown hair flowing down his naked back rode past on a chestnut mare. A girl with a sweet-smelling flower in her hair sauntered past as if on her way to Gauguin. Very soon the town was behind me again and I was alone with black straggly rocks once more, a few stone faces and a tumble of old gravestones, white and black and clay-red, tilted against the sea.",

How could I be bullied at school therefore? How could they make things hot for me? There was the Doctor lurching into chapel, as if he trod a battleship in a gale of wind, shouting out his commands through a megaphone, since people in authority always become melodramatic—I did not hate him like Neville, or revere him like Louis. I took notes as we sat together in chapel. There were pillars, shadows, memorial brasses, boys scuffling and swopping stamps behind Prayer Books; the sound of a rusty pump; the Doctor booming, about immortality and quitting ourselves like men; and Percival scratching his thigh. I made notes for stories; drew portraits in the margin of my pocket-book and thus became still more separate. Here are one or two of the figures I saw.",

A little sugar clung to them, and a thin, adhesive silver tissue (also edible, said Abdul) which fluttered in the slight breeze. He handed me a spoon, and with his own attempted to beat off the flies which swarmed so obstinately upon the food that they appeared to prefer death to separation from it.
