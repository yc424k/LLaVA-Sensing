An elderly man in the next row scooted to the edge of his seat and, holding on to the seat in front of him with both hands, leaned into the aisle to look through the front window. A mother lifted up her toddler so he could wave from the window as we pulled away. At the front of the bus, the conductor rifled through a pile of cassettes and slid one into the tape-player. It was a Burmese version of the thigh-slapping country-and-western hit ‘Jambalaya’. The toddler giggled with delight. The old man tapped his fingers to the music, and I found myself humming along merrily. We were on our way.",

Finally, by the afternoon of the fourteenth, we motored through the pass of a barrier reef and up to the customs dock of Apia.",

Despite the rain, I examined the meager stock of local hotels with some care—I felt entitled to a spell of comfort and luxury after my night in a cheerless Llandudno guesthouse—and I chose an inn called the Royal Sportsman. My room was adequate and clean, if not exactly outstanding, and suited my purposes. I made a cup of coffee and, while the kettle boiled, changed into dry clothes, then sat on the edge of the bed with a coffee and a rich tea biscuit, and watched a Welsh-language soap opera called Pobol Y Cwm on television, which I enjoyed very much. I had no idea what was going on, of course, but I can say with some confidence that it had better acting, and certainly better production values, than any program ever made in, say, Sweden or Norway—or Australia, come to that. At least the walls didn’t wobble when someone shut a door. It was an odd experience watching people who existed in a recognizably British milieu—they drank tea and wore Marks & Spencer cardigans—but talked in Martian. Occasionally, I was interested to note, they dropped in English words—“hi ya,” “right then,” “OK”—presumably because a Welsh equivalent didn’t exist, and in one memorable encounter a character said something like “Wlch ylch aargh ybsy cwm dirty weekend, look you,” which I just loved. How sweetly endearing of the Welsh not to have their own term for an illicit bonk between Friday and Monday.",

    "target_paragraph": "Near my tents a sluggish stream flowed through clumps of yellow iris and formed a pool in the sand. It provided water for our animals and for the flocks of goats that Armenian shepherd boys herded morning and evening along the margin of the sea. The spot was so attractive and the weather so delightful that I spent an idle day there, the first really idle day since I had left Jerusalem, and as I could not hope to examine Seleucia exhaustively, I resolved to see no more of it than was visible from my tent door. This excellent decision gave me twenty-four hours, to which I look back with the keenest satisfaction, though there is nothing to be recorded of them except that I was not to escape so lightly from Armenian difficulties as I had hoped. I received in the morning a long visit from a woman who had walked down from Kabūseh, a village at the top of the gorge above the Garīz. She spoke English, a tongue she had acquired at the missionary schools of ’Aintāb, her home in the Kurdish mountains. Her name was Kymet. She had left ’Aintāb upon her marriage, a step she had never ceased to regret, for though her husband was a good man and an honest, he was so poor that she did not see how she was to bring up her two children. Besides, said she, the people round Kabūseh, Nosairis and Armenians alike, were all robbers, and she begged me to help her to escape to Cyprus. She told me a curious piece of family history, which showed how painful the position of the sect must be in the heart of a Mohammadan country, if it cannot be cited as an instance of official oppression. Her father had turned Muslim when she was a child, chiefly because he wished to take a second wife. Kymet’s mother had left him and supported her children as best she might, rather than submit to the indignity that he had thrust upon her, and the bitter quarrel had darkened, said Kymet, all her own youth. She sent her husband down next morning with a hen and a copy of verses written by herself in English. I paid for the hen, but the verses were beyond price. They ran thus:",

Suddenly, two hours seemed barely enough time to enjoy the cool, clean air. The gardens, we soon learned, offer seventeen feddans (about sixteen acres) of scenic forestry to tour; a Noah’s ark for tropical plants and curious travelers. The gardens are divided by four linear paths and crossed by a dozen or so shorter paths, so the entire island is a checkerboard of small plots, each carefully manicured, trimmed, and pruned. We passed several long benches that overlooked the river and pagodas draped with climbing vines. Teresa fell in love with some blue flowers, and I filled a dozen frames with shots of tall palms against the dark blue sky. Near the southern tip of the island, we found a café and a small park that overlooked a lagoon covered in water lilies. I stopped to read a sign that described the island (where I learned about the feddans) and its plants (drawn from equatorial regions around the world) while Teresa inspected a row of flowering bushes. I looked toward the dock to see if Gin Tonic were there waiting for us. Luckily, he wasn’t, so we took a second loop of the island.",

Now he sank down, cautiously, gingerly, and looked at the table and half read a line in a book. Gibbs stopped in the middle of his sentence.",

Less eminent Russians turned up after the Soviet Revolution, and others again retreated to Hong Kong after successive alarms in Shanghai, a racier international settlement which in general they much preferred. Throughout the 1930s there were always White Russians knocking about, earning their livings as ships’ guards, as prostitutes, as dance teachers, as photographers, as racehorse trainers (the last Russian trainer at Happy Valley retired in 1986). There were enough to form a Russian platoon of the Hong Kong Volunteers, and when Hong Kong fell to the Japanese in 1941 there were enough to form a thirty-member Cossack choir in their prisoner-of-war camp.",

Suddenly as he stood by the window, twenty-six years old, and looked out on the magical enchantments of that new April, he thought of his father, and of all the other people who had died, and there rose up in him a wordless pity, an aching loneliness, a memory of something lost and slain. And at such times his hope and joy would vanish, and there came to him a conviction of unutterable loss and ruin. The work he had begun with such exultant certitude now lay before him like a limb of a shattered sculpture on the table, and with a revulsion of infinite disgust he put it away out of his sight.",

Soon after 8 a.m. the sun suddenly felt pleasantly warm and I stopped to remove my jacket. Then a gusty gale-force crosswind sprang up, blowing fine stinging sand from the Kalahari; without goggles, cycling would have been impossible. Beyond the next ridge sheep were sprinkled across an expanse of flatness, nibbling at a sage-green plant that is highly nutritious for both sheep and goats – but not for cattle. Copses of spindly sweetpepper trees marked the entrances to two farms, ten miles apart; their clusters of tall windpumps were whizzing so fast the noisy blades formed a blur. This harsh metallic music, its rhythms obedient to air currents, is the Karoo’s signature tune.",

And how could I explain that, in the evenings, after my shower, I’d have to dry my body with that poo towel, and then put on the same outfit I’d been wearing every evening for twelve days—my one change of clothes that I also slept in—clothes that smelled of all the places we’d stayed in like an olfactory map of our travels: strangers’ homes and run-down hotels, ashram floors and incense from temples, mothballs and curries and soaps and drywall.",

They come to rest, then, on root-stalk of the vine that clambers up the other side of the barn wall. A straggly tendril pulses toward the passion-flower, through the weight of sunlight. The eyes of Helforth follow the twining insistence of the little tendril. It seems now they will be lost for ever in the purple star. But I know Helforth, and I wait for Helforth. His eyes drop again and rest on the spiral of the grape tendril. Then his eyes fall lower on a sheaf of vine-leaves and on one leaf. As his lids fall and as his mind discards the drug-purple of the lordly blossom, I know he knows that I am waiting. His lids droop to blacken out the heady visual memory of rose and purple, and then widen. His eyes rest on the cool young vine-leaves and I come.",

The path winds around the mountain to the bottom of the pine forest, where a shady hamlet overlooks the confluence of the Modir River with its tributary from the north. This is the way of foot travel in Nepal, steeply up and steeply down the labyrinthine valleys. The down is hardest on the legs and feet, which jam at the knees and into the toe of the boot. In Kathmandu, our youngest Sherpa, Gyaltsen, had taken my mountain boots to a cobbler to have them stretched; unstretched, the boots came back with neat round patches of bright leather sewn onto the outside surfaces at the indicated points. The patches were removed in Pokhara, but the cobbler there had no tool to stretch the boots, and so they are just as narrow and—due to perforations—less rainworthy than before.",

Everyone stared silently at me – except two army officers, sitting by the long street window where there was still enough light to play backgammon, with the collars of their greatcoats pulled up and the ear-flaps of their fur hats pulled down. Choosing an empty corner, opposite the door, I wondered if the Boss had a room with bedding to let. By now I had identified my sleeping-bag as my single greatest loss, on the practical level. With it, I could survive a night in a barn, a stable, an outhouse; without it, I might not survive a midwinter night in this unheated restaurant. But of the Boss there was as yet no sign.",

He was about the middle height, and neither thin nor fat: his figure was rather big-boned and angular, and yet it gave an impression of meagreness, spareness, and somewhat tallowy toughness which so many city people have, as if their ten thousand days and nights upon the rootless pavement had dried all juice and succulence out of them, as if asphalt and brick and steel had got into the conduits of their blood and spirit, leaving them with a quality that is tough, dry, meagre, tallowy, and somewhat calloused.",

His back still undulated with muscle beneath skin that was bleached bright white. Up there, his body had not putrefied, it had petrified – his flesh looked like nothing so much as stone. When pictures of Mallory’s corpse were released to the world’s media, many commentators likened it to a white marble statue. In death as in life, for Mallory had been a man of unusual physical beauty whose appearance provoked ecstatic comparisons with classical sculpture from the men and women who fluttered around him. ‘Mon Dieu! George Mallory!’ exclaimed Lytton Strachey famously after first seeing him in 1909. ‘My hand trembles, my heart palpitates, my whole being swoons away at the words … he’s six foot high, with the body of an athlete by Praxiteles, and a face – oh incredible.’ Strachey’s twittery comparison of Mallory with a Praxitelean sculpture in white marble would harden, ninety years later, into a macabre reality.",

On the Company News desk where I worked as a subeditor, or copy editor, the five-man team would wander in about 2:30 and spend most of the afternoon reading the evening papers and drinking tea while waiting for the reporters to surmount the daily challenge of finding their way back to their desks after a three-hour lunch involving several bottles of jolly decent Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Once ensconced at their desks, the reporters would compose their expenses, complete hunched and whispered phone calls to their brokers with regard to a little tip they’d picked up over the crème brûlée, and finally produce a page or so of copy before retiring parched to the Blue Lion pub across the road. At about half past five, we subeditors would make some little marks on a few pieces of paper for an hour or so, then slip our arms into our coats and go home. It seemed very agreeably unlike work. At the end of the first month, one of my colleagues showed me how to record imaginary expenditures on an expense account sheet and take it up to the third floor, where it could be exchanged at a little window for about £100 in cash—more money, literally, than I had ever held before. We got six weeks’ holiday, three weeks’ paternity leave upon the valid production of a child, and a month’s sabbatical every four years. What a wonderful world Fleet Street then was, and how thrilled I was to be part of it.",

A hum of shrill voices reverberated against the low ceiling, leaving Lily shut out in a little circle of silence. She felt a sudden pang of profound loneliness. She had lost the sense of time, and it seemed to her as though she had not spoken to anyone for days. Her eyes sought the faces about her, craving a responsive glance, some sign of an intuition of her trouble. But the sallow preoccupied women, with their bags and note-books and rolls of music, were all engrossed in their own affairs, and even those who sat by themselves were busy running over proof-sheets or devouring magazines beween their hurried gulps of tea. Lily alone was stranded in a great waste of disoccupation.",

We bade goodbye to the people in the office and to a few fellow-inmates with whom we were on hobnobbing terms, and I hoisted on my rucksack. Konrad’s fardel – a wicker creel slung diagonally across his torso on a long baldric of canvas and leather – turned him into a lanky urban fisherman. For the fourth time we set off for the Wallnerstrasse. It was a bright, blowy morning; and we had been right to be optimistic; the moment I entered the Consulate, the clerk held up from afar a registered envelope crossed with blue chalk, and some others. The good news, which would have spread delight four days before, was something of an anti-climax now. We headed for a coffee-house in the Kärntnerstrasse called Fenstergucker. Settling at a corner table by the window near a hanging grove of newspapers on wooden rods, we ordered Eier im Glass, then hot Brötchen and butter, and delicious coffee smothered in whipped cream. It was a morning of decisions, separations, departures; and they weighed on us both. Konrad was determined to set off at once and smite while the iron was hot, determination high and the capital still intact. He became gently excited and the Harfleur spirit was beating its wings in the air; but I felt anxious about him and hoped his associates had as gentlemanly a cast of mind as he thought. He, in his turn, was filled with concern about me. It was true that we had been ripping rather fast through the fairy gold; but he built up a headstrong Sir Harry Scattercash kind of picture that I rather liked. ‘Husband all lucre when you are in squandering vein, dear young,’ he said, and ‘Do not dog bona robas.’",

With their dumpy graceless bodies and an air of the Empire about their beautiful heads and shoulders, their faces not marred but somehow made more personal and approachable by the extraordinary frequency of wens on them, these Roman women move in the blazing noon of a terrible cold sensuality, that can kill because it is so truly gay. They are said to be the coldest women in Europe but they are probably also the most candid; they are no more nebulous than the sky above them, and seem incapable of the least affectation; and they lose not an atom of their tremendous inner conviction because their calculations have brought them to a prospect of doing the washing for the next fifty years under an image of the Madonna. Their power even takes on another depth of joyousness once that is settled. The drive of femininity, which is of the whole being and so just the opposite of nymphomania, never gives out; neither does the lung power; their voices carry like rockets across the square and in all the streets around, in a frenzy of anger you would suppose but it may be only to ask the time and in a moment will be as loud with laughter. With their children it is a torrent treatment that may go on for thirty years, or never stop, of huggings and slap-pings and spoiling and tyrannical ordering about. The American, reflecting on his own childhood, feels exposed as to a break in Boulder Dam.",

When searching for detailed maps I visited the government bookshop, which also sells Beerlao T-shirts and sundry other unappealing souvenirs, and my presence was ignored by the two young women assistants sitting in the middle of the floor playing cards. Dusty, sun-bleached Russian textbooks and Marxist tracts loaded the shelves; English primers printed in Thailand and of doubtful pedagogic value were piled on the counter. In a nearby stationery shop a monk and I were both potentially good customers, eager to buy pens in bulk, but there was no one to serve us. We waited and waited – and waited. Finally the monk climbed over the counter with enviable agility – he was advanced in years – and returned some minutes later with a beaming young woman who seemed astonished by this rush of customers.",

I’m so glad you’re open.”\n\n“For a few more minutes anyway.”\n\n“I won’t take long.”\n\nI turned in a circle, honing in on the essentials: coffee, ice cream, and fresh popped caramel kettle corn. I grabbed a large Styrofoam coffee cup and filled it to the brim. At the scoop counter I carefully studied the bins of ice cream.\n\n“Hard to choose, huh?” said the woman, setting down her broom and slipping on gloves.",
