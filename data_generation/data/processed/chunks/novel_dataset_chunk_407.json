    "target_paragraph": "One afternoon she crossed the river for a walk in Battersea Park. It was a warm spring, and down the long avenue the trees were tipped with the flame of bursting buds, like so many green lights turned low. The beds and borders were gay with crocuses and hyacinths, and the open spaces were beginning to look green again. Audrey cared little for these things, but to-day she was somehow aware of them; she felt in her the new life of the spring, as she had felt it a year ago. She walked rapidly from sheer excitement, till she had tired herself out; then she sat down on one of the benches, overlooking the waste ground where the children played. Except for a bright fringe under the iron railings, it was still untouched by spring, and the sallow grass had long been trodden into the dust. Some ragged little cricketers were shouting not far off, and near her, by the railings, was a family group—a young father and mother, with their children, from two years old and upwards, crawling around them. They were enjoying a picnic tea in the sunshine, with the voluptuous carelessness of outward show that marks the children of the people. Audrey looked at it all with a faint disgust, but she was too tired to move on to a more cheerful spot. She turned her back on the picnic party, and began to think about Wyndham. He had been away ten days; he said he was going for a fortnight; in another week at the longest she would see him. She was roused by a tug at her petticoats. The two-year-old, attracted like some wild animal by her stillness, had scrambled through the railings, and was trying to pull its fat little body up by one hand on to the bench beside her. Its other hand grasped firmly a sheaf of fresh grass. It was clean and pretty, and something in its baby face sent a pang to Audrey's heart. She loosened its chubby fingers, hoping it would toddle away; but it gave a wilful chuckle, and stood still, staring at her, reproaching, accusing, in the unconscious cruelty of its innocence. And yet surely the Divine Charity had chosen the tenderest and most delicate means of stirring into life her unborn conscience. Moved by who knows what better impulse, she stooped suddenly down and touched its face with the tips of her gloved fingers. Startled at the strange caress, like some animal stroked too lightly, the little thing made its face swell, and asserted its humanity by a howl. Then it fled from her with a passionate waddle, scattering blades of grass behind it as it went.",

You, all of you, ignore it. What the dead poet said, you have forgotten. And I cannot translate it to you so that its binding power ropes you in, and makes it clear to you that you are aimless; and the rhythm is cheap and worthless; and so remove that degradation which, if you are unaware of your aimlessness, pervades you, making you senile, even while you are young. To translate that poem so that it is easily read is to be my endeavour. I, the companion of Plato, of Virgil, will knock at the grained oak door. I oppose to what is passing this ramrod of beaten steel. I will not submit to this aimless passing of billycock hats and Homburg hats and all the plumed and variegated head-dresses of women. (Susan, whom I respect, would wear a plain straw hat on a summer’s day.) And the grinding and the steam that runs in unequal drops down the window-pane; and the stopping and the starting with a jerk of motor-omnibuses; and the hesitations at counters; and the words that trail drearily without human meaning; I will reduce you to order.",

My throat was sandpaper from the wind as I hurried toward the water that flowed into the ravine. I fell on my knees as I reached the creek, eager to splash my face. In the twilight I was able to see that while, yes, it had water?the merest trickle?it was thick with red algae. I sat back on my heels, devastated. I could comb the water more effectively than scoop it into my bottle. I knew that I was almost out, having carried little from Cottonwood Creek in hopes of filling up here. I was disgusted with myself for allowing my balking at water weight to imperil me. I’d been spoiled by front-country water access for a few days and let my guard down. I needed to remember that there were no faucets up ahead.",

The flashes now came frequently, lighting up faces as if they were going to be photographed, surprising them in tense and unnatural expressions. The clap followed close and violently upon them. Several women half rose from their chairs and then sat down again, but dinner was continued uneasily with eyes upon the garden. The bushes outside were ruffled and whitened, and the wind pressed upon them so that they seemed to stoop to the ground. The waiters had to press dishes upon the diners’ notice; and the diners had to draw the attention of waiters, for they were all absorbed in looking at the storm. As the thunder showed no signs of withdrawing, but seemed massed right overhead, while the lightning aimed straight at the garden every time, an uneasy gloom replaced the first excitement.",

Leaving without a co-driver on a team run really throws a wrench in the works. If that happens, a driver has to turn around at whatever point he or she either realizes the mistake or gets a call from Wayne. Drivers don’t always exchange cellphone numbers so Wayne occasionally fielded calls from drivers who had been left behind during a break at a truck stop or a rest area, one presumes mistakenly. Though one driver admitted, he left a co-driver he disliked just to peeve him. Of course, he still had to go back and get the guy. Such mistakes or pranks could make a team absurdly late. On this particular run, since the turnaround was less than 24 hours, that mistake should only last one day. On a run with no time to spare, one that turned around immediately, such a boneheaded move could create a domino effect for the rest of the week.",

Sunrise was not far off, the lights had been turned out in the garden, and the flowers seemed to breathe their scent more deeply in the small chill of the dawn. I felt oddly elated to be alive, and I knew in a moment of decision that I would never see Major Charge again, nor the dahlias, the empty urn, the packet of Omo on the doorstep or a letter from Miss Keene. I walked down towards the little wood of fruit trees nursing my decision close to my heart—I think even then I knew there would be a price to pay for it. The dancers who remained must all be in the sala now, for the lawn was empty, and there were no cars left outside the gates so far as I could see, though I heard the sound of one receding down the road towards the city. Again lines from Maud came to mind in the early sweet-scented morning: “Low on the sand and loud on the stone the last wheel echoes away.” It was as though I were safely back in the Victorian world where I had been taught by my father’s books to feel more at home than in our modern day. The wood sloped down towards the road and up again to the back gate, and as I entered the little hollow I trod on something hard. I stooped down and picked the object up. It was Wordsworth’s knife. The tool for taking stones out of horse’s hoofs was open—perhaps he had meant to open the blade and in his hurry he had made an error. I struck a match and before the flame went out I saw the body on the ground and the black face starred with white orange petals, which had been blown from the trees in the small breeze of early morning.",

This is the first place I have seen with prices: £420 per stag and £900 fishing, per two rod beat, rotating daily. For stag hunting you get an Argocat, stalker and gillie. I am thinking, if the price is per stag, you are likely to get one because of the economics of sending that gear and those people with you. For fishing, this pricing sounds like Sanskrit and a daunting price. I have concluded, probably incorrectly, that two of you get to go fishing for a week. It is fly fishing only and primarily catch and release. Lodging not included for either activity. I am agog. I can think of a lot of things to spend £900 on. None of them involve a fish I have to give back. (However, they will allow me to shoot and fish while the Reay Estate will not.) I understand the allure of the place in just the short time I ride through it. It is wild. It is ancient. It is brilliant.",

They could also still see Wrangel Island hovering on the horizon to the southwest. In this way, sometimes stopping to rest and survey the route ahead, they made it all the way to Camp 4 early on the second day out. The camps were between five and ten miles apart, and it was always uplifting to see an igloo and signs that others had been there. At Camp 4, they discovered the leg of a recently killed polar bear—a very welcome addition to their larder of pemmican and biscuit—and a note from chief engineer Munro, saying that his group had been delayed by the storm and that the trail beyond was rough going. Bartlett was heartened to have news of the advance party.",

The handles were off all the doors and there ensued a brief knockabout scene from a Turkish shadow-play among the three of us which finally resulted in our breaking into the vehicle at a weak point in its defences. (Jamal had to crawl through the boot, and half-way through the back seat, in order to unlatch for us.) Then we were off through a landscape blurred with rain and the total absence of wind­screen wipers. Jamal drove with his head out of the window for the sake of safety. Outside, the rain-blackened span of mountains glittered fitfully in the lightning-flashes.",

The guide, choosing to misunderstand me (or perhaps understanding me too well), said: “You, old? I'm forty-four. If all old women were like you, life would be heaven for men.” (With your looks, life must be a Muslim heaven on earth for you, I thought; but of course I refrained from saying so.) The good man, with an air of cleverness to which he was clearly entitled, popped me into a creaky old elevator (“built by Mussolini”) hidden by a tapestry, with instructions to the other tourists to stay put. As he repeated this performance on each of three stories of the palazzo, he was obliged to run down the stairs three times to collect the waiting tourists and then to march up the stairs three times with the tourists in tow. I would have sworn this was a disinterested act of kindness, except that somewhere between the third and fourth stories his wedding band disappeared from his ring finger.",

She could not leave his presence when he was there, nor remove her eyes from his face, which was something like Napoleon’s, with a lock of black hair falling across the forehead. But the cavalry officer melted imperceptibly out of her existence.",

I couldn’t find my balaclava, which is an essential item to avoid frostbite when riding on the snowmobiles to reach the herd. Before I ran out, she quickly pulled off her own embroidered scarf and tied it tightly across my face to make sure the skin was protected, whispering words of motherly concern in the Nenets language.",

He had persuaded me that before the waves had time to calm down and clean up, northwest winds—which, according to his weather radio, were already blowing twenty-five knots in the Farallon Islands, twenty miles offshore—would be here. Those winds, when they arrived, would wreck the waves completely, so this might be our only chance to surf this swell. Yes, we were the only surfers in sight, but that was because the others were expecting it to get better later, on the outgoing tide. They didn’t know about the northwesterlies.",

As the opening of the tent was on the crater side, we could not get in or out without going down into this crevasse. The tent walls were held down with stones to make it as snug as possible, but snug is a word of the lower earth, and has no meaning on that frozen mountain top. The natural floor was of rough slabs of lava, laid partly edgewise, so that a newly macadamised road would have been as soft a bed. The natives spread the horse blankets over it, and I arranged the camping blankets, made my own part of the tent as comfortable as possible by putting my inverted saddle down for a pillow, put on my last reserve of warm clothing, took the food out of the saddle bags, and then felt how impossible it was to exert myself in the rarefied air, or even to upbraid Mr. Green for having forgotten the tea, of which I had reminded him as often as was consistent with politeness!",

In photographs taken at the beginning of the century, five superb churches can be seen. After the massacres the area was closed off to visitors, and was not reopened until the 1960s. When scholars returned, only one church, the eleventh-century rotunda of St Sergius, was still standing; the other four were no more than one or two courses high. Two had been completely levelled and the stones removed. The peasants told of border guards arriving with high explosives. More reliable witness to what had happened was contained in the remaining building: the cupola was untouched, but the side walls had been blown outwards in four places where small charges appeared to have been laid.",

I’ve been trying to turn my back to the soil for ten years!\nANOTHER CHILD : The farmers may be the backbone of the country, but who wants to be a backbone?\nANOTHER CHILD : I care not who hoes the lettuce of my country if I can eat the salad!\nALL : Life! Psychic Research! Jazz!\nMR. ICKY : (Struggling with himself) I must be quaint. That’s all there is. It’s not life that counts, it’s the quaintness you bring to it...\nALL : We’re going to slide down the Riviera. We’ve got tickets for Piccadilly Circus. Life! Jazz!\nMR. ICKY : Wait. Let me read to you from the Bible. Let me open it at random. One always finds something that bears on the situation.\n(He finds a Bible lying in one of the dods and opening it at random begins to read.)\n“Ahab and Istemo and Anim, Goson and Olon and Gilo, eleven cities and their villages. Arab, and Ruma, and Esaau—”\nCHARLES : (Cruelly) Buy ten more rings and try again.\nMR. ICKY : (Trying again) “How beautiful art thou my love, how beautiful art thou! Thy eyes are dove’s eyes, besides what is hid within. Thy hair is as flocks of goats which come up from Mount Galaad—Hm! Rather a coarse passage...”\n(His children laugh at him rudely, shouting “Jazz!” and “All life is primarily suggestive!”)\nMR. ICKY : (Despondently) It won’t work to-day. (Hopefully) Maybe it’s damp. (He feels it) Yes, it’s damp... There was water in the dod... It won’t work.\nALL : It’s damp! It won’t work! Jazz!\nOne of the Children: Come, we must catch the six-thirty.\n(Any other cue may be inserted here.)\nMR. ICKY : Good-by...\n(They all go out. Mr. Icky is left alone. He sighs and walking over to the cottage steps, lies down, and closes his eyes.)\nTwilight has come down and the stage is flooded with such light as never was on land or sea. There is no sound except a sheep-herder’s wife in the distance playing an aria from Beethoven’s Tenth Symphony, on a mouth-organ. The great white and gray moths swoop down and light on the old man until he is completely covered by them. But he does not stir.\nThe curtain goes up and down several times to denote the lapse of several minutes. A good comedy effect can be obtained by having Mr. Icky cling to the curtain and go up and down with it. Fireflies or fairies on wires can also be introduced at this point.\nThen Peter appears, a look of almost imbecile sweetness on his face. In his hand he clutches something and from time to time glances at it in a transport of ecstasy. After a struggle with himself he lays it on the old man’s body and then quietly withdraws.\nThe moths chatter among themselves and then scurry away in sudden fright. And as night deepens there still sparkles there, small, white and round, breathing a subtle perfume to the West Issacshire breeze, Peter’s gift of love—a moth-ball.\n(The play can end at this point or can go on indefinitely.)",

While she bustled off to the kitchen in that charming flutter with which all English ladies of a certain age receive sudden guests, I warmed my toes by the fire and reflected (for such was my state of mind these days) that this was the first English house I had ever been in, other than as a paying guest. My wife had brought me here as her young swain one Sunday afternoon many years before and we had sat, she and I and her family, tightly squeezed into this snug and well-heated lounge watching Bullseye and The Generation Game and other televisual offerings that seemed to me interestingly lacking in advanced entertainment value. This was a new experience for me. I hadn’t seen my own family in what might be called a social setting since about 1958, apart from a few awkward hours at Christmases, so there was a certain cozy novelty in finding myself in the midst of so much familial warmth. It is something that I still very much admire in the British, though I confess a certain passing exultation when I learned that they were taking Bullseye off the air.",

    "target_paragraph": "As he became famous, Babe Ruth discovered that celebrity had a distinct downside, notably that he couldn’t go into many public places without being bothered, occasionally dangerously so. In 1921 he was drinking in a speakeasy in New Jersey when a drunken customer started to harass him. They exchanged words and stepped outside. Harry Hooper, a fellow ballplayer who was drinking with Ruth that night, emerged from the men’s room to find Ruth gone. Looking outside, he discovered Ruth standing stiffly with a gun held to his head. Luckily Hooper’s timely arrival frightened Ruth’s harasser, who fled into the night. After that, Ruth limited his drinking to the safety of his residence.",

Peat plots on the right are definitely being worked, some with very artistic peat mounds. Many places use wooden pallets as part of their peat harvesting operation, to keep the peat off the sodden bog when it is drying. I get close to the top of the rise, with energy fading. To the left is a gravel pit, waist high. I climb into it and sit down. No wind. Lots of sun. Really, really nice. I pull out my thermos, make tea, and chow down on the Bay Café cake, giving me enough sugar and enthusiasm to ride into Leverburgh without stopping.",
