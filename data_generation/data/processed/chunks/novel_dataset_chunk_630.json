While I am making up my own fairy tale (perhaps this was once a hunting lodge for Frederick II, a falcon's lair?), in walks, shattering all reflection, a dazzling man . . . the twentieth century. He is Ilio, cousin to me (but this word has lost all meaning). His eyes are sapphire under dark gothic eyebrows, his hair is black and curly, and his brigand's mustache frames a tender mouth; his hard, supple body, to which Laura, Lizzie, Anna, and I all viscerally respond, is covered with a fuzz of fine, black, curly hair; he is wearing a red T-shirt and jeans cut off strategically; he is perfectly elegant; his elegance (having nothing to do with costume) is worn lightly.",

It’s not all loving-kindness here; I see a monk beat a dog, another one smokes and while Buddhist texts forbid meat, the fleshy bodies of sheep hang in roadside butcher boxes attracting swarms of flies and shoppers galore. I’ve kept up my Kumbh Mela vow not to eat meat—it just feels wrong to me now. I know the Dalai Lama has tried to turn vegetarian but so long as he and other Tibetan Buddhists continue to eat meat, the tinge of hypocrisy will remain. The meat-eating Buddhists do not kill, but it seems unfair that they get Muslims to kill animals for them. While Muslims don’t think the killing is sinful, surely the Buddhists must worry about the Muslims bringing bad karma upon themselves for the sake of Tibetan tummies? What’s more disturbing, though, is the violence toward people. A local tells me one of his female staff was being bashed by her husband, but when he reported it to the Tibetan welfare office, they told him it was dangerous to hurt her husband’s pride.",

He picked out four new titanium bits of different sizes, stuffed them in his pocket, and fired up Big Dink’s outboard for the run back to the town dock. He made it back to Sandra’s, covered in sweat and knelt beside Julio and opened his hand to reveal the four titanium drill bits. Julio just stared at them, and then with tears in his eyes, he said, “Mochas gracias mi amigo.”",

All around were signs of recent landslips and soon our track ended abruptly, obliterated by countless tons of fallen mountain. We could see its continuation above us and to reach this we followed a goat-trail, sending cascades of loose pebbles and soil flowing from our footsteps. The gradient was so severe that Rachel had to be helped and we were both feeling ‘panted’ when we regained the track near the top of the ridge. But our rewards were many. First, a trail of fresh snow-leopard pug-marks in the fine dust; second, a majestic eagle with a wing-span of at least four feet sailing below us over the stream; and third a superb view of many previously unseen snow-peaks on the far (southern) side of the Gorge.",

High peaks were all about, quite close, with sun-broken clouds straying among them.

The wall tells a story that doesn’t have to be spoken—a story about a transgender daughter asking for an old picture to be taken down, her taking a replacement herself, then hanging it with permission in the family home. It is the second indication—after the bumper stickers—of how strongly Kathy and Bob support Kaylee. Pictures can be sticking points for some parents of transgender children; Billy remembers repeatedly asking his mother to take his high school senior picture off the wall until it stayed down.",

Moorcroft died of fever caught in these marshes. There is a proverb which says a visit to Kunduz is tantamount to suicide. Here we are, therefore, lying in a mulberry grove beside a stagnant pool, both irresistible attractions to the fatal mosquito. Other pests abound. I pitched my bed near a wall. A wasps’ nest was at once discovered in it, and anyhow, people warned me, it was full of scorpions. When I suggested removing to a neighbouring garden, they said that was full of snakes. We are lucky to have ordered those mosquito-nets in the bazaar at Mazar. I have draped mine over the camera tripod; Christopher had half a mulberry tree demolished to make him a framework. Frogs are blowing musical bubbles in the pool. On the south-east, a vast new range of snowy peaks has caught the first light of the moon. Our two guards are loading their rifles before going to sleep, and a cat assaults the morning’s milk. For dinner we ate scrambled eggs and onions. Christopher thought of the onions, and had them ready cooked and chopped in the hotel so that they had only to be heated. A brilliant invention.",

The degrees of freedom measure the number of axes in which a body is free to move. In a sense, the more dimensions used to describe a type of travel, the more degrees of freedom there are for the traveler, i.e., he is more free to explore. The analogy may even go further: The more dimensions a type of travel has, the more dimensions of the foreign culture the traveler will come to experience.",

Her air was less of expectancy than of contemplation: she seemed not so much to be watching for any one, or listening for an approaching sound, as letting the whole aspect of the place sink into her while she held herself open to its influence. Yet it was no less apparent that the scene was not new to her.

He recoiled from the thought, but it did look as if he would have to go out into the night and fetch in Ollier. There was a nice prospect for a clergyman—having, in the small hours of the night, to fetch in another clergyman from the most highly undesirable lovemaking. True that if it hadn’t been for this wish of Ollier’s to propose to Miss Dodge, he himself wouldn’t have got Alice. But of what use was Alice to him at one o’clock in the morning? The warmth of a man’s appreciation and admiration naturally cools at such an hour. No man can continue relieved and pleased throughout a whole night. Things pall. Alice palled. After one o’clock, everything palled.",

Even my classes felt racially constructed. For academic subjects, at least, students were assigned, on the basis of test scores, to a group that moved together from teacher to teacher. I was put in a high-end group, where nearly all my classmates were Japanese girls. There were no Hawaiians, no Samoans, no Filipinos, and the classes themselves, which were prim and undemanding, bored me in a way that school never had before. Matters weren’t helped by the fact that, to my classmates, I seemed not to exist socially. And so I passed the class hours slouched in back rows, keeping an eye on the trees outside for signs of wind direction and strength, drawing page after page of surfboards and waves.",

Other bodies lay piled in a mass grave, probably the aftermath of a sudden outbreak of disease. Soon after De Soto’s passage, all signs of habitation at the settlement abruptly ceased.",

The ancient canyon art of Utah belongs in that same international museum without walls which makes African sculpture, Melanesian masks, and the junkyards of New Jersey equally interesting – those voices of silence which speak to us in the first world language. As for the technical competence of the artists, its measure is apparent in the fact that these pictographs and petroglyphs though exposed to the attack of wind, sand, rain, heat, cold and sunlight for centuries still survive vivid and clear. How much of the painting and sculpture being done in America today will last – in the merely physical sense – for even a half-century?",

(Though 'dial-up' internet access could be a frustrating affair when trying to book airline seats in those early days.) Also, even the smallest hotels, in the most remote corners of the world, were able to set up an email account to communicate with potential guests. Some even set up their own simple websites.",

I broke away on my own and with a dwindling entourage walked the side streets of the village, which was in better shape all in all than its Soviet-era leftovers had led me to think. Most of the houses were of stucco and lath construction, trim and cozy looking, with salmon hanging all along the eaves to dry, wooden ladders leading to outside attic doors, and neat yards. Some had front walks made of the old rubber drive treads of snow machines. Chairs in front of many houses faced the village’s sea view, a sweep of mountains and ocean widening eastward to a full Bering Strait horizon. I saw a row of chairs made of three linked folding seats, like in a theater, next to three stools made of whale vertebrae.",

We enjoyed a picnic lunch on a deserted, coral covered beach at Rocky Point (about 23 miles north) where the barrier reef touches the land. The day was ours.",

When I arrived in KSA in 1995, you had the choice of buying a (very plain) abaya in a local souk. Dozens of stores in the mall also offered them. Abayas were large shapeless bags made of polyester and, of course, completely black. The fastenings ranged from just a button at the neck to five or six hooks or studs from the neck to below the waist, one at chest level and usually one around the knees–heaven forbid they would blow open and expose a pair of pants, or a muumuu like many of the local women wore or, my goodness, a bare leg. (In the city of Khobar there was a poster often found in expat bathrooms of a Saudi woman striding out with a very long, sexy leg exposed, wearing a garter. These posters are still frequently to be found in returnees’ homes.)",

The “parade” is one pipe band consisting of eight pipers and six drummers. They are mustered in a small parking lot. During the warm-ups, one of their members runs from pipe player to pipe player with an electronic device, tuning their pipes. Who would have thought that anything that discordant is tuneable? A tiny crowd gathers to hear them. At 5:00pm on the dot, they head for the main street of Oban, one block away. I love the music and the drummers are a great fascination. Half of what they do is hit their drum. The other half is fancy things with their pompom drumsticks, like swinging them over their heads and whipping them 360 degrees around their wrists before striking the next beat. It’s amazing they don’t bean themselves or anyone else. The “parade” consists of the one pipe band and the small crowd that has gathered at the start. Except as we get moving, more and more people fall in behind while we walk the main street along the shore of Oban Harbor. And it grows, and it grows. And it IS a parade. A parade of people who are just caught up in it all and who love the sound of Scotland.",

Whenever I stand at the racks of sables admiring them, I have a sense of being elsewhere—in a Siberian winter, in the past, generally out of the modern mainstream.

Although Gant often cried out bitterly against his business and declared, when he was not attacking property, that he had never made even a bare living from his tombstones, he was rarely short of ready money: he usually had one or two small commissions from country people, and he always carried a well-filled purse, containing $150 or $200 in five- and ten-dollar bills, which he allowed Eugene to count out frequently, enjoying his son’s delight, and the feel of abundance.",

He would buy books he could not afford, books he could not read, and carry them with him everywhere he went, together with a dictionary, and so decipher them. That swarming multitude of Gothic print, that staggering superflux of German culture, maddened him with an intolerable and impossible hunger for possession. He informed himself upon the number of books that came out yearly from the German presses. It was horrible, it was appalling. There were over 30,000. He hated them for the same gluttony that was devouring him. He wondered how they could endure it, how they could ever draw their breath again in peace, in clearness, in repose, under the nightmare superfetation of that flood of print.",

When we arrived, we stepped from the vehicle into a dry, oven-like heat, which was all the more startling after the comparative coolness of Nairobi. In 1919, a geologist named J.W. Gregory was poking around in the area when he came across an expanse of ancient and distinctive teardrop-shaped hand axes of a type known as Acheulean. In the 1940s, Louis Leakey and his wife, Mary, got around to excavating the site. What they found was that Olorgesailie was a kind of factory where these tools were made in incalculable numbers over about a million years, from 1.2 million to 200,000 years ago. But here’s the thing. The stones from which the axes were made aren’t found on the Rift Valley floor. They had to be brought there from two nearby mountains named Ol Esakut and Mount Olorgesailie, each about ten kilometers away. Why the early people went to such trouble and what exactly they used the tools for have long been a mystery. Acheulean axes were beautiful pieces of technology for the time, and each represented a lot of effort to create, but they weren’t outstandingly good for cutting or chopping or scraping—certainly not a great deal better than almost any random unshaped rock would be.",

    "target_paragraph": "The last time I had seen Broadway, on an August afternoon some years before, it had been a nightmare of sclerotic traffic and flocks of shuffling daytrippers, but now, out of season, it seemed quiet and forgotten, its High Street nearly empty. It’s an almost absurdly pretty place with its steeply pitched roofs, mullioned windows, prolific gables, and trim little gardens. There is something about that golden Cotswold stone—the way it absorbs sunlight and then feeds it back so that even on the dullest days villages like Broadway seem to be basking in a perennial soft glow. This day, in fact, was sunny and gorgeous, with just a tang of autumn crispness in the air, which gave the world a marvelous clean, fresh-laundered feel. Halfway along the High Street I found a signpost for the Cotswold Way, a long-distance footpath, and plunged off down a track between old buildings. I followed a narrow trail across a sunny meadow and up the long slope toward Broadway Tower, an outsized folly high above the village. The view from the top over the broad Vale of Evesham, was, as always from such points, sensational—gently undulating trapezoids of farmland rolling off to a haze of distant wooded hills. Britain still has more landscape that looks like an illustration from a children’s storybook than any other country I know—a remarkable achievement in such a densely crowded and industrially minded little island. And yet I couldn’t help feel that the view may have been more bucolic and rewarding ten or perhaps twenty years ago.",

Lines details examples of the most appalling cruelty by settlers toward the natives—of Aborigines butchered for dog food; of an Aboriginal woman forced to watch her husband killed, then made to wear his decapitated head around her neck; of another chased up a tree and tormented from below with rifle shots. “Every time a bullet hit,” Lines reports, “she pulled leaves off the tree and thrust them into her wounds, till at last she fell lifeless to the ground.” What is perhaps most shocking is how casually so much of this was done, and at all levels of society. In an 1839 history of Tasmania, written by a visitor named Melville, the author relates how he went out one day with “a respectable young gentleman” to hunt kangaroos. As they rounded a bend, the young gentleman spied a form crouched in hiding behind a fallen tree. Stepping over to investigate and “finding it only to be a native,” the appalled Melville wrote, the gentleman lifted the muzzle to the native’s breast “and shot him dead on the spot.”",

What little cooking could be done—mostly boiled pemmican—he’d done by himself, though Templeman was technically the cook. When the winds finally died down, Mamen struggled out of the tent, digging through three-foot-deep snowdrifts, and walked down to the sandspit, hoping the exercise might do him good. But his limbs were so heavy, puffy, and sore that he had to stop many times on his way back to rest. While he rested, he combed the spit, finding the bones of birds bleached white from time and weather. He wondered how long they’d been there, and whether his bones would join them one day soon. Then he saw something sparkling among the bones and stooped to pick it up. “I found a stone containing gold,” he wrote in his diary. “I will examine it closer tomorrow.”",
