He entered with his usual dragging step, stooping and somewhat heavier, but with the same light smouldering under the thick lids behind his eyeglasses.",

I got in on the left, Eric loaded some stuff in the back, and we took off. Again I saw the globe-spanning view of the two continents and the strait in between. Then we turned toward Alaska; it grew gradually larger straight ahead. Soon we could make out the village of Wales, and the hill beyond it, and then some little specks at the hill’s base—Wales’s reindeer herd, Eric said.",

Among the offerings was a sepia-toned photograph of Stalin tickling a little girl. Her fair hair was combed into plump braids; a badge of Lenin twinkled from her jumper. As I examined the disconcerting image, Igor passed by. “Ah, Tovarish Stalin,” he murmured as he peeked over my shoulder. With some effort, he lowered his body into a squatting position, bowed his head, and laid a carnation on Stalin’s grave.",

And time was passing; Stephen would be due soon to come back; her mother would want to say good-bye to him, and couldn’t have gone for a walk on this morning of departure. She would particularly want to say good-bye, quite apart from the fact that she would be gone before his return on Monday, because she wasn’t letting him stay in Hertford Street over the week-end. Stephen did so hate hotels. It seemed hard when no one was in the flat that he couldn’t use it. Her mother had made excuses–said something or other about Mrs. Mitcham having a holiday, but Virginia didn’t think she had felt quite comfortable about it. She would therefore certainly wish to make him some parting little speech of more than ordinary gratitude for his hospitality, seeing how from him she was withholding hers. And here was Stephen, coming across the grass, and in a few minutes he would have started, and her mother still nowhere to be seen.",

He was a part, a drop, an indecipherable fraction of these grey tides of swarming tissue that passed in ceaseless weft and counter-weft upon the beaten pavements, at once a typical man-swarm atom and a living man. Indistinguishable in his speech, gait, dress, and tallowy pigmentation from the typical cell-and-pavement article, at the same time, although ugly, meagre, toughened, gnarled and half-articulate, angular as brick and spare as steel webbing, with little juice and succulence, he was honest, loyal, somehow good and memorable, grained with the life and movement of a thousand streets, seasoned and alert, a living character, a city man. In that horrible desperation of drowning and atomic desolation among the numberless hordes that swept along the rootless pavements in Eugene’s madness to know, own, intrude behind the million barriers of bricks, to root and entrench himself in the hive, he seized upon that dreary, grey and hopeless-looking Jew.",

Surrounded by tall grass, the boma is a three-sided structure of sticks and reeds standing at the edge of Marula-Puku camp. Inside is a wash table also made of sticks, a jerry can of cold water, and a basin in which we mix hot and cold water for our baths every evening.\nA rustling noise sounds from the grass. Mark pauses briefly, but walks on. Earlier a male waterbuck had been grazing near the sausage tree just beyond the boma; he is probably still in the tall grass. Mark mixes his bathwater, then switches off the flashlight to save the batteries. Standing naked under the bright stars, he begins to wash his hair, closing his eyes against the soapsuds. He freezes as he hears the rustling again from six feet behind him, just outside the boma. He quickly splashes water onto his face to rinse away the soap, then switches on his flashlight, hoping to get a closer look at the waterbuck. A wall of tall grass is all that he sees, but he can still hear the swishing sounds. He steps to the grass, parts it, and shines the light into the thick cover at his feet.\nA lioness, crouched flat against the ground, glares back at him, her tail lashing. She is only four feet away, looking straight into his eyes.\n“Aaarrgghh!” Involuntarily, Mark utters a primal growl and jumps back. At the same instant the lioness springs to her feet, hissing and spitting at him, her canines gleaming white in the light. Mark leaps into the boma. The lioness whirls around and charges away through the grass to join five other lions ten yards behind her. Together the pride trots to the firebreak a little farther on, where they all sit on their haunches, staring at Mark. Suds dripping down his neck, Mark stares back, wondering if they will become frequent visitors to our camp like the lions we knew in the Kalahari.",

He once showed me sepia-tinted photographs of his female instructors—sensible ladies in flat shoes, with hair pulled back into taut buns. He even remembers the titles of the essays he had to write at school (‘Compose 500 words with the title “Under the Banyan Tree”’). In his eyes, the British can do, and did, no wrong. ‘Under the British we were able to live peacefully,’ he once told me. ‘A sixteen-year-old girl could travel on her own from the southern tip of the train system in Moulmein all the way to the northern tip in Myitkyina and no harm would come to her. The British looked after the people. We had a secure life. We could go to sleep each night confident that tomorrow would come.’",

Delectable cold fish with superb mayonnaise, a casserole of tenderest meat and onions in a sauce flavoured with red wine, perfect green salad, warm banana cake crusted with brown sugar and a soupçon of rum. We spoke French because Madame said she was glad of the opportunity and this allowed me a full range of praising adjectives, from exquis to fantastique. As I gobbled the glorious food, Madame talked slightingly of her cook, un imbécile like all Africans but he knew she would give him des coups bien durs if he permitted himself serious stupidities. The serving boy passed the casserole on the wrong side. Madame said to him chattily, “Imbécile. Idiot. Black monkey. That is not the way, go around.”",

Most bars in America are dark and full of moody characters – people drinking alone and staring ahead. There’s none of that agreeable coffee-house atmosphere that you find in bars in Europe. American bars are, by and large, just dark places to get drunk in. I don’t like them much, but this one was OK. It was snug and quiet and well lit, so I could sit and read. Before too long I was fairly well lit myself. This was also OK.",

At last the ledge trail straightens, headed south, and I reach the foot of the last climb to the pass just before noon. On a knoll, there is a prayer wall and a stock corral for those who come too late in the day to start the climb. Plainly, we shall not reach Murwa before nightfall, despite Karma’s assurances to the contrary; we shall have to press hard just to cross the pass and descend far enough below the snows to find brushwood to keep warm. Lacking mountain lungs, I am slow in the steep places, and I start the climb at once, without waiting for the others to come up.",

Most of the streets were unpaved and lined with battered-looking trailer homes. Everyone in town seemed to collect old cars. They sat rusting and windowless in every yard. Almost everything in town appeared to exist on the edge of dereliction. Such economic life as Wells could muster came from the passing traffic of Interstate 80. A number of truck stops and motels were scattered around, though many of these were closed down and those that remained were evidently struggling. Most of the motel signs had letters missing or burnt out, so that they said ‘Lone St r Mot I – V can y’. I had a walk around the business district before dinner. This consisted mostly of closed-down stores, though a few places appeared still to be in business: a drugstore, a gas station, a Trailways Bus depot, the Overland Hotel – sorry, H tel – and a movie-house called The Nevada, though this proved upon closer inspection also to be deceased. There were dogs everywhere, sniffing in doorways and peeing on pretty much everything. It was cold, too. The sun was setting behind the rough, distant peaks of the Jackson Mountains and there was a decided chill in the air. I turned up my collar and trudged the half-mile from the town proper to the interstate junction with US 93, where the most prosperous-looking truck stops were gathered, forming an oasis of brightness in the pinkish dusk.",

But free lau-lao was offered, with roast corn on the cob, by the large jolly family who ran the place and seemed unworried by their lack of guests. I stayed in the one-storey annexe, where my enormous high-ceilinged room (the only dirty room in my Lao experience) lacked a mosquito net, window screen, fan, towel, candles – though the electricity went off at 10 p.m. In the filthy mosquito-infested bathroom a dip-and-pour shower was occasionally possible. The family lived in the other half of the annexe and it worried me to see, near their veranda, two monkeys roped to a huge wooden chest amidst a pile of old tractor tyres. But everybody loved them and they were often released to sit on family laps being fondled and fed leftovers.",

And, just as we were about to leave, Sean and Jerry arrived, so I bought another round and, when that was gone, Allan Besant and Robbie Mowat walked in. So I bought another; and Allan and Robbie and Jerry and Sean decided that they were off to a party in the capital, Kirkwall, a few miles down the road. So, as instructed, Luke and I walked up the gently curving stone-paved street to the Royal Hotel, where you could get good things to eat. And, so very pleased to be ashore, and forgetting that I was not going to stay that way, I decided to celebrate.",
