And all the other women wept with gusto, comforting Eliza and her daughter, falling into one another’s arms, wailing with keen hunger. And the men stood sadly about, dressed in their good clothes, wondering when it would be over. Ben lay in the parlour, bedded in his expensive coffin. The room was heavy with the incense of the funeral flowers.",

She surveyed it with satisfaction on going into it after breakfast, and was glad it was hers. It had a tiled floor, and walls the colour of pale honey, and inlaid furniture the colour of amber, and mellow books, many in ivory or lemon-coloured covers. There was a big window overlooking the sea towards Genoa, and a glass door through which she could proceed out on to the battlements and walk along past the quaint and attractive watch-tower, in itself a room with chairs and a writing table, to where on the other side of the tower the battlements ended in a marble seat, and one could see the western bay and the point round which began the Gulf of Spezia. Her south view, between these two stretches of sea, was another hill, higher than San Salvatore, the last of the little peninsula, with the bland turrets of a smaller and uninhabited castle on the top, on which the setting sun still shone when everything else was sunk in shadow. Yes, she was very comfortably established here; and receptacles—Mrs. Fisher did not examine their nature closely, but they seemed to be small stone troughs, or perhaps little sarcophagi— ringed round the battlements with flowers.",

And I reckon she wished for a minute that I was about three or four because then she could have put one arm around me against her knee and held the back of my head with the other hand. But now she just held my hand and this time she had to look up at me. “Mrs Snopes killed herself last night,” she said. “I’m going over to Oxford with Uncle Gavin to bring Linda home.”",

One had a brown baby slung round her waist like a squaw’s papoose, but the other two were young and beautiful with brown cheeks and very large, very dark eyes and black, black hair. As we passed each other, they all three shouted something very matey in Magyar or Romany and I made cheerful noises back and beamed a bit. They were without any bashfulness. I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race.",

It was a moonless night and I could hear the sea before I could see it, coming in with a slow, rhythmic whoosh-whoosh. I went and stood at the water’s edge. The waves fell on to the beach like exhausted swimmers. The wind played at my jacket. I stared for a long time out across the moody sea, the black vastness of the Atlantic, the fearsome, primordial, storm-tossed depths from which all of life has crawled and will no doubt one day return, and I thought, ‘I could murder a hamburger.’",

Then, after a warm rain, the shadows broaden and draw together, for overhead the leaves are bursting; the wind blowing on to him from the clearing is scented, for the grass out there has violets in it; the pear trees in the deserted garden put on their white robes of promise; and then comes summer, and in the long days there are wanderers in the woods, and the chance passer-by, moved perhaps by some vague sentiment of pity for so much loneliness, throws him a few flowers or a bunch of ferns as he goes his way.

What seems like a small miracle, Alejandro explained, is just an expression of what paisas describe as “Metro culture,” a public attitude born of civic pride. What might be acceptable in the streets—casually discarding a wad of gum, a cigarette butt, a plastic bottle or wrapper—simply cannot, and will not, be tolerated in a subway seen by many as the emblem of the city.",

The police chief and mayor considered the options open to them and decided that the most intelligent use of their resources would be to blow up the house – but of course! – even though they knew there were children inside and it was in the middle of a densely-populated part of the city. So they dropped a bomb on the house from a helicopter. This started a fire that quickly grew out of control and burned down most of the neighbourhood – sixty-one houses in all – and killed eleven people, including all the children in the barricaded home.",

When Hamilton’s incline railway was dismantled in the 1930s, a set of metal stairs was constructed to connect the city’s downtown community to its suburban alter ego at the top of the escarpment. Today the Stairs, as they are known locally, offer a great cardio workout through a lovely, quiet stretch of forest. Initially, I did my stair training alone in the early evening, after work, until someone mentioned that a body had recently been found hanging from a tree in the vicinity. I promptly switched to daylight workouts on the Bruce Trail with lots of company.",

Unborn, she would have been perfectly all right and comfortable, and Catherine wouldn’t have had any of her ideas about being the mother of a married daughter, and what would Virginia say, and all such stuff.

Abdel slowed the car to weave through the festering debris, and, just then, a mob swarmed the taxi from all sides. There were seven or eight men, all dressed in grey djellabas. They appeared, suddenly and improbably, from behind the mounds of garbage. One man leaned through Abdel’s window and grabbed at his arms. Another tried to open the passenger door; he fumbled with the handle but couldn’t release the lock. The others pulled at our doors, but they, too, were locked, and our windows closed tight. Abdel shouted and swung his arms through his window. He accelerated quickly and drove the wrong way down a side street. When we were safely away, I asked Abdel what the men wanted, but he said they were just crazy. His voice trembled while he spoke.",

    "target_paragraph": "It is remarkable now, when over 2 million people a year come to the Great Barrier Reef and it is universally esteemed as a treasure, how long it took the tourism industry to discover it. In Rum Jungle, an account of a tour through northern Australia in the 1950s, the historian Alan Moorehead made venturing into northern Queensland sound like a journey to the headwaters of the Orinoco. Then, Cairns was a small, muggy coastal outpost hundreds of miles up a jungle road and occupied mostly by eccentric dropouts of a fugitive disposition. Today it is a bustling mini-metropolis of sixty thousand inhabitants, indistinguishable from any community of similar size in Australia except for the humidity that falls over you like a hot towel when you emerge from the airport terminal and a certain hale devotion to the tourist dollar. It has become a hugely popular stop-off point for backpackers and other young travelers for whom it has a certain reputation for tropical liveliness. On this day the whole was pressed under an oppressive weight of low gray skies of the sort that threatened rain in volume at any moment. We took a cab into town through a long, unbecoming sprawl of motels, gas stations, and fast-food places. Central Cairns was somewhat snugger, but it had the feel of a place that had been built only recently, in haste. Every second business offered reef cruises or snorkeling expeditions, and most of the rest sold T-shirts and postcards.",

One side was printed in Arabic, the other in English, but someone had ripped that side to shreds. Eventually, a faded-yellow tram rolled to a stop in front of us. Alexandria’s tram system dates back to 1863. It’s the oldest tram system in Africa, and one of the oldest in the world, and it looks every bit its age. The car was outdated and patched together; the lights flickered, and there was no hint of air-conditioning, all of the windows were wide open. The car had very few seats, and those few seats were all taken – by men. Unlike Cairo, nobody offered a seat to Teresa, so we stood in a vestibule, on the stairs. A conductor collected our fare: twenty-five piastre – about four cents each. A moment later, the tram jolted to a start, and we rolled along the avenue, just for a minute or so, before the tram stopped again. The other passengers climbed off the car and disappeared into the streets while the tram choked and sputtered to a deep sleep. We had traveled a few hundred feet and would have to walk the rest of the way.",

Eventually I gathered I would be staying elsewhere, in the apartment of her daughter, or brother, or somebody. Miffed to have lost my spot, I took my bags and followed her out into the paths of coal soot between the buildings. There we were met by Ira, Nina’s daughter. Ira resembled a beautiful young woman in a children’s story—rosy cheeks, perfect skin, chestnut hair to her shoulders, dark eyes.

Decoud did not move; the effect was that of being launched into space. After a splash or two there was not a sound but the thud of Nostromo’s feet leaping about the boat. He hoisted the big sail; a breath of wind fanned Decoud’s cheek. Everything had vanished but the light of the lantern Captain Mitchell had hoisted upon the post at the end of the jetty to guide Nostromo out of the harbour.",

When that happens different drivers nap in different ways. Most chose not to lie down in the upper bunk, if the truck has one, because they might sleep for too long. One fellow told of a co-driver who pulled over for a nap, climbed up on the spare, overhead bunk and didn’t wake until shaken on the shoulder by him – five hours later. In the way I had leaned against the passenger window with my little green bookbag on the “easy run” with Chan and Jack, I had also done so in the driver seat of the parked rig when taking a catnap break on different runs. So, too, did drivers lean against the window in the driver seat with a balled up jacket, a roll of paper towels or whatever they found handy for a makeshift pillow. Other drivers keep a regular pillow in the overhead bin of the driving compartment for the specific purpose. While still other drivers just slump face forward over the steering wheel.",

We had seen little of each other since 1993 and in that time Madras had adopted a new name, expanded its waistline and grown into a monster of a metropolis that I barely recognised. But like an ex-lover, it still smelt the same. On the drive from the airport, a heady mix of diesel, waste and noxious fumes from the Cooum river was occasionally delivered from evil by top notes of sea air and jasmine swinging from the rear-view mirror. The Honda’s headlamps bounced over bundles of bodies asleep by the roadside and my heart tightened. By the time I dragged my bag into my room, my hair was stuck to the back of my neck, my skin was clammy with grime and studded with mosquito bites. India wastes no time in extending its welcome.",

I had missed a day myself and didn’t know how many days Dopey missed. Dopey had at least one day off in the middle of the week, maybe two. Would home-time and 24-48 hours notice give a driver a chance to do something to clear out his system? Or maybe that explained why Dopey had become so ornery. Maybe he already knew a test awaited him and his moods and mentality disintegrated as he prepared for it. Or one could claim Dopey simply had a hot-and-cold personality coupled with extreme prejudices. But that wouldn’t explain his physical symptoms like poor vision and motor control.",

But mad as a hornet, raging, bellowing and cursing and still trying to take the rifle away from Charles’s uncle (Mrs Meadowfill was in the room now, the shawl already clutched about her head as if some fatalistic hopeless telepathy communicated to her the instant the hog crossed their unfenced boundary, like the electric eye that opens doors) until at last he exhausted himself into what would pass with him for rationality. Then he told it: how Snopes had told Essie two days ago that he had given the hog to McKinley as a house-warming present or maybe even—Snopes hoped—a wedding gift some day soon, with Charles’s uncle saying, “Hold on a minute. Did Essie say Mr Snopes gave the hog to McKinley, or did she say Mr Snopes told her he had?”",

We were hot and lost and needed to leave the square before our tiff turned worse. I noticed a side street that looked a little less chaotic than the others and we started walking. The road was short, and the sidewalk, as always, littered with trash and feces. We walked in the middle of the road, around moving cars and trucks. Soon, that little road dropped us in the middle of a busy thoroughfare unlike any we had seen in Cairo. The road was lined with mid-rise apartment buildings. Women draped laundry on the balconies, and children played in the street. Narrow storefronts filled the ground floor of most buildings. The storefronts spilled over the sidewalk. Gadgets and widgets and industrial doodads blocked our way. We stepped around boxes of bolts, pulleys, gaskets, and fittings piled high and proud. Everything was made of heavy metal and twisted wire. It felt like we landed in a warehouse full of Terminator parts. I couldn’t even identify most of the merchandise – it seemed highly specific – but the stores were packed with customers. Drivers double-parked, bumper-to-bumper. They popped their trunks and loaded and unloaded the mechanical goods. I wanted to window-shop but Teresa was in a hurry.",

In both areas, however, Paraguay seemed a place of absolutes.

That Paraguay was a byword for the Possible—more Paradise than Parador—was best suggested by the fact that Robert Southey, the British poet laureate at the time, called his longest poem A Tale of Paraguay (“For in history’s mournful map, the eye/ On Paraguay, as on a sunny spot,/ May rest complacent”).",

Then the plane roars away into the south, and excited crows swirl in the valley air.",

The trunk of the tree was smooth and afforded no foothold. A machete would have saved me a lot of trouble. Machete-less, however, I decided to try knocking the fruit down by hurling rocks at it but soon concluded that this was both pointless and dangerous. I was blinded by the sun and couldn’t see where the rocks were landing. One of them almost bashed my head in. I tried inching up the tree, hugging it tightly with my knees and digging my fingernails into its bark; but I fell back down into the mud. My failure infuriated me. I couldn’t bear the thought that I might die of hunger while mountains of fruit hung over my head, out of my reach. It wasn’t fair. Who was all the fruit for? My inside churned with frustration. Then I had another idea.",

Phone books resumed in 1948, and from then until 1950, Rudy’s name was still there, now listed as retired. He’d have been in his late sixties. My fictionalised Rudy was sturdy if not portly in build, a serious, yet huggable guy. If he lived into the 1950s, then he’d have been an enemy of that Communist state, so I can’t imagine he escaped problems.
