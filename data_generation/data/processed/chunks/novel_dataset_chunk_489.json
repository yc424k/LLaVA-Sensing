They used to be familiar as soldiers, policemen and ships’ guards, they are familiar still as hotel doormen and security guards. The aristocratic-looking gentlemen often to be seen standing in the lobby of the Mandarin Hotel, as if waiting to join their fellow-directors for luncheon in the grill, are I am told strong-arm men from the north-west frontier; the police who guard the ammunition stores on Stonecutters Island, in the harbour, are always Sikhs, because their religion forbids them to smoke.",

Now you will find they will all want to talk with you! They don't care about your race!” She laughed, returning to apply more unscented lotion to her drying limbs.\nI was shocked. I had indeed noticed that while I felt terrible about Rashida and her helpers waiting on us in the tent, like maids, retrieving cutlery, serving food, tidying up, serving drinks, preparing our beds, no one else expressed the same concern. I tried to be as helpful as possible, unused to being waited upon. After eating I always returned my plate and utensils to the bucket in which everything was collected and taken away for washing, and would just get up to retrieve my own cold drink from the refrigerator cabinet in the corner of the tent, rather than ask a maid to fetch me one. I had noticed the Saudis dropping half-empty, crumpled cans on the floor of the tent, leaving their litter for the maids to remove. Or worse, signaling to the maids to bring them another soda with a contemptuous and dismissive wave, not even articulating the words, let alone pleasantries like “please” and “thank you.”",

To compound the impact of this on a stifling, humid night, the bus had clearly been parked all day in a position to soak up the maximum amount of sunlight, and every single window, except the driver's, had been glued firmly shut.

Others performed the classic drunk’s hurricane walk, fighting an imaginary wind as they lurched from one lamppost to the next, hanging on. Bodies were pulled from unconscious bliss in mud wagons and walked to waiting cars or buses. They might not remember a lot of what happened last night but they knew they’d had fun. I don’t know where they all went when they dispersed, but I’m sure it wasn’t the safest Monday morning to be on the roads around Port of Spain. We rode safely back to the boatyard in big crashworthy buses only to learn that Powerboats management had given orders that nobody with mud or paint on them be allowed into the showers until they were first hosed off outside. We were obliged to stand out in the cool morning air and be sprayed with cold water until we stopped bleeding colored mud onto the ground, which we all agreed was a really quick way to sober up.",

    "target_paragraph": "In a bad mood, it is easy to believe that Rome is a perpetual chariot race to which hapless pedestrians are incidental; certainly the traffic lights have nothing at all to do with pedestrian crossings and everything to do with the flow and merger of cars. Even two cars in an empty piazza can look as if they are an accident about to happen—like bumper cars at Coney Island; a game. Any attempt to walk across so wide a street as the Via del Teatro di Marcello (engineered by Mussolini to “open up” the Piazza Venezia) is bound to curdle smiles. I am frequently obliged to cross this street, I change buses here. So many lines of traffic debouch into the piazza that crossing it requires the courage of crossing a highway—which it resembles—blind-folded. There is no longer a smartly dressed policeman in white operatically orchestrating movement from a pedestal (the picture memory of him comes from a gentler, more leisured time); there is only a harassed cop directing cars. Sometimes there is no guard at all, only blind faith; it is as implausible to negotiate these streets by car as by foot. Even Romans cross with fear and trembling. I've seen grown women stand for fifteen minutes before they can bring themselves to take the plunge into the stream of cars to get to a traffic island, which will in any case bring them only halfway to their objective. I looped many loops to find a way to get from the bus junction to the Campidoglio or to the Teatro Marcello without the small hairs on the back of my neck standing up; to no avail. One day, after I'd taken three steps forward and two back into the Via del Teatro di Marcello, I closed my eyes for the plunge and found my arms seized by a French man and woman who I thought must have smelled my fear and sensed my vertigo. They had their own fear, and they depended on me to make a phalanx with them; we sputtered at one another in English, French, and Italian to keep our courage up until we reached the Campidoglio. If someone is keeping a ledger, I am now entitled to at least one act of that civility and succor in Paris that I take for granted in Rome.",

The midwinter landscape was arid and the air dry. Efrain had two little girls back home in Cusco, and his guiding style was more fatherly than John’s. He checked frequently to make sure I was carrying water and wearing sunscreen. He also asked some general probing questions to get an idea of what sort of client I was?a know-it-all norteamericano? A bucket-list tourist? A woo-woo spiritual seeker??and filled in some more details of his life story. He’d made peace with his mother after the whole orphanage thing, and had started a foundation of his own to help send homeless kids to school.",

We formed intense friendships that seemed to have the tenacity of the biological ties they were meant to replicate. You could choose not to participate in politics, but you could not avoid politics. It was in the air you breathed. And politics was about justice. It was high minded, and nothing to do with the low-life power struggles of career politicians.",

We rattled on through an increasingly remote and barren landscape, treeless and cold, with heather clinging to the hillsides like lichen on rock and thinly scattered with sheep that took fright and scampered off when the train passed. Now and then we passed through winding valleys speckled with farms that looked romantic and pretty from a distance, but bleak and comfortless up close. Mostly they were small holdings with lots of rusted tin everywhere—tin sheds, tin hen huts, tin fences—looking rickety and weather battered. We were entering one of those weird zones, always a sign of remoteness from the known world, where nothing is ever thrown away. Every farmyard was cluttered with piles of castoffs, as if the owner thought that one day he might need 132 half-rotted fenceposts, a ton of broken bricks, and the shell of a 1964 Ford Zodiac.",

    "target_paragraph": "Ahead walked Edelgard, visibly slimmer, younger, moving quickly and easily in her short skirt and new activity. It was this figure—hardly now at a distance to be distinguished from the figures of the scanty sisters—walking before me that made me think with tenderness of Marie-Luise. Edelgard was behaving badly, and when I told her so at night in our caravan she did not answer. At home she used to express immediate penitence; here she either said nothing, or said short things that reminded me of Mrs. Menzies-Legh, little odd sentences quite unlike her usual style and annoyingly difficult to reply to. And the more she behaved in this manner the more did my thoughts go back regretfully to my gentle and yielding first wife. Sometimes, I recollect, those twenty years with her had seemed long; but that was because, firstly, twenty years are long, and secondly, because we are none of us perfect, and thirdly, because a wife, unless she is careful, is apt to get on to one’s nerves. But how preferable is gentleness to an aggressive activity of mind and body. How annoying to see one’s wife striding on ahead with an ease I could not imitate and therefore in itself a slight on her husband. A man wants a wife who sits still, and not only still but on the same chair every day so that he knows where to find her should he happen to want anything. Marie-Luise was a very calm sitter; she never moved, except to follow the then Clothilde about. Only her hands moved, in a tireless guiding of the needle through those of my undergarments which had become defective.",

    "target_paragraph": "The second author was both an obvious invitee and a reluctant one. John Muir was perhaps America’s leading writer on the relatively new subject of wilderness protection, a movement that within a few years would come to be known as conservation. He had visited Alaska six times and was generally acknowledged as the top expert on its glaciers. His 1879 canoe trip through the Inside Passage is one of the most famous voyages in American exploration. (Muir’s first encounter with Glacier Bay is the heart of his classic Travels in Alaska, a copy of which I did have in my office bookcase.) He had also founded the Sierra Club, to defend California’s dwindling wild places against men like Harriman, practitioners of what Muir called “gobble gobble economics.” Unfamiliar with Harriman, and perplexed by his unusual offer, Muir dragged his feet until his friend Merriam convinced him that the ship would be making stops in Alaskan locations that even Muir had yet to explore.",

The truck slowed to about 40 miles an hour, then 30, then 20. I couldn’t tell what had happened and wondered if the transmission had gone out. Starting out, I had feared a collision by losing control if the truck moved faster than I could keep up with. This was the other side of that coin. The slow speed made the rig like a stone in a stream with the flow of traffic eager to rush around it. I steered haplessly along, hoping no impatient or inattentive motorist rear-ended the back trailer, as the rig oozed along well under the minimum speed limit.",

It sputtered, coughed and revved to life. I opened the throttle up wide trying to squeeze every rpm out of her. We were ten feet from the buoy and dead in the water. We had options. We could get sucked out to sea and come back in when the tide reversed. We could beach Echo on a nearby sand bar and wait for the tide to turn. I took an alternative approach. I tacked 90 degrees to starboard and cut across the inlet to the other shore. The change in direction would give us enough wind to fight the current and take advantage of the counter current on the opposite shore. We were coming into a good position thirty feet off the shore of Cumberland Island when the engine coughed, sputtered and lost power. One of the two cylinders had blown out. Between the sails and half a motor we fought inch by inch until we were in the St Mary’s channel heading into Georgian waters. We were going to be fine. We could breathe easy.",

He sat there sweating and thinking if he could jury-rig something – anything. He settled on using a couple of washers as spacers that he hoped would force the ratchet over far enough to engage the ratchet when he tightened the capstan. He had some washers in his tool bag that would fit. He had to disassemble the entire mechanism, but it wasn’t long before he had it all back together. He tested it, and it seemed to work just fine. The real test would be under load and that meant remounting it to the bowsprit. He knew if it didn’t work, it would take a few more hours to try again, and with the heat, the humidity and, his back, he knew he would be spent if that happened.",

It would take the form of sly gossip, rumor, whispering, swift mockery masked behind a play of innocence, a sudden twist upon a word, a quick, apparently guileless, misinterpretation of a meaning, the pontifical face schooled in grave and even respectful attentiveness, the whole ending suddenly with the explosion of mirth, the high, choking scream of laughter, which, as anyone who had been its victim could testify, was more devastating and unanswerable than any logic of cold argument could be.",

My witticisms “run like wildfire through the court”.* Duchesses tear emeralds from their earrings out of admiration—but these rockets rise best in darkness, in my cubicle at night. I am now a boy only with a colonial accent holding my knuckles against Mr Wickham’s grained oak door. The day has been full of ignominies and triumphs concealed from fear of laughter. I am the best scholar in the school. But when darkness comes I put off this unenviable body—my large nose, my thin lips, my colonial accent—and inhabit space. I am then Virgil’s companion, and Plato’s.* I am then the last scion of one of the great houses of France. But I am also one who will force himself to desert these windy and moonlit territories, these midnight wanderings, and confront grained oak doors. I will achieve in my life—Heaven grant that it be not long—some gigantic amalgamation between the two discrepancies so hideously apparent to me. Out of my suffering I will do it. I will knock. I will enter.’",

Many ANC activists deplore Mr Mandela’s choice of this Coloured clergyman with an unorthodox (by clerical standards) view of matrimony, a man who not long ago was a source of bitter dissension within his Dutch Reformed Mission Church.

After arranging for a leave from the convent, Diana returned to Colombia, landing at the small airport in La Dorada, where her mother met her with the terrible news that her brother, just seventeen, had been kidnapped by the paramilitaries. Nothing in San Diego, her mother warned, was the same. The guerrillas had arrived with lists and gone door to door grabbing anyone accused of collaborating with the paramilitaries. They shot them in the plaza and dumped the bodies at the edge of town. The paras, as the paramilitaries were known, did the same thing, killing anyone who so much as offered a glass of lemonade to a member of the FARC.",
