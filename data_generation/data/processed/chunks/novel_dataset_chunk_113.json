Beside the bed was a small bedstand with a light, but I didn’t even think to turn it on. Instead, I lay down for the first time on my narrow bed and pulled the canopy around it.\nI lay in the small alcove, in the small room, and on that narrow bed enclosed in lace, I felt the small body contained within my own.

Soon there would be prayers—all of us lined up in our unbroken rows—and not long after, at dawn, more prayers, and old monks, as they seemed, watching over us.

On every trail and mountaintop, calling for me to come to terms. Yet I had not answered, hiding and hoping, coping through stoicism. I contemplated the existence of a dark chamber inside everyone where they put the hurt, the embarrassments, the scars, the heartbreak—the pains of living—a place to lock them away and forget they exist in order to move on. It’s how we cope and how we survive the harshness of an unfair world. Some people open the chamber when they’re low and use the contents to berate themselves, reliving the rancor because they don’t believe they deserve anything else. Some only open that chamber to throw more in and never process the pain. Now I was realizing I’d spent a lifetime doing both.",

The summit of Mont Blanc was reached in 1786, and mountaineering proper came into existence in the middle of the 1800s, induced by a commitment to science (in the sport’s adolescence, no respectable mountaineer would scale a peak without at the very least boiling a thermometer on the summit) but very definitely born of beauty. The complex aesthetics of ice, sunlight, rock, height, angles and air – what John Ruskin called the ‘endless perspicuity of space; the unfatigued veracity of eternal light’ – were to the later nineteenth-century mind unquestionably marvellous. Mountains began to exert a considerable and often fatal power of attraction on the human mind. ‘The effect of this strange Matterhorn upon the imagination is indeed so great,’ Ruskin could claim proudly of his favourite mountain in 1862, ‘that even the gravest philosophers cannot resist it.’ Three years later the Matterhorn was climbed for the first time; four of the successful summitteers fell to their deaths during the descent.",

    "target_paragraph": "More recently, the mountain summit has become a secular symbol of effort and reward. ‘ To peak’ is to reach the high point of an endeavour. To be ‘on top of the world’ is to feel incomparably well. Undoubtedly, the sense of accomplishment which comes from reaching a mountain-top has historically been a key element of the desire for height. This is unsurprising – what simpler allegory of success could there be than the ascent of a mountain? The summit provides the visible goal, the slopes leading up to it the challenge. When we walk or climb up a mountain we traverse not only the actual terrain of the hillside but also the metaphysical territories of struggle and achievement. To reach a summit is very palpably to have triumphed over adversity: to have conquered something, albeit something utterly useless. It is the imagined significance of the summit – which is, after all, nothing but a patch of rock or snow raised higher than any other by the contingencies of geology; a set of co-ordinates in space; a figment of geometry; a point without a point – which has largely given rise to the industry of ascent.*",

If I were a child, I would want to lift up the tablecloth and crawl under the unending table, into the flaxen light where I could crouch and listen to the loud laughs, clinks, and grown-up talk, hear over and over “Salute” and “Cin-cin” travelling around the chairs, stare at kneecaps and walking shoes and flowered skirts hiked up to catch a breeze, the table steady under its weight of food. Such a table should accommodate the wanderings of a large dog. At the end, you need room for an enormous vase of all the flowers in bloom at the moment. The width should allow platters to meander from hand to hand down the center, stopping where they will, and numerous water and wine bottles to accumulate over the hours. You need room for a bowl of cool water to dip the grapes and pears into, a little covered dish to keep the bugs off the Gorgonzola (dolce as opposed to the piccante type, which is for cooking) and caciotta, a local soft cheese. No one cares if olive pits are flung into the distance. The best wardrobe for such a table runs to pale linens, blue checks, pink and green plaid, not dead white, which takes in too much glare. If the table is long enough, everything can be brought out at once, and no one has to run back and forth to the kitchen. Then the table is set for primary pleasure: lingering meals, under the trees at noon. The open air confers an ease, a relaxation and freedom. You’re your own guest, which is the way summer ought to be.",

I hoped I could find my way back to a big ring fort we had reached on our first day - the triple-ramparted Cathair Chomain. It was close to freezing, and my breath fletched in the air. Roosting birds, unidentifiable in the dark, rose from the ground with flaring wings and eyes like jewels. The only sound I could hear was the stony krekking of a raven.

The car’s inner light spilled onto the snow as vodka, leather, and cigarette smoke thickened the air. I watched in disbelief as the driver’s shoes sauntered toward me. My eyes ran up from his socks to his jeans, his black leather coat, his jutting chin, and finally his glassy eyes, peering hard at me. When invited, the stare of a man feels so warm and wet. It turns your insides out, quickening your breath, swelling your breasts, parting your thighs. But a predatory stare feels cold and dry. Muscles lock, hairs stand, lips dissolve, thighs press tightly together.",

The huge round bases, that rose before out of the bare earth, rise now from lush emerald corn, in whose depths flourishes a bright purple monkshood; or from the shining white and filling grey-green pods of the opium crops; or from those low trees, scattered with gold when I first saw them, and bare as bones when I left, that have now turned into bushy deep-green mulberries.

I ordered a vegetable pizza (not bad) with a green apple Fanta (disgusting), and Teresa had the kofta sandwich (a spiced beef meatball) with iced tea. Afterward, I went back to our room and washed a load of clothes in the sink. Teresa took the elevator to the roof-deck on the tower and watched the sun set behind the sand dunes, over the Western Desert. She desperately wanted to visit the oases there, and being so close to the left bank made her dream of a few nights under the stars. If not for the high holiday, and the extreme weather, and the extreme danger, we might have made it. Instead, we gave up on the Western Deserts, and set our eyes, once more, on Luxor, and, from there, the Red Sea.",

I said as much, to which my opponent replied that she was only trying to help – whereupon I retorted that it was a matter of opinion whether ‘help’ or ‘interference’ was the mot juste for any of our activities. She then went on to accuse me of being ‘like the CID’ – a charge which left me completely uninsulted because, as I pointed out, CIDs are necessary evils, human nature being what it is. As can be seen, our meeting was not exactly productive, except in so far as it gave us both the opportunity to let off a great deal of long-pent-up steam. I only wish that I was more deserving of comparison with the CID – though actually Interpol is what we need here.",

The collapse of Trenor’s will left her in control, and she heard herself, in a voice that was her own yet outside herself, bidding him ring for the servant, bidding him give the order for a hansom, directing him to put her in it when it came. Whence the strength came to her she knew not; but an insistent voice warned her that she must leave the house openly, and nerved her, in the hall before the hovering care-taker, to exchange light words with Trenor, and charge him with the usual messages for Judy, while all the while she shook with inward loathing. On the doorstep, with the street before her, she felt a mad throb of liberation, intoxicating as the prisoner’s first draught of free air; but the clearness of brain continued, and she noted the mute aspect of Fifth Avenue, guessed at the lateness of the hour, and even observed a man’s figure – was there something half-familiar in its outline? – which, as she entered the hansom, turned from the opposite corner and vanished in the obscurity of the side street.",

This came to me during a time trial, when we plowed slowly through deep sand, which had already trapped another car. Bernard looked at them and said, “Typical error. People think they have to speed up to get through sand. It’s the opposite. Go as slowly as you can while still moving forward. That way you won’t spin your wheels and carve ruts.” It came up again when Bernard and I were struggling to excavate ourselves from the morass we were stuck in following the P2P. Each tentative opener of conversation meant movement. The way forward was slow, and neither of us knew quite where that way was leading, but even baby steps were better than no steps at all.",

She was suitably wowed by the natural beauty of Madeira, and loved being beyond the reach of her office. She could spend whole days hiking through the terraces and reading what she called murder books—mysteries—while I surfed. I remember a foggy morning: I was surfing Jardim alone. She was reading on a hotel balcony directly above the break. The waves were head-high, barely clearing the rocks on the sets. After every ride, I would look up. Caroline’s nose would still be in her book. I would yell. She would wave. She saw none of my rides. When I finally came in and complained, she tried to explain, not for the first time, how exquisitely boring it was to watch surfing. The lulls between sets seemed to go on for hours. There had been, it was true, some fairly long lulls.",
