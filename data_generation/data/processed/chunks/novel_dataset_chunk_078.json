Then our path ascended the ploughed ridge diagonally, passing many giant thistles – twenty feet tall, with enormous balls hanging from their upper stalks like toys on a Christmas tree – and sometimes crossing uncultivated stretches where clumps of thyme and heather grew between outcrops of rock, or the now familiar Semien shrubs shed their small green leaves into Jock’s bucket. From the crest of this ridge we walked for hours down a slightly broken, sloping plateau, seeing occasional conspicuous groups of twisted pines. Here I got a close-up view of two magnificent Lanner Falcons, with red-brown heads, dark-grey backs and black wings; both had perched on boulders and neither moved until we were almost beside them. Apart from these the only birds I’ve noticed in the Semiens are Thick-billed Ravens – natives of Ethiopia – but the Lammergeyer (Bearded Vulture), which has a wing-span of eight to nine feet, is also quite common here.",

During his short stay in Pizzo, he certainly hadn’t tasted the tartufo that had yet to be invented, although I would hope that he at least had the opportunity to sample the tuna or other fish for which the city was well noted. Following in his footsteps many years later, Dumas only mentioned a cold chicken, bread and wine, but that was a snack for the condemned man to stave off hunger during the night.",

Despite the fact that no serious historian, in Israel or elsewhere, would even begin to try to defend such a crude distortion of Palestine’s medieval history, this version still possesses a curious half-life in government propaganda. Facts About Israel, for example, is an information book produced by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs which is prefaced by a fifteen-page account of ‘the history of the Land of Israel’. Here, following an extremely detailed account of the Biblical Israelite kingdoms, fourteen hundred years of the region’s Islamic history is written off in a small section entitled ‘Arabs in the Land of Israel’:",

In much of the city they still aren’t. A sense of almost microscopic embroidery fills the town’s windingest lanes, where log homes sunk halfway to their eaves in the permafrost draw your attention with decorative wood carving on shutters and doors and windows as ornate as the finest carved birch jewelry box. And yet almost every house also looked gray and older than old, though never as decrepit as the defiantly ugly high-rises that confront you whenever a big open space from Soviet times scissors across the network of lanes.",

These children, like so many Italian children, ask questions about one as if one weren't there. Their faces two inches from one's own, they say (to whom? one wonders), “Why is she fat?” or, “Why is her hair yellow?” or, “Why are her teeth so straight?” or, “Why does she wear these brutti clothes?” These questions are never discouraged and seldom answered. It seems an inefficient way of gathering information about the world, but they are quite as tolerable and as coherent as other children, if very much more there, leaving no space between themselves and other people. Will they come to believe that an accumulation of facts is tantamount to intimacy?",

He reached out, caught Starwick by the throat and collar of his shirt, and endowed with that immense, incalculable strength which hatred and the sudden lust to kill can give a man, he lifted the slight figure from the ground as if it were a bundle of rags and sticks, and slammed it back against the facade of a building with such brutal violence that Starwick’s head bounced and rattled on the stone. The blow knocked Starwick senseless: his hat went flying from his head, his cane fell from his grasp and rattled on the pavement with a hard, lean clatter. For a moment, his eyes rolled back and forth with the wooden, weighted movement of a doll’s. Then, as Eugene released his grip, his legs buckled at the knees, his eyes closed and his head sagged, and he began to slump down towards the pavement, his back sliding all the time against the wall.",

Part of the local reticence arose, I thought, from a shyness that was utterly engaging, and part of it from an unfeigned sense of cultural dignity and pride that was genuinely moving. But there was also a wariness, a watchfulness in the people, as strong as in their impenetrable dzongs. And the dzongs themselves struck me always as strategic more than spiritual establishments; as fortifications rather than golden palaces or monasteries. Bhutan had the red-robed monks, the butter lamps, the chants, the scriptures, the prayer halls, and the faces of Tibet, but it had none of that country’s fire and intensity, none of its radiant magnetism. Bhutan may have got its name from the Sanskrit Bhotanta, or the east end of Tibet. Yet it seemed in many ways a near inversion of Tibet. And where in Tibet the air fairly vibrates with the strength of religious devotion, Bhutan struck me as a strangely secular place.",

Its editor, Walter Mares, sat smoking and gulping coffee at a desk so cluttered he could barely find space to set down his mug. Heavyset, with graying hair and mustache, Walter had spent much of his twenty-three-year tenure covering labor strikes, copper price collapses, and floods in the deep canyon enclosing Clifton. But he also wrote features about the Coronado Trail, which gave beleaguered Clifton its town motto—“Where the Trail Begins”—and a small point of tourist interest to promote at civic events and state fairs.",

It isn’t like LA where I’d drive a block and a half to Trader Joe’s and find whatever fruits or veggies I want whenever I want them. Here, to everything there is a season and when you go to the corner store or the stalls by Damascus Gate, you get what the earth gives you. During the summer, fresh mangoes—sweet, ripe, golden beauties, juice dripping down your chin when you eat them. Before that, strawberries, red and pert. In winter, bitter greens. Almonds after the first rains. And in the fall, juicy figs and bright red pomegranates, split open into tiny jewels.\nHere, especially in the stalls by Damascus Gate, you have to be grateful for the gifts you have when you have them . . . and still know that when they’re gone, they’ll be back again when the earth turns around the sun at the right time in its right pace.\nI also learned Um Ibrahim’s name: Amal.

Past the densely peopled beaches and rows of Coca-Cola and burger shops Pepe found a quieter beach at the poor end of town. Even the sand was inferior. But there was a shellfish market, and a restaurant where we ate paila marina, a crabby bouillabaisse which was to become my favourite Chilean food, with a mound of tiny lemons and a bottle of cold white wine. Shifty individuals sidled in to sell wet handkerchiefs’ full of illegally caught locos, a Chilean mollusc with no common name in English but usually referred to as abalone, which it resembles. Locos are so sought after that capture is illegal during the breeding season, and confiscated catches are reported in the papers as if they were cocaine hauls.",

I agree that not forgetting is important. But forgetting is also important. Not to deny what happened. But to allow ourselves to go on. In the cities, the violence was random, anonymous. In the small towns, and certainly in places like Puerto Triunfo and Puerto Berrío and all the riverside settlements in the Medio Magdalena, it was intimate and personal. Everyone knew everyone. An old man once told me that if he didn’t forget, he wouldn’t be able to get up in the morning and go to work. We were walking together down a side street in his town, and he kept pointing left and right, indicating where people had been killed. Naming names. So-and-so was shot here. This happened there. Suddenly he stopped, looked me right in the eye, and said, ‘I need to forget to continue living.’ ”",

He was surprised to hear them boasting about how they had gone from idea to thriving business in a relatively short time. He took note of the clothes they wore, and when they mentioned their cell phones, fancy watches, and other luxuries, his ears perked up. Despite the austerity he’d grown up with during the special period, or perhaps because of it, he appreciated the power of money.

So, when Bryce returned with a single fish at 8:30, which he bathed in cheap oil and supplemented with soft, raw “tahfu” (for the vegetarian), we barely contained our disgust. Making a crew wait for dinner was one thing. Making them wait for a gross dinner that they finished with growling stomachs was a crime punishable by the coldest of shoulders. We rummaged noisily through lunch stores, scarfing down a Clif Bar or carefully rationed cookies. Bryce lasted only one summer.",

It stood out like an office block in a Georgian crescent, all pre-stressed concrete and gleaming modernity, as different from the austere classical chapels of the Tur Abdin as could be imagined. Inside it was worse still: jarring Technicolor icons hung from the brightly-lit walls; at the back of the altar, behind the priest, a barrage of fairy lights winked like a neon advertisement in Piccadilly Circus.",

The country spends $200 million a year on maintenance and restoration, which seems a reasonable sum until it is brought to your attention that that is less than the cost of a dozen new miles of highway, and a fraction of what was spent on stadiums for the 1990 World Cup. Altogether it is less than 0.2 per cent of the national budget. As a result, two-thirds of the nation’s treasures are locked away in warehouses or otherwise denied to the public, and many others are crumbling away for want of attention ? in March 1989, for instance, the 900-year-old civic tower of Pavia collapsed, just keeled over, killing four people ? and there are so many treasures lying around that thieves can just walk off with them. In 1989 alone almost 13,000 works of art were taken from the country’s museums and churches, and as I write some 90,000 works of art are missing. Eighty per cent of all the art thefts in Europe take place in Italy.",

If they were to be sent on a timber-cutting detail, the best assignment was that of taking the smaller limbs trimmed from the downed trees and feeding them to the fire. If their day’s job was to work on the road, breaking a path through the snow with their bodies for horses and vehicles to follow, the assignment you wanted least was to be the man who walked on point, ahead of the others. Usually prisoners received no food during their twelve-hour workday. Guards watched them the whole time, and they had to keep within a boundary indicated by pieces of red cloth or other markers distributed around the work site. Any prisoner who crossed the boundary area would be shot, and the guard who shot him would get a day or two off. Sometimes guards tried to fool prisoners into going over the line just so they could shoot them. If the prisoners were doing road building, they toiled with picks, sledgehammers, shovels, and wheelbarrows. Even in forty-below weather the work caused them to sweat heavily. Back at camp at the end of the day, they had to stand in formation for another roll call while the sweat froze in their clothes. Then they marched into the barracks for a supper that was similar to breakfast, followed by a brief time for personal activities like letter writing and reading the little mail they were allowed. Then sleep.",
