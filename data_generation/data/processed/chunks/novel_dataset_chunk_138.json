I recovered some of my appetite and took a bite of a granola bar. I choked on its dryness and spit it out. I drank more water and took a smaller bite. As I sat out one of the hottest hours of the day in the blessed shade, two separate firemen came out and plied me with bottles of Gatorade. To save my phone battery, I played with my watch’s buttons until the alarm was set for 5 a.m. I also turned on the hourly alarm. Maybe with a reminder, I could manage to take in a small amount of calories more regularly. I shouldered my pack, now holding three and a half liters of water, and stepped inside to thank the firefighters. Then I headed out into the heat of the day?to again cross this arid, exposed terrain that shimmered with mirages and memories.",

U.C. took the platoon’s salute in fine style and remarked that his horse was lucky as he could ride and walk at the same time so the horse would really have six legs. I went to get on my horse which kicked ferociously; Mr Ma, beating a retreat, slipped and fell flat in the thick mud. We set off in a downpour, all members of the party past speech.",

By its second year on air, NBC was selling over $10 million worth of ads a year. By the early 1930s, radio advertising was worth over $40 million a year in a market that was shrunken by the Great Depression. Newspaper advertising fell by a third, and magazine ads by closer to a half as radio advertising took off. Nearly 250 daily newspapers folded in the decade after the birth of network radio. Listening to the radio became the thing that every household did, and David Sarnoff could legitimately take the credit for almost all of that. By 1929, just before the stock market crash, RCA’s stock was 10,000 percent higher than it had been just five years before, and David Sarnoff was the darling of the radio industry.",

Engrossed in getting Varuna under sail, I didn’t notice Kreiz on a collision course until we were very close, and then stood up in alarm to see if they were going to move.

These play to the caravan crowd from whom they get more money. Thus, your tent site is wherever they can’t put a caravan. Mine is on a slope with a twenty degree tilt. Kids and dogs run amok, morning til late. Wifi is available, but only in one tiny, unsheltered spot 250 metres from my tent. There is no mobile service.",

Borromini goes deeper into the structure for his motion and lightnesses, making ornament more incidental, or superfluous; there is hardly any in this interior. Two-order façade, with double curve, a triumph over the tiny corner space that was available. The richness inside is all of space; it is hard to see what has been done with it, the forms are so intricate; it is a solidified dance—apparently based on two crossed ovals, with a further elaboration at the corners, of twisted ovals. Soup-tureen dome, with light streaming in from the windows of the cupola. It is the building in Rome in which you most feel freed of your own weight. He used the oval in somewhat the same way in S. Agnese in Piazza Navona but not so successfully.—To be considered together with the Quattro Fontane, one of which is embodied in its outer wall.",

It’s been a lingering idea, this dream; most visitors to Bali (myself on my first trip included) still endorse it. “I was furious at God that I was not born Balinese,” said the German photographer George Krauser after visiting Bali in the 1930s. Lured by reports of otherworldly beauty and serenity, some really A-list tourists started visiting the island—artists like Walter Spies, writers like Noël Coward, dancers like Claire Holt, actors like Charlie Chaplin, scholars like Margaret Mead (who, despite all the naked breasts, wisely called Balinese civilization on what it truly was, a society as prim as Victorian England: “Not an ounce of free libido in the whole culture.”)",

Today’s seventy miles were flat and arid – few farms, no visible people of any colour, no trees, no traffic, brown bush, the depressingly named Asbestos Mountains away to the west, low and smooth. From the beginning of human time, this was part of the San people’s territory. Then gradually the Griquas – so named in 1812 by the Revd John Campbell of the London Missionary Society (LMS) – migrated north. And these semi-nomadic cattle-herders of mixed ancestry were mainly responsible for exterminating the San in this region. Incinerating live children was one of their ploys. But more usually they captured the children of slain parents for sale as slaves in the Cape Colony. Now Griqualand West is a misnomer; in the mid-nineteenth century most Griquas were forced to move to Griqualand East on the Transkei–Natal border, where a few small communities remain intact.",

Surely, if the mind wanders (and Jacob looked extraordinarily vacant, his head thrown back, his hymn-book open at the wrong place), if the mind wanders it is because several hat shops and cupboards upon cupboards of coloured dresses are displayed upon rush-bottomed chairs. Though heads and bodies may be devout enough, one has a sense of individuals—some like blue, others brown; some feathers, others pansies and forget-me-nots. No one would think of bringing a dog into church. For though a dog is all very well on a gravel path, and shows no disrespect to flowers, the way he wanders down an aisle, looking, lifting a paw, and approaching a pillar with a purpose that makes the blood run cold with horror (should you be one of a congregation—alone, shyness is out of the question), a dog destroys the service completely. So do these women—though separately devout, distinguished, and vouched for by the theology, mathematics, Latin, and Greek of their husbands. Heaven knows why it is. For one thing, thought Jacob, they’re as ugly as sin.",

We had turned north at Gilgil onto a secondary road and it was bad. This was the year of the great floods and there was plenty of mud to overcome; mud is for bogging down, dust is for skidding out of control. My aim was Barry’s Hotel at Thomson’s Falls and it was getting late. I began to worry, as I did every day thereafter, about daylight and distance. Worry is too mild a word. A knot started to form in my stomach around four o’clock and grew knottier and bigger every half hour. The sun set almost exactly at six. I doubted that I could cope with these roads in the dark; I could too easily imagine a breakdown and a long cold black night, waiting for a car to pass in the morning.",

He spoke enough English to opine that Hare’s disability was merely a result of her having been put on the market wrongly adjusted. He then worked on the brakes for half an hour, by the light of his jeep’s headlamps, before going for a reassuring trial run down the steep slope from Route 6. Elated and grateful, I stood him several beers as we supped together. He was not surprised to hear about the camera theft. ‘You were lucky,’ he said. ‘Those people have poisons to kill and then they steal everything.’",

I started hauling logs and large rocks about, placing them in the shape of an arrow pointing downstream. Next to it I formed the letter Y for the first initial of my name, and after it I wrote ‘12’ for the date. I was pleased with my ingenuity and sure the signal would be spotted from above. The truth is I still thought I would be disappointed if someone came to rescue me. I was convinced that I was so close that it would be a shame not to do it on my own.",

After they have passed, the steps are as dirty as before; but now above the blackened skirting-tiles the walls are freshly and dirtily splashed. The bathrooms and lavatories are foul; the slimy woodwork has rotted away as a result of this daily drenching; the concrete walls are green and black with slime. You cannot complain that the hotel is dirty. No Indian will agree with you. Four sweepers are in daily attendance, and it is enough in India that the sweepers attend. They are not required to clean. That is a subsidiary part of their function, which is to be sweepers, degraded beings, to go through the motions of degradation. They must stoop when they sweep; cleaning the floor of the smart Delhi café, they will squat and move like crabs between the feet of the customers, careful to touch no one, never looking up, never rising. In Jammu City you will see them collecting filth from the streets with their bare hands. This is the degradation the society requires of them, and to this they willingly submit. They are dirt; they wish to appear as dirt.",

He also said that if I wanted to sleep out, he had found a possible bivouac hole for us: a tunnel, open at both ends, weathered into the north-west face of one of the tors, its floor a blond grit-sand beach. A hare’s scrape, really. To sleep inside a tor! I couldn’t wait.",

There must be society. Coming out of the library it was painful, but pleasant, to run slap into Mrs. Manresa32 and an unknown young man with tow-coloured hair and a twisted face.

The hot sun melted so much snow on our roof that when we got back from a kerosene-hunt we found all our bedding sodden. But it soon dried when hung outside.

Rachel spent the forenoon at the local girls’ school with some of her young friends; she finds it very difficult to keep upright while walking around Skardu under these conditions. The kerosene shortage is now acute because no jeeps are able to get through from Juglote, the track having been blocked by seven major landslides.",

But then again, we had seen the pictures: crazed revolutionaries burning effigies of Uncle Sam, incarcerating hostages and calling down hellfire on the Great Satan (Ronald Reagan) and the She-Devil (our own Prime Minister). The British Foreign Office was little more cheering. The man we had spoken to at the Iranian information desk had warned us that Britons were strongly advised not to visit the country. Two Englishmen, one a student, were languishing in Iranian jails on trumped-up charges of espionage, and a backpacker of our own age had been shot dead at the border. He was thought to have been carrying drugs, and to have panicked when they were discovered at customs. Then there were the reports of the Morality Police, the Islamic Secret Service set up by the Ayatollah Khomeini. They operated both in Iranian homes, through a network of informers it was said, and more publicly, through a fleet of plain-clothes agents. Men and women walking together in the streets could be stopped and asked to present a marriage certificate. If none was forthcoming, the Morality Police could order an instant public flagellation. They had similar powers in the enforcing of the Dress Laws. If anyone, men as well as women, were regarded as immorally dressed, wearing a T-shirt or simply revealing an ankle or a wrist in public, that person could be immediately arrested and flogged. Travelling unmarried with Laura was going to be risky, however much trouble we took with our dress. Finally there was the Gulf War and the dangers of bombing raids by the Iraqi airforce.",

Suddenly there’s a loud crash, followed instantly by a sharp bang. I hunch reflexively. As a child of the sixties, I’m a veteran of school air raid drills. I now execute a perfect duck, knees cradling my head, arms covering all. “What the hell was that?!” I shout from between my elbows, as Bernard shouts, “A rock. Someone threw a rock at us!” I peer up and see the windshield on Bernard’s side is a crazy blossom of cracks. Bernard keeps driving, giving me only a second to spot the culprits: a small group of cute tousle-haired young boys, who mockingly wave rock-filled hands. They’re laughing.",

The workmen had left early today, abandoning the desolate heaps of lime and sand and pruned rocks out of which it would all be finished. Janis was at the end of a field digging. He shouted and loped unevenly towards us like a camel across the furrowed earth, eager to unlock the bamboo palisades which surrounded the little temporary huts where Marie lived while she was waiting for ‘Fortuna’ to be completed. ‘God be with you,’ said Janis with delight, shaking hands all round and exposing a mouth as devoid of teeth as an oyster in a shapeless grin. I introduced my companion and told him that we had come to study the arrangement of the trees, which seemed to delight him even more. He jumped up and down in an ecstasy of willingness to please, like a monkey on a chain. But first the laws of hospitality must be observed strictly. He unlocked the gate and led us into the little loggia with its fantastic palms where the two peacocks talked in undertones, and setting chairs for us, poured us glasses of sherbet – which in Greek still preserves a haunting trace of Aphrodite’s name, for it is called Aphros or Foam. Drinking, we completed the politenesses due to convention before I told Panos that I would go and bathe while he did his tour of inspection. ‘I know it will be cold,’ I said, ‘but I have only a few days left before I leave the island. Don’t deny me the pleasure.’ Panos grinned. ‘Pleasure or torture?’ ‘One partakes of the other.’ ‘Good.’ No Greek can resist aphorism; its form will make him believe it to be true, even if it is false. ‘Good,’ he repeated rising. ‘Then I shall go off with Janis.’ The old man bobbed and curtseyed again. ‘Willingly. Willingly.’",

Midnight came and John got out his flare gun—for emergencies only—and shot off four blanks at the indigo sky. Such a cry-wolf violation of USFS safety parameters might have been grave, had we been closer to town. Luckily, there was no one who cared within fifty miles, no officials to initiate a rescue even in dire straits, no bosses to see the beer bottles all over the beach. Nobody to sneer when half of us never made it back to our tents. Midmorning we woke blurry to find John, arms and legs spread wide, collapsed on the beach beneath the flapping tarp. With goldish sand in his stubble, a beatific smile on his face, he was an angel come back from a bender. Not fallen, just passed out cold.",

I transfer the outline of the continental shelf from one of Robertson’s charts onto my large chart, though the scale of the small charts may be quite inaccurate. None of the charts show any shipping from South to North America, but I reason that there must be a large number of small vessels running an interisland business in the Caribbean, and there should be traffic from Brazil to islands and to other points north. I sketch in my assumed lanes and possible traffic patterns for the airlines, so I will know when to try the EPIRB. I continually calculate the probable error in my navigation, both for and against me, and write on my chart maximum and minimum number of days to the lanes, to the shelf, to the islands. Even the best estimates don’t look good, and each day makes the minimum-to-maximum-number-of-days spread wider and wider apart, which gives rise to incredible hope on the one hand, incredible depression on the other. At my current speed of eight miles a day, I’m not getting to any lanes any too quickly.",

A fisherman named Luigi, paddling about the stern of the FLUTTERBY where, in consequence of the kitchen refuse thrown overboard, marine beasts of every shape and kind were wont to congregate, cast down his spear at what looked like a splendid caerulean flat-fish of uncommon size and brilliance. The creature shivered and collapsed at that contact in the most unnatural, unfishlike manner; and Luigi drew up, to his amazement, a fragment of a lady's dress—to wit, a short length of sky-blue CREPE DE CHINE. Bitterly disappointed, he nevertheless took the matter with the characteristic Southern philosophy. \"This will do for my little Annarella,\" he decided. And doubtless the child, arrayed in these celestial tints, would have been the envy of all her girl companions at the next festival of the patron saint b for the fact that Mr. Freddy Parker was strolling on the beach at the very moment of the man's return to land. By a rare piece of good luck, as he himself phrased it, his eye fell upon the dripping fabric; by a stroke of intuition not rare but unique, he divined its worth as a sociological document. Promising the man a reasonable sum of money (the Commissioner happened to have no loose change in his pocket just then) he carried the incrimination morsel in triumph to the Residency, where it was displayed by his lady, to all and sundry, in corroboration of her theory.",

At the top of the stick, where Georgina’s hand would grasp it, her husband had carved a small hole and stuffed it with a lock of his hair and one from each of their two children, as well as strands of hair from the family pets.
