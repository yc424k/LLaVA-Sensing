No man with any of the juices of boyhood in him has forgotten those dreams. The peculiar thing about Everett Ruess was that he went out and did the things he dreamed about, not simply for a two-weeks’ vacation in the civilized and trimmed wonderlands, but for months and years in the very midst of wonder….",

Minute diamonds of moisture from the mist hung, too, upon Tess’s eyelashes, and drops upon her hair, like seed pearls.

It was five months since he had left America. After the overwhelming impact of impression and event which a new world, a new life, had brought to him in so many varied, chance, and unexpected ways – after the ship, the voyage, the enormous isolation, the whole earth-detachment of the sea (itself a life, a world, a universe of new experience), after the weeks in England, the huge web of London, the brief but poignantly illuminating days in Bristol, Bath, and Devonshire, with fleeting glimpses of something so strange, yet so familiar, so near, yet never to be touched, that it seemed to him he was looking in through a lighted window at a life which he had always known, but which he could never make his own; after the terrific impact of France and Paris – the month of bewildered, desperate and almost terror-stricken isolation in a new and hostile world – an atom, wordless, tongueless, almost drowned among the strange, dark faces of the Frenchmen; after all the confusion, grief, and error of that month – the night-time kaleidoscope of cafés, brothels, alcohol, and women, the frenzied day-time prowling through museums, bookstalls, thronging streets – the thousand monuments of an alien culture, the million faces of an alien race, until every atom of him was wrung, trembling, maddened and exhausted, sick with loss and hopelessness, weary with despair – after the huge first shock and flood-tide of immersion in an alien life – had come his meeting with Starwick, Elinor, and Ann, the brief, fatal, furious weeks of their relation, the bitter loss and waste and rankling pain of parting; and finally the sweltering and incurable ache, the blind and driven aimlessness of wandering, the chance encounter with the Countess, and the brief interlude of forgetfulness and oblivion that had come to him while he was with her – and now, blank, silent loneliness again, the blind fortuity of chance, the arbitrary halt and desperate entrenchment of his spirit in this town of Tours.",

Lucas was waiting, standing in the door with his hat on, in silhouette against the firelight on the hearth. The old woman did not rise. She sat as in the commissary that afternoon, motionless, only bent a little forward, her tiny gnarled hands immobile again on the white apron, the shrunken and tragic mask touched here and there into highlight by the fire, and for the first time in his memory he was seeing her in or about the house without the clay pipe in her mouth. Lucas drew up a chair for him. But Lucas did not sit down. He went and stood at the other side of the hearth, the firelight touching him too—the broad sweep of the hand-made beaver hat which Edmonds’ grandfather had given him fifty years ago, the faintly Syriac features, the heavy gold watch-chain looped across the unbuttoned vest. “Now what’s all this?” Edmonds said.",

They planned to run both businesses there until the Federation of Cuban Women offered Cary a suitable space for Procle to move into. Despite the setbacks they’d suffered and the shadow of decay all around them, she felt things were moving in the right direction. They were Cubans after all, and their sense of relativism constantly reminded them that things were far better than they had been during the special period. The business course in Florida had filled Oscar with fresh ideas he was eager to try as he decided whether to stay in Cuba or make his life elsewhere. And Cary felt her optimism in Cuba’s future growing stronger with Oscar working by her side, even if only temporarily. Fidel had passed from the scene, but Cuba had not collapsed, and the enemy had not invaded, though the new American president had started sounding more and more belligerent toward Cuba.",

    "target_paragraph": "December 31\nWhen I awoke on the last day of 2016, the wind was strong and the air was cold. I could hear whistling coming from the rigging of other boats in the marina, and the trees on the shore were swaying in the wind. I had been wanting to try out my “storm/working jib” in strong winds and as I drank my coffee I decided to give it a go. I got the small sail out and hanked it to the headstay, led the jib-sheets through the jib-cars and tied them to its clew, attached the halyards, secured the jacklines, put a reef in the mainsail, and started the engine. While the engine warmed up, I put on my lifejacket/harness, gloves, and a warm hat. I was also wearing my very warm red sailing jacket and a black hat. Before pulling away, I attached my GoPro video camera to the stern pulpit with two hose-clamps so I could video the action.\nAs we pulled out of the relative calmness of the marina and into the choppy water of the bay, I heard the VHF radio say “this is the United States Coast Guard.” But then the radio abruptly died. The battery in the handheld VHF that I kept in the cockpit when I sailed had not been charged. Earlier I heard on the weather-radio channel that there was a small craft advisory today. I wondered if the Coast Guard was calling to warn me not to go out. The wind was cold and strong, the sky was grey, and there were no other boats out on the water. I hoped I was not making a bad mistake.\nI hoisted the sails and steered us onto a close reach. We accelerated, Sobrius heeled over, and spray flew off the bow with each little wave we crossed. I was taking video as I tied off the tiller, climbed up onto the coachroof and carefully walked to the mast. The jib-halyard needed tightening, and Sobrius charged ahead at full speed while I rode her like a surfboard and used the winch to trim the sail.\nThese were the heaviest conditions in which I had yet sailed. The wind was blowing 20-25 knots with gusts at “near gale” according to the report from National Weather Service which I heard on the VHF radio earlier that morning.\nWith one reef in the mainsail and the small headsail that the previous owner referred to as a storm jib, we heeled considerably on a close reach, with the leeward rail at the waterline. This sail has a luff of only 25’ 6” and a foot of 11’ 5”, but I felt like I probably had too much sail up while we beat into the wind at 6 knots. However, sailing downwind was fine and we slid across the water at 7-8 knots, faster than the theoretical hull speed, which is about 6.5 knots. It was dramatic how the perceived conditions changed when I turned us downwind: no more spray, surfing the waves instead of charging into them, not heeling, sailing faster but feeling less motion.\nThe sail was absolutely thrilling and I took some good video, which I edited into one short video and posted on YouTube (Pauly Dangerous and Sobrius, a 1972 Dufour Arpege, Sailing in Near-Gale Conditions on Tampa Bay https://youtu.be/dhoT6kY0KAw ). Sobrius performed well, my foul-weather gear performed well, and the camera performed well. I suppose I did too. However, the cacophony coming from below-deck made me realize that I need to better secure things down there when I sail.\nSinglehand miles: 202",

Haldane, in his classic work on the subject, The Drove Roads of Scotland (1952), describes how during the Second World War, intrigued by ‘a lonely grass-grown track crossing the hills’ behind his home in Perthshire, he became drawn into the history of the droving centuries. He determined to map the main drove-ways as best he could, even as they were disappearing, and set out to re-walk many of their routes, reading and pacing his way back into an understanding of the era. His book – though wary of nostalgia and rigorous in its historiography – has a finely managed tinge of elegy to it. In his account the drovers, while resilient in the face of hardship, were by no means impervious to beauty. They relished – some of them at least – what he called a ‘love of movement and adventure’, and they left behind them the landmarks of a fascinating age:",

Check my hands: not a trace of blood. No longer do I feel so isolated from the sparse and furtive life around me, a stranger from another world. I have entered into this one. We are kindred all of us, killer and victim, predator and prey, me and the sly coyote, the soaring buzzard, the elegant gopher snake, the trembling cottontail, the foul worms that feed on our entrails, all of them, all of us.

After the morning news, there was my friend Bourebonne-san, providing his snappy, tongue-in-cheek commentary about the day’s events. Prime time took us to Haruna Ai, dancing and chatting and giggling away. On the nights when I was coughing so hard I thought I’d vomit, I’d while away my insomnia by watching the delightfully hammy sprite KABA.Chan, who told me about the best handbags, vacuum cleaners, portable GPS devices and slimming tights Japan’s premier home-shopping program had to offer. From Japan’s helmet-haired transgender make-up artist Ikko to gay aerobics instructor Chris Matsumura (think Japan’s answer to Richard Simmons), no one ever needed to have a boring straight moment with Japanese television: it was just one big, exploding rainbow poof of colour!",

I stopped everything—moving, breathing, thinking—and stood on tiptoe peering into the leafy void. The noise came again, nearer. Whatever it was, it was coming my way! Whimpering quietly but sincerely, I ran a hundred yards, day pack bouncing, glasses jiggling, then turned, heart stopped, and looked back. A deer, a large buck, handsome and proud, stepped onto the path, gazed at me for a moment without concern, and sauntered on. I took a long moment to catch my breath, wiped a river of sweat from my brow, and felt profoundly discouraged.",

His eyes had “a tenderness that haunted one,” a friend recalled. His most conspicuous attribute, after 1917, was a vast, drooping mustache. Although his manner was affable and even sweet-natured, he was a bitter foe of the state. “Vanzetti was anarchism personified,” one associate said.",

The tall, ornate Tudor chimneys of the house stood out gauntly against a brightening sky, and as Stephen crept into the small herb garden, one tentative bird had already begun singing—but his voice was still rather husky from sleep. She stood there and shivered in her heavy coat; the long night of vigil had devitalized her. She was sometimes like this now—she would shiver at the least provocation, the least sign of fatigue, for her splendid physical strength was giving, worn out by its own insistence.\nShe dragged the coat more closely around her, and stared at the house which was reddening with sunrise. Her heart beat anxiously, fearfully even, as though in some painful anticipation of she knew not what—every window was dark except one or two that were fired by the sunrise. How long she stood there she never knew, it might have been moments, it might have been a life-time; and then suddenly there was something that moved—the little oak door that led into that garden. It moved cautiously, opening inch by inch, until at last it was standing wide open, and Stephen saw a man and a woman who turned to clasp as though neither of them could endure to be parted from the arms of the other; and as they clung there together and kissed, they swayed unsteadily—drunk with loving.\nThen, as sometimes happens in moments of great anguish, Stephen could only remember the grotesque. She could only remember a plump-bosomed housemaid in the arms of a coarsely amorous footman, and she laughed and she laughed like a creature demented—laughed and laughed until she must gasp for breath and spit blood from, her tongue, which had somehow got bitten in her efforts to stop her hysterical laughing; and some of the blood remained on her chin, jerked there by that agonized laughter.\nPale as death, Roger Antrim stared out into the garden, and his tiny moustache looked quite black—like an ink stain smeared above his tremulous mouth by some careless schoolboy finger.\nAnd now Angela’s voice came to Stephen, but faintly. She was saying something—what was she saying? It soundly absurdly as though it were a prayer—’ Christ!’ Then sharply—razor-sharp it sounded as it cut through the air: ‘You, Stephen!’\nThe laughter died abruptly away, as Stephen turned and walked out of the garden and down the short drive that led to the gates of the Grange, where the motor was waiting. Her face was a mask, quite without expression. She moved stiffly, yet with a curious precision; and she swung up the handle and started the powerful engine without any apparent effort.\nShe drove at great speed but with accurate judgment, for now her mind felt as clear as spring water, and yet there were strange little gaps in her mind—she had not the least idea where she was going. Every road for miles around Upton was familiar, yet she had not the least idea where she was going. Nor did she know how long she drove, nor when she stopped to procure fresh petrol. The sun rose high and hot in the heavens; it beat down on her without warming her coldness, for always she had the sense of a dead thing that lay close against her heart and oppressed it. A corpse—she was carrying a corpse about with her. Was it the corpse of her love for Angela? If so that love was more terrible dead—oh, far more terrible dead than living.\nThe first stars were shining, but as yet very faintly, when she found herself driving through the gates of Morton. Heard Puddle’s voice calling: ‘Wait a minute. Stop. Stephen!’ Saw Puddle barring her way in the drive, a tiny yet dauntless figure.\nShe pulled up with a jerk: ‘What’s the matter What is it?’ ‘Where have you been?’\n‘I—don’t know, Puddle.’\nBut Puddle had clambered in beside her: ‘Listen, Stephen,’ and now she was talking very fast, ‘listen, Stephen—is it—is it Angela Crossby It is. I can see the thing in your face. My God, what’s that woman done to you, Stephen?’\nThen Stephen, in spite of the corpse against her heart, or perhaps because of it, defended the woman: ‘She’s done nothing at all—it was all my fault, but you wouldn’t understand—I got very angry and then I laughed and couldn’t stop laughing—’ Steady, go steady! She was telling too much: ‘No—it wasn’t that exactly. Oh, you know my vile temper, it always goes off at half cock for nothing. Well, then I just drove round and round the country until I cooled down. I’m sorry, Puddle, I ought to have rung up, of course you’ve been anxious.’\nPuddle gripped her arm: ‘Stephen, listen, it’s your mother—she thinks that you started quite early for Worcester, I lied—I’ve been nearly distracted, child. If you hadn’t come soon, I’d have had to tell her that I didn’t know where you were. You must never, never go off without a word like this again—But I do understand, oh, I do indeed, Stephen.’\nBut Stephen shook her head: ‘No, my dear, you couldn’t—and I’d rather not tell you, Puddle.’\n‘Some day you must tell me,’ said Puddle, ‘because—well, because I do understand, Stephen.’",

All signs indicated that the throngs did not depart the previous day with the phantom boaters. The chain link fence at the entrance was padlocked. As we passed the full service chandlery I noticed it too was padlocked, shelves empty apart from a modest layer of dust. The duty free shop sat locked and empty; Customs/Immigration, empty. We were escorted into the marina office where a card table occupied one corner of a bare room with three badly worn folding chairs keeping it company. A rude bookshelf of rough lumber bolted to a wall served as a repository for a modest selection of tattered cruising guides, local tourist propaganda and a VHF radio drumming out hurricane scares from Miami.",

At noon there came a knock on our door and in walked Huamán, a tall, lean, dark-skinned gentleman, elegantly dressed with close-cropped silver hair. We’d met him earlier, in the Mercado, where he denounced the conquistadores – and everyone and everything Spanish – in a voice crackling with rage, as though Pizarro & Co. had just arrived in Jauja. He’s as odd as two left feet and became feverishly excited on discovering that I’m a writer; he wants me to write a book about his obsession. He claims to be a pure Huanca Indian whose family have been locally prominent since the 15th century and his message is that Peru’s prosperity can only be restored by transferring the capital back to Jauja. Seizing one of our maps, he pointed out that Jauja is as near to the centre of Peru as anywhere could be in such an irregularly shaped country. Like many of his compatriots, he takes an almost mystical pride in his own region but feels no national pride. (To me an understandable sentiment, and one to be much encouraged, globally, for the sake of mankind’s survival.) He claims that Futbol was invented in the Jauja valley, where his ancestors wrapped their enemies’ skulls in their enemies’ skins and kicked them around on cold evenings to keep warm. In pre-Inca times, he said, the peoples of Jauja and Huancayo were more often than not at war, but resentment of Inca domination united them and they have been allies ever since. In 1948 they co-operated to build an airport – men, women and children voluntarily working together, without pay, to improve the region’s communications.",

I heard the crest of the wave hissing and churning, and then my board was lifted and flung forward. I scarcely knew what happened the first half- minute. Though I kept my eyes open, I could not see anything, for I was buried in the rushing white of the crest. But I did not mind. I was chiefly conscious of ecstatic bliss at having caught the wave. At the end, of the half-minute, however, I began to see things, and to breathe. I saw that three feet of the nose of my board was clear out of water and riding on the air. I shifted my weight forward, and made the nose come down. Then I lay, quite at rest in the midst of the wild movement, and watched the shore and the bathers on the beach grow distinct. I didn't cover quite a quarter of a mile on that wave, because, to prevent the board from diving, I shifted my weight back, but shifted it too far and fell down the rear slope of the wave.",

    "target_paragraph": "The Deacon Bessarion, breathless from his run down the steps, helped the abbot secure the luggage and supplies to the hook, unsaddled the mare, and led her off to the stable on the flank of the opposing rock, joining us then in the long climb. The staircase twisted back on itself again and again under the overshadowing rock from which it had been hollowed and brought us at last, panting and tired, to a heavy iron doorway. This opened, through a hole, into a dark stepped grotto through the heart of the rock. We rose at last into a courtyard of the monastery that was only divided from the gulf by a low stone wall. A spacious loggia, paved with square black and white slabs, lay at the top of another short ascent, built out at a recent date from the Byzantine brickwork of the monastery. A cypress tree, stooping in the wind, miraculously flourished there. The tiles and the cupolas of the church in the light of the moon, the patina and disorder of the monastic buildings looked domestic and human after the chaos of rock through which we had come up. Turning round, the abbot—a portentous figure on the top step, with his beard and his robes blown sideways in the sudden tramontana—opened his hands in an ample gesture of welcome. Then, leaning over the rail of a penthouse which shook with every gust of wind while Father Bessarion toiled at the windlass, we watched the burdened hook ascending. The luggage, the saddle and the demijohn were safely unloaded on the planks. Leading us into the chapel, the abbot lit a taper at the sanctuary lamp and the gold and silver of the iconostasis and the innumerable haloes of frescoed saints twinkled among the shadows. Making the sign of the cross and kissing the main ikons, the abbot and Father Bessarion retired. We followed them out into the moonlit yard. There was nobody about and no lights in the windows. The buildings appeared aloof and spellbound.",

Sometimes, on a cold still night in winter, the sky had the peculiarly frosty clarity that comes from a still, biting cold. Above the great vertical radiance and cold Northern passion of New York, it was a-glitter with small pollens, with a jewelled dust of stars that seemed to have been sown drunkenly through heaven, and as Eugene looked his weariness was cleansed out of him at once, he was filled with an overwhelming desire to possess beauty and all things else, and to include all things in him. He would learn to be all things: he would be an artist and he would find a way of living in the maelstrom. The darkness filled him with a sense of power and possession: his spirit soared out over the city, and over the earth, he was no longer afraid of the grey-faced Jew beside him, peace and power and certitude possessed him. He drank the air into his veins in great gulps, he saw the huge walled cliff of the city ablaze with its jewellery of hard sown lights, he knew he could possess it all, and a feeling of joy and victory rushed through his senses.",

That barefoot walk is founded upon the conviction that mortification of the sole leads to amelioration of the soul. This is barefootedness as penance, maceration, test: the stones cut the pilgrims’ feet so badly that blood oozes up between their toes and stains the path.",
