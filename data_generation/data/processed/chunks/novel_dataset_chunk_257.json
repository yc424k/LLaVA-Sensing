That was a smell of air and rain and turf and corduroy. But they were very holy peasants. They breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as they prayed. They lived in Clane, a fellow said: there were little cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the halfdoor of a cottage with a child in her arms as the cars had come past from Sallins. It would be lovely to sleep for one night in that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the dark lit by the fire, in the warm dark, breathing the smell of the peasants, air and rain and turf and corduroy. But, O, the road there between the trees was dark! You would be lost in the dark. It made him afraid to think of how it was.\nHe heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last prayer. He prayed it too against the dark outside under the trees.\nVisit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and drive away from it all the snares of the enemy. May Thy holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace and may Thy blessing be always upon us through Christ, Our Lord. Amen.",

Depending on the time of year, it would not be uncommon for a plant with edible roots to have poisonous seeds. If a species does produce alkaloids, as fall approaches, the seeds are where the toxin is most likely to be found.”",

After protests against the wearing of furs began picking up speed, owning furs (at least in America and Europe) lost some of its glamour and took on a slightly unsavory, clandestine quality. Nowadays you almost never see a celebrity wearing a fur in a photograph. Mary Tyler Moore, an anti-fur celebrity best known for her TV sitcoms, donated a brand-new, $112,000 coat of Russian sable to PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. PETA then bedecked the coat with animal traps, electrocution devices, and other equipment of the fur processing business in order to make a point outside a show of fashions of Arnold Scaasi, a designer who sometimes worked in fur.",

On Route 13 I overtook all other cyclists, including a young man on a racing bicycle; the Lao are notable for strength and stamina rather than speed.

Abbesses, principals, head mistresses, dignitaries, in the republic of women—without being brilliant, any of them, they were that. She penetrated a little farther in the direction of St Paul’s. She liked the geniality, sisterhood, motherhood, brotherhood of this uproar. It seemed to her good. The noise was tremendous; and suddenly there were trumpets (the unemployed) blaring, rattling about in the uproar; military music; as if people were marching; yet had they been dying—had some woman breathed her last, and whoever was watching, opening the window of the room where she had just brought off that act of supreme dignity, looked down on Fleet Street, that uproar, that military music would have come triumphing up to him, consolatory, indifferent.",

This morning the tape was set but it was losing its grip due to the morning dew. Fortunately, most of it held. I dried it off, but the condensation just kept coming. I was anxious to paint the deck and have Sobrius looking sharp because my father was going to visit on the 30th. I waited until the sun rose up over the surrounding boats and evaporated the rest of the condensation, then I began painting the deck.\nFirst I scooped out globs of the thick grey paint and spread it with a notched trowel, one that I used for setting tile, and then I rolled it out with the special roller that came with the paint. I did one section at a time, and backrolled the previous section after rolling out each new section. The Kiwigrip stands up and forms spikes when it is backrolled, which is what gives it its grip. I rolled each section a third time after the job was finished, and finally I removed the tape before the paint was dry. I waited 7 hours, as the instructions on the paint-can dictated, before returning to Sobrius and carefully walking on the surface. I was very pleased with the results, both visually and practically. I haven’t slipped on deck yet.\nWhile out, I visited West Marine and purchased charts for Florida’s east Coast and the Keys. I bought another chart book for The Bahamas. I also went to the airport for a meeting with Customs and Border Patrol, where I registered with the Small Vessel Registration Service.\nThis way I will not have to go through customs when I return from a foreign country on Sobrius. I need only to make a phone call to check back in.",

Figuring that no amount of protest would return that bag until we parted, I swallowed a tirade and accepted the chivalry.

The village was lifeless—the shuttered and silent gin and blacksmith shop, the weathered store; the motionless horse alone postulating life and that not because it moved but because it resembled something known to be alive. But they would be inside the store. He could see them—the heavy shoes and boots, the overalls and jumper coats bulging over the massed indiscriminate garments beneath—planted about the box of pocked sand in which the stove, squatting, radiated the strong good heat which had an actual smell, masculine, almost monastic—a winter’s concentration of unwomaned and deliberate tobacco-spittle annealing into the iron flanks. The good heat: he would enter it, not out of the bleak barren cold but out of life, mounting steps and walking through a door and out of living. The horse raised its head and looked at him as he passed it. But not you, he said to it. You’ve got to stand outside, stand here and remain intact for the blood to contrive to run through. I dont. He mounted the steps, crossing the heel-gnawed planks of the gallery. On the closed door was tacked a paper placard advertising a patent medicine, half defaced—the reproduction of a portrait, smug, bearded, successful, living far away and married, with children, in a rich house and beyond the reach of passion and blood’s betrayal and not even needing to be dead to be embalmed with spaced tacks, ubiquitous and immortal in ten thousand fading and tattered effigies on ten thousand weathered and paintless doors and walls and fences in all the weathers of rain and ice and summer’s harsh heat, about the land.",

(On other days I have complained when we make camp after dark instead of arriving in good light, in time to wash; the poor man must think I have gone crazy.) But at twilight it was plain that we would not make the huts at Muni, at the far end of Zuwa Gorge, which narrowed and grew dark as we went along: the island, reached by a fallen tree, was a last refuge.",

According to the Times report, the storm had covered parts of the region with “more than two inches of snow” and created “drifts up to six inches high.” In response to this, I did something I had never done before: I pulled out my notebook and drafted a letter to the editor in which I pointed out, in a kindly, helpful way, that two inches of snow cannot possibly constitute a blizzard and that six inches of snow is not a drift. A blizzard, I explained, is when you can’t get your front door open. Drifts are things that make you lose your car till spring. Cold weather is when you leave part of your flesh on doorknobs, mailbox handles, and other metal objects. And then I crumpled the letter up because I realized I was in serious danger of turning into one of the Colonel Blimp types who sat around me in considerable numbers, eating cornflakes or porridge with their blimpish wives, and without whom hotels like the Old England would not be able to survive.",

On the other hand, when we got out on the lagoon and were struck by another heavy wind-squall, the cutter became liliputian, while the Snark, in our imagination, seemed to promise all the stability and permanence of a continent. They were good boatmen. Tehei and Bihaura had come along to see us home, and the latter proved a good boatwoman herself. The cutter was well ballasted, and we met the squall under full sail. It was getting dark, the lagoon was full of coral patches, and we were carrying on. In the height of the squall we had to go about, in order to make a short leg to windward to pass around a patch of coral no more than a foot under the surface. As the cutter filled on the other tack, and while she was in that \"dead\" condition that precedes gathering way, she was knocked flat. Jib-sheet and main-sheet were let go, and she righted into the wind. Three times she was knocked down, and three times the sheets were flung loose, before she could get away on that tack.",

It was certainly not the sort of place one would wish to spend four days. There was a blacksmith, a cay shop, a man selling watermelons, another selling bread, a few labourers gawping at the Pakistanis and doing nothing in particular, a post office, a school, a hotel, a line of ragged poplars and on them a few blaring loudspeakers. From these issued stirring military ditties and what sounded like news reports. Few were listening to the music and none was able to understand the news.

Every day since I arrived the sky has suddenly clouded over during the afternoon and an hour or so later we get a magnificent thunderstorm, with bigger hailstones and heavier rain than I’ve ever seen before: even in India during the monsoon we had nothing quite like it. This is a very satisfactory arrangement, as the rain lays the dust – if only briefly – and slightly lessens the stink by washing away some of the excrement and rotting garbage that accumulates on the streets. Half an hour ago I stopped writing to revel in a truly classic thunderstorm. The first crash made my ashtray leap off the table and literally deafened me, so I blew out the candles and sat at the open window to enjoy the display. Overhead it was as though some mischievous god were switching on and off a brilliant blue electric light which revealed every detail of the garden and neighbouring house. Then the sheet lightning stopped and instead the sky seemed alive with writhing dragons of flame flashing from horizon to horizon, while the thunder roared continuously from mountain to mountain like a million lions – and then the rain came and gradually the storm subsided. I must be getting more and more animistic: this is the sort of thing that now awakens my religious fervour.",

He had long hair, his eyes were deep and sombre, and he wore a cape; he was a poet, and there was magic and mystery in his touch, for he had heard the horns of Elfland faintly blowing. And by the waters of life, by time, by time, Lord Tennyson stood among the cold, grey rocks, and commanded the sea to break – break – break! And the sea broke, by the waters of life, by time, by time, as Lord Tennyson commanded it to do, and his heart was sad and lonely as he watched the stately ships (of the Hamburg-American Packet Company, fares forty-five dollars and up, first-class) go on to their haven under the hill, and Lord Tennyson would that his heart could utter the thoughts that arose in him.",

We strode along in a haze of thin dust. The giant mesquite dwindled until it scarcely reached to our knees. To the right the tall hill and the chimneys of the town swam tranquilly in the hot sun; rifle fire had almost ceased for the moment, and only dazzling bursts of thick white smoke marked our occasional shells along the ridge. We could see our drab guns rocking down the plain, spreading along the first line of alamos, where the searching fingers of the enemy’s shrapnel probed continually. Little bodies of horsemen moved here and there over the desert, and stragglers on foot, trailing their rifles.",

Our skiff scudded over the water as we left the narrow neck of shoreline behind at Tasajeras. The wetland expanded in every direction. At full throttle, our small party was soon skating over a mirror of glass, with only a distant fringe of mangroves to suggest the presence of horizons and the mundane separation of earth from sky. The faint silhouette of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta hovered not thirty miles to the east. As the sun melts the ice on those frozen summits, glacial streams from those heights grow into seasonal rivers—the Fundación, Tucurinca, Aracataca, and Riofrío—that replenish the wetland with fresh water and, more essentially, according to the mamos, infuse it with aluna, the generative essence of the Madre Creadora, the Great Mother. Running away from the ciénaga to the south and west are natural canals that ultimately fuse with the floodwaters of the Río Magdalena. Like the arteries and veins in the human body, a network of waterways reaches across the ancient delta to connect the snowfields of the Sierra Nevada, the most sacred destination of the pilgrims, with the river that made possible the life of the Colombian nation.",

    "target_paragraph": "What I wanted, though, was the weather forecast for tomorrow, and this cute facsimile with its jumpy typography was no use to me at all.\nI thought that all American hotel rooms had television; this one apparently refused to acknowledge that the instrument had been invented yet. There was a telephone of sorts, though. I unhooked the trumpet-shaped earpiece from its fluted stand, fearing that all I’d hear would be the cracked recorded voice of Rutherford Hayes or Mark Twain. But a girl’s voice came through, singing, “Hi, there!” a century out of sync with the apparatus we were using.\n“Is there a TV anywhere in the hotel? I want to see a weather forecast.”\n“You’ll find one in your room, sir.” She made it sound as if this were a cozy game of Hide and Seek that the hotel usually organized for its customers.\n“Where?”\n“You just try that old wardrobe right across from where you’re sitting, sir.” She must have been the queen tease of Red Wing High; I imagined her in frilly pants and fishnet tights, twirling a drum majorette’s baton.\nI tried the wardrobe, a handsome reproduction piece of pine Colonial. The drawers, when I pulled at them, turned out to be doors, and opened on an enormous color television. I found my weather report. Nothing does so much justice to the gargantuan scale of American life as its national weather maps. In Europe, one is allowed to see the weather only as scraps and fragments: a cake slice of a depression here; a banded triangle of a ridge of high pressure there. In the United States, every morning and evening, I was enthralled by the epic sweep of whole weather systems as they rolled across the country from the Pacific to the Atlantic, or coasted down from the Arctic Circle, or swirled up from Mexico and Cuba. The weathermen tapped their maps with sticks. Without betraying the slightest flicker of wonder or concern, they announced that people were being frozen to death in Butte, roasted in Flagstaff and blown off their feet in Tallahassee. Each day they rattled off every conceivable variety of climatic extremity in a blasé drawl. I’d never seen so much weather at once, and was deeply impressed. I shivered vicariously for the Montanans, sweated for the Arizonans and ran for shelter with the Floridians.\nTonight, though, Minnesota was the one place in the nation with really boring weather. Our local man from Minneapolis foretold moderate humidity, low precipitation and winds from the south at ten to twelve miles an hour. By American standards, he might reasonably have asserted that for the next day we would have no weather at all.\nI closed the false drawers on the TV. I peered down at Main Street through the dinky white plywood shutters on my bedroom window.\nThere was nothing going on. I tried to distract myself with the St. James Journal:\nEVEN UP.—Last Monday evening, after concluding his day’s labor on the bench, Judge Crosby repaired to the basement of the St. James hotel for a bath. After concluding his ablutions he enquired of the sable proprietor, Charley Fogg, what the damage was. Said Charley: “Judge, dis is the first time I has had ob getting eben with you, and guess I’ll hab to charge you about seventy-five dollars.” His honor pondered a moment, and then said: “Do I know you? Have I ever met you before?” “I tink you hab,” said Charley. “You sent me up once for three months.” Honors were easy.",

One is to Rodel, down the road, where I continue my circumnavigation of Roineabhal, coming to an abbreviated end at St Clement’s Church. St Clement’s is a medieval church, built sometime in the 15th or 16th century. It is quite unexpected, here on the promontory overlooking Skye. One description of it is as an “ecclesiastical jewel.” This it is. Three medieval carvings have been used in the 1784 reconstruction of the church, one with a human face looking down on me as I walk around the cemetery finding tombs of various Macleods. It is the Macleods of Dunvegan who built the original church and Captain Alexander Macleod of Harris who had it rebuilt. The interior is intimate with carvings, remains of a medieval cross, and a tomb. Since many of the Macleod clan chiefs were buried on Iona, speculation is that the church had an Ionian connection as well with some taking it further and alleging an original church with connections to St Columba. Having been to Iona, I think this is not a stretch. The church has that kind of feel. But all is guesswork because of fires, rebuilding, decay, rebuilding, and the final result which is, I think, glorious. The stairway to the top of the church tower is so narrow, dark, and claustrophobic that I do not take the first step. Outside, I do climb up to the highest point there, look over the waves to the west and see…St Kilda. My first glimpse. It looks remote, wild, and far away. I am mightily excited.",

In good weather, the mail plane arrives three times a week. But Earl Stout likes to gather mail in weekly units. “What’s the use of getting it,” he explains, “before it’s all in?” Saturday nights, he used to play pool at the Central store—stick in hand, cigar in mouth, brandy on the cushion. “That was until the old Chevy went out. Now I stay home. All the years I was on the Yukon, there was no place to go. The nearest person was five miles away. You got to get used to staying home.” He sorely misses Bob. A black, short-haired mongrel, Bob was for many years Earl’s only companion. Five wolves running on the creek overtook Bob not long ago. They left his collar and a small piece of his tail. After finding the blood and the fragments, Earl drank a bottle of rum. It is 3:45 P.M. He gets up and pulls denim overalls over his trousers. He ties strings around the ankles. He puts on mittens and a wool cap, and he says, “I can’t take the cold the way I used to.” The air outside is ten below zero. I make a move to leave. “You don’t have to go,” he says. “It isn’t time yet. There’s still ten minutes.” He waits until the clocks say four. “Now,” he says, “it’s time to go.”",

But it was agreed that the colder temperatures may have eased the flow of the river that had stopped McKinlay and Chafe, so perhaps he might make it.
