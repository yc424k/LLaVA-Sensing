The two-roomed concrete hovel – the centre one of three – was entered through a communal yard of extreme squalor bounded by a few matoke plants. Inside all was clean and neat but very cramped. The spectacularly beautiful tortoiseshell cat reclining on a small settee graciously permitted me to stroke him but didn’t move to give the visitor more space – a thoroughly spoiled cat, I know the symptoms. In each corner stood stacks of video and hi-fi equipment and thousands of tapes. Tanzania is one of those few blessed lands still without television, or it was then – perhaps by now it has been infected. Family photographs and mass-produced pious pictures (made in Italy: to be found in Catholic homes on every continent) covered the walls. Most conspicuous was an elaborately framed ‘Special Papal Blessing’ given to Mumfi personally by His Holiness John Paul II on the occasion of his visit to Uganda and allegedly signed by the Pope. What sort of racket is this?",

There must be something I had done, I thought, on which they could have me up; there were any number of irregularities of which I could be accused. The previous day, crossing a small lake in the countryside on a rowboat, I had come to a routine customs check—a little shack in the empty place—and the officers had taken away my passport. So now I was even less official, my formal identity taken away from me.",

I sat on a slab, feeling chilled, and realised that never before had I met undisguised anti-Semitism. It frightened me – and gave me a new understanding of the Israelis’ fear. Despite my never having met another Palestinian who spoke thus, Hussein was certainly not unique. Do I lead an unduly sheltered life? Walking on, I began to feel foolish, to accuse myself of over-reacting. Hussein’s sentiment, however upsetting, shouldn’t have even slightly surprised me. In the Holy Land Zionism has sown and continues to fertilise the seeds of hatred – as so many Israelis, including Shin Bet’s Avrham Shalom, readily admit. But it did alarm me to think of Mein Kampf still being available in Arabic. All my long-repressed authoritarian instincts came swarming to the surface.

So after devouring hastily the remains of the five chickens we had brought from Umm Ruweik, flavoured by stalks of wild onions that ’Awād had found in the lava, we set off homewards. We just accomplished the ride of 4¾ hours in time, that is we saw the smoke of the camp fires before night fell, and got our direction thereby. A series of spaces cleared of stones led us to the camp. These open places are the marāh (tent marks) of the ’Anazeh, who used to camp in the Safa before the Druzes established themselves in the Mountain over a hundred years ago. The marāh, therefore, have remained visible after at least a century, and will remain, probably, or many centuries more. There was a strong cold wind that evening, and the main wall of the tent had been shifted round to shelter us the better; but for all that we passed a comfortless night, and the cold woke me several times to an uneasy sense of having fallen asleep on an ant hill. How the Arabs contrive to collect so many fleas among so few possessions an insoluble mystery. There was hardly a suitable place for them to lodge in, except the tent walls themselves, and when those walls are taken down they must show skill and agility beyond the common wont of fleas in order to get themselves packed up and carried off to the next camping ground, but that they are equal to the task every one knows who has spent a night in a house of hair. After two nights with the Ghiāth our own tents seemed a paradise of luxury when we returned to them the next afternoon, and a bath the utmost height to which a Sybaritic life could attain, even when taken in a temperature some degrees below freezing point.",

    "target_paragraph": "This fresh attitude to altitude was a radical change of heart, and one which made itself felt in almost every cultural sphere, from literature to architecture to horticulture. In the early part of the century the so-called ‘hill poem’ established itself as a popular minor genre, in which the poet – much as Petrarch had done four centuries earlier – would describe first the physical act of walking up a hill, and then the cogitations that the view from the summit evoked in him. The hilltop, with the broadening of vision that it offered, also became attractive for leisure-seekers. Viewpoints and viewing stations were formalized and institutionalized across Europe, including ones at Etna, Vesuvius and Naples. Here were places where your eye could traverse pleasingly between different orders of life: where events, objects and existences which were usually dispersed in space and time could be experienced simultaneously and at a single glance. Altitude made possible the panorama: the Greek word for ‘all-sight’ or ‘all-embracing view’. From an Alpine mountain-top, wrote the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner, one might observe on a single day the four seasons of the year. The great seventeenth-century French traveller Maximilien Misson noted that from the rough stone balconies of the Chartreuse St Martin, perched high above Naples, a spectator could survey the outline of the city itself – its harbour, breakwater, lighthouse and castles – then move southwards down the coast, over the scalloped coastline with its white rocks, and then northwards, to the black bulk of Vesuvius, with thick lines of smoke coiling upwards out of its crater like fakirs’ ropes.",

The lake below lapped and dazzled. She plucked up courage and said to her father: ‘Father…‘He looked up very kindly over his spectacles.

She rose and crossed to the washing-table. What would Nell think of this, she thought, tilting up the beautifully polished brass jug and dipping her hands in the hot water. Another bell tolled. She crossed to the dressing-table. The air from the garden outside was full of murmurings and cooings. Wood shavings, she said as she took up her brush and comb – he had wood shavings in his hair. A servant passed with a pile of tin dishes on his head. The pigeons were cooing Take two coos, Taffy. Take two coos… But there was the dinner bell. In a moment she had pinned her hair up, hooked her dress on, and ran down the slippery stairs, sliding her palm along the banisters as she used to do when she was a child in a hurry.

As I didn’t know how to drive a manual, I offered to carry the parcel up so she could move the car in case a traffic cop were to pass, but she wanted to do it. I was to remain there and tell the officer she’d be right back. No problem—she told me to say that I wasn’t able to walk very far due to my bunions. I had recently traded in my narrower, more stylish Italian-made footwear that I had purchased in Siderno for a pair of heavy, square-toed shoes.

Whilst she sorrowed she cheered with her voice, and what was stranger than that the strong should need encouragement from the weak was that cheerfulness should be so well simulated by such utter dejection. Her friend moved forward slowly, and she with small mincing steps moved forward beside him, half her weight being thrown upon the animal. Sometimes she sank as she had sunk from walking erect, from the crutches, from the rails. The dog, who now thoroughly understood her desire and her incapacity, was frantic in his distress on these occasions: he would tug at her dress and run forward. She always called him back, and it was now to be observed that the woman listened for human sounds only to avoid them. It was evident that she had an object in keeping her presence on the road and her forlorn state unknown.",

Near a large body of water, an open meadow, or above tree line where the view is unobstructed, geology’s alchemy is evident. Eras ago, through compression and uplift and carving, dirt and rock, water and ice turned into mountains. And since then, over centuries, the process reverses. A hard rain, hot summer sun, the freeze and thaw of the darkest days. A forest fire, the warming Arctic’s winds. Mountains revert again to dirt and rock, water and ice.",

The horse bore him away, and the very step of the animal seemed significant of dogged despair. Gabriel, for a minute, rose above his own grief in noticing Boldwood’s. He saw the square figure sitting erect upon the horse, the head turned to neither side, the elbows steady by the hips, the brim of the hat level and undisturbed in its onward glide, until the keen edges of Boldwood’s figure sank by degrees over the hill. To one who knew the man and his story there was something more striking in this immobility than in a collapse. The clash of discord between mood and matter here was forced painfully home to the heart; and, as in laughter there are more dreadful phases than in tears, so was there in the steadiness of this troubled man an expression deeper than a cry.",

To emerge from the bustling, subterranean bowels of Waverley Station and find yourself in the very heart of such a glorious city is a happy experience indeed. I hadn’t been to Edinburgh for years and had forgotten just how captivating it can be. Every monument was lit with golden floodlights—the castle and the Bank of Scotland headquarters on the hill, the Balmoral Hotel and the Sir Walter Scott Monument down below—which gave them a certain eerie grandeur. The city was abustle with end-of-day activity. Buses swept through Princes Street and shop and office workers scurried along the sidewalks, hastening home to have their haggis and cock-a-leekie soup and indulge in a few skirls or whatever it is Scots do when the sun goes down.",

Admittedly this specimen was only twenty feet long – but it did look terrifyingly insecure, being casually held in place at either side by little piles of loose rocks, while its width could barely accommodate a single human foot. After one glance I funked it completely. Forty feet below the water was churning violently through a boulder-filled channel and even my trick of crossing such bridges à cheval seemed inadvisable. Merely to see Mingmar tripping lightly over almost made me ill and when he returned to take my knapsack I also handed him my shirt, shorts and shoes, informing him that I was going upstream to find some point at which I could either wade or swim across. Then it was his turn to feel ill; he went quite pale and said ‘You’ll drown!’ ‘Very likely,’ I agreed. ‘Yet somehow I prefer drowning to falling off that unspeakable contraption you call a bridge.’",

His own dwelling resembled Mr Tang’s rather than Mr Thonglit’s; there were chairs and a table and glasses for the lau-lao provided by my host. Hot boiled water, herb-flavoured, was offered from a Chinese mega-thermos-flask. A map of the region, identical to mine, adorned one wall and my host pointed out various bandit bases between this valley and Luang Prabang. His wife – equally impressive, fluent in sign language – joined in the ‘conversation’, using pen and paper to convey how many had been murdered in the past year: thirty-four, including two children when a truck-bus was ambushed near Kasi. (The government consistently suppresses such statistics.) I could see where our conversation was leading; no way would this chief allow me to walk on. When I half-heartedly tried the ‘permit’ trick it merely amused him: he dismissed John Murray with a wave of the hand and a twinkle in the eye. Then he advised me to secrete my binoculars in my rucksack; their brown leather case might be mistaken for a gun holster and certain men could react negatively to an armed stranger. At which point I began to suspect the real identity of these ‘bandits’.",

It was extensively bombed during the war, which gave the city fathers a wonderful opportunity, enthusiastically seized, to rebuild most of it in concrete. It was only a little after six in the evening, but the city center was practically dead. I wandered around beneath gloomy street lights, looking in shop windows and reading those strange posters—bills, as they are known in the trade—for provincial newspapers that you always find in Britain. I have an odd fascination with these because they are always either wholly unfathomable to nonlocals (LETTER BOX RAPIST STRIKES AGAIN, BEULAH FLIES HOME) or so boring that you can’t imagine how anyone could possibly have thought they would boost sales (COUNCIL STORM OVER DUSTBINS CONTRACT, PHONE BOX VANDALS STRIKE AGAIN).

    "target_paragraph": "Accounts from the Spanish conquest, Juan noted, tell of soldiers taken in death by the Magdalena, swallowed by its currents, consumed by caimans. During the War of Independence, as General Hermógenes Maza moved on the vital commercial center of Mompox, he was told by his superiors to limit the bloodshed. On his way downriver, the general took sixty prisoners at Gamarra. Following his orders to the letter, he sewed them alive, three at a time, into large leather bags and dumped them into the river to drown, allowing him to write his commander that the deed had been done without a single drop of blood. When Maza took Mompox by surprise, in a predawn attack from the river, he summoned all prisoners to an efficient if brutal tribunal. As he sat in a deck chair on his riverboat, La Comandancia, he ordered every man to introduce himself by the name Francisco. If the captive pronounced the word with a soft lisping accent on the letter c, a certain sign of Spanish birth, he called out, “¡Al baño!” or “Bath time!” With that, the prisoner’s head would fall into the river, followed by his corpse. General Hermógenes Maza was perhaps the first to refer to the Río Magdalena as a “comfortable common grave.” Of the two hundred prisoners taken before him that day in Mompox, only one survived. To this day, fishermen along the length of the river speak of La Llorona, a beautiful woman reduced by her son’s death to a wandering cadaver, the embodiment of misery, condemned for all eternity to water the river with her tears, a symbol of all mothers who have lost sons to violence.",

    "target_paragraph": "The sun struggled through as I descended to river level; this mountain stream was almost iced over despite its speed. Here I was in hilly farmland – too hilly to have been ‘collectivised’. The several villages were long rows of sturdy one-storey dwellings, freshly painted in contrasting combinations of colours. The design of these homes – self-built of wood and stone, or wood and brick – showed endless variety and considerable imagination. Rumanian peasants are proud individualists, which partly explains Ceausescu’s compulsion to herd them all into soul- and mind-numbing blocs. In front of each house on my right, beyond the river, an old tree-trunk bridge spanned the water. Elegant wrought-iron gates led into tidy yards where – as in the fields between the villages – maize stalks were stooked and conical hay-ricks woven around tall poles. The doors and windows of barns and stables (some brand-new) were finely carved, as were the roofs protecting each family well. Every yard had vines trained over trellises; in summer these provide cool awnings beneath which to drink the wine from last year’s crop. Carefully pruned fruit trees – apple, plum, apricot, cherry, pear – flourished in gardens where enough vegetables could be grown to allow a surplus for bottling. There were however a few ominous new dwellings which suggested that a milder version of the Irish bungaloid blight could soon hit Transylvania.",

Their approach gave scale to the waves, which turned out to be less monstrous than I’d imagined. When Edwin quickly took off on a meaty left, it stood up about three times his height. The wave was mud brown and hungry-looking; I started snapping pictures. Edwin pulled into it well, but the wave suddenly lined up all the way to the pier, fifty yards north, closing out, and he was forced to straighten off. The whitewater exploded and engulfed him. A moment later, his board came cartwheeling out of the whitewater; his leash had snapped. The waves were breaking close to shore—there was no outside bar on the south side of the pier—and Edwin washed in quickly. He came chugging up the dunes, and he grinned when I told him that I’d got several shots of his ride. “It’s not too hairy out there, I don’t think,” he said. “Kind of closed out, maybe.” He wanted to borrow the leash from my board. I gladly gave it to him. The waves looked more than kind of closed out, and it was not getting any warmer—the air temperature was in the forties.",
