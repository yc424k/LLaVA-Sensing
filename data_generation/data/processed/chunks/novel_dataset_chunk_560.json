I knew its shape, the feel of it; I knew just how the streets would run, silent and straight, and then end up at the mountain.",

A metal grille had been pulled across the entranceway and secured with chains and a padlock. On a side wall, fairy lights hung around a Buddhist shrine threw a dim orange light around the room. The shop’s stools had been neatly stacked against the walls, and the tables had been pushed together into the centre to make a sleeping platform for the boys, who lay curled up against each other in a tangled pile of arms, legs and longyi. I recognized Kyaw Kyaw’s red-and-green-checked longyi and saw him lying with his head on another boy’s stomach and one leg dangling over the edge of the tables. The room was still and quiet except for the heavy sound of breathing and the occasional cockroach scuttling across the cement floor.",

Better Toby be banging on his drum than whatever else he would inevitably get up to since I doubt he ever sits still, either. Tosh runs around the hostel telling everyone “TOMORROW IS SUNDAY.” If you need anything, including food, get it now because you aren’t getting a blessed thing tomorrow with one exception. A rogue petrol station is open slightly north of town and evidently deals groceries. Do the Presbyterians tar and feather you if you go there?

In the Victoria Hotel bar sat a young Afrikaner couple from Jo’burg, also storm-bound. Hendrik runs a textile-printing business and is equally happy to take orders from the ANC, the AWB, APLA, the Nats. ‘I work fourteen hours a day, average,’ said he. ‘Now we gotta get off our backsides, face up to the new competition. I say Mandela’s right about affirmative action – why not? Those poor bastards, they’re waiting long enough for jobs. I’m no liberal, just a realist. We’re living already in the new South Africa. It’s not in the future and maybe something we can avoid. Plenty of my age think the same but you don’t hear about us, we’re not news.’",

I believe I may even have failed to notice them edging away when, emboldened by seven or eight glasses of Jupiler pils or the memorably named Donkle Beer, I would lean towards one of them and say in a quiet but friendly voice, ‘Je m’appelle Guillaume.

The statue can still be seen as you drive along the Meishin Expressway between Kyoto and Osaka. Once as I was driving past it with David Kidd, he remarked, ‘There is the ugliest thing ever made by the hands of man.’",

Inside was wide and spacious, signs were digitised and, above all, the carriages were air-conditioned. A yawning gentleman sat in a seat by the doorway, his topi at a jaunty angle, below a sign saying ‘Ladies-Only’. Another gentleman standing by the doors kept his balance by inserting one finger into a hole for the air conditioning, but the compartment was otherwise empty. Ten minutes into the ride, the train reached Rajendra Nagar and we jumped off, greeted with a hug of humidity on the platform.",

We work together as a well-oiled machine. But what we really do well is talk. We can talk for hours: about our daughter, about what it means to be a writer, about the state of the world. André Malraux wrote that a happy marriage is a long conversation that ends too soon. I just want it to go on and on.\nWhat time is it in New York? Can I call my husband? It is too early to Skype. And he probably won’t pick up anyway. Outside, the moon illumines the fields where the flowers and vegetables have all frozen on their stalks and vines.

It was anything but brave—letting herself drift into these continual meetings, and refusing to accept their consequences. Yet every nerve in her told her that these moments were the best thing in life, the one thing she couldn’t do without: just to be near him, to hear his cold voice, to say something to provoke his disenchanted laugh; or, better still, to walk by him as now without talking, with a furtive glance now and then at his profile, ironic, dissatisfied, defiant—yes, and so weak under the defiance . . .

I quickly got to my feet, pulled on my abbayah, and hurried to make my ablutions.\nReturning to the tent I prayed, this time (following the custom of the women surrounding me) I covered my ears. There were no catcalls of “Haram.” I was pleased. I was learning to be a better Muslim and perhaps, maybe because of my eagerness to improve, so too were others. As I sat counting off my “Alhumdullilahs,” my “Allah hu Akbars,” and my “Subhan'allahs,” a Saudi woman passing by corrected me, signaling me to keep count on my right hand, not my left, which in my distraction I had forgotten. This time I didn't take offense but accepted the corrections. This was part of Hajj, to be allowed to improve and develop one's skills of worship. I finished my prayer and readied myself for breakfast, which was already in progress.\nI noticed Randa walking in from her morning ablutions. As she wandered the tent, she dried her hair with sporadic rubs from her towel, leaving her damp red locks standing awry. She returned to her place in the tent and waved a friendly hello.\nAs I returned the greeting, I couldn't help noticing all eyes were on me. A line of teenage Saudi girls followed my every movement. In a silent row, still wrapped in their full-length scarves which they wore, as though mummified, while praying earlier in the morning, they tracked me with their dark eyes. Each smiled at me shyly. One bespectacled girl even called, “Salaam alaikum, Qanta!” I responded, unsure how she could know my name. Elsewhere, older Saudi matrons nodded to me in acknowledgment, showing signs of actual approval. Overnight, something had triggered a volte-face.\n“Salaams, Doctora Qanta!” Rashida sang, beaming even more than usual.\nRanda grinned, explaining. “We all heard about your midnight rounds, Qanta,” Randa called out, “Rashida told us. Everyone has been talking about it since early this morning! News travels fast. They are impressed you are a doctor!”",

The evening was cold, with ice in the wind. But the crowd surged on, back and forth, back and forth, slowly. At the tables were seated mostly men, taking coffee or vermouth or aqua vitae, all familiar and easy, without the modern self-consciousness. There was a certain pleasant, natural robustness of spirit, and something of a feudal free-and-easiness. Then arrived a family, with children, and nurse in her native costume. They all sat at table together, perfectly easy with one another, though the marvellous nurse seemed to be seated below the salt. She was bright as a poppy, in a rose-scarlet dress of fine cloth with a curious little waistcoat of emerald green and purple, and a bodice of soft, homespun linen with great full sleeves. On her head she had a rose-scarlet and white head-dress, and she wore great studs of gold filigree, and similar ear-rings. The feudal-bourgeois family drank its syrup-drinks and watched the crowd. Most remarkable is the complete absence of self-consciousness. They all have a perfect natural \"sangfroid\", the nurse in her marvellous native costume is as thoroughly at her ease as if she were in her own village street. She moves and speaks and calls to a passer-by without the slightest constraint, and much more, without the slightest presumption. She is below the invisible salt, the invisible but insuperable salt. And it strikes me the salt-barrier is a fine thing for both parties; they both remain natural and human on either side of it, instead of becoming devilish, scrambling and pushing at the barricade.",

I knew that if she wasn’t relearning how to walk, write, talk—live—that my mom and I could be building cabinets or quilting, or taking impromptu roadtrips. Yet, I also knew the past was not where I lived. I live here in these mountains now—finding myself yet again, becoming Anish more fully than when I was twenty-one.",

You have lost a leader whom you would have followed; and one of you has lost happiness and children. He is dead who would have given you that. He lies on a camp-bed, bandaged, in some hot Indian hospital while coolies squatted on the floor agitate those fans—I forget how they call them.* But this is important; “You are well out of it”, I said, while the doves descended over the roofs and my son was born, as if it were a fact. I remember, as a boy, his curious air of detachment. And I go on to say (my eyes fill with tears and then are dry), “But this is better than one had dared to hope”. I say, addressing what is abstract, facing me eyeless at the end of the avenue, in the sky, “Is this the utmost you can do?” Then we have triumphed. You have done your utmost, I say, addressing that blank and brutal face (for he was twenty-five* and should have lived to be eighty) without avail. I am not going to lie down and weep away a life of care.* (An entry to be made in my pocket-book; contempt for those who inflict meaningless death.) Further, this is important; that I should be able to place him in trifling and ridiculous situations, so that he may not feel himself absurd, perched on a great horse. I must be able to say, “Percival, a ridiculous name”. At the same time let me tell you, men and women, hurrying to the tube station, you would have had to respect him. You would have had to form up and follow behind him. How strange to oar one’s way through crowds seeing life through hollow eyes, burning eyes.",

Under the names of James Ryan and Mr and Mrs Harry A. Place, the ‘family of 3’ went to operas and theatres. (The Sundance Kid was a keen Wagnerian.) They bought Etta a gold watch at Tiffany’s and sailed for Buenos Aires on S.S. Soldier Prince. On landing they stayed at the Hotel Europa, called on the Director of the Land Department, and secured 12,000 acres of rough camp in Chubut.",

This is my favourite corner of Cape Town, built quite close to the city centre at the turn of the century to house artisans and workers, white and Coloured. Now it houses many young academics and students, with enough of its original families remaining to preserve an air of continuity. The streets are short and narrow, the small dwellings – mostly one-storeyed, no two alike – stand in tiny gardens, often tree-shaded, and display a variety of ornamental detail that blends Coloured creativity with imported fashions. Residents sit on their little stoeps and greet passers-by, children are seen and heard, dogs are taken for walks and traffic is light – people go shopping on foot. This afternoon the postman met me walking back from the pub and asked, ‘Have you lost your bike?’ – he had noticed me arriving on Lear. That’s very Obs, heart-warmingly non-urban and non-dorpy.",

Everyone who visits the citadel in the clouds inevitably follows in Bingham’s footsteps?not only by walking the same paths the explorer trod, but by projecting whatever vision it is they hope to see onto the lost city. As for me, the mental image of Machu Picchu that I’ll always keep is of John juggling handfuls of gadgets as he tried to capture the sunrise coming through the window, completely oblivious to Karl Marx patting him enthusiastically on the back.",

    "target_paragraph": "I trudged through the snow with the KGB major turned Baptist minister, to a chapel built with American dollars in Communism’s City of the Dawn. Siberia was growing surreal. Although Boris himself walked with a stick, he felt a fastidious concern for me, as if I could not move without his help. ‘Watch out for the ice…don’t hurry…. The snow’s deeper here….’\nFour pastors were waiting for us in the chapel kitchen. Their faces had converged into a childlike seriousness above their matching suits and ties. They looked glad to see me. My foreignness carried the aura of a far-flung Church. They were so trustful, so expectant, I felt ill at ease. My boots were still mewing and my Orthodox prayer-belt squeezed my waist like a heresy–but so worn that it resembled blue rope. When I pulled off my anorak I saw that its friction had drawn out a film of downy feathers from the quilted jacket below. Boris looked worried. ‘I think they’re chicken feathers,’ he said. I was afraid I was letting him down. As we processed into the church, he marched behind me, picking the feathers from my back, murmuring ‘Chicken…chicken….’\nWe trooped in before a congregation of 200. Among the sea of old women were some young office workers, a knot of students, three soldiers. The chapel was new and airy. There was no altar. The pastors and choir faced the congregation from a ramp of simple pews, backed by a fresco of Golgotha. Then the service began in a surge of prayers and hymns to the lilt of a harmonium. Everyone participated. Impromptu supplications welled up, one old woman’s plea rising to a tearful music, and two children sang a duet. There was a personal testimony which I could not follow. And a nervous woman was inducted formally among the faithful, clutching her handkerchief.\nNothing seemed further from the liturgy of the Orthodox, with its esoteric signs and hierarchies, and the mystical presence of all its sanctified and tortured past in the massed icons of saints and martyrs. In place of these mysteries, the chapel exuded democratic energy. Man was foremost. God dwelt, above all, in man. A moral force was abroad. The pastors studded the carefully orchestrated devotions with four sermons. First came a shy, youthful homily; then a hectoring bombardment from a visiting preacher; then an august elder bestowed homely prestige. Spontaneous questions rose from the congregation: somebody felt confused about divine grace, somebody else wanted to know how much drinking was a sin. And finally the chapel’s pastor–a spirited optimist swirled in black hair–resolved all the rest in a plea that our hearts open, and that Christ march in.\nThen, to my alarm, he announced the advent of an English writer amongst them. Boris nudged me to stand up and say something. I scrabbled in my head for the right thoughts, the right words. The chapel had gone silent. I got to my squeaking feet. In a rush of warmth and bad grammar, I stumbled out my gratitude and pleasure at being among them. But in the pew beside me Boris started cautiously picking at my back. ‘Chicken…chicken….’ I realised my legs were shaking. I imagined myself feathered like Papageno. I hoped my prayer-belt with its distracting verses (‘He shall cover thee with his feathers’ etc.) was undetectable. ‘Chicken….’ But the sea of worshippers beneath me–old women and young men–went on smiling as I told them I would hold them in my heart after I had left, and would wish them well.",

Then McCord at their usual table, with what he called breakfast—a quart stein of beer and about another quart of pretzels or salted peanuts or whatever was available, and Wilbourne would have the one drink which he allowed himself before Charlotte came (“I can afford abstemiousness now, sobriety,” he told McCord. “I can pay shot for shot and no holds barred with any and all for the privilege of refusing.”) and they would wait for the hour when the stores would empty, the glass doors flashing outward to erupt into the tender icy glare of neon the holly-pinned fur-framed faces, the wind-carved canyons merry and crisp with the bright voices speaking the good wishes and good will into intransigeant vapor, the employees’ chute too discharging presently the regimented black satin, the feet swollen with the long standing, the faces aching with the sustained long rigid grimacing. Then Charlotte would enter; they would stop talking and watch her approach, shifting and sidling past the throng at the bar and among the waiters and the crowded tables, her coat open above the neat uniform, her hat of the current off-the-face mode thrust further back still as if she had pushed it there herself with a sweep of the forearm in the immemorial female gesture out of the immemorial female weariness, approaching the table, her face pale and tired-looking too though she moved as strongly and surely as ever, the eyes as humorlessly and incorrigibly honest as ever above the blunt strong nose, the broad pale unsubtle mouth. “Rum, men,” she would say, then, sinking into the chair which one of them drew for her: “Well, papa.” Then they would eat, at the wrong hour, the hour when the rest of the world was just beginning to prime itself for food (“I feel like three bears in a cage on Sunday afternoon,” she said.), eating the meal which none of them wanted and then disperse, McCord to the paper, Charlotte and Wilbourne back to the store.",

It was summer in unairconditioned Cortona, the middle of a heat wave. Even midnight brought no relief to stony streets blowtorched all day by the July sun. Not too late to back out, I thought, catch the next thing smoking on the runway back to the U.S. But I got up in the morning and walked around town and along Roman roads in the country, feeling fresh waves of excitement. I can do this! I made my way to the notary office and listened to the long contract read aloud in Italian. Even the interpreter seemed not to understand much of it.

There was usually a group around Belle’s chair—other young women or a young man or so inactive between sets, with an occasional older woman come to see just exactly what was going on or what Belle wore at the time; watching Belle’s pretty regal airs with the young men. “Like a moving picture,” Aunt Sally Wyatt said once, with cold and curious interest.",

Ignoring comments about lateness at the Jolly Trucker, I switched trailers with Yuri’s co-driver in the chilly night air. Then I secured the rig again. After an overnight stay I would drive back alone, drop the trailers and go home a day earlier than expected. Next Tuesday the new week of driving began. At the Fort Worth office Carol or Jane would hand over a dispatch slip at the counter with our truck number on it. I hoped to see Margie there.",

It was just another large, impersonal, well-provisioned international resort. I could have been in Marbella or Eilat or anyplace else developed in the last twenty-five years. The hotels were mostly big international names—Marriott, Radisson, Mercure—and of an unexceptionably respectable standard. I parked the car on a side street and walked along to the seafront. En route I passed stores of an unexpected ritziness—Prada, Hermès, Ralph Lauren. All perfectly fine. It just wasn’t very interesting. I didn’t need to travel eight thousand miles to look at Ralph Lauren bath towels.",

It lacks power, he says, to move the material at the rate it should be moved. If a guy could expand the intake end of the pipe, where it sticks into the reservoir, the pipe would deliver more water. “Without a funnel effect, only so much will run in there. If a guy could make something like a funnel …” What is needed, as is so often the case, for thousands of purposes in Alaska, is a fifty-five-gallon drum. There are several near the wanigan, and Ed goes to get one while Stanley, with the Cat, opens the dam and lowers the reservoir enough to expose the pipe. With his torch, Ed cuts out the top and bottom of the drum and slits it down the side. At one end of the slit he pries the walls of the drum apart, making a V-shaped gap, which he fills in with scraps of steel. Attached—welded to the pipe—the new end flares like the bell of a trumpet, doubling the intake. Funnel effect.",

Then I glanced down the road to my left. Approaching at a quick pace were three young men of Southern Asian appearance, wearing flowing shalwar kameez robes and skull caps. Each had a wispy, long beard and was leaning forward beneath the weight of a large backpack. It's wrong to stereotype people by their appearance, but in a country still reeling from its worst ever terrorist attack, and in a city on edge and fearing further atrocities, the appearance of the young men caused a sudden murmur of apprehension outside the bar. All heads turned towards them as they approached, their steps seeming to quicken as they got closer. I heard the smash of glass, and turned to see a group of French tourists abandon their table at speed and scramble inside the bar. There followed the noise of a mass scraping of metal chairs on concrete, as others followed in a rapid evacuation from the bar's street-side tables. For some reason, Kirsty and I stayed put. I later likened the experience to my childhood brush with the infamous Hair-Puller. I knew I should move, but seemed frozen to the spot, watching the terrible scene unfold in slow motion. At any second, I expected a police officer or soldier to notice the potential attackers and unleash a deadly hail of gunfire which would obliterate the threat, and also anyone stupid enough to remain sitting outside the bar clutching a glass of beer.",

The wind was strong and keen, and the fierce splendour of the tropic sun conveyed no heat. Mr. A. went away investigating, the native rolled himself in his poncho and fell asleep by the fire, and I divided the time between glimpses into the awful desolation of the crater, snatched between the icy gusts of wind, and the enjoyment of the wonderful cloud scenery which to everybody is a great charm of the view from Haleakala. The day was perfect; for first we had an inimitable view of the crater and all that could be seen from the mountain-top, and then an equally inimitable view of Cloudland. There was the gaunt, hideous, desolate abyss, with its fiery cones, its rivers and surges of black lava and grey ash crossing and mingling all over the area, mixed with splotches of colour and coils of satin rock, its walls dark and frowning, everywhere riven and splintered, and clouds perpetually drifting in through the great gaps, and filling up the whole crater with white, swirling masses, which in a few minutes melted away in the sunshine, leaving it all as sharply definite as before. Before noon clouds surrounded the whole mountain, not in the vague, flocculent, meaningless masses one usually sees, but in Arctic oceans, where lofty icebergs, floes and pack, lay piled on each other, glistening with the frost of a Pali winter; then alps on alps, and peaks of well remembered ranges gleaming above glaciers, and the semblance of forests in deep ravines loaded with new fallen snow. Snow-drifts, avalanches, oceans held in bondage of eternal ice, and all this massed together,shifting, breaking, glistering, filling up the broad channel which divides Maui from Hawaii, and far away above the lonely masses, rose, in turquoise blue, like distant islands, the lofty Hawaiian domes of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa; with snow on Mauna Kea yet more dazzling than the clouds. There never was a stranger contrast than between the hideous desolation of the crater below, and those blue and jewelled summits rising above the shifting clouds.",

Fairy-tale plots, broad innuendos, unquestioned piety, heroes and villains, a weakness for spectacle and a shrewd determination to give the groundlings what they wanted—all, of course, were the essence of Chaucerian or Shakespearean art. But Hindi movies remained—critics forbid!—irredeemably vulgar. They were as fat and fleshy and cartoonish as the characters they celebrated. They played—no, pandered—to the lowest common denominator in mankind. Why on earth did they always have to be so loud, so bright, so broad?",

He did not know what his master meant, but as soon as Jim made a movement the girl started too and walked down into the open space. It seems that no one else of the people of the house was in sight. She tottered slightly, and about half-way down called out to Jim, who had apparently resumed his peaceful contemplation of the river. He turned round, setting his back against the gun. “Will you fight?” she cried. “There is nothing to fight for,” he said; “nothing is lost.” Saying this he made a step towards her. “Will you fly?” she cried again. “There is no escape,” he said, stopping short, and she stood still also, silent, devouring him with her eyes. “And you shall go?” she said slowly. He bent his head. “Ah!” she exclaimed, peering at him as it were, “you are mad or false. Do you remember the night I prayed you to leave me, and you said that you could not? That it was impossible! Impossible! Do you remember you said you would never leave me? Why? I asked you for no promise. You promised unasked — remember.” “Enough, poor girl,” he said. “I should not be worth having.”",

    "target_paragraph": "Within a mile we had spotted our first redura (short-cut), a barely perceptible path across a level sandy plain where a few tall eucalyptus swayed in a gusty wind. Nearby, on our left, rose a sheer semi-circular wall of grey rock; on our right, the mountains were round and brown. Soon we entered a eucalyptus plantation where the young trees grew in rows some ten yards apart. Sheep, goats and a few skeletal cows grazed on sparse clumps of rough grass and scrub. Their herds – two tiny ragged children sitting in the shade of a eucalyptus – stared at us with alarmed eyes from beneath wide-brimmed hats. Next came a mile or so of curiously splintered land, its mini-abysses scattered with strange shrivelled shrubs. Then abruptly we were overlooking a deep, circular, irrigated hollow, containing the new dwellings of a Co-op farm. Turning left and keeping to the high ground, we crossed acres of stubble – the earth feather-light with drought – before negotiating a precipitous, shadowy ravine where Juana warned us of an inexplicable boggy patch. Mules are famed for their quick response to every sort of natural hazard. Remembering Juana’s inadequate lunch, Rachel dismounted for the tough climb back to the road. Then she requested her sweater; it was 4.45 and suddenly cold.",
