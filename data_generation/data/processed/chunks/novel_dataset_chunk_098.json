Troubles about people’s health didn’t seem within his range – he gave no thought to his own. In the lane beside the commissary he stepped back as an open electric truck crammed with girls in the bright costumes of the Regency came rolling in from the back lot. The dresses were fluttering in the wind, the young painted faces looked at him curiously, and he smiled as it went by.\n\n*",

    "target_paragraph": "When the war was over, Soviet historians said little about the contributions of the Lend-Lease aircraft. The omission was understandable, considering the overall Russian sacrifices and the fact that Lend-Lease planes were just a fraction of those the USSR, with ramped-up production, was able to put in the sky by war’s end. But the planes from America, and other Lend-Lease goods and matériel, made an unforgettable impression on average Russians. Joseph Brodsky remembered treasuring empty tins that Lend-Lease Spam had come in, Kolyma prisoners marveled at the amazing American white bread “that produced no bowel movement worthy of the name,” and boys who saw Americans for the first time in the pilots who stopped at their Siberian transfer-point villages thought the yellow boots those pilots wore were about the coolest thing in the world.",

From beyond the circle with its spurious Greek balustrade, clotted with movement, filled with a gray light of the same color and texture as the water which the fountain played into the pool, came a steady crash of music. They went on, passed the pool where the children and an old man in a shabby brown overcoat sailed toy boats, and entered the trees again and found seats. Immediately an old woman came with decrepit promptitude and collected four sous.",

Madame Olenska, leaning back against the boat-rail, drank in the coolness between parted lips.

It is lively; it is a gorgeous architectural jumble: Renaissance buildings next to medieval houses, Corinthian columns on sidewalks, in courtyards, even on staircases. And medieval houses gussied up with discreet and beautiful windows the better from which to see the green slopes of the Capitol; and narrow streets hung with laundry that debouch into sunny small piazzas, some little more than cul-de-sacs; houses draped in ivy, courtyards adorned with succulents and fountains. There is a sense, here, of life fully lived; the passeggiata, here, resembles a parade. There is also (ironically) a sense of safety: One is not afraid, here, subliminally or actively, of being “thieved.” To walk here is a tactile experience—sun and shadow on your skin as you walk down dark, narrow streets crowded with tall, narrow houses and exit into intimate piazzas. Architecture feels like your skin's skin, and this makes a kind of moral sense.",

We drew into Ahmedabad and sped straight to Hotel Serena, where I collapsed under the shower, then lay in a ball on the bed, watching newsflashes about Swamiji Nithyananda. The self-proclaimed holy man had been ‘nabbed’ in a sex-tape scandal with an unidentified Tamil actress, causing his ashram to be attacked by ‘miffed’ followers. The ‘absconding’ swami claimed that she was taking care of him while he was sick; judging by the gloriously repeated footage, it was clear that the actress had an extremely attentive bedside manner.",

I held the little doll in my hand, wondering if my mother would be there to welcome me home when I finished the voyage and thinking about her face as she said goodbye. We had said goodbye many times before, but this time we both knew it was different. I broke down again, but not for myself. My future was as limitless as this morning’s horizon. The tears were for the cage of my mother’s reality, for people born under the wrong star and for whom life can be so unfair. “I am doing this trip for you, too, Mommy,” I said aloud. “I want to help you dream, and give you something to hope for.”",

There’s adrenaline and camaraderie, doing good work and bacon every morning, and, of course, overtime pay plus occasional hazard premiums. (Fire seasonals in the West like to sniff smoky air and say, “Smells like money!”) But there’s also the militarized mentality, the “hurry up and wait,” macho smoke-jocks strutting like hopped-up Marines, and the almost-too-hot-to-bear weather that nurtures fire, underwear soaked with sweat. Eventually the sneaky pleasure at getting paid premium wages to play Hacky Sack while “standing by” gives way to demoralizing sluggishness. Weeks of inefficiency and the rumbling machinations of bureaucracy grind all but the staunchest work ethic to a pulp.",

Yet they somehow stayed perfectly groomed and dry. This struck me as a dazzling sort of performance art, and a way to maintain private dignity amid public squalor.

They had built the schoolhouse themselves and paid the teacher and sent their children to it only when there was no work for them to do at home, so it only ran between harvest-time and planting—from mid-October through March. Nothing had been done yet about replacing the Professor until one day in the summer Varner happened to make a business trip into the next county, was benighted, and was invited to pass the night in a bleak puncheon-floored cabin on a barren little hill farm. When he entered the house he saw, sitting beside the cold hearth and sucking a foul little clay pipe, an incredibly old woman wearing a pair of stout-looking man’s shoes slightly unorthodox or even a little bizarre in appearance. But Varner paid no attention to them until he heard a clattering scraping noise behind him and turned and saw a girl of about ten, in a tattered though quite clean gingham dress and a pair of shoes exactly like those of the old lady—if anything, even a little larger. Before he departed the next morning Varner had seen three more pairs of the same shoes, by which time he had discovered that they resembled no other shoes he had ever seen or even heard of. His host told him what they were.",

In normal circumstances a lovely young woman alone would have thought of nothing else; the whole edifice of female government is based on that foundation stone; chastity is their jewel, their centre-piece, which they run mad to protect, and die when ravished of. But if one has been a man for thirty years or so, and an Ambassador into the bargain, if one has held a Queen in one’s arms and one or two other ladies, if report be true, of less exalted rank, if one has married a Rosina Pepita, and so on, one does not perhaps give such a very great start about that. Orlando’s start was of a very complicated kind, and not to be summed up in a trice. Nobody, indeed, ever accused her of being one of those quick wits who run to the end of things in a minute. It took her the entire length of the voyage to moralize out the meaning of her start, and so, at her own pace, we will follow her.",

Burma Shave was a shaving cream that came in a tube. I don’t know if it’s still produced. In fact, I never knew anyone who ever used it. But the Burma Shave company used to put clever signs along the highway. They came in clusters of five, expertly spaced so that you read them as a little poem as you passed: IF HARMONY/IS WHAT YOU CRAVE/THEN GET/A TUBA/BURMA SHAVE. Or: BEN MET/ANNA/MADE A HIT/NEGLECTED BEARD/BEN-ANNA SPLIT. Great, eh? Even in the 1950s the Burma Shave signs were pretty much a thing of the past. I can only remember seeing half a dozen in all the thousands of miles of highway we covered. But as roadside diversions went they were outstanding, ten times better than billboards and Pella’s little twirling windmills. The only things that surpassed them for diversion value were multiple car pile-ups with bodies strewn about the highway.",

He means to be a professional politician but seems unsure of the procedure for getting launched on this career. Like every other Hunzawal to whom I have spoken here – quite a number, the Jubilee being their Gilgit headquarters – he bitterly resents the Mir’s deposition and claims that his country’s whole way of life is being rapidly changed for the worse. As an example, he quoted the present fate of Hunza women. Before the introduction of soldiers and police from down-country they went about their villages unveiled, but now they are being put into purdah. A curious side-effect of ‘Progress’, recalling what happened in many remote Turkish villages when Ataturk the Secularist provided buses on which women could travel to the market-towns.",

One would be much more responsive to the beauty of the landscape, in a region like this, if not tormented by a vision of all those commercially forested hills being grazed by Zulu herds.

Although we had a gas-powered hob on the Ford Ranger for cooking, I remembered advice from Noah on our Tanzania safari, that a night time fire was necessary to keep predators at bay. What he'd failed to tell me, and was especially relevant now, was that hippos are attracted to light, and a riverside fire may draw the attention of the animal widely reckoned to be the most likely to kill humans in Africa. Perhaps fortunately, I'd failed to gauge how quickly the dry mopane wood burnt, and not long after we'd eaten, our supply of fuel was exhausted, and we were forced to retire to the relative safety of our tent on the cab roof.",

At bedtime, the air became chilly, and when I bathed in the river in the morning, a cold mist lay on the water and made the stones of the gravel bank wet with dew. By breakfast the sun had come over the trees and the day quickly got warm. While Sergei broke camp, Volodya gave the van a wash. We set out and continued southward, passing villages called Roskosh (Luxury), Zvenevay (Small-Group Town), and Tigorovo (Tigerville), and rivers called Pervaya Syedmaya Reka (First Seventh River) and Vtoraya Syedmaya Reka (Second Seventh River).",

The dead leaves crackled under foot; among them sprang up the pale spring flowers, the loveliest of the year – blue flowers and white flowers, trembling on cushions of green moss. Spring was sad always, she thought; it brought back memories. All passes, all changes, she thought, as she climbed up the little path between the trees. Nothing of this belonged to her; her son would inherit; his wife would walk here after her. She broke off a twig; she picked a flower and put it to her lips. But she was in the prime of life; she was vigorous. She strode on. The ground rose sharply; her muscles felt strong and flexible as she pressed her thick-soled shoes to the ground. She threw away her flower. The trees thinned as she strode higher and higher. Suddenly she saw the sky between two striped tree trunks extraordinarily blue. She came out on the top. The wind ceased; the country spread wide all round her. Her body seemed to shrink; her eyes to widen. She threw herself on the ground, and looked over the billowing land that went rising and falling, away and away, until somewhere far off it reached the sea. Uncultivated, uninhabited, existing by itself, for itself, without towns or houses it looked from this height. Dark wedges of shadow, bright breadths of light lay side by side. Then, as she watched, light moved and dark moved; light and shadow went travelling over the hills and over the valleys. A deep murmur sang in her ears – the land itself, singing to itself, a chorus, alone. She lay there listening. She was happy, completely. Time had ceased.",

They had even managed to avoid May's English aunt, the banker's wife, who was still in Yorkshire; in fact, they had purposely postponed going to London till the autumn in order that their arrival during the season might not appear pushing and snobbish to these unknown relatives.",

I realized that I’d pulled something?likely a hamstring. Stopping to palpate the back of my thigh, I noted there were no bulges, and no heat. Just stiffness. I tried to touch my toes, but I couldn’t even touch my kneecaps. The musculature of my left leg had seized. Slipping my pack off, I sat down, awkwardly contorting myself to accommodate the tightness that had developed. I pulled out my first-aid kit, which was nothing more than sports tape, triple antibiotic ointment, and a handful of ibuprofen in a plastic baggie. For the second time on my hike thus far, I took an ibuprofen and got back to my feet. Within twenty minutes the pain had subsided, even though I still limped slightly. It’s marvelous how effective 200 mg of vitamin I is when my body is unaccustomed to it!",

In military matters the Governor of Havana retained control over the whole island, otherwise the province of Oriente was to enjoy virtual independence under Santiago’s jurisdiction. Oriente then incorporated the modern provinces of Guantanamo, Holguin, Las Tunas, Granma and Santiago.",

It was fascinating and it was horrifying. Of course we knew about tsunamis but never thought we would be in one, and I still couldn’t really accept that it was happening.

Day four, I show up at the pier at the appointed time because the tour boat owner has not called me either way (go/no go). I find out later on the local tom-tom network that he had a pre-booked tour and took them, leaving me stranded. As I start to walk back to the hostel I see the sign of the OTHER tour boat operator on a building wall and decide to call them. This is done standing in the middle of the street since mobile service at the hostel is non-existent, as is Wi-Fi, making these reservation arrangements technologically challenged. As luck would have it, one seat left for tomorrow…if we go. I book it, grab a bacon roll at the Butty Bus, and then go back to the freezing hostel.",

I looked in on Raffles every time, but usually I stayed in the look-alike blocks that encircled Orchard Road. My body sixteen hours out of sync, I awoke every day at 9pm (5am in California), and took breakfast in one of the gleaming, late-night convenience centres amidst the gilded shopping malls. Then I walked through much of the night, in and out of alleyways and deserted streets, trying to pick up the city’s subconscious and everything that didn’t show up during the daylight hours. I saw women seated on rattan chairs outside pungent doorways, tubes of pink lighting flickering above them. I saw joss sticks burning beside guttering candles in backstreet Chinese shops. I watched girls strutting past the Royal Thai Embassy alone in the dark and African men shuffling down red-lanterned streets in search of cavernous international phone-calling centres. When I’d spent four months travelling across Asia in 1985, the only place in the continent I could find from which to call home was one of these huge hallways off Killiney Road.",

Troy had sunk down exhausted, and it was some time before he could speak connectedly, his deliverers meanwhile lending him what little clothing they could spare among them as a slight protection against the rapidly cooling air. He soon told them his tale, and begged to be put ashore at his bathing place, which he pointed out to them as being about a mile distant. Their boat was somewhat laden, but after a little demuring they agreed to row in the direction signified, and set him down. Troy however had considerably understated the distance, and what with this and keeping wide of the current they rowed more than two miles before the narrow mouth of the cove appeared. By the time that their keel crunched among the stones of the beach within the opening the sun was down, a crescent moon had risen, and solitude reigned around, rendering distinct the gentle slide of the wavelets up the sloping shore and the rustle of the pebbles against each other under the caress of each swell – the brisker ebb and flow outside the bar being audible above the mild repetition of the same motion here within.",

Also, that deck leaked, and it leaked badly. It drowned Roscoe out of his bunk and ruined the tools in the engine-room, to say nothing of the provisions it ruined in the galley. Also, the sides of the Snark leaked, and the bottom leaked, and we had to pump her every day to keep her afloat. The floor of the galley is a couple of feet above the inside bottom of the Snark; and yet I have stood on the floor of the galley, trying to snatch a cold bite, and been wet to the knees by the water churning around inside four hours after the last pumping.",

He looked at the faces in the hotel lobby, the brawling, furious, and chaotic street, and the swarming and rancid corridors, with dizzy swimming eyes and a constricted heart; a thousand unutterable and horrible premonitions and imaginings of ruin and shame swarmed through his mind – every day he felt the impending menace of some new and fatal catastrophe, some indefinable and crushing disgrace with which each hour was ominously, murderously pregnant.",
