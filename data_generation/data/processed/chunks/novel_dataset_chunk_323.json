There was something irritating to her in the mute interrogation of Gerty’s sympathy: she felt the real difficulties of her situation to be incommunicable to anyone whose theory of values was so different from her own, and the restrictions of Gerty’s life, which had once had the charm of contrast, now reminded her too painfully of the limits to which her own existence was shrinking. When at length, one afternoon, she put into execution the belated resolve to visit her friend, this sense of shrunken opportunities possessed her with unusual intensity. The walk up Fifth Avenue, unfolding before her, in the brilliance of the hard winter sunlight, an interminable procession of fastidiously-equipped carriages – giving her, through the little squares of brougham-windows, peeps of familiar profiles bent above visiting-lists, of hurried hands dispensing notes and cards to attendant footmen – this glimpse of the ever-revolving wheels of the great social machine made Lily more than ever conscious of the steepness and narrowness of Gerty’s stairs, and of the cramped blind-alley of life to which they led. Dull stairs destined to be mounted by dull people: how many thousands of insignificant figures were going up and down such stairs all over the world at that very moment – figures as shabby and uninteresting as that of the middle-aged lady in limp black who descended Gerty’s flight as Lily climbed to it!",

Allan, who is not a man to let any impediment stand between him and his evening beverage, yanked them open with a vehemence that was impressive, and we squeezed through. The bar was liberally, not to say unexpectedly, arrayed with rough, boisterously drunk, and dangerous-looking fellows, all with copious tattoos, long hair, and beards like mattress ticking—not exactly the patrons you would expect to find drinking in the bar of a business hotel.",

Because the dolly’s wheels are heavier, the pointed loop in front of the dolly often wanted to rise up in the air or plunge downward. Holding on to the dolly I fought to keep the weighty point from either falling to the ground or rising skyward. Standing at the head of the dolly and rolling it back or forth while trying to prevent the whole contraption from giving into gravity felt like a sort of slow motion underwater dance and a definite exercise in appreciating the three dimensionality of space. Pushing, pulling, and balancing I managed to center the dolly against the black vertical stripe painted on the front of the trailer that indicated where the heavy pin waited underneath to be snapped into the fifth wheel of the dolly.",

I never dropped out. I was expelled. After Pop died, the girl I was seeing dumped me, and then everything just fell apart. I moved into this stupid frat house and spent all my time lost in beer and drugs. I was failing my Law and Society class, the one class I needed to get into law school. I didn’t know what to do.” Holding him tighter, the words just poured out, “I cheated. I cheated in a bad way. A guy in the class showed me how to fix the professor’s door so it wouldn’t lock. Then we snuck in at night and photographed the exam—he’d left it right there on his desk. But we fucked up! We totally fucked up! He’d made four versions of the test and the answers we bubbled in matched one of the others. My buddy confessed, and we were both expelled. Don’t tell Ma, she doesn’t know. That’s why I can’t go back to school, ’cause I fucked up.”",

Everyone’s pressed together, open bottles of champagne passing from hand to hand, people drinking straight from the bottles. It’s a veritable bacchanal. I grab a bottle by the neck, spy my own clique at an already fully occupied table, see Gustav and Laure talking standing with another couple, though Laure still doesn’t seem to be participating. I weave my way through the crowd to Bernard. “Look,” I tell him, handing him the bottle. “I got us some of our beef jerky for dinner.” We each take a swig of Moet. “Robert and Maddy are over there,” I shout, pointing into the teaming crowd. “Their table’s already crammed. Let’s find our own place to sit.” Grabbing some empty chairs before someone else takes them, I pull the jerky bag out and fling it onto the table. “Help yourselves,” I shout to the others at our table. No one moves. The jerky is one of the best decisions I made before the Rally. Not only is it organic beef, I’ve chosen a peppery, soy, sugary version that satisfies every one of my food cravings. To the uninitiated, jerky looks as appetizing as boot leather. “It may not look good, but it’s delicious.” They each take a tiny piece to be polite and soon all our hands are delving into the sack, tangy jerky washed down by mouthfuls of drily refreshing champagne.",

It’s no surprise that Colonsay’s west coast is rocky and carved, the ocean roiling. The surprise is that it is so warm. The Gulf Stream runs right past here and tempers the climate. The Kilmartin House Museum has a small local display. Then it’s on past the airfield and rugby pitch, a patch of grass so designated to accommodate the annual rugby tournament. Next, down the Oronsay Road past the small ruin where the monks hunkered down while waiting for the tides to change. A stop at a holiday let where the family tells me they come annually. This year was a big year because the twelve year old daughter jumped off the dolphins (piers) into the harbour, no mean feat given the height and the water temperature. She beams proudly having joined the island youth in a totally illegal initiation right. Past the estate owned pub and into the community shop for supplies. On to the Colonsay Brewery, Colonsay Bookshop, and Wild Thyme Spirits (gin). The sign for the next ceilidh is up at the community centre. The shop is busy and includes a used book exchange. I load up and head back.",

He likes the snuff of fresh air and walking at a brisk pace down the Strand. Or in the country there’s a cock crowing on a gate; there’s a foal galloping round a field. Something always has to be done next. Tuesday follows Monday; Wednesday Tuesday. Each spreads the same ripple of well-being, repeats the same curve of rhythm; covers fresh sand with a chill or ebbs a little slackly without. So the being grows rings; identity becomes robust. What was fiery and furtive like a fling of grain cast into the air and blown hither and thither by wild gusts of life from every quarter is now methodical and orderly and flung with a purpose—so it seems.",

He made it home most evenings, and on special occasions we went to a restaurant called the Jolly Roger, part of a pirate-themed chain, with burgers named after Robert Louis Stevenson characters, in a shopping mall in Kahala. One night we went to see Disney’s Snow White at a drive-in on Waialae Avenue, all six of us in a pile in our old Ford Fairlane. I know this because I wrote to my friend in L.A. about it. I described the film as “psychedelic.”",

The wind was still fierce—strong enough to knock me down several times—but it was a bright, clear dawn, and the visibility was perfect. I searched the entire western half of the Col for more than an hour, peering behind boulders and poking under shredded, long-abandoned tents, but found no trace of Harris. Adrenaline surged through my veins. Tears welled in my eyes, instantly freezing my eyelids shut. How could Andy be gone? It couldn’t be so.",

For it was a curious fact that admission to the intimacy of the Prince and his mother—who continually declared themselves to be the pariahs, the outlaws, the Bohemians among crowned heads nevertheless involved not only living in Palace Hotels but mixing with those who frequented them. The Prince's aide-de-camp—an agreeable young man of easy manners—had smilingly hinted that their Serene Highnesses, though so thoroughly democratic and unceremonious, were yet accustomed to inspecting in advance the names of the persons whom their hosts wished to invite with them; and Lansing noticed that Mrs. Hicks's lists, having been \"submitted,\" usually came back lengthened by the addition of numerous wealthy and titled guests. Their Highnesses never struck out a name; they welcomed with enthusiasm and curiosity the Hickses' oddest and most inexplicable friends, at most putting off some of them to a later day on the plea that it would be \"cosier\" to meet them on a more private occasion; but they invariably added to the list any friends of their own, with the gracious hint that they wished these latter (though socially so well-provided for) to have the \"immense privilege\" of knowing the Hickses. And thus it happened that when October gales necessitated laying up the Ibis, the Hickses, finding again in Rome the august travellers from whom they had parted the previous month in Athens, also found their visiting-list enlarged by all that the capital contained of fashion.",

Larry showed me the recipe: flour, water, and salt, baked “until golden brown and rock hard,” then left to cool in the oven, “a process similar to case hardening in blacksmithing.” In Mexico, Moctezuma sampled Spanish hardtack and declared it indistinguishable from limestone.",

All three sleep on a row of charpoys; Muslims have no convention forbidding the sexes to share sleeping quarters. Their Russian-type tin stove, on which all water is heated and all cooking done, burns very expensive wood.
