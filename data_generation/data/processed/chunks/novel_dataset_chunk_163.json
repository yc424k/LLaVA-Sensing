I walked along them one afternoon, winding my way up the hill until I found what I was looking for. Poking above the palm-thatch roofs was a chimney with a few desultory weeds growing from it. I walked through the narrow gaps between the houses and came to a large clearing. There was nothing in the clearing but a solitary, pale-orange chimney stack. Halfway up the stack, five weathered wooden planks stuck out in all directions like signposts, and on each side of its base were the remains of brick fireplaces. Around the edge of the clearing I found the foundations of a large house, and on one side entrance steps leading up to a flat grassy patch. In Burmese Days this patch of grass was a sitting room decorated with ornamental tables and brassware trinkets from India. Orwell wrote that the room smelled of chintz and dying flowers.",

No wonder they were going so slow on the way in. He just groaned at the thought of getting rid of them.

Auntie rarely ceased sewing coats and trousers and mukluks, but even with help from Mamen and McKinlay and a few others, she’d simply run out of time and materials to fit out everyone. Now they scoured the camp for any spare skins or woolens and assessed the state of their footwear; most had holes in the bottoms. “We had nothing but what we stood in,” remarked Chafe, “and that was nearly worn out.”",

Edred has been thrown off his horse. We don’t think he is hurt much. It happened in the wood the other side of Marshcombe Bottom.” She went on to give a few of the particulars, but none of the invented horrors that had been communicated by the boy. “I thought it better to tell you at once,” she added, “in case he should not—be very well able to walk home, and somebody should bring him.”",

The clumsy deep-sea galleons of the conquerors that, needing a brisk gale to move at all, would lie becalmed, where your modern ship built on clipper lines forges ahead by the mere flapping of her sails, had been barred out of Sulaco by the prevailing calms of its vast gulf. Some harbours of the earth are made difficult of access by the treachery of sunken rocks and the tempests of their shores. Sulaco had found an inviolable sanctuary from the temptations of a trading world in the solemn hush of the deep Golfo Placido as if within an enormous semi-circular and unroofed temple open to the ocean, with its walls of lofty mountains hung with the mourning draperies of cloud.",

But a taste for Art—or at any rate the sort of art that is found in galleries and churches—is by no means universal. Hence the case of the poor tourists who, from motives of snobbery, visit Rome and Florence, is even more pathetic than the case of those who repair for the same reasons to Paris and Monte Carlo. Tourists “doing” a church wear a mask of dutiful interest; but what lassitude, what utter weariness of spirit looks out, too often, at their eyes! And the weariness is felt, within, still more acutely because, precisely, of the necessity of simulating this rapt attentiveness, of even going hypocritically into raptures over the things that are starred in the Baedeker. There come moments when flesh and blood can stand the strain no longer. Philistinism absolutely refuses to pay the tribute it owes to taste. Exasperated and defiant, the tourist swears that he won’t so much as put his nose inside another church, preferring to spend his days in the lounge of the hotel, reading the continental Daily Mail.",

The typical way of visiting these islands is a cruise on a live-aboard boat. My memory of puking over the side of the boat in Panama is far too recent to be ignored, so I’m hesitant to step foot on any more floating vessels. On top of that, I learn that prices for Galapagos tours are around $3,000 per person per week! We’d spend half our year’s budget on a two-week tour! So instead, we fly out to the islands, stay in last-minute hotels or rentals, and just wing it exploring independently for three weeks. We spend a week on each of the three largest islands, and are joined for part of our stay by friends from Costa Rica and California.",

Mine took me on a long tour through Botley and Hinksey, on a nostalgic swing past the sprawling Rover car factory at Cowley, and out through Blackbird Leys, before taking me twice around a roundabout and flinging me, like a spacecraft in planetary orbit, back toward town. I was powerless to do anything about this, largely because my attention was preoccupied with trying to turn off the back windshield wiper, which seemed to have a mind of its own, and figuring out how to remove an opaque cloud of foamy washing fluid from the front windshield, which shot out in great obscuring streams no matter which switch I pushed or stalk I waggled.",

We would visit the UK, hug Grandma and Grandpa, walk the dog, play a few games, and then she was ready and open for the next adventure; that was as much Scottish culture as she could feign an interest in. Although she and I have British passports and I carried the programming of British culture, she never would, unless she moved there. Was I raising a kid who would find herself feeling like an alien? I had found the US to be the most difficult culture to adopt—how could I teach her to be something I had never really been? What subtle messages was I passing along to her?",

Beyond the objective dangers of the terrain they moved through, the surveyors risked being attacked by bandits or punished as spies. The Emirs of Afghanistan, in particular, did not take kindly to the officers of a nearby foreign power wandering round their country. After losing too many of their own men to accidents and assassination, the British – characteristically – decided to train up native Indian cartographers, disguise them as pilgrims, and send them in to reconnoitre and map the parts British officers couldn’t safely reach. The pandits, as they became known – giving us our word ‘pundit’ – taught themselves to count their own paces, to walk at 2,000 paces to the mile, and to mark off each one hundred paces by moving a bead on their rosaries. They carried their notes hidden in their prayer wheels, and in their staffs were stashed thermometers, so that they could measure altitude by boiling-point. The most famous of these early pandits were the Singh cousins, Nain and Kishen. So committed was Kishen to his job that he not only worked out his own pacings, but also those of a galloping horse; when a bandit attack forced him to escape on horseback, he was therefore able to continue mapping the terrain through which he fled.",

    "target_paragraph": "Spring was coming. Spring was in the air. (Author’s Note. — This is the same day on which the story starts, back on page three.) A chinook wind was blowing. Workmen were coming home from the factory. Scripps’s bird singing in its cage. Diana looking out of the open window. Diana watching for her Scripps to come up the street. Could she hold him? Could she hold him? If she couldn’t hold him, would he leave her his bird? She had felt lately that she couldn’t hold him. In the nights, now, when she touched Scripps he rolled away, not toward her. It was a little sign, but life was made up of little signs. She felt she couldn’t hold him. As she looked out of the window, a copy of The Century Magazine dropped from her nerveless hand. The Century had a new editor. There were more woodcuts. Glenn Frank had gone to head some great university somewhere. There were more Van Dorens on the magazine. Diana felt that might turn the trick. Happily she had opened The Century and read all morning. Then the wind, the warm chinook wind, had started to blow, and she knew Scripps would soon be home. Men were coming down the street in increasing numbers. Was Scripps among them? She did not like to put on her spectacles to look. She wanted Scripps’s first glimpse of her to be of her at her best. As she felt him drawing nearer, the confidence she had had in The Century grew fainter. She had so hoped that would give her the something which would hold him. She wasn’t sure now.\nScripps coming down the street with a crowd of excited workmen. Men stirred by the spring. Scripps swinging his lunch-bucket. Scripps waving good-by to the workmen, who trooped one by one into what had formerly been a saloon. Scripps not looking up at the window. Scripps coming up the stairs. Scripps coming nearer. Scripps coming nearer. Scripps here.\n“Good afternoon, dear Scripps,” she said. “I’ve been reading a story by Ruth Suckow.”\n“Hello, Diana,” Scripps answered. He set down his lunch-pail. She looked worn and old. He could afford to be polite.\n“What was the story about, Diana?” he asked.\n“It was about a little girl in Iowa,” Diana said. She moved toward him. “It was about people on the land. It reminded me a little of my own Lake Country.”\n“That so?” asked Scripps. In some ways the pump-factory had hardened him. His speech had become more clipped. More like these hardy Northern workers’. But his mind was the same.\n“Would you like me to read a little of it out loud?” Diana asked. “They’re some lovely woodcuts.”\n“How about going down to the beanery?” Scripps said.\n“As you wish, dear,” Diana said. Then her voice broke. “I wish — oh, I wish you’d never seen that place!” She wiped away her tears. Scripps had not even seen them. “I’ll bring the bird, dear,” Diana said. “He hasn’t been out all day.”\nTogether they went down the street to the beanery. They did not walk hand in hand now. They walked like what are called old married people. Mrs. Scripps carried the bird-cage. The bird was happy in the warm wind. Men lurching along, drunk with the spring, passed them. Many spoke to Scripps. He was well known and well liked in the town now. Some, as they lurched by, raised their hats to Mrs. Scripps. She responded vaguely. If I can only hold him, she was thinking. If I can only hold him. As they walked along the slushy snow of the narrow sidewalk of the Northern town, something began to beat in her head. Perhaps it was the rhythm of their walking together. I can’t hold him. I can’t hold him. I can’t hold him.\nScripps took her arm as they crossed the street. When his hand touched her arm Diana knew it was true. She would never hold him. A group of Indians passed them on the street. Were they laughing at her or was it some tribal jest? Diana didn’t know. All she knew was that rhythm that beat into her brain. I can’t hold him. I can’t hold him.",

But they couldn’t hear anything from upstairs, even when they were inside the dark hall, at the foot of the stairs. “Likely hers will be at the back,” Uncle Buck said. “Where she can holler down to the kitchen without having to get up. Besides, an unmarried lady will sholy have her door locked with strangers in the house.” So Uncle Buck eased himself down onto the bottom step, and he knelt and drew Uncle Buck’s boots off. Then he removed his own and set them against the wall, and he and Uncle Buck mounted the stairs, feeling their way up and into the upper hall. It was dark too, and still there was no sound anywhere except Mr Hubert snoring below, so they felt their way along the hall toward the front of the house, until they felt a door. They could hear nothing beyond the door, and when Uncle Buck tried the knob, it opened. “All right,” Uncle Buck whispered. “Be quiet.” They could see a little now, enough to see the shape of the bed and the mosquito-bar. Uncle Buck threw down his suspenders and unbuttoned his trousers and went to the bed and eased himself carefully down onto the edge of it, and he knelt again and drew Uncle Buck’s trousers off and he was just removing his own when Uncle Buck lifted the mosquito-bar and raised his feet and rolled into the bed. That was when Miss Sophonsiba sat up on the other side of Uncle Buck and gave the first scream.",

Although the banks were lined with a jagged shelf of frozen overflow, no ice bridges spanned the channel of open water, so he was forced to wade. There had been a big thaw in early April, and breakup had come early in 1992, but the weather had turned cold again, so the river’s volume was quite low when McCandless crossed—probably thigh-deep at most—allowing him to splash to the other side without difficulty. He never suspected that in so doing, he was crossing his Rubicon. To McCandless’s inexperienced eye, there was nothing to suggest that two months hence, as the glaciers and snowfields at the Teklanika’s headwater thawed in the summer heat, its discharge would multiply nine or ten times in volume, transforming the river into a deep, violent torrent that bore no resemblance to the gentle brook he’d blithely waded across in April.",

Expecting to see dull, corporate Americana, I felt for a moment that we had mistakenly stepped into a museum: as far as the eye could see was a treasure house of Asian art. Khmer sculpture stood in the corridors, and Chinese jade carvings sat casually next to computers and on top of filing cabinets. ‘Dad loves Asian art,’ Trammell S. said. ‘He likes using his collection to decorate the office, so his employees can enjoy it too. I’ll introduce you to him.’",

A new tube, the obvious remedy, would involve removing the back wheel. And could men who had never before seen a bicycle with any gears, never mind Lear’s twenty-one-speed system, successfully perform such an operation? I decided on conventional puncture treatment. If that failed I would have to walk to Kilosa; the Concern team must surely be equipped with a talented mechanic. Tensely I watched the patching and replacement of the tyre, like an anxious mum in an operating theatre. Then, as I was reattaching the panniers, one of the silent, sullen men under the mango tree suddenly stepped forward and truculently demanded, ‘Give identity papers!’",

(Uncle worked in a glass factory.) Behind this menagerie could be glimpsed some attractive Czech cut glass and my admiring it caused Anna’s eyes to fill with tears; it had been a wedding present, twenty years ago. A large solid wireless stood beneath an outsize television set – identical to all other Rumanian television sets and not expensive, that medium having been Ceausescu’s favourite propaganda tool. Above the beds hung shiny tapestries, some four feet by two, depicting the Last Supper (which it would be blasphemous to describe accurately) and a romantic mountain scene – brick-red deer drinking from an electric-blue lake surrounded by lime-green trees under a salmon-pink dawn (or sunset?) sky. The adjacent room was much bigger and also overheated, for my benefit. Near the stove stood a double bed; eight simple, monastic-looking chairs circled a fine oak dining-table; the handsome matching sideboard held a long row of empty Scotch whisky, English gin and French brandy bottles.",
