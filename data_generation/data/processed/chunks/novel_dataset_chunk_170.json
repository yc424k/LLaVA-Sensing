It took a bit of getting used to the sound of the Air Marine X wind generator. The stronger the wind blew, the louder it got but it was sure pumping the amps into the batteries. The new 8D truck battery he had installed had added 150 amp hours and increased their previous capacity of 240 amp hours to 390. He had even bought a window air-conditioning unit in Cancun that fit in the companionway hatch like it had been engineered for it. With the little Honda generator, they could be cool even at anchor. In the steamy jungle of the Rio Dulce, it meant that they could sleep in cool comfort. It was all coming together.",

Its behaviour was explained by a pair of rocky gates, each crowned by a watch-tower, which passed it through the mountains. We followed it, crossing from the west bank to the east by means of a dilapidated bridge, of whose two stone arches one had been washed away and replaced by a wooden suspension. The motor road, which must have joined the river further south, uses this bridge. According to the Russian who called on us at Moghor, both it and the towers were built by Alexander.",

But if he passed these same people two hours later in the High Street, their lives, their words were stranger than in a dream, or they seemed to have an incredible fictitious quality that made everything they did or said seem false, mannered, and affected, so that when he listened to them he had a feeling of resentment and contempt for them as if they spoke and moved with the palpable falseness of actors.",

But you know——’ He opened the book, and began searching for passages to read aloud, and in a little time he found a good one which he considered suitable. But there was nothing in the world that bored Ridley more than being read aloud to, and he was besides scrupulously fastidious as to the dress and behaviour of ladies. In the space of fifteen minutes he had decided against Mrs Flushing on the ground that her orange plume did not suit her complexion, that she spoke too loud, that she crossed her legs, and finally, when he saw her accept a cigarette that Hewet offered her, he jumped up, exclaiming something about ‘bar parlours’, and left them. Mrs Flushing was evidently relieved by his departure. She puffed her cigarette, stuck her legs out, and examined Helen closely as to the character and reputation of their common friend Mrs Raymond Parry. By a series of little stratagems she drove her to define Mrs Parry as somewhat elderly, by no means beautiful, very much made up—an insolent old harridan, in short, whose parties were amusing because one met odd people; but Helen herself always pitied poor Mr Parry, who was understood to be shut up downstairs with cases full of gems, while his wife enjoyed herself in the drawing-room. ‘Not that I believe what people say against her—although she hints, of course—’ Upon which Mrs Flushing cried out with delight:",

After a sleepless night--a night of dry misery and crazy unreal plans--she had telegraphed him: “Have you gone mad? Is there really no other copy? Come this evening after nine. I must see you.” The day dragged by. She did not see Tarrant again before he departed for the office. She had nothing further to say to him, and was afraid of making another blunder if the subject of Vance came up. If she had not foolishly reproached her husband for destroying a masterpiece he might have been glad to let Vance off his bargain--but now she knew he would exact his pound of flesh. In what form? she wondered. She was not clear about the legal aspects of the case, but she knew Tarrant would move cautiously and make certain of his rights in advance. The meaningless hours crawled on. Her husband was dining at Mrs. Pulsifer’s--a big affair for some foreign critic who had been imported to receive a university degree. She was sure of her evening alone with Vance. But the hours passed, the evening came, and he did not come with it, and he sent no message. She sat waiting for him till after midnight; then she heard the click of her husband’s latchkey and hurried away to her room to avoid meeting him. When she looked at herself in the glass as she undressed she saw a ravaged face and eyes swollen with crying. She had wept unconsciously as she sat there alone and waited.",

(Sue and I saw Bo Diddley there.) I learned to pull pints of beer properly under the close supervision of a career barman named Peter. Peter told me that if I got anything wrong, the customer had the right to throw the beer (but not the glass) in my face and demand a repull. The list of punishable errors was long: too much head, too little head, flat beer, warm beer, too little beer, any hint of soap in the glass. This news had its intended effect: I pulled scared and carefully. Weekday nights were slow and easy. Friday and Saturday nights at the Patch, which was in a big, dark, barnlike building out behind the old pub, were madness, with screaming customers six deep at the bar, blasting punk rock, and ten thousand rum and Cokes. The summer tourist season was starting. After work, I would walk down the beach road back to Kirra, grateful for the silence, stopping at the top of the point where the great wave was said to break, peering into the sloshing blackness beyond the base of the jetty. All the Gold Coast waves we had surfed so far had been sweet, warm, soft, a little sloppy. People said Kirra, when it broke, was a rocket-fueled pointbreak with crazy, hammering power. That was hard to picture.",

At these altitudes, in the Himalayan autumn, the difference between sun and shade is striking: the stream by my tent is clogged by ice, whereas lizards lie sunning on the rock slope above camp where I climb up to get warm and write these notes.",

When I went to my hometown library to look up books on Paraguay, the kind of titles I found were The Lost Paradise, A Vanished Arcadia, Picturesque Paraguay. For decades, even centuries, Paraguay—like any country, perhaps, where people can derive something out of nothing—had been regarded as a utopia just waiting to be realized, an empty space waiting to be converted into a private paradise. “When I first came to Asunción from Spain,” wrote the Paraguayan poet Josefina Plá, “I realized that I’d arrived in Paradise. The air was warm, the light was tropical, and the shuttered, colonial houses suggested sensual, tranquil lives.” Even G. K. Chesterton, who never saw the place, more or less rehearsed the conventional wisdom when he wrote: “Ye bade the Red Man rise like the Red Clay … And man lost Paradise in Paraguay.”",

As it did in England in the 17th and Europe in the 20th, so it does in South Africa in the 21st century.: the fire collapses on itself and creates embers—chunks of wood that are extremely hot. These chunks fall into the fire pit of the lapa. During a bush braai, these embers are removed with tongs and transferred to a metal plate. Above this plate is a grill, which is heated by the embers and on which the food cooks.",

    "target_paragraph": "With full stomachs, we paddled to the Abaco Inn via the waters of White Sound, where a friend of Eddie was staying with his wife. On the way out to the island, a powerboat got confused and meandered out of the channel, almost running aground. Eddie stopped to explain to them the channel markers and the rule of \"red right return\". When returning to port, one should keep the red channel markers to the right (and the green markers to the left).\nEddie's friend's wife saw us from her bungalow and came out to offer us cold bottles of water. I wanted to drink mine quickly and go surfing, so I gulped down about half of the bottle and was instantly rewarded with the sharp pain in the forehead with which we are all familiar. I just wanted to go surfing, but now I had to stand there on the porch and wait for the ice-cream headache to go away before again attempting to finish the bottle of water. The pain subsided and I put the bottle back to my lips. I needed the water, but again was impatient and suffered the consequences an embarrassing second time.\nWe walked across the island (only about 50 yards) as golf carts carrying vacationers passed by, arriving at the beach on the Atlantic side. A crude and sloping concrete stairway with steps that were too wide for easy walking led us down to the sandy beach on the north side of the Inn, which sat on a rocky bluff. The sun was intense and the cool water beckoned.\nWe first paddled out about 100 yards to a spot called Rush Reef, which was just barely breaking with waist-high waves in 4' of clear water. The man from the powerboat joined us on a rented SUP while his wife laid in the sand on the beach. She was the only person on the beach and wore a bright red one-piece bathing suit and a big sun hat, lounging and reading a book while we surfed.\nAfter surfing for a while on the outside, we paddled back to the inside (close to the beach) and surfed Japan's, a fast right point breaking just off the sharp rocky bluff and finishing in water only inches deep over reef. I got a few fun waves here, only contacting the reef with my foot once, but not enough to get cut. The scalding-hot pavement on the walk back across the skinny island was worse on my feet. I did not bring my sandals (or my kayak paddle) because I didn’t want to leave anything on the beach. I pictured young thieves peeking out of the bushes, ready to steel whatever we left there. But the beach was a lonely place and completely free of thieves. I think my time surfing in Costa Rica, where you cannot leave your sandals on the beach for even a second, influenced my decision to leave my sandals on the boat, which led to my very hot feet.",

Even now it has a vaguely raffish air in parts ? a tattoo parlour and one or two of the sort of dive bars through whose windows you expect to see Popeye and Bluto trading blows ? but these are fading relics. For years, restaurateurs have been dragging Nyhavn almost forcibly upmarket and most of the places now are yuppie bars and designer restaurants, but very agreeable places for all that, since the Danes don’t seem to be the least bit embarrassed about living well, which is after all how it should be.",

I had never been to an Asian cinema, and was anyway interested to check his claim that English-language films were on show in China. I had always understood that Western films were kept well away from the People’s Republic to make sure no one ever got a hint of the life enjoyed on the affluent side of the Bamboo Curtain. This idea had been confirmed by my guidebook to China which maintained that the Chinese were kept going on a cinematic diet of The Chuang Minority Loves Chairman Mao with a Burning Love and The Production Brigade Celebrates the Arrival in the Hills of the Manure Collectors. But Salindi had been telling the truth. At the Kashgar Odeon (or whatever name it went by) two films were currently being shown. One was advertised by pictures of the familiar ‘Happy Peasant’ variety, and that film might well have been about manure collectors. But there was no mistaking the second film. It was Dr No. We bought two tickets and went inside. The film had just begun.",

My roots go down to the depths of the world, through earth dry with brick, and damp earth, through veins of lead and silver. I am all fibre. All tremors shake me, and the weight of the earth is pressed to my ribs. Up here my eyes are green leaves, unseeing. I am a boy in grey flannels with a belt fastened by a brass snake up here.

Sometimes one passes a few human beings, deplorably out of place, but doing their best, generally, to make up for their ungeometrical appearance by mounting bicycles.

From outside the town I saw palms waving over the flat roofs. I had covered the two and a half miles to Gur, the city that Ardeshir founded about a.d. 220, and was regretting my refusal of a mount, when the clatter of horses in pursuit made me turn. First rode the Governor on a rearing brown stallion, followed by his son on a bucking grey; next the mayor and some other gentlemen; then a posse of armed soldiers, one mounted on a strawberry roan. In the middle of the cavalcade pranced a huge white ass, carrying a mountain of carpets but no rider. “This,” said the Governor, “is for you. Our guests do not walk.”",

He experimented with various combinations of hot sandwiches and found that sausages in a roll kept warm longer than anything else he tried. He secured the right to sell his “red hots,” as he rather generously called them, at the Polo Grounds and almost at once began doing brisk business. It was Stevens’s products that the cartoonist Tad Dorgan called “hot dogs,” in jocular reference to their supposed principal constituent. Stevens loved the term, and by the 1920s hot dogs were indelibly associated with baseball games all across the nation, and Stevens had the concession operations at all three New York ballparks and others as far afield as Chicago. He was also rich in a way that most baseball club owners could only ever dream of being.",

    "target_paragraph": "The Wiltshire section of the Ridgeway passes through arguably the most sacralized terrain in England. Between 3,000 and 4,000 years ago, vast devotional interventions were made in the landscape here. Megaliths and henges were raised, sarsens were organized in avenues, earthworks were dug, and the cryptically simple edifice of Silbury Hill – a huge truncated cone of tamped chalk – was somehow constructed. At Avebury and Silbury, as at Minya Konka, an ease of relation is expressed between topography and belief. And paths, tracks and cursuses were intricately involved with this Neolithic landscape theatre. The archaeologist Christopher Tilley, in his pioneering work The Phenomenology of Landscape, argues that to understand many of the sacred landscapes of Neolithic Britain we need first to understand the importance of the ancient paths that both link and bypass them. Walking, both as approach and traverse, was crucial to the dramas of perception: what Tilley calls ‘the strong paths’ of this region were used to ‘pattern’ the relationship ‘between sites and their settings’.",

Finger-walking the shelves of a library one morning, I discovered the books of a man called Vaughan Cornish. In 1895 Cornish had moved into a small house on the Dorset coast near Poole, the precise location of which I was not able to establish. During his years there, Cornish became beguiled by the waves that fell upon the beach beneath his garden. ‘Every day,’ he recalled in a memoir written near the end of his life:the waves of the sea - beautiful, mysterious and insistent - drew me more and more to the path on the cliff whence I could watch them curl and break, and listen to their splash upon the sandy shore. I stood there on the afternoon of a calm day in early autumn at the time of low water of a spring tide. The little waves, gliding slowly in over the flat sands, bent round the ends of a shoal, as waves of light are refracted, and, meeting, passed through each other, each to continue its own course.",

There was also a fine old three-story farmhouse. It had a warm thatched roof and high paper windows, and on the timber floors of its second and third stories the old silkworm trays and frames stood intact. This solid old farmhouse had been trundled plank by plank from a little mountain village some sixteen kilometers outside Tsuruoka, and was now fenced off behind a turnstile earning money for the proprietors of the Chido Museum.

And almost no one was just there to see the scenery. Everyone was going through something, running away from something, processing something, putting off something. I learned that night in Mount Maunganui that my sweet, cheerful friend Josh had moved to the country in New Zealand after ten years in San Francisco because of a nasty little speed habit he had acquired as a result of the fifteen-hour workdays of a chef. He couldn’t quite figure out how to stop, but thought removing himself to a green, quiet place at the bottom of the world might do it. He was right.",

To me those last are among the most beautiful of creatures, their russet flanks darkly striped, their horns elegantly curved, all their movements exquisite.

With each rainfall, water-drops are sent wandering across the surfaces of the limestone, etching the track of their passage with carbonic acid as they go.

Through the action of water, a hairline crack over time therefore becomes a runnel, which becomes a fracture site, which becomes an escarpment edge.",
