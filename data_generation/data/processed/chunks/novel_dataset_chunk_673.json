Touring Switzerland in the winter of 1779, Goethe made his way to Chamonix with the intention of ‘walking on the ice itself, and considering these immense masses close at hand’. He took ‘nearly a hundred steps round about on the wave-like crystal cliffs’ before retreating back to terra firma (‘the more firmer, the less terror’, one late-Victorian tourist would pun nervously in a hotel album a century later, clearly shaken by his trip on the ice) and clambering up to the Montanvert, the rocky outcrop which provided the best view of the Mer de Glace. There he met an Englishman who gave his name simply as Blaire, and who had ‘erected a convenient hut upon the spot, from the window of which he and his guests could survey the sea of ice’. ‘What a devotion to the spectacle of the ice!’ noted Goethe in his journal.",

The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.",

    "target_paragraph": "Afterwards, it was in confused musical terms that the stages of our progress strung themselves together in my memory. This is how they resound there still. Overtures and preludes followed each other as courtyard opened on courtyard. Ascending staircases unfolded as vaingloriously as pavanes. Cloisters developed with the complexity of double, triple and quadruple fugues. The suites of state apartments concatenated with the variety, the mood and the décor of symphonic movements. Among the receding infinity of gold bindings in the library, the polished reflections, the galleries and the terrestrial and celestial globes gleaming in the radiance of their flared embrasures, music, again, seemed to intervene. A magnificent and measured polyphony crept in one’s ears. It was accompanied by woodwind at first, then, at shortening intervals, by violins and violas and ’cellos and then double basses while a sudden scroll-work of flutes unfurled in mid-air; to be joined at last by a muted fanfare from the ceiling, until everything vibrated with a controlled and pervading splendour. Beyond it, in the church, a dome crowned the void. Light spread in the painted hollows and joined the indirect glow from the ovals and the lunettes and the windows of the rotunda. Galleries and scalloped baldachinos and tiered cornices rose to meet it; and the soft light, falling on the fluted pilasters and circles of gold spokes, and on the obelisks wreathed with their sculpted clouds, suffused the honeycomb side-chapels and then united in a still and universal radiance. Music might just have fallen silent; unless it were about to begin. In the imagination, instruments assembled – unseen cymbals just ajar that would collide with a resonance no more strident than a whisper; drums an inch below their padded sticks with palms ready to muffle them; oboes slanting, their reeds mute for a moment more; brass and woodwind waiting; fingers stretched motionless across the wires of a harp and fifty invisible bows poised in the air above fifty invisible sets of strings.",

People moved in and abruptly moved out again, with ashen faces and terrible wounds. By 1930, when the house went on the market one last time, no buyer could be found. It stayed empty for twenty years, and finally in 1950 it was pulled down. Now the site is overgrown and weedy, and you could walk past it without ever guessing that one of the finest houses in the North had once stood here. But if you poke about in the tall grass, as we did now, you can find one of the old conservatory floors, made of neatly patterned black-and-white tiles. It was strangely reminiscent of the Roman mosaic I had seen at Winchcombe, and scarcely less astonishing.",

A half muffled noise of light wheels interrupted him. Boldwood turned back into the road. It was the mail cart – a crazy two-wheeled vehicle, hardly heavy enough to resist a puff of wind. The driver held out a letter. Boldwood took it and opened it, expecting another anonymous one.

When the woman had left, Faubion turned to Garbo and said, ‘That’s a cruel way to treat your fans! What would it have been to you to give your signature to that woman? She would have treasured it all her life.’ Garbo retorted, ‘If I’d given her my autograph, she would’ve grown bored and put it aside in a week or two. But because I refused, she’ll treasure my autograph until the day she dies.’",

Magadan is about nine hundred miles from Yakutsk, on the Pacific Ocean’s Sea of Okhotsk. The highway runs through the coldest inhabited places on earth—Oimyakon is in its vicinity—and during its early years of construction, workers on its Kolyma section north of Magadan almost all died before the road was done. At the peak of operation in the thirties and forties, the mines of Kolyma produced perhaps 50 percent of all the gold being mined at that time in the world. By comparing the number of deaths in the Kolyma mines with the corresponding output of gold, historians have estimated that each ton of Kolyma gold cost between seven hundred and a thousand lives, or about one life for every two pounds of gold. The gold, sometimes carried out of the hills in backpacks, began its journey to western Russia along this highway.",

The tourist brochures present it as the island’s first religious and political capital but this more than slightly overstates the case. True, Velasquez founded Cuba’s first European settlement here in 1511, naming it ‘Nuestra Señora de la Asuncion de Baracoa’. However, he soon moved his capital to the more accessible Santiago, leaving Baracoa with little to show for its moment of glory. During the next two centuries nothing of architectural consequence happened, apart from three forts built between 1739 and 1742 in reaction to increasing Anglo-Spanish hostility and pirate activity. As a convenient harbour for lone ships trading with Havana, Baracoa became largely dependent on smuggling pigs, poultry, honey and precious woods – irresistible pirate-bait. French corsairs first plundered the port in 1546 and frequently returned thereafter.",

    "target_paragraph": "Finally came the language. Nearly all Dutch people speak perfect English, thanks to an excellent education and a population small enough to mean it isn’t worth dubbing American films and television programmes into the local language. However, outside of Amsterdam it is relatively rare to hear English spoken in the street, and I quickly became frustrated at being unable to follow conversations, read menus or tell the difference between alcohol-free beer and real beer in the supermarket. Dutch friends provided a crash course in key phrases every Englishman abroad should know: ‘Mag ik een biertje’ (can I have a beer); ‘Je bent mooi’ (you are beautiful); ‘Ik heb het niet gedaan, ik wil een advocaat’ (I didn’t do it, I want a lawyer). When this vocabulary proved insufficient I took a few lessons with a private tutor, a kind, curly-haired woman who’d broken her hip in a cycling accident and was consigned to a Hitchcockian convalescence watching the birds through her rear window. We never studied as such, but gossiped in a mixture of Dutch and English, and I quickly reached a level where I could understand almost everything people said and stammer my way through a reply. Reading was harder, though, and I battled my way through picture books belonging to a Dutch friend’s eighteen-month-old daughter. Miffy (Nijntje) was fun, but The Very Hungry Caterpillar was beyond me. Out in public I still regularly made mistakes, such as the time when instead of asking someone whether she was cold, I accidentally called her something else beginning with ‘c’.",

In the affaire des knickers, for example, he was definitely up against it, because Mother had him on toast and we all knew it. Mr. Clarke had stuck his neck out; he had written her a letter signifying his disapproval of our costumes, and Mother was joyfully able to point out that his disapproval was purely private and personal. Besides, the newspapers had already made it clear that the Board of Education, upon due examination of its rights in the matter, had admitted that it couldn't expel Dauphine and me from class or dictate what we were to wear as long as we didn't come to school in a state suggesting nudity.

    "target_paragraph": "IT GREW RAPIDLY WARMER. HAVING nothing to do until the late-afternoon boat left, I walked along the deserted beach of white sand. It was hot, dusty. I decided to go swimming and left my clothes on an upturned boat amid scuttling crabs.\nThe water was warm and very salty. Floating near me were several transparent jellyfish—milky round globs. They looked as though someone very large had been spitting.\nI had heard that they bit, or stung. They didn’t look dangerous, but standing, water to my waist, I hailed two small boys walking along the road. One of them suggested that they were dangerous only if purple. Reassured, I swam farther out.\nThe water was warm on the surface but cool deeper down. Salty, filled with cold currents, it also contained a number of tiny fish that nibbled at both the fronds of seaweed underfoot and my toes. I struck out, as though in a large warm bath, my waves lazily forming a wake.\nThe shadows of eagles passed continually over the shallow water. Against the glare of the sun I could glimpse their great shapes, like daytime bats. Farther out I found a seaweed-covered underwater reef on which I could just stand. Nearby was a boat from which a man and two boys were laying nets.\nThe man and I talk. He works, teaching the little boys not to put it that way, not to make so much noise, not to push each other into the water, and at the same time tells me about the fish. I stand up to my neck in the warm water, the cold seaweed coiling around my ankles. He continues to tell me the names of the fish—a long list—and the boat drifts about my head in a large circle. At the end of the list he adds, as an afterthought: “Oh—yes. You must be careful of the poison fish.”\n“What poison fish?”\nHe thinks. “What was his name now?”\nHe thinks for a long time, trying various names, shaking his head, unable to remember, while the cold seaweed wraps itself about my ankles, something brushes against a toe, something else nibbles.\nFinally: “There now, I’ve forgotten. At any rate, they are poisonous. Very poisonous. People die, you know.”\n“Oh?”\n“Anyway, the big thing is to remember not to stand in the seaweed, because it is full of them, and if you step on them, they bite you and kill you, you see?”\nHe looked on nodding approvingly as I flailed about and began paddling on the surface. “That’s right, that’s right,” he said. “That way they won’t get at you so easily.”\nThen, smiling, he began to row away, the little boys, busy in their importance, pulling ropes, tying things into place. After having entangled myself in their net, for the boat had circled me, I swam back, splashing as much as possible.\nWhen I was safely on the sandy beach I heard a banging sound and looked up. The two little boys had sticks in their hands and were beating the boat. It looked as though they were trying to make it go faster. Then the boat turned and I saw what they were doing. The net was slowly closing. The boys were banging to make the fish move into the wake. The nets would close and the fish would be caught and pulled in.\nThe hollow sound of wood on wood echoed in the open, sunny bay. It sounded like Buddhist drums, those hollow, gourd-shaped, ball-like objects in every temple, like the empty tone they make when struck, which carries so far and makes one think of vestments, incense, and the musty smell of old temples.",

The portico, open at either end, framed in delicious pictures. The waiter led me through a spacious boarded hall where a narrow table along one side told of recent supper, through intricate passages, across little inner courts with shrubs and greenery, and blue sky above, and lilac bushes in tubs looking as though they had to pretend they were orange trees and that this was Italy and that the white plaster walls, so mouldy in places, were the marble walls of some classic baths, up strange stairs that sloped alarmingly to one side, along more passages, and throwing open one of the many small white doors, said with pride, 'Here is the apartment; it is a fine, a big, a splendid apartment.'",

One hour out of camp he purposely fell and said he hurt his leg; the money was with his friend at camp. Sunny today and we have to push on. Jang-bu showed his annoyance by beating the hell out of the fellow. That cured the leg but he would not go to the pass. He suggested going down the khola to the lake. I did not like the idea, knowing what the canyons are like. But the sherpas wanted that route—and Gyaltsen had never bought himself boots with the boot money, I found out. He wore sneakers and it was very cold. I did not want frozen feet on my conscience. We forced our yak friend to carry the load down the canyon until at 2 p.m. he fled. But we got most of our money’s worth. A hellish trip. Ice falls, slippery snow-covered rocks, 6\" trails along ledges covered with snow with cliff above and below. Since I was heaviest, everyone felt it logical that I lead and test ice bridges as we crossed and recrossed stream. Logical but not always pleasant: once I fell in, getting soaked from chest on down, and got my feet wet several times. By evening had done most of canyon: at least we had big fire.",

This is the biggest (though not very big) town between Vientiane and Luang Prabang and at first glance it seems dreary: a mile or so of small shophouses and dwellings lining Route 13 at the base of a steep ridge, partially forested. On a ledge half-way up the ridge stand the ruins of a bombed wat and here the atmosphere is odd – uneasy. In general, the locals encountered along the main street – a considerable percentage Hmong – seemed less welcoming than their compatriots elsewhere. But I soon discovered the real Kasi, the friendly and attractive peripheral bans where most people live.",

Concrete bunker homes have roofs of rubble and twisted metal, plastic is piled up on earth huts and the streets of sandy soil are covered in rubbish. Battered buffalo, black-bristled pigs, skittish goats, horribly thin horses and red-arsed mangy monkeys graze the waste. We never lose sight of humanity. Women in bright cotton saris are shopping, sweeping, threshing, planting, weeding, water-collecting, plaiting hair and carrying huge loads of produce on their heads. Children play cricket, fly kites, scrub clean for school and scamper about. Men are mostly sitting on string charpoy beds, drinking small cups of chai, playing cards or just squatting on their heels and watching the world go by.",

The bathhouse attendants had thoughtfully provided a net for skimming off the mosquitoes and flies that had died on the surface of the water, but I was too tired to bother and too badly blistered from the sun to do more than sit slumped on the tiled edge soaking my feet.

Bartlett wanted everyone involved in some way to bolster ship camaraderie and spirit. Typically, there was a built-in segregation on board: the staff and sailors stayed mostly to their forward quarters; the Eskimos spent most of their time in the laboratory, which was also up front; and the officers and scientific staff inhabited the saloon, Cabin De Luxe, and messroom aft. Bartlett encouraged total group participation. He even convinced the irascible Dr. Mackay to act as umpire, pinning a paper rosette on the curmudgeon’s coat designating him an official.",

    "target_paragraph": "In 1988 we lost our energetic overachiever Nishi. He collapsed from overwork, and was replaced by a traditionalist from the Sumitomo Trust staff. At the same time, Dallas assigned an American manager to the project. The antagonism between the American manager and the Japanese staff was a sight to behold. As the buffer between them, it was fairly rough on me, but it was also a great learning opportunity. Until the American manager’s arrival, I had always thought of workplace relations in the US as being equal, and those in Japan as hierarchical. But the Japanese-division chief guided his subordinates with a very gentle hand. Nishi, for instance, would frequently say to Starnes, ‘I understand your point, but until I can convince my subordinates, I can’t move. Give me time.’ Of course, this was often no more than a negotiating ploy, but I noticed that Nishi really did consult with his staff, and often left important decisions up to them. The American corporate structure, on the other hand, is far more authoritarian. It’s modeled on boot camp: the manager gives commands, and his subordinates carry them out. In terms of company organization, the Japanese way is much more democratic.",

    "target_paragraph": "I should say something here about Los Angeles, moving back to. It was an article of faith among our circle of young ex-residents that L.A. equaled living death. If Ireland was the sow that ate its farrow, L.A. was the John Wayne Gacy of cities, smothering its children with a toxic beach towel of poisoned air, mindless growth, and bad values. Whatever we were looking for—beauty, wisdom, uncrowded surf—it wasn’t there. Or so we believed. (When I later learned that Thomas Pynchon, one of my undergraduate literary heroes, had apparently lived in Manhattan Beach, in the dreaded South Bay, in the late ’60s and had found its grubby, bleached-out vitality inspiring, I suddenly saw it differently. I felt brought up short by my own shortsightedness, my unoriginality. Then again, I loathed the novel that his South Bay research ultimately produced.) The persistent nostalgia that infected most surfers, even young ones—the notion that it was always better yesterday, and better still the day before—was related to this dystopian view of Southern California, the suburban megalopolis that was, after all, the capital of modern surfing and head office of the nascent surf industry. But we took this nostalgia with us wherever we went. In Lahaina my imagination was captured by the news that the town had once contained a great river, big enough for whaling ships to sail up and take on freshwater. It made sense. If Puu Kukui, straight up the mountains, was the second-rainiest spot in the world, where was all the runoff? Diverted for irrigation by the corporations that grew the sugarcane all over west Maui, of course. Modern Lahaina was, as a result, parched, dusty, and unnaturally hot.",

The narrow bungalow was unpainted. The clothes hung out to dry were still, stiff, as if desiccated by the hot afternoon sun. Old car tires, the ones the children played with, were piled under the kuka tree. Olanna knew the tranquil flatness of the yard would change soon, when the children came back from school. The families would leave doors open and the veranda and kitchen would fill with chatter. Uncle Mbaezi’s family lived in two rooms. In the first, where worn sofas were pushed aside at night to make room for mats, Olanna unpacked the things she had brought?bread, shoes, bottles of cream? while Aunty Ifeka stood back watching, her hands behind her back. “May another person do for you. May another person do for you,” Aunty Ifeka said.",
