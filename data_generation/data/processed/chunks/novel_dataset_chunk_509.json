As far as injuries go, this was a pretty unimpressive one to get knocked out by. A broken femur, fine—defeat accepted—but a common case of tendonitis? Seriously? That was like dropping out of the Olympics due to an ingrown hair. No way. I couldn’t go home. I needed to walk again. Especially since Masha had told me she’d heard rumors of Via Francigena pilgrims, upon reaching Rome, getting ushered into a secret room at the Vatican. There, I imagined being handed a tea-stained scroll with a better survival guide than the one I’d written myself:",

There were moments when she frightened him; when he would have given the world to believe either that she was five years older than she said, or else that she did not know the meaning of the words she used. At such moments it was always the vision of Rose Sellars which took possession of him, and he found himself breathlessly explaining this strange child to her, and feeling that what was so clear to him would become incomprehensible as soon as he tried to make it clear to others, and especially to Mrs. Sellars. “There’s nothing to be done about it,” he thought despairingly. Aloud he remarked, in an impatient tone: “You’re very foolish not to go to school.”",

They were excellent surfers but playing it safe, riding the shoulders of waves that were already breaking long before we caught sight of them. Effectively, they were contenting themselves with scraps. Lovely scraps, to be sure. Still, I was on my gun. I was nervous but not weak with fear, even when the heavy sections on the set waves threw out and boomed upcoast. I started moving deeper, paddling west. The usual lineup markers were a pair of brick smokestacks, but those, I could see, wouldn’t work today. The main peak today was much farther west.",

The glow of the full moon bathed everything in a lustrous light. He walked about a hundred yards beyond the ship, the dry ice crunching beneath his boots, then turned around. Large hummocks of ice cast long, disfigured shadows, and the mounds themselves had been polished to a glassy sheen so that they shimmered like giant gemstones. Stars, muted by the flaming moon, flecked the cloudless sky and auroral streamers hung down like shimmering curtains. He turned and took in the Karluk, which rose above the scene like an ice ghost, her rails and deck and rigging sheathed in glittering rime. All at once, McKinlay grew aware of that presence again, a sense that he was not alone. It was something otherworldly, “an exaltation beyond all earthly feeling.” The feeling slowly faded away, but the memory was emblazoned in him. When he got back in his bunk, he wrote in his journal, “Whatever hardships the future might hold, whatever fate the North had in store for me, I felt supremely glad I had come.”",

Yet they were happy. Even Menzies-Legh, a grey-haired, badly-preserved man, older a good deal, I should say, than I am, was joking and then laughing at his jokes with the fledglings, and Lord Sigismund and Jellaby were describing almost with exultation how brisk they had felt after a bath they had taken at five in the morning in the Medway.",

Two men left; two men arrived, Americans both. But the President of the United States congratulates only one, and by strange coincidence the one whom the President has not found worthy of being mentioned by name is named Levine.”",

Sometimes there were small political gatherings outside Dimitrov’s tomb and you could see that people were enjoying the unaccustomed luxury of being able to talk freely. One evening outside the old royal palace somebody set up along a wall an arrangement of photographs of the exiled royals, King Simeon and his family. Crowds pressed to see the pictures. I thought it odd at first, but you can imagine what it would be like in Britain if the royal family had been banished forty years ago (now there’s a thought for you) and people had been denied any official information about them. So suddenly now the Bulgarians could see what had become of their equivalent of Princess Margaret and the Duke of Edinburgh and all the others. I had a look myself, rather hoping to discover that King Simeon was now managing a Dairy Queen in Sweetwater, Texas, but in fact he appeared to be living a life of elegance and comfort in Paris, so I declined the invitation to sign a petition calling for his reinstatement.",

So it was: rectangular, like a small stable with two stalls and a verandah. The stalls were bedrooms, containing native beds, platforms of beaten earth spread with matting. The walls were papered thickly with old advertisements and photographs out of illustrated papers, most of them German or American. Over a chair made out of an old packing-case was an article by General Pershing on Youth; beautiful women showed their teeth brushed with Chlorodone, handsome men displayed their ready-made suitings, somebody wondered why she wasn’t a social success, and a man in uniform denounced a clause of the Treaty of Versailles. It was a really fine house, the only one like it in the town; we didn’t have another lodging in a native town so good before Monrovia.",

Then I’m standing by myself on an empty, straight road in the middle of the Bolivian Amazon, watching the bus lights fade. There’s a soft haze that makes the thin, broken tarmac float like water. Tall grasses and trees, green, purple, orange and gold, overhang the banks. There are leaves of every shade until everything seems to melt into a looming vastness. It smells hot, as if the air is too tight, and I struggle to breathe. The sky is blue but the edges are already turning reddish gold. It’ll be night soon. From inside the bus, I’d thought there would be a resounding silence out here, but I was wrong. The jungle hums, speaking no language I’ve heard before.",

Halo and Lorry, as children, had found in a popular natural history book a striking picture of a bristling caterpillar sitting upright on its tail, with the caption: “The male Puss-Moth when irritated after a full meal.” They instantly christened their progenitor the Puss-Moth, but modified the legend by explaining to strangers that he was more often irritated before a full meal than after--especially when kept waiting for it. Today Mr. Spear was unusually perpendicular and bristling, and his small, rather too carefully modeled features were positively grimacing with anger. To his daughter long habit made the sight more comic than impressive; but she was vexed that the question of the motor had to be dealt with.",

We strolled the paved trails around the hotel tower, the barracks, and the villas. Our guidebook mentioned a village on the south end of Elephantine Island (on which the hotel stands), but a high, stone wall stretched from bank to bank and there was no way to reach the village on foot. The wall led us back to the west side of the island where several boatmen lay in the grass or sat on chairs under the shade of mile-high palm trees. We waved to them from afar, knowing we would likely hire one to take us on a tour soon enough. That second day, after touring the Old Cataract Hotel and the Nubia Museum, we followed the trail behind the hotel and found the same group of men sitting in the same seats as the day before. As we neared, one boatman, a large man, with dark brown skin, and hands like sledgehammers, jumped to his feet.",

The answer changed as we changed. Caroline sometimes left for weeks herself, to visit friends and family in Zimbabwe, and the separations did us good, I thought, at least in our early years. We needed the breaks. Later, it got more difficult to be apart. Caroline retained a firm vein of self-reliance, though. She was unusually good at being alone. I sometimes thought she got it from her mother, June, who was both deeply attached to her husband and a tough, well-guarded character who listened all night to the BBC’s Africa Service and rarely slept. Caroline’s father, Mark, who did not particularly like to travel, nonetheless spent a great deal of time on overseas business trips as a minerals trader. Caroline worked extremely hard—she was, as a lawyer, the same perfectionist she had been as a printmaker. My Madeira jaunts were partly redeemed in her mind because they were not just surf trips but writing retreats. I felt the same way, certainly. I got lonely. There was still no Internet or cell phone service in Jardim, so I called home at night from a phone booth in the praça. Next to the booth was a communal birdcage, home to parakeets of many colors. In the daytime, the birds sang and pecked at a huge cabbage someone threw in their cage. At night, they fluffed up into little gray silent balls to stay warm. I would huddle in the booth on wet, windy nights, straining to hear the comforting notes of Caroline’s voice, her cheerful reports on the luxe life of our daily grind.",

A double row of great trees forms a shady walk on the edge of the grounds, and it is bountifully supplied with those stone seats so fatal, I am sure, to many an honest bath-guest. The grounds, trim and shady, have neat paths winding into their recesses from the road, with no fence or wall or obstacle of any sort to be surmounted by the timid tourist; every tourist may walk in them as long and as often as he likes without the least preliminary bother of gates and lodges.",

He worries more about the Transvaal’s future water supply than about the Republic’s future government. In his boyhood, fifty-odd years ago, several now-vanished springs and streams blessed this region; lines of dead or dying bushes still mark the streams’ stony courses. In the decades ahead, George foresees water becoming more precious than oil – or gold, or diamonds, or uranium.",

The scene where we had taken off, just an hour before, bore virtually no similarity to the one where we came down. As we neared the ground, we flew just above fences with black fence posts shaped like upside-down L’s and trailing broken strands of black barbed wire with big black barbs, like something from a World War II movie, maybe Stalag 17. And in America, when a plane crashes in or near an airport, management whisks the wreckage away, so as not to dishearten future travelers. Here, plane wrecks had merely been moved over to one side of the runway. We taxied by a couple of crumpled-up passenger aircraft and one crushed helicopter.",

But, at the same time, even the faces that were most exposed to view, and therefore most tautly under control, disclosed a sudden impulsive tremor which, unless directly checked, would have developed into an outburst of laughter. The first sight of Mr Rodney was irresistibly ludicrous. He was very red in the face, whether from the cool November night or nervousness, and every movement, from the way he wrung his hands to the way he jerked his head to right and left, as though a vision drew him now to the door, now to the window, bespoke his horrible discomfort under the stare of so many eyes. He was scrupulously well dressed, and a pearl in the centre of his tie seemed to give him a touch of aristocratic opulence. But the rather prominent eyes and the impulsive stammering manner, which seemed to indicate a torrent of ideas intermittently pressing for utterance and always checked in their course by a clutch of nervousness, drew no pity, as in the case of a more imposing personage, but a desire to laugh, which was, however, entirely lacking in malice. Mr Rodney was evidently so painfully conscious of the oddity of his appearance, and his very redness and the starts to which his body was liable gave such proof of his own discomfort, that there was something endearing in this ridiculous susceptibility, although most people would probably have echoed Denham’s private exclamation, ‘Fancy marrying a creature like that!’",

They also falsify the current situation by claiming that their nation is the best … a claim especially virulent, because the identification between Jewish religion and Jewish nationality has prevailed for so long and still prevails among many Jews. It should not be forgotten that democracy and the rule of law were brought into Judaism from the outside. Before the advent of the modern state, Jewish communities were mostly ruled by rabbis who employed arbitrary and cruel methods as bad as those employed by totalitarian regimes. The dearest wish of the current Jewish fundamentalists is to restore this state of affairs … The dangers of their being established in Israel as at least part of the ruling power are great.",

They had a curious, indefinable remote elegance, something conventional and \"fin-de-siècle\". But not our century. The wonderful artificial delicacy of the eighteenth. The boys had big, perfect ruffs round their necks: and behind were slung old, cream-coloured Spanish shawls, for warmth. They were frail as tobacco flowers, and with remote, cold elegance they fluttered by the carriage from which emerged a large black-satin Mama. Fluttering their queer little butterfly feet on the pavement, hovering round the large Mama like three frail-tissued ghosts, they found their way past the solid, seated carabinieri into the hall.",
