Freydis claimed she’d gone to ask about purchasing the brothers’ ship and been turned down, as well as assaulted. “But you’re such a coward that you will repay neither dishonor done to me nor to yourself,” she said. “Unless you avenge this, I will divorce you!”",

Curtains had been taken down, ornaments removed from their shelves, pictures from their hangings; and the grand piano stood where it had never yet been allowed to stand, in a draught between the window and the door. Tripping over a Persian rug, he saw that the floor was littered with tapestries and rich stuffs of magnificent design. On his left was a miscellaneous collection of brass and copper ware, on his right a heap of shields and weapons of barbarous warfare. On all the tables and cabinets there stood an array of Venetian glass, and statuettes in bronze, marble, and terra-cotta. He was looking about for Miss Craven, when that lady arose from a confused ocean of cushions and Oriental drapery—Aphrodite in an \"Art\" tea-gown. She greeted him with childlike effusion.",

    "target_paragraph": "Miriam almost ran home from seeing Minna into the three o’clock train ... dear beautiful, beautiful Hanover ... the sunlight blazed from the rain-sprinkled streets. Everything shone. Bright confident shops, happy German cafés moved quickly by as she fled along. Sympathetic eyes answered hers. She almost laughed once or twice when she met an eye and thought how funny she must look “tearing along” with her long, thick, black jacket bumping against her.... She would leave it off to-morrow and go out in a blouse and her long black lace scarf.... She imagined Harriett at her side—Harriett’s long scarf and longed to do the “crab walk” for a moment or the halfpenny dip, hippety-hop. She did them in her mind.\nShe heard the sound of her boot soles tapping the shining pavement as she hurried along ... she would write a short note to her mother “a girl about my own age with very wealthy parents who wants a companion” and enclose a note for Eve or Harriett ... Eve, “Imagine me in Pomerania, my dear” ... and tell her about the coffee parties and the skating and the sleighing and Minna’s German Christmasses....\nShe saw Minna’s departing face leaning from the carriage window, its new gay boldness: “I shall no more when we are at home call you Miss Henderson.”\nWhen she got back to Waldstrasse she found Anna’s successor newly arrived cleaning the neglected front doorstep. Her lean yellow face looked a vacant response to Miriam’s enquiry for Fräulein Pfaff.\n“Ist Fräulein zu Hause,” she repeated. The girl shook her head vaguely.\nHow quiet the house seemed. The girls, after a morning spent in turning out the kitchen for the reception of the new magd were out for a long ramble, including Schocolade mit Schlagsahne until tea-time.\nThe empty house spread round her and towered above her as she took off her things in the basement and the schoolroom yawned bright and empty as she reached the upper hall. She hesitated by the door. There was no sound anywhere.... She would play ... on the saal piano.\n“I’m not a Lehrerin—I’m not—I’m—not,” she hummed as she collected her music ... she would bring her songs too.... “I’m going to Pom—pom—pom—Pom-erain—eeya.”",

It was true that there are a thousand islands in archipelagic Chile. The gulf had not troubled us, and I learnt from Patricio that the name doesn’t refer to distress at all. It was originally spelt Peñas (‘cliffs’), and in the hands of British cartographers the tilde dropped off, leaving the incorrect Penas. I made a note to write to William and the rafter about this. At breakfast an air of mild celebration infused the dining room, muted only when we noticed a dead horse being winched overboard. Later, the islands melted into gradations of blue, from a rich cobalt to a light Wedgwood wash, and we lay on the decks like lizards after the cold, wet weeks of Patagonia.",

We had whisky with boiling hot water from our thermoses for dessert. The river shone silver in the evening light; blue-black mountains stood out against a greenish sky. As we passed the poor river villages, huts on stilts, massed sampans, U.C. said, “They think happy days are here again. Tourists are coming back to the North River.” Then he slept, a talent I envied. In the starless night we began to run aground on sandbars. A man from our sampan took soundings with a boathook. Other unseen boat people shouted at us; I suppose we were a traffic block. After the fifth being stuck and grinding off, the tow-rope wrapped around the propeller, the Chriscraft went in circles and the sampan was bumping our stern. The military lay snugly tucked in, on the floor of the sampan, asleep in their long underwear.",

It took a good deal of walking in Freeport on the first two days to determine that the padlocked environs of Running Mon Marina and our home aboard Quest held far more interest to Wendy and me than did anything else on Grand Bahama Island. But we didn’t want to just idle away two weeks. We needed a boat project. I had stored two quarts of interior varnish in a rear locker. This was an opportune time to remove every bit of teak from the inside of Quest, place all the items on the dock, wet sand with 400 grit and slap on a few coats of varnish.",

Centuries-old houses looked their age, well lived-in still, with peeling paint and warped clapboards. Most of the town’s historic sites were likewise antique and unimproved, memorials not only to the Pilgrims but to a bygone tourist sensibility.",

I was completely out of food when I walked into the parking lot, despite the trail magic the runners had left at a road crossing for thru-hikers the day before. My hunger had surpassed symptomatic tummy growls and crankiness—for most of the day I’d been hiking in a woozy, lightheaded state. The most direct path to reach the door of the supermarket passed by a Wendy’s, and I couldn’t last the extra hundred yards. I veered into the fast-food building and emerged minutes later with a large Frosty that was gone by the time I walked into the Kroger.",

Around were the usual distractions of a North Sea holiday resort: ice-cream and hot-dog stands, a children’s fairground ride, shops selling sunglasses and wire baskets of beach toys. It did not quite feel like the end of the world, as the man on the train had suggested, more like the end of the pier. The vast car park next to the plaza was nearly empty and most of the shops were closed. An orange lifeguard tower stood sentry over acres of unoccupied sand and empty cafés, a single imported palm tree leaning precariously in the wind. I thought of Byron: ‘Man marks the earth with ruin/ His control/ Stops with the shore.’",

It’s a phenomenon I first discovered when I lived on a boat on the Pacific Ocean, where life is so often wrought with physical and emotional trauma. Whenever we’d pull into a dry port—alive!—I’d find myself rolling in ecstasy over tiny luxuries like clean, dry clothing, the smell of clean hair, or a tin of unheated baked beans, eaten with a fork. Joy is relative. When you’re accustomed to a life of milk and honey, it’s much harder to be impressed by little pleasures, because small luxuries so quickly become entitlements. Why isn’t there enough foam on my fucking cappuccino? But when you’re roughing it, something as simple as not smelling shit for ten seconds can be heaven. The world’s wealthiest countries might be cash rich, but one could argue that we’re terribly poor at appreciating tiny pleasures.",

One of them, Ruiz de Arce, wrote: ‘We were marching along with no thought of a line of battle. We had been inflicting very long days’ marches on the horses. Because of this we were leading them up the pass by their halters, marching in this way in groups of four’. They were about half way up when Soto, well ahead of his men, saw thousands of Indians swarming over the crest above. As the Inca troops charged, hurling boulders before them, they covered the entire mountain-side. When Soto shouted back to his men to form a battle line it was too late; they had had to scatter to avoid the Indian missiles. Many mounted and tried to spur their horses to the level top of this ridge; but no horse could gallop, few could trot and some wouldn’t even walk. The animals’ obvious exhaustion encouraged the Indians and soon five Spanish heads had been split open by clubs, maces and battle-axes; some of the richest conquistadores were among the dead. Soto then tried to entice the Indians down to the comparatively level ground around Limatambo, where horsemen would have an advantage. Some Indians took this bait and about twenty were killed. The rest retreated to the top of the ridge and both invaders and defenders prepared for an uneasy night. But the conquistadores’ uncanny good fortune was soon restored. At 1. a.m., as they huddled sleepless, cold and fearful on an exposed hillock, doing what they could for eleven wounded men and fourteen wounded horses, a distant European trumpet sounded through the night. Another force of forty Spanish cavalrymen had heard of the battle and were doing a daring nocturnal forced march.",

And, in truth, she was no longer girlish. It was said that she often wrote State papers from her father’s dictation, and was allowed to read all the books in his library. At the receptions—where the situation was saved by the presence of a very decrepit old lady (a relation of the Corbelàns), quite deaf and motionless in an armchair—Antonia could hold her own in a discussion with two or three men at a time. Obviously she was not the girl to be content with peeping through a barred window at a cloaked figure of a lover ensconced in a doorway opposite—which is the correct form of Costaguana courtship. It was generally believed that with her foreign upbringing and foreign ideas the learned and proud Antonia would never marry—unless, indeed, she married a foreigner from Europe or North America, now that Sulaco seemed on the point of being invaded by all the world.",

I believe two of them were actual women—but the q-b says no. There was a Victorian gown of thick green silk, with a creamy blotched crossover shawl. About her we both were doubtful. There were two wistful, drooping-lily sisters, all in white, with big feet. And there was a very successful tall miss in a narrow hobble-skirt of black satin and a toque with ospreys. The way she minced and wagged her posterior and went on her toes and peered over her shoulder and kept her elbows in was an admirable caricature. Especially the curious sagging, heaving movement of \"bustle\" region, a movement very characteristic of modern feminism, was hit off with a bit of male exaggeration which rejoiced me. At first she even took me in.",

One entire section of the menu was devoted to “Porridge.” But the pièce de résistance of the hotel was clearly the five-course meal whose centerpiece was bacon and eggs. The bacon arrived in hefty black slabs as thick as expensive chocolate. I set to cutting into my meal, and a piece of meat ricocheted across the table.

The exterior is neat, the guttering and roof tiles done out smartly in scarlet. But the sign that should show the times of service has come away from the wall. Leafed limbs of various autumnal hues have come to rest shyly against the brickwork, or prostrate themselves across the stone steps that lead up to heavy wooden doors.",

Here was a new way for Cuba to operate, one that more resembled the kind of go-getting attitude that Zenaida had instilled in her, an approach that could rebuild pride in her homeland and in the revolution. But she also found that despite decades of promises about equality, some things hadn’t changed. Just as at the aluminum plant, she was thrust into a den of jealousy, resentment, and subtle but undeniable racism. On the central office team of ten supervisors that she inherited, nearly all were men and not one was black. In the twenty-six textile factories, only one manager had skin that looked like hers. To her great disappointment, she found her formal introduction to the Puntex staff distressingly familiar. Her team assembled at Puntex headquarters on Concordia Street in central Havana. She walked into the small conference room with theater seating to find the first three rows empty. Right then she felt that the vacant seats were a sign of their unwillingness to accept her.",

It was splendid in any case to be enveloped once more in our familiar surroundings. It was in every detectable respect the same forest that we had left in North Carolina—same violently slanted trees, same narrow brown path, same expansive silence, broken only by our tiny grunts and labored breaths as we struggled up hills that proved to be as steep, if not quite as lofty, as those we had left behind. But, curiously, though we had come a couple of hundred miles north, spring seemed further advanced here. The trees, predominantly oak, were more fully in bud, and there were occasional clumps of wildflowers—bloodroot and trillium and Dutchmen’s breeches—rising through the carpet of last year’s leaves. Sunlight filtered through the branches overhead, throwing spotlights on the path, and there was a certain distinctive, heady spring lightness in the air. We took off first our jackets and then our sweaters. The world seemed altogether a genial place.",

The morning tropical sun was warm and welcoming as my little sister, Nathalie, and I ran around excitedly in our matching batik dresses, looking for the hand-painted eggs and chocolate treats that we could collect in our wicker baskets. The exotic flowers that populated my mother’s garden were in full bloom, from hanging white orchids and star-shaped frangipani bouquets, to blood-red hibiscuses and multicoloured birds of paradise. Standing majestically in the middle of the garden was a gigantic avocado tree that spread its cooling shade from large branches heavy with fruit. At its base was our green and blue treehouse on stilts, or bahay kubo as we say in Tagalog or in Filipino, made of wood, dried nipa palm leaves and bamboo slats, where we would play at being little madams for hours on end.",

Not a downpour but bulging drops so fat and heavy they could almost hear them fall one at a time, splashing into the dirt but doing nothing to cool things off. With all three of them in there, and Faru panting frantically on the floor, the bedroom soon was stifling. Cary got up to open the casement window, and the musty smell of rain and dirt washed in. From where they lay, with their heads at the foot of the bed and their feet pointing toward the open window, they had a clear view of the blood-orange sky. For Cary, the strange light and evocative scents brought back harrowing reminders of another storm. She was just a girl then, living with her mother and twin sister in a rooming house near Cuka in Tacajó. When Hurricane Flora tore through, what little they had was nearly blown away.",

It was a crushing blow, so toneless, steady, and impassive in its deliberation that the boys turned white with horror, confronted now with a murderous savagery of purpose they had not bargained for. It was obvious to all of them that the blow might have killed Carl Hooton had it landed on his head; it was equally and horribly evident that it would not have mattered to Nebraska Crane if he had killed Carl Hooton. His black eyes shone like agate in his head, the Cherokee in him had been awakened, he was set to kill. As it was, the blow had landed with the sickening thud of ash-wood on man’s living flesh, upon Carl Hooton’s arm; the arm was numb from wrist to shoulder, and three frightened boys were now picking up the fourth, stunned, befuddled, badly frightened, not knowing whether a single bone had been left unbroken in his body, whether he was permanently maimed, or whether he would live to walk again.",

The site attracting the most votes would be the site of the new capital of Alaska, and when the election came, the emphatic preference of the voters would prove to be Willow. By the terms of the initiative, the move was to begin by 1980. Opponents of the move would go on clinging to the hope that, come groundbreaking day, the money would not be there. Meanwhile, the big helicopter flew on into rain and falling darkness, down the short run to Alaska’s principal city—over Knik Arm, into the Bowl. The rain blurred the windows. Through them, the streets and buildings below appeared to be lying under ten layers of acetate. The chopper touched down. Earl Cook, who had left his home in Fairbanks at six in the morning, unbuckled his seat belt with a terminal sigh. “That …” he said. “That’s a hell of a way to get to Anchorage.”",

When I’d find the right archway, I’d leave a gift of an opalescent marble, hoping it might charm a fairy into granting a wish. At school I made a friend who looked like a brown-haired pixie, with alabaster skin, huge doe eyes, and a level of daring that expanded my worry-filled world.
