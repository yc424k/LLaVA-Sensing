While perhaps not comprehending the breadth of history and the artistic value of the statues, even the youngest Calabrians were well aware that the museum was home to something rare and special. They watched their older siblings move to the north to find work. On holidays, their aunts and uncles visited from Canada and Australia where they, too, had sought out a better life, but the Bronzes were there to stay.",

The long line of little gray, weather- beaten houses nestled peacefully among the orange trees. It must always have been God’s day on that low, drowsy island, Edna thought. They stopped, leaning over a jagged fence made of sea-drift, to ask for water. A youth, a mild- faced Acadian, was drawing water from the cistern, which was nothing more than a rusty buoy, with an opening on one side, sunk in the ground. The water which the youth handed to them in a tin pail was not cold to taste, but it was cool to her heated face, and it greatly revived and refreshed her.",

At any rate, the Blenker habitation would probably be deserted, and he would be able, without indiscretion, to satisfy a vague curiosity concerning it. He was not sure that he wanted to see the Countess Olenska again; but ever since he had looked at her from the path above the bay he had wanted, irrationally and indescribably, to see the place she was living in, and to follow the movements of her imagined figure as he had watched the real one in the summer-house. The longing was with him day and night, an incessant undefinable craving, like the sudden whim of a sick man for food or drink once tasted and long since forgotten. He could not see beyond the craving, or picture what it might lead to, for he was not conscious of any wish to speak to Madame Olenska or to hear her voice. He simply felt that if he could carry away the vision of the spot of earth she walked on, and the way the sky and sea enclosed it, the rest of the world might seem less empty.",

He decided to head for Key West’s little harbor and got in just as the gusts built to 40 knots. The two marinas were full, so they tied up to a concrete dock that was under construction. This will do for the night, he thought as he called his insurance company and told them about the incident. Then he called the Stock Island Ship Yard – they could take him in the morning. Next was a call to the Spectra watermaker dealer – they would meet him there tomorrow as well. Maybe we can be out of here by the end of the week, he thought.",

    "target_paragraph": "On chilly evenings the radiator was the centre of the family life, and the seat nearest it was now always occupied by a very old man with a yellowish waxen face and a heavy shock of black hair streaked with gray, who sat with a helpless left arm stretched on the shawl that covered his knees, and said at intervals, in a slow thick voice: “Feels . . . good . . . here . . . after . . . Crampton. . . .” Grandpa and Grandma Scrimser had moved into Mapledale Avenue after Grandpa’s first stroke. The house out at Crampton was too cold, and the Nordic help, always yearning for Euphoria or Swedenville, could not be persuaded to wait on a paralytic old man and his unwieldy wife. Lorin Weston had accepted the charge without a murmur: he was a great respecter of family ties. But the presence of the old couple had not made things easier at Mapledale Avenue. It was an ever-recurring misery to Mrs. Weston to have the precise routine of her household upset by Mrs. Scrimser’s disorderly ways; she did not mind nursing her father nearly as much as “picking up” after her mother. But the crowning grievance was the invasion of her house by Grandma’s followers--all the “inspirational” faddists, the prophets, seers, and healers who, having long enjoyed the happy-go-lucky hospitality of the Scrimser table, now thronged to Mrs. Weston’s, ostensibly to pray with Grandma and over Grandpa, but always managing, as Mrs. Weston remarked, to drop in round about mealtimes.",

He had only the compass and a stick for the snakes. He could go almost a mile before he would need to see the compass. He sat on a log, the invisible compass in his hand, while the secret night-sounds which had ceased at his movements, scurried again and then fell still for good and the owls ceased and gave over to the waking day birds and there was light in the gray wet woods and he could see the compass. He went fast yet still quietly, becoming steadily better and better as a woodsman without yet having time to realise it; he jumped a doe and a fawn, walked them out of the bed, close enough to see them—the crash of undergrowth, the white scut, the fawn scudding along behind her, faster than he had known it could have run. He was hunting right, upwind, as Sam had taught him, but that didn’t matter now. He had left the gun; by his own will and relinquishment he had accepted not a gambit, not a choice, but a condition in which not only the bear’s heretofore inviolable anonymity but all the ancient rules and balances of hunter and hunted had been abrogated. He would not even be afraid, not even in the moment when the fear would take him completely: blood, skin, bowels, bones, memory from the long time before it even became his memory—all save that thin clear quenchless lucidity which alone differed him from this bear and from all the other bears and bucks he would follow during almost seventy years, to which Sam had said: “Be scared. You cant help that. But dont be afraid. Aint nothing in the woods going to hurt you if you dont corner it or it dont smell that you are afraid. A bear or a deer has got to be scared of a coward the same as a brave man has got to be.”",

I smelled liquor on the fellows’ breath, and when we shook hands, they held mine slightly longer than seemed necessary as he stared at me imploringly. “Do not worry,” Jain assured me. “They are not gays. They are just looking for gays to make love to.” I registered my surprise. “Whatever is easier,” he smiled. “They prefer girls.

I noticed a stone at the entrance to one of the inner gardens, with two straw sandals set neatly beside it.

I strike a light back-handed blow on the nose of an obstreperous horse, and a bone in my hand is broken. I put my head under the water for five minutes, and I am drowned. I fall twenty feet through the air, and I am smashed. I am a creature of temperature. A few degrees one way, and my fingers and ears and toes blacken and drop off. A few degrees the other way, and my skin blisters and shrivels away from the raw, quivering flesh. A few additional degrees either way, and the life and the light in me go out. A drop of poison injected into my body from a snake, and I cease to move—for ever I cease to move. A splinter of lead from a rifle enters my head, and I am wrapped around in the eternal blackness.",

And my lips are too wide, and my eyes are too close together; I show my gums too much when I laugh.

So I skip up the stairs past them, to the next landing, where the long glass hangs and I see myself entire. I see my body and head in one now; for even in this serge frock they are one, my body and my head. Look, when I move my head I ripple all down my narrow body; even my thin legs ripple like a stalk in the wind. I flicker between the set face of Susan and Rhoda’s vagueness; I leap like one of those flames that run between the cracks of the earth; I move, I dance; I never cease to move and to dance. I move like the leaf that moved in the hedge as a child and frightened me. I dance over these streaked, these impersonal, distempered walls with their yellow skirting as firelight dances over teapots. I catch fire even from women’s cold eyes. When I read, a purple rim runs round the black edge of the textbook. Yet I cannot follow any word through its changes. I cannot follow any thought from present to past. I do not stand lost, like Susan, with tears in my eyes remembering home; or lie, like Rhoda, crumpled among the ferns, staining my pink cotton green, while I dream of plants that flower under the sea, and rocks through which the fish swim slowly. I do not dream.",

Staggering slowly up the glacier beneath my overloaded pack, bearing this ridiculous metal cross, I felt like an odd sort of penitente.

Rime ice is formed when super-cooled air (air whose temperature is below 0°C) carrying liquid water-droplets is blown on to a surface suitable for the droplets to freeze on: a rock, for example, or more dangerously, the leading edge of an aircraft’s wing. Rime ice tends to form into delicate feather-like structures. What is curious about it is that it grows into the wind. As each new layer of rime ice is formed, it becomes the surface on which the next layer will crystallize. So by the alignment of rime ice on a rock you can tell which way the prevailing wind has been blowing: an example of how the land keeps its own meteorological archives. One winter I came across a pair of the granite tors which protrude from the summits of the Cairngorm mountains. It had been cold for several days, and the dark stone of the tors was invisible beneath a thick layer of rime ice. Reaching out with a gloved hand, I touched a feather of ice and was shocked when it crumbled away into powder, like a structure of ash left behind by a fire.",

A heron was slowly hoisting itself off the ice; then a spiral of slower wingbeats lifted it to the top of a Lombardy poplar that was dark with a multitude of dishevelled nests. Its mate, looking enormous as it paced a white pool, cumbrously followed it; and a minute later, I could see their beaks projecting side by side. They were the only ones there, wintering it out in the nearly-empty heronry. The other nests would fill up towards the close of the tadpole season.",

Knowing that Kasi lay to the south-east was no help; in such terrain it may be necessary to walk for miles in the apparently wrong direction. I was beginning to feel slightly desperate when two bamboo-laden women emerged from the forest, paused to stare at me fearfully – then hurried away. My calling a greeting only made them trot faster. But they had provided guidance: their footsteps led me across a muddy expanse of half-cleared forest to what I hoped was the continuation of my track. Stopping to drink from a cliff-face stream veiled by vegetation, I found myself eyeball to eyeball with a smallish snake hanging from a branch. Most snakes try to evade humans but this one seemed otherwise inclined; I felt I was lucky to have seen him/her in time.",

In response, this son of the Enlightenment, believed by all to be a supporter of republican ideals, seized control of the government, disenfranchising his rival by unilaterally abolishing the office of the vice president, Santander’s locus of authority. Some objected, comparing Bolívar to Napoleon; others likened his behavior to that of Julius Caesar. Darker elements plotted his end. At his lowest ebb, Bolívar endured two attempts on his life, six weeks apart, both in Bogotá and both mercifully foiled by the one person he could still trust, Manuela Sáenz, his beloved mistress. Manuelita saved him on the first occasion by feigning hysteria, drawing him out of a private party where killers stalked. Bolívar escaped death a second time by scrambling out a bedroom window; he landed on the cobblestoned street half-dressed and fully humiliated. These trials and threats did nothing to quell Bolívar’s ambitions; quite to the contrary, the assassination plots gave him what he needed to move on Santander.",
