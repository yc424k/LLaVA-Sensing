The faces about her flowed by like the streaming images of sleep: she hardly noticed where Selden was leading her, till they passed through a glass doorway at the end of the long suite of rooms and stood suddenly in the fragrant hush of a garden. Gravel grated beneath their feet, and about them was the transparent dimness of a midsummer night. Hanging lights made emerald caverns in the depths of foliage, and whitened the spray of a fountain falling among lilies. The magic place was deserted: there was no sound but the plash of the water on the lily-pads, and a distant drift of music that might have been blown across a sleeping lake.",

He had walked back with his son after the funeral mass for young Lebel; and in the porter’s lodge of the Avenue Marigny they found a soldier waiting—a young square-built fellow, with a shock of straw-coloured hair above his sunburnt rural face. Campton was turning from the door when George dashed past him, caught the young man by both shoulders, and shouted his name. It was that of the orderly who had carried him out of the firing-line and hunted him up the next day in the Doullens hospital. Campton saw the look the two exchanged: it lasted only for the taking of a breath; a moment later officer and soldier were laughing like boys, and the orderly was being drawn forth to shake hands with Campton. But again the glance was an illumination; it came straight from that far country, the Benny Upsher country, which Campton so feared to see in his son’s eyes.",

Right now, the air is at forty-five on an uncertain morning under volatile skies—May 13, 1976. It is mail day, the country’s substitute for organized entertainment, but there is no guarantee that the plane will come through. It comes two, three, occasionally four times a week. The weather is inconstant, mutable. Squalls of snow may be shoved aside by thunderheads that are soon on the rims of open skies. Borg’s records show that on a July day in the nineteen-sixties the thermometer reached ninety-six. During a night in January, 1975, the column went down to seventy-two degrees below zero. Borg says the air was even colder by the river. While this is the coldest part of Alaska, it is also the hottest and among the driest. Less than four feet of snow will fall in all of a winter, and about a foot of total precipitation (a figure comparable to New Mexico’s) across the year. There is a dusting of new snow, Borg comments, on the mountains down the river.",

To our surprise, within ten kilometers we do indeed spy a ramp, just like the one we found in Khovd, Mongolia. This one’s at the back of what appears to be a deserted auto repair shop. All the windows in what used to be the shop are broken, lethal fragments jutting from the window frames, shards scattered on the ground. Trash wafts through weeds choking for sunlight among the pavement cracks. There are no crowds here. There’s no one here at all. By now we have so much experience with shock absorbers that we make quick work of removing this one. Then Bernard turns to me and says what I’ve been dreading to hear for the past two weeks: “I couldn’t see this back at the checkpoint, but here it’s obvious.”",

The car shot up beside him and stopped. He opened the door, though since the Iowan was now engaged in trying to refold his map, the American private in the front seat was the first to get out. His name was Buchwald. His grandfather had been rabbi of a Minsk synagogue until a Cossack sergeant beat his brains out with the shod hooves of a horse. His father was a tailor; he himself was born on the fourth floor of a walk-up, cold-water Brooklyn tenement. Within two years after the passage of the American prohibition law, with nothing in his bare hands but a converted army-surplus Lewis machine gun, he himself was to become czar of a million-dollar empire covering the entire Atlantic coast from Canada to whatever Florida cove or sandspit they were using that night. He had pale, almost colorless eyes; he was hard and slender too now though one day a few months less than ten years from now, lying in his ten-thousand-dollar casket banked with half that much more in cut flowers, he would look plump, almost fat. The military policeman leaned into the back of the car.",

His eldest daughter brought a comb and mirror with which he combed his fine moustache. Then he gave a sigh and betook himself to the little domed privy at the garden’s end, where he squatted down and, between epic grunts, conducted a dis­jointed conversation with his wife. ‘I hear a stranger has come to stay in the village. Some pest of an Englishman, eh?’ She replied, ‘He has bought Kakojannis’ house. He is on the balcony watching you.’ There was silence for a moment. ‘Ho ho ha ha,’ said Frangos at last and then, catching sight of me, gave another great whoop and put up his great paw. ‘Yasu,’ he cried formally, addressing me as if I were in the next valley; and then taking a step towards me he added: ‘Ho there, Englishman, we drank together, did we not?’",

There was great excitement on the wharf at Honolulu the evening I left. It was crowded with natives, the king's band was playing, old hags were chanting melés, and several of the royal family, and of the \"upper ten thousand\" were there, taking leave of the Governess of Hawaii, the Princess Keelikolani, the late king's half-sister. The throng and excitement were so great, that we were outside the reef before I got a good view of this lady, the largest and the richest woman on the islands. Her size and appearance are most unfortunate, but she is said to be good and kind. She was dressed in a very common black holoku, with a red bandana round her throat, round which she wore a lé of immense oleanders, as well as round her hair, which was cut short. She had a large retinue, and her female attendants all wore leis of oleander. They spread very fine mats on the deck, under pulu beds, covered with gorgeous quilts, on which the Princess and her suite slept, and in the morning the beds were removed, breakfast was spread on the mats, and she, some of her attendants, and two or three white men who received invitations, sat on the deck round it. It was a far less attractive meal than that which the serene steward served below. The calabashes, which contained the pale pink poi, were of highly polished kou wood, but there were no foreign refinements. The other dishes were several kinds of raw fish, dried devil-fish, boiled kalo, sweet potatoes, bananas, and cocoa-nut milk.",

It was built of warm honey-coloured sandstone and was full of old Ottoman khans and churches, lovely even in the rain. As I sat in a café, warming my hands around a glass of tea, I caught sight of a Maronite priest in black cloak and biretta hurrying along the road outside, a bent figure scurrying under the shelter of a wide umbrella. I had understood that the Christians of the Chouf, like those of Damour, had been driven out of the area during the fighting. Surprised, I chased after the priest and invited him into the café to join me. Clearly as amazed to see me as I was to see him, Père Abbé Marcel abi-Khalil accepted.",

If she fulfilled the requirement by nature, she did not by predisposition. “That life was just not my style. I like it more here. It’s more worthwhile. The satisfaction is in making your own living, as opposed to making money and buying your living—to have the garden all planted and a year’s supply of salmon hanging on the racks. I get a lot of pleasure, too, out of having a nice piece of skin. When I tan it right, I feel good. I have sure learned a lot, stumbling around. In my first year, I broke two plates and several cups. I wouldn’t do that now. I have a long way to go, though. I’m still not comfortable in boats.”",

But all the while, behind these voluntarily emphasized sensations, his secret consciousness continued to revolve on a loud wheel of thought. For a time it seemed to be sweeping him through deep gulfs of darkness. His sensations were too swift and swarming to be disentangled. He had an almost physical sense of struggling for air, of battling helplessly with material obstructions, as though the russet covert through which he trudged were the heart of a maleficent jungle...",

But if the pale blue envelope lying by the biscuit-box had the feelings of a mother, the heart was torn by the little creak, the sudden stir. Behind the door was the obscene thing, the alarming presence, and terror would come over her as at death, or the birth of a child. Better, perhaps, burst in and face it than sit in the antechamber listening to the little creak, the sudden stir, for her heart was swollen, and pain threaded it. My son, my son—such would be her cry, uttered to hide her vision of him stretched with Florinda, inexcusable, irrational, in a woman with three children living at Scarborough. And the fault lay with Florinda. Indeed, when the door opened and the couple came out, Mrs Flanders would have flounced upon her—only it was Jacob who came first, in his dressing-gown, amiable, authoritative, beautifully healthy, like a baby after an airing, with an eye clear as running water. Florinda followed, lazily stretching; yawning a little; arranging her hair at the looking-glass—while Jacob read his mother’s letter.",

We passed several scenes of wayside carnage as sheep were being slaughtered for Id feasts, but these were the only symptoms of festivity. Returning at dusk through the dimly-lit bazaar, where most merchants had already closed and locked their wooden shutters, I pictured the streets of London or Dublin this evening and praised Allah for allowing me to be in Gilgit instead. But that was a selfish reaction: from poor Rachel’s point of view it is extremely bad luck to have missed the thrills of two successive Christmases. Fortunately, however, she has a passion for jewellery and Rs.10 will buy unbelievable quantities of bangles, brooches, rings and necklaces.",

In the end I found a room above one of the small souvenir shops that crowded the road to the temple gate, and collapsed gratefully onto the floor of it. Drenched, cold, and very tired, I hung my dripping clothes over an electric fire to dry them and lay down to sleep as soon as dinner was over. The wind still roared and the rain beat upon the windows of my room as though they were taiko drums. All night the claws of the typhoon ripped at the shuttered streets, at the six-hundred-year-old cedar trees, and at the carved wooden gates and thin paper screens of Eiheiji, the Temple of Eternal Peace.",

Walking a little slower, perhaps; perhaps looking backward, but without sadness, untroubled as cows. Horace sat in the window while the servant methodically reduced the chaos of his possessions to the boxes and bags, gazing out across ancient gray roofs, and trees which he had seen in all their seasonal moods, in all moods matching his own. Had he been younger he would have said goodbye to them secretively or defiantly; older, he would have felt neither the desire to nor the impulse to suppress it. So he sat quietly in his window for the last time while the curtains stirred delicately against his hair, brooding upon their dreaming vistas where twilight was slowly finding itself and where, beyond dissolving spires, lingered grave evening shapes; and he knew a place where, had he felt like walking, he could hear a cuckoo, that symbol of sweet and timeless mischief, that augur of the fever renewed again.",

Today, four hundred years after its total sacking, even its ruins are few and scattered, scarcely noticeable at first against the surrealist brown rock formations of which they seem to form part. The surrounding villages are broken down and dusty; the physique of the people is poor. Then, abruptly, grandeur: the road from Kampli goes straight through some of the old buildings and leads to the main street, very wide, very long, still impressive, a flight of stone steps at one end, the towering gopuram of the temple, alive with sculpture, at the other. The square-pillared lower storeys of the stone buildings still stand; in the doorways are carvings of dancers with raised legs. And, inside, the inheritors of this greatness: men and women and children, thin as crickets, like lizards among the stones.",

Unsure of what to do, he pauses as drivers, in disbelief, crash into one another. Some abandon their cars, dashing away. One couple shrieks as the tiger jumps on their hood. No one is hurt.

Soon the King’s emissary, Prince Gideon Zulu, appeared on the steps surrounded by five Paramount Chiefs – naked torsos gleaming, pot-bellies protruding, each carrying his shield and sporting a leopard-skin cloak, leopard-skin wristbands, armbands woven from the tail-hairs of white oxen, belts of jackals’ tails and a lion-claw necklace. This was the moment the cameramen had been waiting for. But before posing the chiefs demanded the return of their spears and knobkerries, confiscated as they entered Parliament. I looked in vain for President de Klerk; perhaps he sensibly chose to make his last exit as President through a side door.",

I felt a glow of affection as its few obligatory flourishes of high-risery appeared on the horizon. At a residential centre for AIDS patients, where I stayed on previous visits, ten black South African public-health workers had arrived the day before ‘to learn from the Zambian experience’. They were USAID-sponsored and led by a paunchy information co-ordinator from Colombus, Ohio. African countries, he asserted, need teams of Western psychotherapists to enable people to get a handle on all this AIDS trauma. He sounded like a skit on ‘the Western helper in Africa’; his protégés made no comment but their body language was eloquent.",

He wanted to obey the laws and to be respected: he believed himself to be a sincerely conventional person – but, some one would see him after midnight, bounding along a campus path, with goat-cries beneath the moon. His suits went baggy, his shirts and drawers got dirty, his shoes wore through – he stuffed them with cardboard strips – his hats grew shapeless and wore through at the creases. But he did not mean to go unkempt – the thought of going for repairs filled him with weary horror. He hated to act – he wanted to brood upon his entrails for fourteen hours a day. At length, goaded, he would lash his great bulk, lulled in the powerful inertia of its visions, into a cursing and violent movement.",

Here it was much hotter. The cropped grass by the road already had a brown tinge, and the corn was standing high, full of pink veitches. Yet on some of the hills men were ploughing; perhaps for a second crop. As usual, the town looked like a wood from a distance, but reminded me of an Irish market-town once we were in it.

Mr. Katamoto would knock the ball up against the projecting brick wall of the house next door, and every time he scored a point he would scream with laughter, clapping his small hands together, bending over weakly and pressing his hand against his stomach, and staggering about with delight and merriment. Choking with laughter, he would cry out in a high, delirious voice as rapidly as he could:",

He wore the Gypsies’ distinctive wide-brimmed black hat and greasy sheepskin jacket; his gross beer-belly wouldn’t allow his blue jeans to come much above his crutch. The other was a little bald man, his skull ghoulishly obvious beneath tight brown Gypsy skin; a small bunch of woolly grey hair behind each ear gave him the look of a debauched elf. He was a deaf mute, who made pathetic shrill croaking noises, like a bullfrog – some of which his companion seemed to understand. At 9 a.m. both were drinking beer and cognac.",

    "target_paragraph": "When she arrived at Nicholson’s old hunter-style camp, she found the ‘kitchen’ comprised of a tarpaulin held up by four posts, with wilderness all around. The stove was an oblong of stones filled with ashes with an iron grate across the top on which the pots could sit. The coals to make the fire were thrust under the grate from a fire burning to the side of the kitchen.\nAlthough the Christmas festivities and food all required some ingenuity, decorations being made out of foil and a few twigs, there was a full Christmas meal of roast turkey, ham, stuffing and all the trimmings, followed by Christmas pudding, brandy butter and custard, and plenty of Christmas cake and mince pies to last over several days. After the teachers left, Brian received a message saying that they had their school Christmas meal at the Savoy hotel in London, but the food they had in the camp was so much better! From that day on, Vivien became the caterer for Nicholson’s camp, where Kamara also worked and where his association with Vivien began.\nBeth asked whether she had ever had any frightening moments. Despite her tiny size, she is absolutely fearless, with the heart of a lion, so I was particularly interested to hear her reply.\nOn her first day at the camp, she found that next to the ‘kitchen’ in the glaring sun was a very hot tent in which there was a refrigerator, and where all the fresh vegetables were laid out on sacks on the floor, the beans and leeks curling up at the edges. Nearby in the shade was another tent, in which there was a pile of potatoes, some broken chairs and crates of sodas. Vivien decided to switch the contents of the tents around so the refrigerator and the fresh produce could be in the shade.\nNext morning while Brian and Kamara were collecting the teachers from the airstrip, she summoned two men to help her move the refrigerator. As she was bending over in the corner near the potatoes, she saw something moving right under her hand. As she looked closer a large head and eyes appeared less than a foot from her face.\n‘Forget the Olympics,’ Vivien laughed, ‘you should have seen this kid move!’",

Often I went out for walks by myself, early in the morning before anyone I knew was awake. On one such excursion, I came by accident on a little square that I hadn't seen before. In it was a ring of men in headdresses and long robes, slowly dancing to drums and flourishing curved knives at each other. I drew back into the shadows of a side street, but they didn't care whether I watched or not. On another morning, I found a group of camels, loaded with bundles tied up in rough brown cloth, each camel led by an African. They were marching toward the outskirts of town. As it happened, I had never before seen camels outside a circus. I followed them, though it was a very hot day, until they stopped in a palm grove.",
