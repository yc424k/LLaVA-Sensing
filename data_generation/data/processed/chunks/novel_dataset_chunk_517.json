As I sipped sweet tea and fidgeted, his Holiness rooted around in an adjacent cabinet, brought out a large, ornately decorated book, and handed it to me. I wiped my dirty hands on my pants and opened it nervously. It was a photo album. The rimpoche, it turned out, had recently traveled to America for the first time, and the book held snapshots from this trip: his Holiness in Washington standing before the Lincoln Memorial and the Air and Space Museum; his Holiness in California on the Santa Monica Pier. Grinning broadly, he excitedly pointed out his two favorite photos in the entire album: his Holiness posing beside Richard Gere, and another shot of him with Steven Seagal.",

Her father was pacing from one drawing-room to the other; she followed him in; but she avoided him. They were too much alike; each knew what the other was feeling. She stood at the window looking up the street. There had been a shower of rain. The street was wet; the roofs were shining. Dark clouds were moving across the sky; the branches were tossing up and down in the light of the street lamps. Something in her was tossing up and down too. Something unknown seemed to be approaching. Then a gulping sound behind her made her turn. It was Milly. She was standing by the mantelpiece under the picture of the white-robed girl with the flower-basket, and the tears slid slowly down her cheeks. Delia moved towards her; she ought to go up to her and put her arms round her shoulders; but she could not do it. Real tears were sliding down Milly’s cheeks. But her own eyes were dry. She turned to the window again. The street was empty – only the branches were tossing up and down in the lamplight. The Colonel paced up and down; once he knocked against a table and said ‘Damn!’ They heard steps moving about in the room upstairs. They heard voices murmuring. Delia turned to the window.",

Returning later, he passed them again in the same field, progressing just as slowly, and as regardless of the hour and of the cheerless night as before.

As in Moscow, you need only stick your hand out in a Havana street before someone screeches to a halt and invites you aboard. This time, a vintage Plymouth Deluxe pulled over. As per Communist protocol, I hopped in the front seat next to the driver, who greeted me with a million-dollar smile wrapped around a half-smoked cigar. His graying hair was carefully combed; his dress shirt neatly pressed. He’d been listening to Radio Liberación but flicked it off so we could chat. I started by asking the age of his car.",

Fieldfares clattered in the bushes, plucking haws, throwing their heads back and swallowing them whole at a gulp. Sarsen stones stood about in flocks, with snow on their rounded backs. Buzzards were out in ones and pairs, turning in the sky, looking for the carrion which was more plentiful in such prolonged cold weather. We passed a kestrel hunched on a telegraph post, its head sunk into its shoulders. We passed Bronze Age round barrows and Neolithic long barrows. Two brown hares made an urgent run across a big field, kicking snow from their hind feet. In the canopy of a long thin beech wood, rooks yabbered and called, tossed up into the air and then settled back, as if the wood itself were boiling.",

One of the leading Muslim families in the village, who also happened to be local commanders of the Gema’a, had wished to buy it.

Gemal Haridi, the head of the Muslim family, made it clear that if he was magnanimous enough to let the sale go ahead between the two Copts, his family would at least expect a considerable cut of the purchase price. Munir refused to pay. Two weeks later, Munir’s son, an engineer aged twenty-five, was shot dead as he bent under the bonnet of a car in his father’s garage. In the same attack Munir was shot in the foot. He had to have the foot amputated. But he still refused to pay.",

I arrange a rude rock seat as a lookout on the world, set out binoculars in case wild creatures should happen into view, then cross my legs and regulate my breath, until I scarcely breathe at all.",

I was refused admission, apparently because I could walk – albeit with difficulty. The truck driver and his mate then helped me find a bus for Oradea; inexplicably, they were very keen on my not being interviewed by the local police. From Oradea, where no hotel would accept lei without an exchange certificate, I caught a train to Satu Mare. I vividly recall walking to the gara and queueing for my ticket – but, curiously, as though it were an ordeal I had read about rather than a personal experience. The bus and train journeys are both blanks: and on arrival in Satu Mare I must have been still semi-concussed; when revisiting the place in March, again arriving by train, I had no recollection of getting from the gara to a Centru hotel.",

The Court of Justice is being repaired,* but one can still take pleasure in this enclosure, which I remember less for its statues of Augustine and Ambrose than for the beauty of the men in the Ristorante Mercanti. There are days in Italy when human flesh seems victorious over all remorse. There was scarcely a man in that restaurant I would not, at that moment, have happily made love to. I applied myself instead to the serious business of eating: beautiful fresh slices of meaty tomato mated with slices of fresh sweet mozzarella, olive oil, and basilico (“Basil is the plant that flourishes from a murdered man's head,” I heard someone, not an Italian, say—a line from a poem by Keats and not a malediction); spaghetti with garlic and oil and tiny clams the size of a baby's fingernail in their shells; strawberries—spring must have arrived somewhere—and cream.",

Calling a spade a spade is a national habit, after all, and nothing seems to anger the Australian but pretension. Though Lawrence may have been merely being Lawrence when he claimed that Australians were such natural democrats that they did not even like to go upstairs, it is certainly true that a visitor is more likely to be called “mate” than “sir.”",

The owner introduced himself as an Orthodox Christian who had spent twenty years in London. He urged me to avoid the Ein Es-Sultan refugee camp – my destination. ‘It is too far to walk and no taxi will take you, those people are too rough.’",

Pedro Sancho, Pizarro’s secretary, wrote of this area: ‘We had to climb another stupendous mountainside. Looking up at it from below, it seemed impossible for birds to scale it by flying through the air, let alone men on horseback climbing by land. But the road was made less exhausting by climbing in zigzags rather than in a straight line. Most of it consisted of large stone steps that greatly wearied the horses and wore down their hooves even though they were being led by their bridles’.",

One group of boys, getting impatient, dragged two coconut logs into the water and actually caught waves on those. Smaller kids ran up and down the sand with coconut shells on strings under their feet, making a sound exactly like clopping horseshoes. The children in Nukui had a great many homemade toys: round nuts that they used in a never-ending game like marbles; tin-can tops on a string that somehow spun and whistled; a coconut leaf twisted on a stick into an elegant wind-spinner. Amid all this tender ingenuity, I found myself staring one evening, after a great deal of kava, into the ceiling of a hut and suddenly seeing on a crossbeam a pair of child’s rubber boots. The boots were dusty and cut in a vaguely cowboy style, and the sight of them pierced me unexpectedly. They were a talisman both from the manufactured world and from my own Lone Ranger boyhood.",

She accomplishes her goal traveling as “John,” complete with an elastic girdle around her chest and cropped hair. Iranian men she meets are suspicious of her and do not take her into their confidence. Rather, it is the Iranian wife Malake, in the excerpt that follows, who opens up to Hobson when she is told by her husband that “John” is indeed female. Woman to woman, Malake quickly sheds formality; she is not alarmed or disgusted, but relieved, clearly relishing the opportunity to confide in the stranger. Hobson’s witty narrative of her encounters with pilgrims of the Islamic faith was followed by a second book, about living with an Indian family. She now works on travel films and documentaries and lives in Yorkshire, England.",

As the sky grew darker, the hungry and exhausted pair started to run whenever possible to make up time.

    "target_paragraph": "Spring came. America had three teams in the running, all with excellent planes and experienced crews. The names of the planes alone?Columbia, America, American Legion?showed how much this had become a matter of national pride. The initial front-runner was the Columbia, the monoplane in which Chamberlin and Acosta had set their endurance record just before Easter. But two days after that milestone flight, an even more impressive and vastly more expensive plane was wheeled out of its factory at Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. This was the America, which carried three powerful, roaring engines and had space for a crew of four. The leader of the America team was thirty-seven-year-old naval commander Richard Evelyn Byrd, a man seemingly born to be a hero. Suave and handsome, he came from one of America’s oldest and most distinguished families. The Byrds had been dominant in Virginia since the time of George Washington. Byrd’s brother Harry was governor of the state. In 1927, Richard Byrd himself was already a celebrated adventurer. The previous spring, with the pilot Floyd Bennett, he had made the first flight in an airplane over the North Pole (though in fact, as we will see, there have long been doubts that he actually did so).",

The next step was to stake a claim and have it filed with the county recorder. But now their problems were only beginning. Before they could raise the money to finance a mining operation it was necessary to have core samples taken in order to assay the quality and the extent of the uranium deposit. This meant first of all bulldozing a road into the claim; then if they had any money left or could borrow more they had to hire or lease a drilling rig. All very expensive procedures. If the drilling proved out they might be ready to go into business. Or might not, depending upon still other factors, such as the expense of trucking the ore from mine to mill.",

The problem lies not just in the vastness of Australia—though that is daunting enough, goodness knows—but in the risks involved in wandering into unknown country.
