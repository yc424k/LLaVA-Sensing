Thus, at the funeral of some remote kinsman, or of some acquaintance of the family, for whom he had never acquired any considerable affection, he would grow bitterly shamefast if, while listening to the solemn drone of the minister, or the sorrowful chanting of the singers, he felt his face had assumed an expression of unfelt and counterfeited grief: as a consequence he would shift about matter-of-factly, cross his legs, gaze indifferently at the ceiling, or look out of the window with a smile, until he was conscious his conduct had attracted the attention of people, and that they were looking on him with disfavour. Then, he felt a certain grim satisfaction as if, although having lost esteem, he had recorded his life.",

Passing through the lobby, Cary happened to glance at a television, and what she saw stopped her short. The hotel captured foreign TV broadcasts, including CNN. Cary stood in the lobby watching video of the angry mob running wild on the Malecón, breaking windows, throwing rocks and sticks, and shouting, though she could hardly believe it, “Down with Fidel!”",

    "target_paragraph": "Opinions here vary so much about the state of the pass that I decided to go up some of the way today by a short-cut and investigate for myself. At 7.30 it was a heavenly morning with warm sun, cool breeze and cloudless sky, like a good May day in Ireland. Progress was slow, with lots of pauses to rest my pounding heart, as the short-cut is naturally a much steeper gradient than the track, but I enjoyed meandering along looking at the very lovely wild flowers in the woods and listening to the birds. Inevitably I got lost and it was 2 p.m. before I came out on the jeep track, 13,000 feet up, amid stony, barren moors. By now the sky was overclouded, thunder was crashing amidst the peaks and it was snowing lightly. (I could hardly believe that seventy-two hours ago and only twenty miles away I had been getting heatstroke!) I didn’t dare go higher because of feeling a slight nausea – caused by either altitude or starvation or both – so I walked down the six miles of track to here. There are three small glaciers completely blocking the road but on this stretch they will be very easy to negotiate on foot. Probably there are more and wider ones farther up; it was a pity I couldn’t inspect the last two miles to the top for fear of overtaxing my ill-treated carcase. (I feel quite sorry for my own body these days, in a curiously detached and impersonal way; I’d like to be able to give it the feed it’s certainly earned.) The delicate question now is whether to stay here another few days and get more acclimatised before pushing Roz up (good for heart) or whether to go over tomorrow and get a square meal on the other side (good for stomach). I think stomach will win because I really would be debilitated after another forty-eight hours on raw beans. (This evening my watch is repeatedly slipping down my wrist.) I have just got another three eggs – all that were available – and about a pint of milk, but the peasants are starving too, pending the delayed arrival of the camel caravans over the pass. They would share their last egg with me and are most reluctant to take money, which makes it all the more awkward. Fortunately the gradient of the track, except on the countless hairpins, is only about one in eighteen for the first six miles anyway. I don’t understand why, when walking briskly down such a slope, one is completely unaffected by altitude, whereas going very slowly up one feels half dead; surely walking is in itself an exertion?",

But naturally Ceausescu had never been allowed to see beggars. This was the first city I had explored and it distressed me to observe how many passers-by looked malnourished to a Third World degree, their faces recalling photographs of starving European refugees at the end of the Second World War. Yet the majority were adequately dressed and all those unhealthy bodies, normally attired, underlined the fundamental insanity of Ceausescu’s dictatorship. There had never been an extreme clothing shortage, my friends explained that evening. The manic ‘save energy’ campaign was accompanied by exhortations to dress warmly and, since there was so little food to be bought, people could afford to spend on their wardrobes. But many garments were ‘seconds’, unimaginatively designed, drably coloured and of poor workmanship. ‘Firsts’ were, at least in theory, for export only.",

We were being cheated of the view – always spectacular as one leaves the puna – and if any redura existed we couldn’t see it. Then for a moment the shifting clouds allowed us to glimpse an unimaginable abyss just below the road and we realised that this was not redura terrain.

It was all the maddest business in the world, yet it did not give him the sense of unreality that had made their first adventure a mere golden dream; and he sat and waited with the security of one in whom dear habits have struck deep roots. In this mood of acquiescence even the presence of the five Fulmers seemed a natural and necessary consequence of all the rest; and when Susy at length appeared, a little pale and tired, with the brooding inward look that busy mothers bring from the nursery, that too seemed natural and necessary, and part of the new order of things.",

They were staying with Connie, she went on, who was expecting Jimmy, who was home from Uganda… his mind slipped a few words, for he was seeing a garden, a room, and the next word he heard was ‘adenoids’ – which is a good word, he said to himself, separating it from its context; wasp-waisted; pinched in the middle; with a hard, shining, metallic abdomen, useful to describe the appearance of an insect – but here a vast bulk approached; chiefly white waistcoat, lined with black; and Hugh Gibbs stood over them.

Justo unpacked his gear in the Sixpac Manco kitchen. John disappeared into his room and threw his stuff around noisily for a few minutes. I had nothing to do except attend to my filthy clothes, which I washed out in the garden with a bar of soap and a scrub brush. My two shirts and two pairs of pants took half an hour to get passably clean. When I finished, I peeled the electrical tape off my toes and took a luxurious lukewarm shower in the open-air bathroom. The water was supposed to be heated by an electric contraption attached to the shower head that had all sorts of wires sticking out of it; this in turn was connected directly to the town’s main power cable. “Electrocuted while bathing” seemed a rather pathetic cause of death. So I let the tepid water run over me and tried to think of what I might be doing in New York at that hour. Then I realized that I didn’t even know what day it was.",

Lydia said that they liked to use halibut heads as bait; she sometimes baked cookies for the guys down at the cannery, in exchange for some choice ones. We stopped at a buoy marking the spot of the first pot and reeled it up with a mechanized winch. It was the size of a laundry basket and filled with huge Dungeness crabs, at least a dozen. At the bottom, the halibut head had been picked as clean as a Georgia O’Keeffe cow’s skull. Lydia pulled the crabs out one by one and measured them against a wooden stick to make sure they were big enough to keep. After an hour on the water, we had two massive plastic tubs of shellfish, most of which would be cleaned, frozen, and shipped off to Lydia’s daughter in Washington.",

Downed trees lay across the path every fifty or sixty yards, often with great bomb craters of dirt around their splayed roots. Dozens more lay rotting on the slopes, and every third or fourth tree, it seemed, was leaning steeply on a neighbor. It was as if the trees couldn’t wait to fall over, as if their sole purpose in the universal scheme of things was to grow big enough to topple with a really good, splintering crash. I was forever coming up to trees so precariously and weightily tipped over the path that I would waver, then scoot under, fearing the crush of really unfortunate timing and imagining Katz coming along a few minutes later, regarding my wriggling legs and saying, “Shit, Bryson, what’re you doing under there?” But no trees fell. Everywhere the woods were still and preternaturally quiet. Except for the occasional gurgle of running water and the tiny shuffle of wind-stirred leaves along the forest floor, there was almost never a sound.",

I thought there was supposed to be a famous finger-sign telling you how far it is to Sydney and Los Angeles, but I couldn’t find it; perhaps they take it in out of season so that people like me don’t carry it off as a souvenir. Only one of the shops was open. I went in and was surprised to find that there were three middle-aged ladies working there, which seemed a bit excessive as I was obviously the only tourist for four hundred miles. The ladies were exceedingly cheerful and chipper and greeted me warmly with those wonderful Highland accents—so clinically precise and yet so dulcet. I unfolded some sweaters so that they would have something to do after I left, watched open-mouthed a demo video for Tommy Scott singing perky Scottish tunes on various blowy headlands, bought some postcards, chatted with the ladies about the weather, and lingered for an awkwardly long period after it was clear that the conversation was over. Then I stepped back out into the gusty parking lot and realized that I had about exhausted the possibilities presented by John o’Groats.",

The valley is by no means inaccessible, but its solitude is formidably guarded. And its world is exceptional. Coruisk determines its own weathers, its own skies and clouds. Light behaves unexpectedly within it. The rock of the Cauldron’s sides changes colour frequently, depending upon the weather’s accent. It can be grey in cloud, toffee-coloured at noon, liverish at evening, and metallic in rain and sunshine.",

Many of them were hobbled by the villagers, their front legs tied together to keep them wandering too far. I knew this would make them slower to get off the road if they saw Dick coming. I also knew that night was when they came onto the road for the warmth it radiated, and they were near impossible to spot on the unilluminated tar. I doubted that wobbly old Dick could stop in time if one stepped out in front of us. After diseases like malaria and HIV, collisions with donkeys are one of the leading causes of death in Botswana, so I took their threat seriously, gnashing away with caffeine-fueled, donkey-defying intensity.",

Aside from its autumnal beauty and the brilliant green it lends the summer canopy, it thrives in cold climates, burns hotter in the woodstove than many conifers, makes decent timber for building, and better survives the frequent fires that clear out junk pine and brush from the understory. Also, larch has personality. Its slender branches ringing a one-hundred-foot trunk look, I swear, joyful, silhouetted against sky. The needles bristle, standing at attention like they’ve been shocked and the tree’s aura is at once stately and gleeful, bringing to mind an old man with a joke or a dizzy child balancing.",

It is those who travel “for pleasure,” as the phrase goes. What Epicurus, who never travelled except when he was banished, sought in his own garden, our tourists seek abroad. And do they find their happiness? Those who frequent the places where they resort must often find this question, with a tentative answer in the negative, fairly forced upon them. For tourists are, in the main, a very gloomy-looking tribe. I have seen much brighter faces at a funeral than in the Piazza of St. Mark’s. Only when they can band together and pretend, for a brief, precarious hour, that they are at home, do the majority of tourists look really happy. One wonders why they come abroad.",

Long roads through wide-open spaces trembled to feel the pad of our shoes, and the Pope waited with his scroll of profound secrets. There was wine to be tasted. I had shoes. I had the willingness.

    "target_paragraph": "Tha Khaek is at the other end of the chronological scale from Phonsavanh – probably older than Luang Prabang. A thousand years ago, as Sii Khotabun, it was a remote border post of the Mon-Khmer empire and a Mekong port for Indian and Arab traders. When the French army first appeared, in 1893, the town was named Muang Tha – Port Town. The unsuspecting Lao graciously welcomed the foreigners, referring to them as ‘guests’, and soon Muang Tha had become known throughout the region as Tha Khaek – Guests’ Port. Now, as the capital of Khammuan province, it is an agreeably run-down French colonial outpost dating, architecturally, from 1912 and as yet not much afflicted by ‘development’. Pre-1975 the population was 85 per cent Vietnamese. Some had been imported by the French to administer the area (in so far as the colonists bothered to administer any part of Laos), others had fled from northern Vietnam when Ho Chi Minh took over. After 1975 the majority – staunch capitalists – moved on to more lucrative pastures in France or the USA. The present population – mainly Lao Lum – is nearly 70,000 including ‘suburban’ bans. But the town is uncrowded and slow-paced even by Lao standards. Soon I realized that I had left the best wine to the last and was somewhere exceptionally congenial.",

Anyone who drops the ball must pay a forfeit: nowadays a kiss (or more) when couples wander off into the forest after sunset. This ritual game was less restrained fifty years ago; then the forfeit, for both sexes, was to discard a garment on the spot.

Forty years later Kipling found himself dragged on a ten-mile hike in horrible wet weather from one side of the island to the other (‘behind, rose the hills into the mist, the ever-lasting mist …’). Horse-riding was never popular in the precipitous landscapes of Hong Kong Island, but after the New Territories became available the inevitable colonial hunt was founded – the Fanling Hunt, which chased the civet cat and the South China Red Fox across the stony wastelands with full paraphernalia of cap, horn, stirrup-cup and imported English hound.",

The soft snow again made walking hard work, but from the top of the hill beyond Antarctica appeared in all its glory, refulgent in the late afternoon sunlight. As their shadows lengthened on the rippling Southern Ocean the icebergs took on an incandescent quality, and I watched a single snow petrel fly among them, gliding through its private symphony. There was no sound at all except the occasional metallic tap-tap as the vulcanologist, a hundred yards away, scraped snow into a specimen tin. I did not need to take a photograph, and I could not: I knew that moment would always be with me, and I did not want to betray it with a picture.",

When he was listening or talking to someone, his body prowling downward, his head thrust forward and turned upward with a kind of packed attentiveness, the simian analogy was inevitable; therefore the name of “Monk” had stuck. Moreover, it had never occurred to him, apparently, to get his figure clothed in garments suited to his real proportions. He just walked into a store somewhere and picked up and wore out the first thing he could get on.

We shook hands and I said how surprised I was to see the university looking so normal after all it had gone through in the war. The Professor smiled. ‘Thankfully we are a very forgetful culture,’ he said, pulling out a chair and indicating that I should sit. ‘Those who committed the worst crimes and atrocities have long been forgiven. Few people in Lebanon can afford to bear grudges for too long. Who remembers Sabra and Chatila? At the time it was terrible: who could ever forgive mass murder like that? But twelve years later even the unfortunate Palestinians have probably forgotten and forgiven.’",

The plane was a brand-new Airbus 321, and its interior design featured Aeroflot’s updated color scheme of orange and blue, exactly like the colors of the New York Mets baseball team. I dozed off, then woke after a couple of hours. From my window seat I could see nothing but blackness below—probably clouds. Then I started seeing occasional small knots of silvery-blue lights here and there, the lights of towns. Then suddenly big reddish-orange lights appeared, dotting the land’s darkness in random profusion, often in clusters of twos and threes. I couldn’t figure out what they were. Then I realized they had to be oil well flares burning off natural gas—those new irruptions of light into the Siberian wilderness that I’d read about. I don’t know what oil field they were part of. I imagined how the taiga or swamp around them looked, weirdly illuminated in their flames. After a while they were fewer; then, none. For an hour before Novosibirsk the ground was mostly dark again.",

Her large pink face was appropriately solemn, and her plum-coloured satin with pale blue side-panels, and blue ostrich plumes in a small satin bonnet, met with general approval; but before she had settled herself with a stately rustle in the pew opposite Mrs. Archer's the spectators were craning their necks to see who was coming after her. Wild rumours had been abroad the day before to the effect that Mrs. Manson Mingott, in spite of her physical disabilities, had resolved on being present at the ceremony; and the idea was so much in keeping with her sporting character that bets ran high at the clubs as to her being able to walk up the nave and squeeze into a seat. It was known that she had insisted on sending her own carpenter to look into the possibility of taking down the end panel of the front pew, and to measure the space between the seat and the front; but the result had been discouraging, and for one anxious day her family had watched her dallying with the plan of being wheeled up the nave in her enormous Bath chair and sitting enthroned in it at the foot of the chancel.",

A sense of coziness emanated from the dark, of families at home amid chocolate and tea. Lights shone in second-floor windows, smells of cooking wafted out of courtyards. Yet all these rituals were shut off from me, and that, in its way, made me happier than anything.
