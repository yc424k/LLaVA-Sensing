At lunchtime our soup was diluted by raindrops sploshing down from the ceiling of this new bungalow and outside it was almost dark, with nothing, nowhere and nobody dry. The monsoon isn’t fun at the best of times, but in a refugee camp it’s hell. To go out on an evening like this and see rows of children lying on thin sacking laid over damp concrete under a leaking tin roof in a shelter open at both ends, and to listen to the pathetic coughing, would take a tear from a stone. On asking why these children were not in their rooms I was told that they couldn’t sleep because of the hoards of vicious bed-bugs which attacked them nightly. Already Juliet has a supply of Tik 20 ready for the anti-bug campaign – but this is a war that can only be waged in dry weather.",

Here is the text, taken from Captain Shelvocke’s voyage, which gave the poem its marching papers:   The heavens were perpetually hid from us by gloomy distant clouds ... one would think it impossible that any living thing could subsist in so rigid a climate and indeed we ... had not the sight of one fish of any kind, nor seabirds, except a disconsolate Black Albitross, hovering near as if he had lost himself ... till Hatley (my second captain) observing in one of his melancholy fits, that this bird was always hovering near us, imagin’d from his colour that it might be some ill-omen ... and after some fruitless attempts shot the Albitross, not doubting, perhaps, that we should have a fair wind after it.",

I suffer for all humiliations. Yet I am also ruthless, marmoreal. I do not see how you can say that it is fortunate to have lived. Your little excitements, your childish transports, when a kettle boils, when the soft air lifts Jinny’s spotted scarf and it floats web-like, are to me like silk streamers thrown in the eyes of the charging bull. I condemn you. Yet my heart yearns towards you. I would go with you through the fires of death. Yet am happiest alone. I luxuriate in gold and purple vestments. Yet I prefer a view over chimney-pots; cats scraping their mangy sides upon blistered chimney-stacks; broken windows; and the hoarse clangour of bells from the steeple of some brick chapel.’",

Already they were sweeping through Charlottenburg. They passed the station without halting, and on the platforms George saw, with the old and poignant feeling of regret and loss, the people waiting for the Stadtbahn trains. Upon its elevated track the great train swept on smoothly towards the west, gathering momentum steadily. They passed the Funkturma. Almost before he knew it they were rushing through the outskirts of the city towards the open country. They passed an aviation field. He saw the hangars and a flock of shining 'planes. And as he looked, a great silver-bodied 'plane moved out, sped along the runway, lofted its tail, broke slowly from the earth, and vanished.",

And in that instant as the boy looks at his brother, a knife is driven through his entrails suddenly, for with an instant final certitude, past reason, proof, or any visual evidence, he sees the end and answer of his brother’s life. Already death rests there on his proud head like a coronal. The boy knows in that one instant Ben will die.",

The airport is across the street from the hotel just beyond the Total station. Of interest to some is the Polytechnic Institute, a modern secondary school staffed by Russian and Ethiopian teachers and attracting an enrolment from all over the Empire. The school is just past the Shell petrol station and is distinguished by a number of large, modern buildings.’ To complete the picture add hundreds of tin-roofed hovels and a textile factory. Yet Abraha, in Zeghie, had described Bahar Dar as ‘a fine city’.",

His gait is choppy, and it’s hard to direct him. Perhaps Colorado horse language is different from what a Mongolian horse would understand. The dusty warm pony sweat and the fresh air on my face make me long for home. Still, it feels so poetic to be in Mongolia on horseback that I momentarily consider just trotting on, to be done with brutal roads and confusing waypoints. Bernard’s figure recedes, becoming a small spot on the dark field. I thrill to be just me and the bay. Until I don’t. The further Bernard fades in the dusk, the more bereft I feel, as if I’ve torn half of me off and left it behind. In the deepening blue dusk I canter a ragged circle and head back. Bernard raises his arms high in a victory sign as he sees me, and I sink into his enveloping hug as my pony is led away.",

To further heighten the tension, on our drive back to the small, Elephant Coast town of St Lucia, we drove into a mini-hurricane. I've driven through some violent storms on my travels, but nothing like this. The late afternoon sky became as dark as night, and a gale-force wind whipped up from nowhere. Rain, then hailstones the size of marbles bounced off our windscreen, to such an extent that I was still unable to see through it, even after slowing to 10mph. It was like being in a car wash, with an electrical storm of unbelievable ferocity raging around us as we crawled along at walking pace. The sheet lightning was almost constant for a ten minute period as we travelled through the eye of the storm, and the continual flash of lightning strikes on the road ahead was like driving across a nightclub dancefloor with a strobe light on constant repeat.",

    "target_paragraph": "At the same time Baibars was slowly and methodically evicting the crusaders from their last toe-hold on the coast of Palestine. As I passed through the St Stephen’s Gate on my way back to Sheik Jarrah I saw an emblem of Baibars’ placed high above the portal. It must have been newly carved when Polo arrived in Jerusalem. The symbol was a pair of lions rampant about to attack a small rat. The lions, which were shown with powerful haunches, long claws and magnificent heraldic tails, represented Mameluke Egypt; the cornered rat, the crusaders. It was a sadly accurate picture: in 1263 Baibars had sacked Nazareth and burned the outskirts of Acre. The following year the crusader fortresses of Caesarea, Arsuf and Athlit all fell before his siege engines. In 1268 Antioch was captured by Baibars after a siege of only four days. But it was in the spring of 1271 that the crusaders received their greatest shock. Krak des Chevaliers, the headquarters of the Knights Hospitallers, was considered by all sides to be impregnable; in 1188 it had defied even Saladin. But on March the third Mameluke troops appeared unexpectedly below the castle, and soon the fortress was invested. Despite heavy spring rains arbalesters were brought up the hill from the valley bottom and after a short bombardment the Egyptians broke into the lower ward. The depleted garrison of three hundred fought on for another month until, on April the eighth, they surrendered, having received a forged order to do so, purporting to come from the Grand Master of the Hospitallers in Tripoli.",

This was evidence, to white Americans, of degeneracy.

He could hear the foreman of the stage hands shouting orders in a thick Irish tone, people were scuttling back and forth, dodging each other nimbly, jumping out of the way of big flats as they shot past. It seemed to be a case of every man for himself.

He was the spearhead of a flying wedge when it collided with a mass going in the opposite direction. The impact turned him around. As the two forces ground against each other, he was turned again and again, like a grain between millstones. This didn’t stop until he became part of the opposing force. The pressure continued to increase until he thought he must collapse. He was slowly being pushed into the air. Although relief for his cracking ribs could be gotten by continuing to rise, he fought to keep his feet on the ground. Not being able to touch was an even more dreadful sensation than being carried backwards.",

He could breathe in their poisonous and lifeless air, stand houseless, naked, unprepared beneath their desolate skies—he could yet endure, meet them, beat them, carry the victorious power of his own world in his own life, and make exultant joy, all-conquering certitude, triumphant sense, and lusty love prevail forever above the wretchedness and scornful doubt of their own life-denying lives—if only Nebraska Crane were there to see him do it!",

Throughout the Punjab one rarely encounters that extremity of poverty traditionally associated with India – but here one does.

The people all around us seemed inwardly dead, mere mechanically-moving puppets, their expressions dulled by permanent suffering. To look at their bodies – so malformed, starved and diseased – and to sense the stuntedness of their minds and spirits made me feel quite guilty about helping Tibetans when so many Indians are in such need. Yet one doubts if Indians ever can be helped in the sense that Tibetans can. Apart from the vastness of their current material problem the very nature of the people themselves seems stubbornly to defy most outside attempts at alleviation.",

Occasionally on a particularly windy day it would blow open to reveal whatever I was wearing underneath, and I ended up feeling like some whacked-out cartoon character walking down the street while it billowed in the wind behind me ... so much for modesty!

It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy. He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.

He threw down the tree he was planting, and was about to break through the belt of holly when he suddenly became aware of the presence of another man, who was looking over the hedge on the opposite side of the way upon the figure of the unconscious Grace. The stranger appeared as a handsome and gentlemanly personage of six or eight-and-twenty, and he was quizzing her through an eyeglass. Seeing that Winterborne was noticing him he let his glass drop with a click upon the rail which protected the hedge, and walked away in the opposite direction. Giles knew in a moment that this must be Mr. Fitzpiers. When he was gone Winterborne pushed through the holly, and emerged close beside the interesting object of their contemplation.",

A chilly wind circled round them, upon whose currents the seeds of a neighbouring lime-tree, supported parachute-wise by the wing attached, flew out of the boughs downward like fledglings from their nest.
