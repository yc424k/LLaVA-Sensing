At night she could hear the boats blowing in the river, and she could hear the ships putting out to sea. It was a five-story building of that familiar reddish brownstone which is now disappearing, but of which there were even then many miles left in the city. The material is ugly, but it is ugly with an evocative memory that is much more poignant and wonderful than most things that are considered beautiful. For in these ugly and desolate blocks of buildings of which the old New York was made, are the memories of primitive America, of “1887,” of “1893,” of “1904,”—that lost time which is more remote, more strange, and, to some men, more beautiful, than the Middle Ages—and the sounds of those times are more lost than Persepolis.",

It is now a familiar suggestion, and one which we are wise to be sceptical about when it is asserted as a rule. Sometimes walking is the mind’s subtle accomplice; at other times its brutal antagonist. As you will know if you’ve ever walked long distances for day after day, fatigue on the path can annihilate all but the most basic brain functions. After twenty miles you’re wall-eyed, inanely watching loops on what John Hillaby once called ‘the skull cinema’.",

    "target_paragraph": "After more than an hour of very difficult climbing we reached the lowest level of the crater, pretty nearly a mile across, presenting from above the appearance of a sea at rest, but on crossing it we found it to be an expanse of waves and convolutions of ashy-coloured lava, with great cracks filled up with black, iridescent rolls of lava, only a few weeks old. Parts of it are very rough and ridgy, jammed together like field ice, or compacted by rolls of lava which may have swelled up from beneath, but the largest part of the area presents the appearance of huge coiled hawsers, the ropy formation of the lava rendering the illusion almost perfect. These are riven by deep cracks which emit hot, sulphurous vapours. Strange to say, in one of these, deep down in that black and awful region, three slender metamorphosed ferns were growing, exquisite forms, the fragile heralds of the great forest of vegetation, which probably in coming years will clothe this pit with beauty. On our right there was a precipitous ledge, and a recent flow of lava had poured over it, cooling as it fell into columnar shapes as symmetrical as those of Staffa. It took us a full hour to cross this deep depression, and as long to master a steep, hot ascent of about 400 feet, formed by a recent lava-flow from Hale-mau-mau into the basin. This lava hill is an extraordinary sight-a flood of molten stone, solidifying as it ran down the declivity, forming arrested waves, streams, eddies, gigantic convolutions, forms of snakes, stems of trees, gnarled roots, crooked water-pipes, all involved and contorted on a gigantic scale, a wilderness of force and dread. Over one steeper place the lava had run in a fiery cascade about 100 feet wide. Some had reached the ground, some had been arrested midway, but all had taken the aspect of stems of trees. In some of the crevices I picked up a quantity of very curious filamentose lava, known as \"Pélé's hair.\" It resembles coarse spun glass, and is of a greenish or yellowish-brown colour. In many places the whole surface of the lava is covered with this substance seen through a glazed medium. During eruptions, when fire-fountains play to a great height, and drops of lava are thrown in all directions, the wind spins them out in clear green or yellow threads two or three feet long, which catch and adhere to projecting points.",

Yet the steep, scrubby slopes were bright with primrose patches, and misty blue wood-violets, and miniature dandelions – dainty, strongly coloured blooms. The sun was setting as we descended through a glade where four deer grazed – then gracefully fled, their sinuous, slow-seeming bounds taking them swiftly out of sight. Moments later the whole western sky flared crimson and I paused to stare at the fiery towers of cloud, edged above with gold and dramatically underlined by a long thin black plume.

Her partner, Cindy, offered to manage the property during my journey. Their contributions were essential to the rental process. After criminal background checks, I interviewed a promising couple who said they were a real estate agent and an artist. A quick Internet check indicated they were three months behind in their current rent. Another couple had used multiple social security numbers in several states, and the next pair had two bankruptcies and pages of unpaid debts. One bankruptcy and fewer debts would have been okay, but I’d have been a fool to rent to someone with so many unpaid obligations. But there were many callers; it took less than ten days to find appropriate renters.",

You stand quietly behind the worshipers, never moving in front of them. You are welcome to take photos (there is no roof), even using a flash, and to talk, ask questions, and move around unobtrusively. This is not a solemn event. No Balinese ceremonies are solemn. Everyone chats, jokes, and laughs. It is a joyous occasion. It is not a time to humble oneself, but to welcome the village gods to the temple, to make them happy with beautiful sights, sounds, and smells. Gay flags, banners, and umbrellas decorate the small buildings and shrines within. Long, decorated bamboo poles, penjors, sprout from the entrances to the shrines. The atmosphere is charged, at once with magic, festivity, and prayer.",

They sighed, looked gloomy, cheered up, and said beefsteaks, then.",

A visitor could buy food at Mallott’s General Store and alcohol at the Glass Door Bar, but if that same visitor wanted to sit down and consume food and alcoholic beverages together, he had to ride his lame bike all the way back out to the fishing lodge at the airport. Jim Capra had advised against stopping in for a drink at the Glass Door. “Every time I set foot in there, one of two things happens,” he told me. “Somebody lines up six shots on the bar, hoping to play ‘Get the Ranger Drunk,’ or somebody starts an argument that they hope turns into a fight.” I didn’t need to know what sort of temptation a visitor from New York might present.",

    "target_paragraph": "I toyed for a moment with the idea of grabbing the woman by both ears and driving her forehead into my knee, but instead passed into the next room where I found the entrance to a small cinema in which they showed us a crackling black and white film all about Roosevelt’s struggle with polio and his long stays at Warm Springs trying to rub life into his spindly legs, as if they had merely gone to sleep. It too was excellent. Written and narrated by a correspondent from UPI, it was moving without being mawkish, and the silent home movies, with their jerky movements that made all the participants look as if someone just out of camera range was barking at them to hurry up, exerted the same sort of voyeuristic fascination as F.D.R.’s legbraces. Afterwards we were at last released to see the Little White House itself. I fairly bounded ahead in order not to have to share the experience with the old people. It was down another path, through more pine trees and beyond a white sentry-box. I was surprised at how small it was. It was just a little white cottage in the woods, all on one floor, with five small rooms, all panelled in dark wood. You would never believe that this could be the property of a President, particularly a rich President like Roosevelt. He did, after all, own most of the surrounding countryside, including the hotel on Main Street, several cottages and the springs themselves. Yet the very compactness of the cottage made it all the more snug and appealing. Even now, it looked comfy and lived-in. You couldn’t help but want it for yourself, even if it meant coming to Georgia to enjoy it. In every room there was a short taped commentary, which explained how Roosevelt worked and underwent therapy at the cottage. What it didn’t tell you was that what he really came here for was a bit of rustic bonking with his secretary, Lucy Mercer. Her bedroom was on one side of the living-room and his was on the other. The taped recording made nothing of this, but it did point out that Eleanor’s bedroom, tucked away at the back and decidedly inferior to the secretary’s, was mostly used as a guest-room because Eleanor seldom made the trip south.",

She was not in the garden, but beyond it he had seen her approaching down a long shady path. Without hastening her step she had smiled and signed to him to wait; and charmed by the lights and shadows that played upon her as she moved, and by the pleasure of watching her slow advance toward him, he had obeyed her and stood still. And so she seemed now to be walking to him down the years, the light and shade of old memories and new hopes playing variously on her, and each step giving him the vision of a different grace. She did not waver or turn aside; he knew she would come straight to where he stood; but something in her eyes said \"Wait\", and again he obeyed and waited.",

Before them the head of the calm gulf is filled on most days of the year by a great body of motionless and opaque clouds. On the rare clear mornings another shadow is cast upon the sweep of the gulf. The dawn breaks high behind the towering and serrated wall of the Cordillera, a clear-cut vision of dark peaks rearing their steep slopes on a lofty pedestal of forest rising from the very edge of the shore. Amongst them the white head of Higuerota rises majestically upon the blue. Bare clusters of enormous rocks sprinkle with tiny black dots the smooth dome of snow.",

And there among the high maize stalks lay our bag, wide open. Each garment had been shaken out, no doubt in the hope of finding hidden cash, then hastily stuffed back; but nothing was missing. I felt weak with relief and found myself thanking Huarmi profusely: a rather inappropriate reaction. Only our financial crisis prevented me from giving granny a few hundred soles to compensate for the trouble we’d caused, amidst such poverty one gets one’s ethical knickers into the most frightful twist. Now having had all day to reflect on the incident, I can see that I was over-reacting. But I shall never look back on this morning as my Finest Hour. And the whole episode revealed that my waffling on last evening about Rachel sampling the reality of Third World suffering was based on fatuous self-delusion. We may seem (indeed we are) fairly spartan in comparison with your average modern tourist. Yet we need some £90 worth of special clothing to enable us to survive on the puna and we know nothing whatever about real privation. Our treks are just playing with hardship. When we go hungry for a few days, or endure extremes of heat or cold or exhaustion, these are no more than Interesting Experiences. The certainty of plenty and comfort lies before us and we cannot even begin to imagine what it feels like to go hungry and cold for a lifetime.",

The speciousness of Mr. Mayhew’s arguments, the sleight-of-hand by which he had dislodged the real workers and replaced them by his satellites, reminded the painter of the neutrals who were beginning to say that there were two sides to every question, that war was always cruel, and how about the Russian atrocities in Silesia? As the month dragged on a breath of lukewarmness had begun to blow through the world, damping men’s souls, confusing plain issues, casting a doubt on the worth of everything. People were beginning to ask what one knew, after all, of the secret motives which had impelled half-a-dozen self-indulgent old men ensconced in Ministerial offices to plunge the world in ruin. No one seemed to feel any longer that life is something more than being alive; apparently the only people not tired of the thought of death were the young men still pouring out to it in their thousands.",

With such a comrade to focus and stimulate his energies he felt modestly but agreeably sure of \"doing something\". And under this assurance was the lurking sense that he was somehow worthy of his opportunity. His life, on the whole, had been a creditable affair. Out of modest chances and middling talents he had built himself a fairly marked personality, known some exceptional people, done a number of interesting and a few rather difficult things, and found himself, at thirty-seven, possessed of an intellectual ambition sufficient to occupy the passage to a robust and energetic old age. As for the private and personal side of his life, it had come up to the current standards, and if it had dropped, now and then, below a more ideal measure, even these declines had been brief, parenthetic, incidental. In the recognized essentials he had always remained strictly within the limit of his scruples.",

The smells of wood, earth, and meadow each filled my nose as the breeze shifted round. Even the texture of the soil felt different as we stepped over it. These were the subtle things you could only experience at foot speed. Syd was right—a camera could distract you from it all. Maybe even my boots were too much?

But these fans were as wholesome as their British counterparts were not. Soccer fans were all too often nothing more than unemployed layabouts with knives in their shoes and switchblades in their eyes, scrounging for a fight; the Tiger supporters, by contrast, were uniformly well dressed and well behaved; they would rather, I imagined, switch than fight. Indeed, they presented a virtual model of an ideal social order. For even in the bleachers, there were no bums, no drunkards, no necking couples or unruly kids. Four children in front of me tidily poked at four tidily boxed meals of noodles and rice, while their mother anxiously snapped photos of them. Pairs of teenage girls whispered to one another and giggled. Senior citizens looked on with serenity. When the Tigers scored, everyone turned around and shook hands with everyone else, decorous as parishioners at an Easter service. And when their moment came, everyone joined together, on time and on cue, again and again and again, in their single compact chant. Da da da, da-da da da.",

But it was a lovely March evening, with just the faintest tang of spring in the air, and once I stumbled onto the Seine, at the Pont de Sully, I was met with perfection. There facing me was the Ile St-Louis, glowing softly and floating on the river like a vision, a medieval hamlet magically preserved in the midst of a modern city. I crossed the bridge and wandered up and down its shuttered streets, half expecting to find chickens wandering in the road and peasants pushing carts loaded with plague victims, but what I found instead were tiny, swish restaurants and appealing apartments in old buildings.",

Of course he had been only nineteen then and now he was thirty-six—didn't look like that at all; in recent snap-shots he was much broader and his hair had grown a little thin—but the impression of her brother she had always retained was that of the big picture.

I decide to embrace my new hope and let everything work itself out. It does. It is a big hill named Ben Hiant (528m) and the highest point on Ardnamurchan. What the shopkeeper forgot was that the road is a long, gradual climb overlooking awe inspiring landscape including the Small Islands north and the Sound of Mull. It is gorgeous. The wind abates. The ride down is long and gradual, too, past lochs, Neolithic monuments and bays, including the Bay of Strangers (Camas nan Geall) with its standing stones and cairns. St Columba’s Well is on the left. At the end is the Ardnamurchan Natural History Visitor Centre with exhibits that fill in my remaining blanks in the story of Ardnamurchan. So, a great day. And I feel good. I feel like I have finally found the rhythm to this part of the trip that can make it enriching. If I survive.",

Traditionally there were, and sometimes today still are, preludes and postludes to a tooth filing, traditions left over from another era when jobs and school did not interfere. A person whose teeth were to be filed was isolated for three days before the ceremony and given a mixture of rice powder and spices to rub on his or her body to clean it. After the ceremony one had to eat a traditional food called padamal, consisting of foods of the six different tastes: pait (\"bitter\"), manis (\"sweet\"), pakeh (\"salty\"), lalah (\"spicy\"), masem (\"sour\"), and nyangluh (\"burned taste\"). And for the three days following the ceremony, a person could not go out, nor could he or she drink or eat hot things because this would cause the teeth to take a bad shape. The Balinese use a word here that means \"wrinkled.\" The yellow coconut with the filings and saliva must be buried near the most important shrine in the family temple which insures that its power will always be close to the individual.",

Whatever convictions had been thwarted or impaired in him, his faith in the importance of his task remained unshaken; and the firmness with which he held to it filled Justine with a sense of his strength. The feeling kindled her own desire to escape again into the world of deeds, yet by a sudden reaction it checked the growing inclination for Stephen Wyant that had resulted from her revolt against Lynbrook. Here was a man as careless as Wyant of the minor forms, yet her appreciation of him was not affected by the lack of adaptability that she accused herself of criticizing in her suitor. She began to see that it was not the sense of Wyant's social deficiencies that had held her back; and the discovery at once set free her judgment of him, enabling her to penetrate to the real causes of her reluctance. She understood now that the flaw she felt was far deeper than any defect of manner. It was the sense in him of something unstable and incalculable, something at once weak and violent, that was brought to light by the contrast of Amherst's quiet resolution. Here was a man whom no gusts of chance could deflect from his purpose; while she felt that the career to which Wyant had so ardently given himself would always be at the mercy of his passing emotions.",

I like the kind with polenta in the cake and a thin layer of filling in the middle. I don’t mind the extra hour to pound open the pine nuts that at home I would have pulled from the freezer. First, I make a thick custard with two egg yolks, ⅓ cup flour, 2 cups milk, and ½ cup sugar. This makes too much, for my purposes, so I pour two servings into bowls to eat later. While the custard cools, I make the dough: 1–½ cups polenta, 1–½ cups flour, ⅓ cup sugar, 1–½ teaspoons baking powder, 4 oz. butter cut into the dry ingredients, one whole egg plus one yolk stirred in. I halve the dough and spread one part in a pie pan, cover with custard, then roll out the other half of the dough and cover the custard, crimping the edges of the dough together. I sprinkle a handful of toasted pine nuts on top and bake at 350° for twenty-five minutes. Soon the kitchen fills with a promising aroma. When it smells done, I place the golden torta on the kitchen windowsill and dial Signor Martini’s number. “My torta della nonna is ready,” I tell him.",

Virtually every man, woman, and child in Puerto Triunfo joined the procession to the cemetery. It was a collective act of resistance, remembered years later as the moment when the people took their first steps along a path of redemption that in time would allow them to reclaim their dignity, and take hold of their destiny.",
