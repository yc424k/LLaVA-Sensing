The only thing that had changed was the size of the yachts – they were bigger, much bigger. When he came through with his dad all those years ago, seventy feet was considered a big boat. Now it wouldn’t get a second look.",

Now there was very little more to do except to shave and dress, stow toilet things away, pack the brief-case with a few books and letters and the pages of manuscript that always accumulated wherever he was, and drive to the station. Twenty minutes' steady work would find him ready. The train was not due until half-past eight, and the station was not three minutes distant in a taxi-cab.

In Montana, they saw, for the first time, high mountains topped with snow. In Alberta, they began seeing moose racks on barns and houses. In British Columbia and Yukon Territory, they saw mud, and rain, and spruce. On the nineteenth of June, they crossed the hundred-and-forty-first meridian, and now “the roads were like crick beds, the rocks were like grapefruit”—Alaska! Not that they needed further proof of where they were, but they got it forthwith when they stopped at a roadhouse, three in the afternoon, and everyone in it was drunk. In Fairbanks, hungry, they cruised around looking for a place to eat, but all they could afford was soup and coffee, for two dollars and fifty cents. There were no hotel rooms. They slept in the car. Of the many hundreds of people they would come to know whose arrivals were similar to theirs, most—within days, a month, a year—would turn and go. The Gelvins sold the car and bought a pickup. Ed got a job in the railroad yard, and before long was building a school. One day in July, they went up the long dust trail to Central, to the domes of the Tanana Hills. Their purpose was to see caribou, and they stood on high passes and swept with their eyes the tundra fells. The nearest caribou was somewhere else. All they saw was the country.",

The complement included a boy of nine and a woman of eighty-two—hardly the sort of people you would invite to help you through an ordeal. Though it had been noted in London that certain skills would be desirable in such a remote situation, no one had actually acted on that observation. The party included no one proficient in the natural sciences, no master of husbandry, not a soul who had the faintest understanding of growing crops in hostile climes. The prisoners were in nearly every practical respect woeful. Among the seven hundred there was just one experienced fisherman and no more than five people with a working knowledge of the building trade. Phillip was by all accounts a kindly man of even temper and natural honesty, but his situation was hopeless. Confronted with a land full of plants he had never seen and knew nothing about, he recorded in despair: “I am without one botanist, or even an intelligent gardener.”",

The Japanese I read about in the Shanghai papers, careering around North China, grabbing one privilege after another, sending peremptory threats to Nanking, were so far removed from the Japanese I knew that I began thinking of their country as a place I'd never seen. My Japan was an entirely different land, a land where one saw soft, nacreous colors at sunrise and everyone was devoted to philosophy. As the years passed and those other Japanese moved in on Chinese territory, robbing and sacking the cities, the illusion of this duality grew easier to maintain. The small, hairy men in uniform and split-toe rubber boots who overran the Chinese city of Shanghai bore no relation to the people who had fished and bathed in the waters below Jijima and took their children to play at Enoshima. It was simpler not to think at all about Eddychan and Kazuko, especially after Pearl Harbor.",

Plus, I imagined the dark and deserted-looking trees along the edge of the highway belonged to the forest where Dorothy and her companions wanted to pick apples. Instead, the trees themselves had scolded them. The trees here, too, must wear scowls and have sharp limbs for hands. While the trees scowled, surely the rock walls laughed cruelly. Next to those rock walls yellow triangular signs read: Fallen Rock. Not Falling Rocks or Watch for Rocks, but rather laughably, rocks disgraced from the presence of Eden. What poem might Milton have written for them?",

Boone chinked his walls and insulated his floor and ceiling with moss collected by his children, planning to supplement it with cement and lime, while the Greenes used fibre glass between their logs. With their heating stove and cooking stove, the Greenes had powerful defenses against the coming cold, almost enough to drive them out into the snow, because if their cabin was handsome, it was ten times as snug. A lighted match could make it warm. The Greenes burn wood at the rate of four cords a winter. The Boones, with their larger cabin, use fifteen.",

Young homosexuals and lesbians usually came to him in couples asking for help. Dr bin Mohamed explained it was important that all contact between them ceased immediately. They needed to dry out, so to speak. The second step was the ‘purification of the heart’ – inabah, a return to purity, a recovery – using a method Dr bin Mohamed had successfully trialled on people with drug addictions. It was through repetitive prayer and readings of the Qur’an that the spirit could be healed of vices.",

But now this accomplished young man does it all by ciphering and mensuration. Then the wheat—that sometimes used to taste so strong o’ mice when made into bread that people could fairly tell the breed—Farfrae has a plan for purifying, so that nobody would dream the smallest four-legged beast had walked over it once. O yes, everybody is full of him, and the care Mr. Henchard has to keep him, to be sure!” concluded this gentleman.",

Juan’s father had portrayed the river in almost mythical terms, as if a sentient being, with recollections of hot tropical nights when the stars seemed to slip in the sky to catch a better view of the David Arango, aglow with deck lights, silently steaming downstream. Such images, Juan recognized, came from a place of deep memory, a well of nostalgia and romance completely removed from the staid middle-class life he had actually known growing up with his father in Medellín. This had only made the Magdalena that much more enchanting.",

If we could find a herd within two or three days’ walking distance from the camp, it would be extraordinary luck – always provided that the herd contained a bull with respectable tusks.\n\nIt is not unusual for an elephant hunter to spend six months, or even a year, on the spoor of a single bull. Elephant go where men can’t – or at least shouldn’t.",

This room also was filled with great bowls of roses, lilies and carnations, the air was dense and heavy with their scent, and through the windows of the place one could see the smooth velvet of the lawns, trimly patterned with designs of flowers aflame with all their glorious polychrome of colour, and at the end the flower-garden, which was alive with many rich and costly blooms growing in geometric designs. It was just the kind of flower-garden, just the kind of flowers, that a woman like Miss Telfair would have: their orderly, exotic and unnatural profusion suggested the cultivation of a hot-house; even the wild and lyric growth of sweet unordered nature had been made to conform to the elegant and fragile pattern of Miss Telfair’s life.",

For his own good, I had forbidden Ed from eating ice cream for fear that he might fall ill. Not ill with a sore throat and cold – which Indians seemed to think were acquired not through viruses, but by drinking cold water and eating ice cream – but ill with a bad stomach. During power cuts ice creams often melted and were then refrozen and melted again on numerous occasions, making them potentially lethal to weak stomachs. On my way back from the toilet, I caught him quietly licking the lid and he flicked it away. ‘My tongue needed cooling after that curry.’",

Here one could sit in peace and rest, pretending to look at an illustrated magazine. So we rested. After about an hour there entered a young Englishman and his wife, whom we had seen on our train. So, at last the coach had been shunted down to the port. Where should we have been had we waited!",

A few women, having finished washing-up, were sitting, the necks of their blouses undone, at the open doors, trying to get a breath of air. In the little schoolhouse, imprisoned children were droning lessons, and their reluctant voices floated sleepily out into the street through the open windows. Mr. Patterson, on inquiry at the Jolly Shepherds, was having his daily nap, and couldn’t be disturbed. Mrs. Jones was nowhere to be found—not that Mrs. Jones, or any other woman, could have got the bedstead up the stairs, but she would, Jen felt, have known where to find a man. A man was what was wanted. Mr. Ollier would have done perfectly, and he just round the corner, two minutes’ walk away on the other side of a cool churchyard, instead of at the end of over a mile of white glare. But he had put himself beyond the pale of helpfulness, or of anything else that was neighbourly and friendly. Oh, bother Mr. Ollier; there she was thinking of him again. …",

From the bluff, beyond a line of office buildings terraced sharply against the sunfilled sky, came a sound of traffic—motor horns, trolleys—passing high overhead on the river breeze; at the end of the street a trolley materialised in the narrow gap with an effect as of magic and vanished with a stupendous clatter.

Everything I saw made me think of what a colony on the moon would be like. But, in order to protect the ecology, the Galapagos have strict visa laws and we were allotted only five days. We had to get serious and find out what was wrong with my engine.

They never gave up, never complained, even when one would stumble over a giant clump of spinifex and pull on the nose-line of the one behind. Such stoic animals. The spinifex, that ubiquitous desert grass, was enough to make you want to burn every clump you saw. These clumps were usually about six feet across, and four feet high, with just the narrowest of gaps between them. They made walking difficult, tiring and painful. A clump is all spikes, and the tiny filaments on the ends of the spikes stick in flesh and itch and burn. I would be leaving sandhill country behind me soon, and heading into the endless flat, hot, homogeneous spinifex wastes, relieved only occasionally by a shallow gully containing mulga and, if lucky, some other titbits for the camels. I wondered how the desert would treat them.",
