Certainly we may imagine Chinese residents observing the early colonists with a bewildered air, as the foreign devils hurled themselves around tracks on ponies, clambered up unnecessary gradients or disturbed the water-spirits by diving in cold wet seas. Presently, though, Chinese were not only gambling on, but actually riding ponies at Happy Valley, and in the end all those imperial pastimes, except possibly cricket and rugby, were to be pursued at least as vigorously by the indigenes. Today there can be no spectacle more redolent of mens sana in corpore sano than the sight of a group of young Hong Kong Chinese hiking somewhere in the outlying islands. They go there in their hundreds, every fine weekend, wearing spotless anoraks and neat clean boots, all spick and span, all gleaming, all smiles, all Walkman radios, all mens sana, swinging boisterously along the country tracks, waving flags sometimes and singing. They look like figures in a propaganda poster; and though in fact this particular enthusiasm came to Hong Kong out of China proper, and the real inspiration for that hearty gait was probably Mao’s Long March, still one cannot help thinking that the old British colonists, as they set out for their two-mile walk before the morning kedgeree, would have liked to think of it as a legacy of their own.",

The party was large and mixed; and to the fresh, untutored mind of a tyro, this in itself was promising. The Dean pursued the ruinous policy of being all things to all men; and to-night, together with nonentities and Oxonians of European renown, there was a sprinkling of celebrities from the outside world. Among these were Mr. Langley Wyndham, the eminent novelist, and his friend Mr. Percival Knowles, the critic who had helped him to his eminence. Having collected these discordant elements around him, the Dean withdrew from the unequal contest, and hovered, smiling ineffectually, on the outskirts of his little chaos. Perhaps he tried to find comfort in a conscience satisfied for a party spoiled. But for Audrey this wild confusion was rich in possibility. However baffling to those officially responsible, it offered a wider field for individual enterprise; and if she did not possess that fine flow of animal spirits which sometimes supports lesser minds under such circumstances, she had other qualities which stood her in good stead. Conspicuous amongst these was an indomitable moral courage. She prepared to hurl herself into the breach.",

We walked for three days more, stopping at restaurants when we came to them, and camping in shelters, which once again we had mostly to ourselves. On our next to last day on the trail, our sixth since setting off from Rockfish Gap, we were walking along beneath dull skies when there came an abrupt, cold roaring of wind. Trees danced and swayed, dust and leaves rose up around us in boisterous swirls, and our jackets and outerwear took on sudden lives of their own, leaping and flapping about us. There was a roll of thunder and then it began to rain—a really cold, miserable, penetrating rain. We sheathed ourselves in nylon and stoically pushed on.",

There was much buzzing among the natives regarding our prospects for the day. I shall always think from their tone and manner, and the frequent repetition of the names of the three worst gulches, that the older men tried to dissuade us from going; but Deborah, who was very anxious to be at home by Sunday, said that the verdict was that if we started at once for our ride of twenty-three miles we might reach Onomea before the freshet came on. This might have been the case had it not been fm Kaluna. Not only was his horse worn out, but nothing would induce him to lead the mule, and she went off on foraging expeditions continually, which further detained us. Kaluna had grown quite polite in his savage way. He always insisted on putting on and taking off my boots, carried me once through the Waipio river, helped me to pack the saddle-bags, and even offered to brush my hair! He frequently brought me guavas on the road, saying, \"eat,\" and often rode up, saying interrogatively, \"tired?\" \"cold?\" D. told me that he was very tired, and I was very sorry for him, for he was so thinly and poorly dressed, and the natives are not strong enough to bear exposure to cold as we can, and a temperature at 68° is cold to them. But he was quite incorrigible, and thrashed his horse to the last.",

This place has a hospital, a maternity ward, and a troupe of about fifty or sixty fine beasts with their matching troupe of mahouts – the trainers and keepers.\n\nTypically and traditionally, a young man and a young elephant get paired up and trained together, and spend a lifetime as a pair. Elephants often live about as long as people, and I imagine there are difficult partings at the end of such a long road.",

There was nobody to be seen until I met a clean-shaven man with a Brooklyn accent who responded amiably to my greeting and seemed ready to chat while his bulldog read a letter on a tree trunk. He had made aliyah with his parents as Kiryat Arba was being developed and felt drawn back after studying agronomy in the US. When I asked about the settlement’s resources he replied, ‘Here we grow nothing but we’ve land nearby for all our fruit and vegetable needs.’ There was something artificially jovial about his manner but he seemed much less abnormal than H2’s denizens. (In this context ‘denizen’ is peculiarly apt: ‘a wild plant, probably foreign, that keeps its footing’.)",

He shook hands with his guards, then turned to the warden, William Hendry, and shook his hand, too. “I want to thank you for everything you have done for me, Warden,” Vanzetti said. Hendry was too overcome to reply. Then Vanzetti turned to the witnesses and in a clear voice and in good English said: “I wish to tell you that I am innocent, and that I never committed any crime, but sometimes some sin. I thank you for everything you have done for me. I am innocent of all crime, not only of this, but all. I am an innocent man.” As an afterthought he added, “I wish to forgive some people for what they are now doing to me.” He took the chair and sat calmly and silently as he was strapped in and his head was covered. A moment later the switch was thrown. “There was complete silence in the room, except for the crackling, sputtering sound of the current,” Elliott wrote in his 1940 memoir, Agent of Death. Vanzetti was declared dead at 12:26:55, less than eight minutes after Sacco.",

Also he was of the blood of the Ernaans, and his birth-place was the Field of Gold; but his eating and sleeping places where the four provinces of Eri, and his abiding place was not upon the ridge of the earth. His eyes strayed from the Abbey tower of the White Friars and the town battlements to a row of crosses which stood out against the sky upon a hill a little to the eastward of the town, and he clenched his fist, and shook it at the crosses. He knew they were not empty, for the birds were fluttering about them; and he thought how, as like as not, just such another vagabond as himself was hanged on one of them; and he muttered: 'If it were hanging or bowstringing, or stoning or beheading, it would be bad enough. But to have the birds pecking your eyes and the wolves eating your feet! I would that the red wind of the Druids had withered in his cradle the soldier of Dathi, who brought the tree of death out of barbarous lands, or that the lightning, when it smote Dathi at the foot of the mountain, had smitten him also, or that his grave had been dug by the green-haired and green-toothed merrows deep at the roots of the deep sea.'",

There was another table, occupied by four skinny young men with hollow cheeks and once-smart jackets who looked like university dropouts. One of them was texting furiously with his jaw clenched, eyes red from crying. When I had walked in and startled the rest of the clientele by being a woman, everybody had looked up, except this table. This table was sealed off from the rest by a heavy energy field.

I wake to a northerly wind that has a tinge of the artic. This is not hyperbole. When the wind blows from the north, it carries microscopic ice particles. That’s what I say because it is freezing. I climb up from Kildonan and ride west along the southern coast to Kilmory and the Lagg Hotel. The Lagg Hotel was built in 1791 as a coaching inn and looks it, although all bright and shiny. I am learning how things work here. If a building looks like a lodging and the door is open, I can walk in and accost someone for tea and/or food. They are usually glad for the trade. I am usually delighted because I am cold and/or starving. In this case both. Taking down the tent and packing up in the wind doesn’t make for a comforting breakfast scenario. The kettle got me hot tea, but that’s it. Here I get tea, scones, jam, a big slab of butter, and respite. The Lagg is also located in a valley with a stream running through it, surrounded by trees. Absolutely charming and good for mental health because I am now turning north, into that headwind.",

The useless fussing of that tiny energetic organism affected unpleasantly this big man threatened in his indolence.",

William and I reached Timaná, nestled in the foothills of the Macizo not fifty miles downriver from San Agustín, late in the day as golden light fell upon the tiled roofs and whitewashed walls of a settlement that is home to thirty thousand, with a history that reaches back to 1538. San Calixto, the oldest cathedral in Huila, soars over the main square, testament to the triumph and enduring power of the Catholic faith. Shadowing its red-brick façade is the canopy of a massive ceiba, planted at the very center of the plaza to commemorate the final liberation of the slaves in 1851 by President José Hilario López, a progressive leader who also supported a free press, agrarian reform, and the separation of church and state. With limbs the width of trunks, and great spreading branches that reach like serpents to and beyond all corners of the square, the tree stands for all the liberal impulses that in Colombia have always opposed the conservative dictates of the church.",

Its frame was of oak, chestnut and ash, and more than three hundred beams kept its roof and its floors from falling. When big easterlies blew, its timbers creaked and groaned, making a sound ‘like a ship in a storm’, as he once put it, ‘or a whale on the move’. It was as close to a living thing as a building could be. He kept the doors and the windows open, in order to let air and animals circulate. Leaves gusted in through one door and out of another, and bats flitted in and out of windows, so that the house seemed almost to breathe. Spiders slung swags and trusses of silk in every corner. Swallows nested in the main chimney, and starlings in the thatch. Ivy and roses clambered up the outer walls, and sent prying tendrils inside through knot-holes and cracks. At the front grew the eponymous walnut tree, which in early autumn clattered green hard fruit down on to the roof of his barn and the heads of visitors. At the back was the moat in which he bathed most days during the summer months, and which was kept clean by a colony of thousands of ramshorn snails - the hygienists of the pond world.",

When an Englishman listens to a speech he wants at least to imagine that he understands thoroughly and impersonally what is meant. But an Italian only cares about the emotion. It is the movement, the physical effect of the language upon the blood which gives him supreme satisfaction. His mind is scarcely engaged at all. He is like a child, hearing and feeling without understanding. It is the sensuous gratification he asks for. Which is why D'Annunzio is a god in Italy. He can control the current of the blood with his words, and although much of what he says is bosh, yet his hearer is satisfied, fulfilled.",

I had fifty pounds of travellers’ cheques and I had no interest at all in Turkey.

I thought of my garden. I missed my dahlias, and at some small station, where a postman was delivering letters from a bicycle, there was a bed of mauve and red flowers. I think I might really have got off if the girl called Tooley hadn’t at that moment touched my arm.
