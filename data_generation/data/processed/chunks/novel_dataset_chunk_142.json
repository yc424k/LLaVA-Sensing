Now, however, she had recovered, and had paid off the last instalment on the house. It was entirely hers. The property at this time was worth perhaps $12,000. In addition she had borrowed $3,500 on a twenty-year $5,000 life insurance policy that had only two years more to run, and had made extensive alterations: she had added a large sleeping-porch upstairs, tacked on two rooms, a bath, and a hallway on one side, and extended a hallway, adding three bedrooms, two baths, and a water-closet, on the other. Downstairs she had widened the veranda, put in a large sun-parlour under the sleeping-porch, knocked out the archway in the dining-room, which she prepared to use as a big bedroom in the slack season, scooped out a small pantry in which the family was to eat, and added a tiny room beside the kitchen for her own occupancy.",

There seems to be no proof of this, and all in all, the destruction of St. Paul's appears to be (still) as much a confusion of embarrassment as a tragedy. It was kept secret from Pius VII, who died on the seventeenth of July; according to Stendhal, Pius had a premonition that disaster threatened the church; but Stendhal is not trustworthy.",

Here at least was a Yin-Yang symbol hanging from the facade; here at least we would see dead-eyed hippies sprawled across cushions and munching hash brownies while they listened to Pink Floyd. As we entered the place, we shed our shoes, and as we sat down, we prepared to shed our inhibitions. The small round room was filled with smoke, and country-and-Eastern music wafted out of its sound system. On its floors were scattered pillows and divans; its walls swarmed with mandalas and thankas. This, I thought, must be an opium den, and my friend likened it to a womb. But there were no lamps and pipes beside every cushion, and no creative spasms rent the air. Yin was not in evidence; nor, to be frank, was Yang. Nothing, in fact, but a few well-heeled Italian tourists in their late thirties. We had traveled 8,000 miles only to end up, so it seemed, in a facsimile of the East Village.",

Viewed as a highly auspicious place to die, devout followers of the religion believe that taking their last breath in the ancient city will help them achieve moksha, the escape from the endless, tiresome cycle of reincarnation. Consequently, the stepped stone ghats alongside the river's sewage filled waters, are flanked by crumbling buildings housing hospices and old folk's homes. Here, ageing, wealthy Indians spend their final days, eagerly anticipating the moment they will expire in the sacred city, to be absolved of the sins accrued in all previous lives. There are even hotels offering 'death beds,' with discounts for those expected to live less than fifteen days. I assume those customers are encouraged to write their Trip Advisor reviews immediately after checking in.",

You understand a man like that hasn’t the ghost of a chance when it comes to borrowing clothes. Very well. On he came in hot haste, without a look right or left, passed within three feet of me, and in the innocence of his heart went on pelting upstairs into the harbour office to make his deposition, or report, or whatever you like to call it.",

I know Baron Haussmann made Paris a grand place to look at, but the man had no concept of traffic flow. At the Arc de Triomphe alone thirteen roads come together. Can you imagine that? I mean to say, here you have a city with the world’s most pathologically aggressive drivers ? drivers who in other circumstances would be given injections of thorazine from syringes the size of bicycle pumps and confined to their beds with leather straps ? and you give them an open space where they can all try to go in any of thirteen directions at once. Is that asking for trouble or what?",

He went on foot across the wilder recesses of the park, where slimy streams of fresh moisture, exuding from decayed holes caused by old amputations, ran down the bark of the oaks and elms, the rind below being coated with a lichenous wash as green as emerald. They were stout-trunked trees, that never rocked their stems in the fiercest gale, responding to it only by crooking their limbs. Wrinkled like an old crone’s face, and antlered with dead branches that rose above the foliage of their summits, they were nevertheless still green—though yellow had invaded the leaves of other trees.",

Only he located the right stars at that moment, he was not laying exactly right since a man must face the East to lay down; walk West but when you lay down, face the exact East. So he moved, shifted a little, and now he was exactly right and he was free now, he could afford to risk it; to show how much he dared risk it, he even would close his eyes, give it all the chance it wanted; whereupon, as if believing he really was asleep, it gradually went to work a little harder, easy of course, not to really disturb him: just harder, increasing. Because a man had to spend not just all his life but all the time of Man too guarding against it, even back when they said man lived in caves, he would raise up a bank of dirt to at least keep him that far off the ground while he slept, until he invented wood floors to protect him and at last beds too, raising the floors storey by storey until they would be laying a hundred and even a thousand feet up in the air to be safe from the earth.",

He was in his early forties, and maintained throughout the work an earnest and prosaic air. I was all the more surprised to catch him in a fantasy of his own invention – for every Sunday he appeared in the coffee shop in clothes of his own design: tall top-boots made in soft suède, jodhpurs, and a check tweed coat set off by a hard collar and a tie of American design with a chorus girl in flames hand-painted on it. He strolled about with an air of distinction in these clothes which were much admired.",

We laid out our bedrolls, then gathered on the open veranda for great steaming bowls of sancocho as Gulbert’s brother Parménides, a park ranger, briefed us on plans for the morning. Our route would take us across Puracé, one of Colombia’s oldest national parks, where the magic of the Macizo Colombiano, which covers some 13,000 square miles, is compressed into just 320 square miles. Small by the standards of Colombia’s national parks, Puracé is nevertheless a place of superlatives, with 362 lakes and lagoons and more than a dozen dramatic páramos, all with names that could only have been coined by campesinos: El Apio, El Buey, Las Papas—celery, ox, and potatoes. Rising over the páramos, forming the backbone of the park, are seven snow-clad volcanoes 14,000 feet or higher, with Puracé itself reaching to 15,030 feet. Within the park, Parménides added, arise some of the great rivers of Colombia, the Caquetá and the Cauca but also the Patía and the Magdalena, born of the same body of water, La Laguna de la Magdalena. The biological bounty includes more than two hundred species of orchids, rare populations of wax palms and Andean oaks, mountain tapirs, cougars, and spectacled bears, as well as some 160 species of birds, including carunculated caracaras, sunbeam hummingbirds, and Colombia’s national bird, the symbol of its patrimony, the Andean condor.",

He had begun as soon as he got into the carriage.\nShe tried to think of Dr. Charles, sitting all by himself in the back carriage, calm and comfortable among the wreaths. But she couldn't. She couldn't think of anything but Dan and the black hearse in front of them. She could see it when the road turned to the right; when she shut her eyes she could see the yellow coffin inside it, heaped with white flowers; and Roddy lying deep down in the coffin. The sides were made high to cover his arms, squared over his chest as if he had been beating something off. She could see Roddy's arms beating off his thoughts, and under the fine hair Roddy's face, innocent and candid.\nDr. Charles said it wasn't that. He had just raised them in surprise. A sort of surprise. He hadn't suffered.\nDan's dark head was bowed forward, just above the level of her knees. His deep, hot eyes were inflamed with grief; they kept on blinking, gushing out tears over red lids. He cried like a child, with loud sobs and hiccoughs that shook him. Her eyes were dry; burning dry; the lids choked with something that felt like hot sand, and hurt.\n(If only the carriage didn't smell of brandy. That was the driver. He must have sat in it while he waited.)\nDan left off crying and sat up suddenly.\n\"What's that hat doing there?\"\nHe had taken off his tall hat as he was getting into the carriage and laid it on the empty seat. He pointed at the hat.\n\"That isn't my hat,\" he said.\n\"Yes, Dank. You put it there yourself.\"\n\"I didn't. My hat hasn't got a beastly black band on it.\"\nHe rose violently, knocking his head against the carriage roof.\n\"Here—I must get out of this.\"\nHe tugged at the window-strap, hanging on to it and swaying as he tugged.\nShe dragged him back into his seat.",

The lower rooms were entirely given over to the birds, who walked about them with a proprietary air, as though the place had been built by and for themselves, and not by and for certain dusty copyholders who now lay east and west in the churchyard. The descendants of these bygone owners felt it almost as a slight to their family when the house which had so much of their affection, had cost so much of their forefathers’ money, and had been in their possession for several generations before the D’Urbervilles came and built here, was indifferently turned into a fowl-house by Mrs Stoke-D’Urberville as soon as the property fell into hand according to law. ‘ ’Twas good enough for Christians in grandfather’s time,’ they said.",

A log across the trail, the saw dogged in, a chain-width gap: that’s kerf. When the cut is complete, the kerf disappears. Writer Thomas Glynn describes the kerf as “the channel in the wood the saw rides in”; while Richard Manning writes “that’s the path the saw makes into sawdust—the path is waste, not lumber, so some of the strength of the original tree dies on a sawdust pile.” It’s a pragmatic point, but how can kerf be waste? Kerf is the critical negative space of wood, as present in every severance as water is present in air or a pause is present in a line. Kerf is no commodity. It cannot be sold, held, or used. If Derrida were a carpenter, kerf would be the trace of sawing, the invisible evidence of what has passed. To the builder, kerf is a shorter board, a penny tax on every cut. To a student of Zen, kerf is the path that disappears behind you as you walk on it, the way you can only see by not looking. It’s the between of the before and the after, this thing and the next. To the wood, kerf is gone.",

It always sounds like that,” the driver said, departing. Thirty miles up the road, the truck went around a curve, and the wheels tried to turn—as they are wont to on curves—at varying rates of spin. The differential failed to see the difference anymore. The breakdown was complete.",

Tiny children dressed as Rama, Hanuman and Ravan clash with paper swords and papier-mâché mallets. They duel, then stand in a huddle to chat up the next move. The boys wipe their dripping pancake makeup, touch up their fake mustaches, pull up their sequined suits and lunge for the kill again. On the loud-speakers a distorted drone of the Ramayana reading rises in volume as Ravan’s army starts to fall. One imp spends ten minutes sinking to the dust clutching his side in a death scene he’s copied from a classic Amitabh Bachchan movie. He then sits straight back up and yells at me, “Good, hey, Auntie? Photo please, what is your good name?”",

There was, in particular, another drawing-room, which she now described as Peter’s creation, but which Ralph knew to be partly hers: a heavily decorated apartment, where Popple’s portrait of her throned over a waste of gilt furniture. It was characteristic that to-day she had had Ralph shown in by another way; and that, as she had spared him the polyphonic drawing-room, so she had skilfully adapted her own appearance to her soberer background.

In the house next-door an elderly woman in a kimono lay on the floor in front of a huge color television, snoring through the late afternoon news. A girl at a shop I stopped in spent five minutes admiring the hair on my forearms, and a man with a red nose told me that he’d saved two million yen as a wedding present for his son. Evening drew on: fishing boats purred past the winking red lamps of tiny harbors. Across the bay the amber lights of the city of Kagoshima flickered on behind the dark lava slopes of the volcano, and as on the very first road of my journey – that hot June road – so here on the last, an old man said to me ‘Gokurosan (thank you for taking the trouble).’",

The drumming was loud and exciting, and the dancers, many with rattles around their ankles, leapt, twirled, and stepped with intention and devotion. During a break in the dancing, we stood silently in front of an altar contemplating the tall white candles and the offerings of flowers, musical instruments, photos, and food.",

He tells them his story and his quest for the sea. They say there is no outlet to the sea.

The Westerner is drawn to the tradition of the Easterner, and almost covets his knowledge of suffering, but what attracts the Easterner to the West is exactly the opposite—his future, and his freedom from all hardship. After a while, each starts to become more like the other, and somewhat less like the person the other seeks. The New Yorker disappoints the locals by turning into a barefoot ascetic dressed in bangles and beads, while the Nepali peasant frustrates his foreign supplicants by turning out to be a traveling salesman in Levi’s and Madonna T-shirt. Soon, neither is quite the person he was, or the one the other wanted. The upshot is confusion. “You cannot have pineapple for breakfast,” a Thai waitress once admonished me. “Why?” I asked. “What do you have for breakfast?” “Hot dog.”",

European tycoons are complaining that nine out of ten banks won’t open accounts for companies operating in Cuba. Yet increasing trade with many countries – especially Venezuela, China and Spain – are vitiating the blockade; last year the Cuban economy recorded a ten per cent-growth rate. Now US pressures are affecting individuals more than the state; when a Cuban children’s theatre group was invited to a drama festival in Buenos Aires the Argentinean government refused them visas. When a Miami-based consortium bought Spain’s Pullmantour cruising company two hundred and twenty Havana workers were sacked. US-owned hotels around the world have sacked their Cuban musicians.
