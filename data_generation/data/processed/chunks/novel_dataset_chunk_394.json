Yet this spiritual sideshow alley is hardly threatening—these sadhus are more like circus freaks on display. Pilgrims file past pointing, whispering, staring and occasionally touching the feet of the sadhus, giving them money or snapping a photo. In return, the hordes are blessed with prasad (a gooey sweet) for additional spiritual energy. The Big Pot Festival is literally in full swing in Sadhu Street; the air is thick with hash and red-eyed saints are sloppily stoned. In some pens smug Westerners sit sharing hash chillums with the holy men and a few in the Juna beckon me over. It’s high status to have foreigners pay homage in this way, but I’m unwilling to be a sadhu trophy and keen to be able to find my way back to camp. I retire to worship Shiva alone with the help of the Channel Four media boys. It’s a practical puja—the dope helps me sleep through the Kumbh noise and brings on states of bliss. I fall into bed feeling that everything is clear, everything is significant.",

His complaints and pleas wore me down; and after dinner I allowed myself to be led through the dark, cold camp, past ropes and glinting rivulets and heaven knows what other dangers, to the tent of one of the government officials accompanying the pilgrimage. I had met him the previous evening at Chandanwari, and now he greeted me warmly. I was glad for Aziz’s sake and my own at this proof of my influence. Aziz behaved like a man already satisfied. He was no longer the leader; he was only my deferential servant. By his behaviour, his interruptions, he presented me as the aggrieved party, a duped tourist; then he withdrew, leaving me to get out of the situation as best I could. My complaint was half-hearted. The official made notes. We talked about the difficulties of organizing such a pilgrimage, and he offered me a cup of coffee with the compliments of the Indian Coffee Board.",

There was no light save that of the coals; but, by their dim steady glow, he could make out the old and ugly wall-paper, stained with long streaks of water rust, and scaling, in dry tattered scrolls, here and there. He sat quietly, bent forward, but he shook violently, as with an ague, from time to time. Why am I here? This is not I, he thought.",

The rest of the story, as told by Mrs. Jameson (Legends of the Monastic Orders): “‘Art thou willing to die?’ asked the saint. ‘No,’ sighed the youth. ‘Art thou willing to resign thy soul to God?’ ‘I am.’ ‘Then go,’ said Philip. ‘Va, che sii benedetto, e prega Dio per noi.’ The boy sank back on his pillow with a heavenly smile on his face and expired.” This happened on March 16th and every year it is still commemorated; the boy’s bedroom is in a part of the house now rented as an apartment, which has to be vacated annually on that day.",

Nikolai Bestuzhev, the kindhearted officer who had refused to let the young cadets accompany his soldiers to the Senate Square, died in Siberia in 1855.

The tracks remained, but broad-boled birch muscled up between the sleepers, blocking the tracks and halting the return of the trains. A complex mosaic of grassland, shrubland, and groves of black locust trees sprung up under a rusting water tower; by 1980, the 25-acre Natur-Park Südgelände supported 334 species of ferns and flowering plants, plus foxes, falcons, three hitherto unknown species of beetle, and a rare spider previously only found in underground caverns in the south of France.",

    "target_paragraph": "Thus talking, with easy silences and some pauses to look at the view over the hedge and to decide upon the species of a little grey-brown bird slipping among the twigs, they walked into Lincoln, and after strolling up and down the main street, decided upon an inn where the rounded window suggested substantial fare, nor were they mistaken. For over a hundred and fifty years hot joints, potatoes, greens, and apple puddings had been served to generations of country gentlemen, and now, sitting at a table in the hollow of the bow window, Ralph and Mary took their share of this perennial feast. Looking across the joint, halfway through the meal, Mary wondered whether Ralph would ever come to look quite like the other people in the room. Would he be absorbed among the round pink faces, pricked with little white bristles, the calves fitted in shiny brown leather, the black-and-white check suits, which were sprinkled about in the same room with them? She half hoped so; she thought that it was only in his mind that he was different. She did not wish him to be too different from other people. The walk had given him a ruddy colour, too, and his eyes were lit up by a steady, honest light, which could not make the simplest farmer feel ill at ease, or suggest to the most devout of clergymen a disposition to sneer at his faith. She loved the steep cliff of his forehead, and compared it to the brow of a young Greek horseman, who reins his horse back so sharply that it half falls on its haunches. He always seemed to her like a rider on a spirited horse. And there was an exaltation to her in being with him, because there was a risk that he would not be able to keep to the right pace among other people. Sitting opposite him at the little table in the window, she came back to that state of careless exaltation which had overcome her when they halted by the gate, but now it was accompanied by a sense of sanity and security, for she felt that they had a feeling in common which scarcely needed embodiment in words. How silent he was! leaning his forehead on his hand, now and then, and again looking steadily and gravely at the backs of the two men at the next table, with so little self-consciousness that she could almost watch his mind placing one thought solidly upon the top of another; she thought that she could feel him thinking, through the shade of her fingers, and she could anticipate the exact moment when he would put an end to his thought and turn a little in his chair and say:",

I have never gone back to look at the region around that highway leading west, and it would be different now anyway, but even then it couldn't have been as beautiful as I thought. Nevertheless, I still think with love of rich, wet color—the green of summer trees and the dark, glistening red clay of the road winding between them, distant blue hills across valleys that were as simply verdant as if a child's crayon had drawn them. There were cracks of lightning in the lowering sky, too far off to be frightening. Obviously, I have forgotten all about the long dull stretches, and though the little towns must have been just like those of Wisconsin and Illinois, my mind has retained no memory of boredom or disappointment.

A party of Gypsies had settled for the night by yet another sweep-well, and our arrival caused bewilderment. Except for the fires, there was no glimmer in any direction and I saw, half with excitement and half with a touch of fright, that we would have to spend the night there. I had heard many hair-raising stories about Gypsies recently and I was chiefly scared about Malek. When I dismounted they crowded about him and patted and stroked his neck and his flanks and scanned his points with eyes like shrewd blackberries. Shaggy and unkempt, they were the darkest Gypsies I had ever seen. Some of the men wore loose white Hungarian trousers, the others were in ordinary town clothes and black hats, all in the last stage of decay. Snotty mites and lithe tar-babies wore vests that came to their middles and some had nothing on at all, except one or two insecurely hatted in cast-off trilbies so loose they swivelled as they walked. Beautiful girls, flounced and bedraggled in green and yellow and magenta, stared with effulgent eyes. Beyond the fires there was a munching of unyoked oxen; horses were hobbled under the branches and a couple of mares grazed loose with tall foals beside them. Dogs bickered and snarled and the poultry, loosed from their travelling coop, pecked about the dust. Black and brown tents were stretched over crossed poles and the ramshackle style and the jumbled scattering of household stuff gave no hint of a thousand or two thousand years’ practice in pitching camp; except for the reeds and withies and the half-woven baskets on which brown hands were already busy, the whole tribe might have fled half an hour ago from a burning slum. I think they were heading for the banks of the Tisza to cut a new stock.",

I bore away and swung the bow through the wind to make a closer approach. Just as we were coming up to them again, this time maybe seventy feet away, two guys dived overboard and stroked hard for Caribee. Alarmed, I pushed the throttle fully open and started to turn downwind. Too late. Faster than I would have believed possible they were a few strokes off our port side, eyes glued to the low freeboard of our decks. It occurred to me to kick them, or stomp their fingers to keep them off, but that seemed like a mean-spirited thing to do to these obviously terrified swimmers and I just didn’t have it in me. They were afraid that we were going to sail away and leave them adrift again and were seizing what they saw as their best option. Before we had time to consider it further they had pulled themselves aboard, panting as they climbed dripping wet into the cockpit.",

A middle-aged man in a long blue djellaba marched to the front of the bus and cursed the driver for several minutes. As would soon become painfully apparent, he needed to evacuate his bowels. The driver didn’t answer him, but his ears turned red. He pulled off the highway and rolled to a stop on the shoulder. The left side of the bus, where we sat, blocked several feet of the right lane. I imagined the headline: “Truck Crashes into Bus! All Passengers Dead.” The driver opened the door. First, Burly Man jumped off the bus. Then Shitting Man, as I would soon call him, jumped off the bus. A dozen passengers, thinking it were a smoke break, jumped from the bus too. The driver squirmed in his seat and made an angry phone call. I watched the errant passengers. Shitting Man scaled the concrete guardrail, turned his back to the wind, raised his robe to his knees, squatted, and shit over the wall. To make the most of his break, Shitting Man lit a cigarette and drew a few long puffs. After a few minutes, the driver honked the horn and everyone but Shitting Man boarded the bus. Shitting Man never even turned his head. The driver blew the horn for two solid minutes. Teresa covered her head and closed her eyes. Finally, Shitting Man finished. He flicked his cigarette in the road, jumped off the wall, and climbed aboard the bus. The odor of fresh feces wafted in the warm air for several minutes after he walked by.",

The latter is home to one of Africa's largest populations of both black and white rhino, and we felt privileged to observe these highly endangered animals in the wild, and at close quarters. It was a sobering thought to watch three black rhino wallowing in the cool mud of a waterhole, and consider that the species is likely to be extinct in twenty years if nothing is done to quell the Far East's senseless craving for their horns.",

Neither Mr. Spragg nor his wife had ever before been out of their country; and Undine had not understood, till they stood beside her tongue-tied and helpless on the dock at Cherbourg, the task she had undertaken in uprooting them. Mr. Spragg had never been physically active, but on foreign shores he was seized by a strange restlessness, and a helpless dependence on his daughter. Mrs. Spragg’s long habit of apathy was overcome by her dread of being left alone when her husband and Undine went out, and she delayed and impeded their expeditions by insisting on accompanying them; so that, much as Undine disliked sight-seeing, there seemed no alternative between “going round” with her parents and shutting herself up with them in the crowded hotels to which she successively transported them.",

And they, shop-girls\nand shop-boys and young clerks, slipped off their memories of the desk\nand counter, and a joy, an instinct, and a sense that had no memory woke\nin them, savage, virgin, and shy; the pure and perfect joy of the young\nbody in its own strength and speed; the instinct of the hunter of the\nhills and woodlands; the sense of feet padding on grass and fallen\nleaves, of ears pricking alert, of eyes that face the dawn on the high\ndowns and go glancing through the coverts. And as this radiant and\nvehement life rose in them like a tide their gravity and shyness and\nseverity passed from them; here and there hair was loosened, combs were\nshed, and nobody stopped to gather them; for frenzy seized on the young\nmen, and their arms pressed on the girls' shoulders, urging the pace\nfaster and faster; and light, swift as their flying feet, shot from\ntheir eyes, and they laughed each to the other as they ran. So divine\nwas now the madness of their running, so inspired the whirling of the\nWheel, that the thing showed plainly as the undying, immemorial ecstasy;\nshowed as the secret dance of magic and of mystery, taken over by the\nLondon Polytechnic, and, at the very moment when its corybantic nature\nmost declared itself, constrained to an order and a beauty tremendous\nand austere.",

Had this town prospered, it could have been a tolerable place to live: wide streets, grassy embankments, ample playgrounds, a capacious stadium, a theatre-cum-cinema and no through-traffic (even when there was traffic) because Jagua is at the end of the road. But the Special Period had left it dejected. I could find no open bar, café, restaurant, nor any ‘private enterprise’ pavement snacks. However I persisted, as one does when beer-hunting, and eventually a tienda appeared, its fridge half-full of Buccaneros. In that little shop the pace of commerce was pleasing. A young black woman, trying to decide which scent to buy with her precious CP5, conferred at length with the mulatto saleswoman. Seven little bottles were sniffed by both and compared and sniffed again while two amused young black men and I waited patiently. Here too the counter display-case showed single wrapped sweets priced individually (CP 0.50), and mini-lollipops (CP 0.10) and mini-chocolate bars (CP 0.15). I bought one of each, to enable me to condemn their poisonously poor quality.",

In a few minutes, I would be delivered into a Niagara of humanity. A squeak of rubber on burning hot runway and we landed in Jeddah. Minutes later the door of the plane opened, admitting a torrent of noise. Sounds of a million men swarmed into the cabin.\nHajj was here.\nWe disembarked the plane in a tumbling mass, slamming into a sweltering wall of moist heat. The humidity from the Red Sea was staggering. Like a live beast, it traveled insidiously under my abbayah, entering at the wrists, snaking over my body, leaving a sticky trail of perspiration in its wake. I peered for Qudsia. Spying her a few steps behind me, I went to join her, and abreast we walked from the runway into the terminal ahead.\nPilgrims from our plane disappeared into dank darkness, scurrying to baggage claim. We hurried to follow, soon noticing all signs were in Arabic which neither of us could understand. We would have to rely on our fellow passengers to take us to the right carousel. Overhead, announcements in guttural and precise Saudi Arabic peppered a hubbub of whirring air conditioners and asynchronous praying.\nThe male pilgrims were surprisingly adept at handling their robes and carrying luggage, all the while moving at a rapid pace. They were possessed with an urgency which I now noticed I lacked. I felt more fearful of being lost than concerned about rushing toward Mecca. These men were anxious with an urgent joy to meet their Maker. Even clumsy Hajj garments seemed not the least encumbrance. I continued my customary staccato forward rushing and periodic arrests backward, tripping on the rear hemline of my abbayah, and made considerably slower progress, but already I was glad of my low-heeled moccasins. I would be doing a lot of walking and already, even mid-morning, the tarmac was heating underfoot.\nInside, the terminal at the King Abdul Aziz airport was surprisingly small given the fifty thousand pilgrims who had been arriving here daily throughout the weeks leading up to Hajj. Many of these pilgrims were likely to be from Southeast Asia—450 flights arrive each day from Indonesia and from Pakistan another 376.10 But today I was arriving with the final influx of domestic pilgrims, traveling from within the Kingdom.\nA year before my arrival in the Kingdom, the Saudi authorities had placed a quota on domestic residents, to ease pressure on Hajj. Now Saudi citizens were required to apply to local pilgrimage boards to seek a permit for Hajj, granted only to those who had not performed Hajj within at least a five-year period. This prevented Saudi residents from arriving annually for Hajj, magnifying the congestion. Though controversial at the time, these sensible restrictions had been effective and reduced domestic pilgrims from fifty percent of all pilgrims to under thirty percent and, because of the specific restriction to those who had been on Hajj within a five-year window, most of the thirty percent now traveling to Hajj from within the Kingdom were non-Saudi expatriates.11",

    "target_paragraph": "Many of Popular Unity’s policies – those to reform land ownership, for example – were developments of policies pursued by the previous regime. But they were often radical developments nonetheless, and some of them attempted the impossible. In addition, a collapse in world copper prices handicapped Allende’s already massively challenging undertaking. More has been written about the three years of his government than about any other period in Chilean history, and the reasons for its failure are still bitterly disputed. There is little disagreement that it did fail. Hyperinflation and escalating economic, political and social chaos had paralyzed the country by 1973, although the government still won an increased majority of 43.4 per cent in the March 1973 elections at an extremely difficult moment in the socialist experiment. (In the British general election in 1992 41.85 per cent of the electorate voted for, and returned, a Conservative government.) Some of the ideas spewed out by the Popular Unity cabinet were too theoretical to stand any chance of being converted into successful practice. The ultra-leftists weakened the socialist movement. The coalition itself was fragmented, yet it faced a press virtually united in opposition, much of it funded by foreign dollars. Allende ignored constant warnings from within his party that he should slow down the pace of his reforms to prevent a right-wing backlash. Agrarian reform incensed the élite. US manipulation of class conflict was highly successful. By September 1973 Washington didn’t have to worry about directly handing a coup: it had destabilized the country so effectively that it could leave the mechanics to the Chileans.",
