And that is fine. William Shawn’s New Yorker, which sponsored most of Matthiessen’s natural expeditions, including this one, trained the writer in drawing attention to the world he was reporting, not himself; Zen does much the same, making the ego seem small and laughable in the context of the natural truths all around it. The point of The Snow Leopard is, much more than in most books, to lose sight of the author and his language so as to feel the silver light of the mountains, the blue sky opening above, the silence and the clarity.",

To outward appearances they were absorbed in the beauties of nature. Sirocco mists rose upwards, clustering thickly overhead and rolling in billowy formations among the dales. Sometimes a breath of wind would convulse their ranks, causing them to trail in long silvery pennants across the sky and, opening a rift in their gossamer texture, would reveal, far down below, a glimmer of olives shining in the sunlight or a patch of blue sea, framed in an aureole of peacock hues.

There was a big painting of Will Rogers, hung conspicuously and intended, I think, to suggest Father’s essential kinship with Hollywood’s St Francis; there was a signed photograph of Minna Davis, Stahr’s dead wife, and photos of other studio celebrities and big chalk drawings of Mother and me. Tonight the one-way French windows were open and a big moon, rosy-gold with a haze around, was wedged helpless in one of them.

How precious were the negations--the not seeing, not hearing, not talking, not being with anybody. Even Manby couldn't get at her. Sitting next to the chauffeur, safely separated by the glass partition, she couldn't even ask her whether her feet were warm, and would she like another rug. Oh, blessed, blessed, thought Fanny, to be alone, to be in the dark, to be out of reach, not to be in Upswich any more.",

He stayed some time and I took the opportunity of discussing with him my plan of riding out into the Safa, the volcanic waste east of the Jebel Druze. He was not at all encouraging, indeed he thought the project impossible under existing conditions, for it seemed that the Ghiāth, the tribe that inhabits the Safa, were up in arms against the Government. They had waylaid and robbed the desert post that goes between Damascus and Baghdad, and were expecting retribution at the hands of the Vali. If therefore a small escort of zaptiehs were to be sent in with me they would assuredly be cut to pieces. Milhēm agreed, however, that it might be possible to go in alone with the Druzes though anything short of an army of soldiers would be useless, and he promised to give me a letter to Muhammad en Nassār, Sheikh of Sāleh, whom he described as a good friend of his and a man of influence and judgment. The Ghiāth are in the same position with regard to the Druzes as are the Jebeliyyeh; they cannot afford not to be on good terms with the Mountain, since they are dependent on the high pasturages during the summer.",

But when on Catherine’s turning round she saw her face, she was instantly placated. What a change. Judgment had indeed been swift.

We were led into a bus to take us to the terminal, and the martial music started up again. Inside, a few lipsticked soldiers apprehended me as soon as they saw me walking around alone. Then a tall, debonair young man, with a nonchalant Left Bank air, puffing on an Albanian cigarette, came up and extended a hand. “I am your guide,” he began smoothly, ushering me into a white Volvo sedan. “What is your occupation? What is your religion? Have you been to South Korea? What were you doing before you came to China? What will you do after you leave China?” We drove through the sepulchral dusk, rows of featureless concrete towers looming through the gray on every side, the gloom relieved only by an occasional Sound of Music billboard. His conversation exhausted, the guide confiscated my passport and scowled. We passed more paintings of workers singing at the heavens. “Korean and Chinese are faintly similar?” I tried. “Totally different,” he replied.",

The contrast of the picture with her rebellious and agitated existence at this same time was too much for her to bear to look upon longer.

Experience has given it a certain weight, a gravitas, but it’s also given it the playfulness most evident in the old, those elders who have weathered every kind of struggle; it’s evident in the peanut shells on the floor, the tea towels representing the turbaned Sikh doorman, the way the antique showrooms in the shopping arcade have been replaced by something more forward-looking and the four-hundred seat Jubilee Hall is now a chandelier-rich ballroom for the three hundred and fifty weddings that sweep through the premises every year. I remember how the British High Commissioner—as we sat in his high-ceilinged, spacious official residence, Eden Hall, designed by Regent Alfred John Bidwell, the same man who designed Raffles—told me how he’d seen one celebrated “starchitect”, responsible for designing tomorrow, eagerly snapping photos as he came down the carpeted staircase to the Raffles lobby.",

When our departure was announced queues formed at four gates, each line confined between metal bars as in a cattle-crush. Then came a delay, caused by several pairs of porters pushing long handcarts piled with cargo for Santiago. Shouting and laughing, they raced each other along the broad hundred-yard expanse between barrier and buffers, their loads wobbling precariously. Unsmiling young women eventually unlocked the gates and closely scrutinised each ticket and ID document. They wore the railway uniform of purple shorts and tunics with black tights and absurdly high-heeled shoes. Although foreigners must travel first-class I had trouble finding my allotted place; all the coaches had gone unpainted for decades. Excitedly chattering groups were being guided to their seats by other uniformed women one of whom led me to a carriage with torn upholstery and mud-coated windows. My only companion was Raimundo, tall, lean, distinguished-looking and very black. A history professor, specialising in colonial Africa, he spoke fluent English.",

I pretended for the sake of my own men to disbelieve them, but secretly I put my watch back a couple of hours, determined that even if it were a twelve-hour trek, we should yet do it and sleep in Grand Bassa. The messenger stuck the note into a cleft stick and with some of our last oil in his lamp set off to walk to Grand Bassa all night through the forest. I remember a whistle blowing among the shabby huts as Tommie marshalled a few ragged uniformed messengers with rifles as useless as his own before a flagstaff in the centre of the village and the Liberian flag waved up and down again while Tommie tried to make his awkward squad stand at the ‘present’. But they laughed at him and someone stole his whistle, and all that evening Tommie went glowering up and down the village looking for it.",

That Stefansson had instructed George Wilkins to film (both in still and moving photography) his departure, theatrically capturing the team heading off into the frozen unknown, certainly illustrated his awareness of his image as an intrepid explorer, undaunted and unafraid. But Anderson also thought Stefansson irresponsible for entirely disregarding the fate of the members of the Karluk, and he’d told him so in sharp words. Rather than tramping off on a new personal and selfish journey, he should be busy organizing rescue ships to go search for Bartlett, his crew, and the expedition’s scientists, who might be clinging to their lives somewhere out on the frozen sea or stranded on some island.",

With the death of Pablo Escobar in 1993, he was able to return, but only for a time. In early 1997, guerrillas of the ELN (National Liberation Army) found Juan Guillermo sitting quietly on the banks of the river. Slipping a hood over his head, they marched him deep into the forest. After two months in captivity, Juan Guillermo overheard a radio broadcast announcing that several ELN cadres had been killed in a foiled attempt to assassinate Álvaro Uribe, then governor of Antioquia. He realized from the location and description of the attack that the guerrillas had originated from the very band that held him prisoner. Knowing that most of his captors would be away for at least two days, he plotted his escape, slipping into the forest that very night. Months later, he was kidnapped yet again. By this point, he had lost his daughter and was as close to despair as he would ever be. When they reached the ELN encampment, he dared the guerrillas to kill him. Death, he told them, meant nothing to him. He then turned his back on their guns and walked home.",

William Langewiesche rightly describes the book as ‘a small masterpiece of scientific exploration’, the consequence of Bagnold’s love-affair with sand. ‘Instead of finding chaos and disorder, ’ Bagnold wrote of the desert:the observer never fails to be amazed at a simplicity of form, an exactitude of repetition and a geometric order unknown in nature on a scale larger than that of crystalline structure. In places vast accumulations of sand weighing millions of tons move inexorably, in regular formation, over the surface of the country, growing, retaining their shape, even breeding, in a manner which, by its grotesque imitation of life, is vaguely disturbing to an imaginative mind.",

On the evening of his parade, Charles and his mother, accompanied by Mayor Walker, were driven to the Long Island estate of a multimillionaire named Clarence H. Mackay for a banquet to be followed by dancing. Shortly after dinner, it was noticed that Lindbergh was no longer present. A panicky Mackay instituted a search of the estate, unable to imagine what had become of his prize guest. It turned out that Lindbergh and his mother had departed for Manhattan without saying thank you or goodbye to their host, the governor, the mayor, or any of the other five hundred guests. They evidently hadn’t told the mayor that they were leaving him without a ride either.",
