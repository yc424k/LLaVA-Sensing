Thank goodness some great invisible magnet pulls me in the right direction, by which I mean any direction away from where I am. If it has to be a grieving season, at least in the tropics you can weep at night and thousands of cicadas will join you. In daylight, tears wash away when you swim, when you sweat, when mango juice dribbles down your chin. You’re always dripping wet in the tropics. What’re a few tears thrown in?",

Osaka pioneered a new type of drive-in public bath at Goshikiyu, near the Toyonaka interchange on the expressway. In general, public baths are slowly dying out in Japan, as the number of homes with their own bath and shower increases. However, an Osaka bathhouse proprietor of an entrepreneurial bent promoted the idea that an evening out at the public bath was the perfect family entertainment. He built a multistoried bathhouse with a large parking lot to service Japan’s new car-centered lifestyle. Inside, he installed restaurants, saunas and several floors of baths with every type of tub: hot, cold or tepid; with jacuzzi, shower or waterfall. On a Saturday night you can hardly get into Goshikiyu’s parking lot; the place is jammed with families with small children.",

At the base of the mountains, grey and black boulders stand gauntly in deep snow, interspersed with occasional large thyme-clumps or juniper bushes. Then come level white stretches – probably fields – often surrounded by Connemara walls and with orchards nearby; and there are unexpected 200-feet deep cleavages in the soft earth, which necessitate long detours. Some of these cracks must be recent since the old track runs to the edges on both sides. For much of the way the Indus is again visible, far below. As it wanders mildly in its deep, wide, gravelly bed it seems quite unrelated to that rollicking torrent which forces its way through the Gorge. At river-level lines of poplars and willows look like toys and make one newly conscious of the scale of the landscape. Beyond the Indus stretch miles of pale brown sand-dunes, beautifully wind-moulded, and from these rise two more isolated, oblong rock mountains, not quite as high or long as the Rock but scarcely less dramatic.",

In many cities, impresarios hired theaters or other grand spaces (Madison Square Garden, for instance) to provide paying audiences with simulated games. One version employed a large diagram of a baseball diamond with colored lights to show balls, strikes, and outs, bells for hits, and white footprints tracing a path around the base paths. An announcer on the stage would relate?and sometimes creatively embellish?developments on a distant playing field from fragmentary information supplied by ticker tape while the scoreboard lit up, clanged, and traced footsteps in support. Another system used live boys, each representing a real player, who took up positions on a baseball field on the stage, where they pitched, batted, and fielded an imaginary ball and ran from base to base as distant reality required. As one observer marveled, no crowds in ballparks were “more loudly appreciative of every fine play than those millions jammed into the various halls or thronging the streets in front of newspaper offices.”",

By the end of the winter all the match-makers were predicting that something would come of it; but when Delia playfully sounded her cousin, the girl’s evasive answer and burning brow seemed to imply that her suitor had changed his mind, and no more questions had been asked. Now it became evident that there had, in fact, been an old romance, probably followed by that exciting incident, a “misunderstanding;” but at last all was well, and the bells of St. Mark’s were about to ring in happier days for Charlotte. “Ah, when she has her first baby,” the Ralston mothers chorused.",

Jero Luh has a shorter mane than does Rarung, and it is a mixture of hairs of different colors, some rather light. She has a purple mask, with prominent eyes and large fangs. Unlike Rangda and Rarung, her red and purple tongue protrudes only a short distance. Jero Luh wears the same golden leather apron as does Rarung, but she wears a white cloth wrapped around her legs and her shirt has red-and-white banded sleeves, with circles of hair attached. The demeanor of Jero Luh is quite different from that of Rangda and Rarung. She often acts as a kind of teaser, frightening the children, pushing the crowd back, hitting Barong from behind with her white cloth, and generally seeming to have a good time. Unlike Rangda and Rarung, Jero Luh never speaks.",

This obscure tradition led us down overgrown tracks to a hillock dense with bamboo. Gul lingered below, playing with her small son, while I climbed a maze of footpaths to the summit.\nThe mound heaved among willows dripping dust. I clambered unthinking through the noon heat, the air sultry and windless. Suddenly I came on a heap of skeletons. Their skulls gleamed among scattered shin-bones and rib-cages. Bamboo was growing through their eye-sockets. Soon I was labouring up over a blackened litter of legs and arms and pates. My feet sent up spurts of anonymous dust. The entire slope, I realised, was man-made: I was ascending a hill of compacted corpses. At its summit a tower of baked brick had worn smooth and hollow. The hard grasses pierced its floor.\nDescending, I saw a man in the fields. What was this place? I called. How old? He did not know. He came towards me. In rustic Mandarin he recounted a garbled myth of Buddhists butchering Muslims at Friday prayer. So the place opened in my journey like a dark space, awaiting explanation, which never came.\nI blundered down, covered in dust, sick. Women were walking with hoes through the wheatfields, singing, and Gul was sitting under a willow nearby, while her son sprinkled her with a rain of dandelions.",

She insisted we walk back to the hotel, by way of Garden City, the neighborhood we passed – but couldn’t reach – earlier that day. She had our return trip planned with maps and timetables and promises of hearty meals to be enjoyed afterward, but she surrendered the idea when she yawned – uncontrollably – halfway through her proposal. I laughed and suggested we hail a taxi, but the street outside Coptic Cairo was still closed to traffic.",

A dairy herd is impractical when tons of hay must come from beyond the desert. Even the fence was being neglected; twice I came upon stretches where child-sized holes had been cut in dense rolls of razor-wire. As I climbed the rocky ridge there was no one in sight – until suddenly a man appeared some fifty yards away, pointing a rifle at me. Seconds later I identified him as an effigy of a Palmach fighter, wearing 1940s combat gear and defending a trench.",

Someone was walking in the big corridor downstairs: they heard the echoing ring of his footsteps on the slick marble flags, and the noisy rattle of a cleaner’s bucket on the floor. The whole building was charged with a weary electric quality – with the quality of a light which has gone dim. And the taste and the smell of this weariness were in Eugene’s mouth and nostrils; it was as if he had stuck his tongue against a warm but burned-out storage battery; it was like the smell that comes from the wheels of a street car when they have ground around a curve, or like the odour from a smoking hot-box on the fast express. His body also had this feeling of electric weariness, as if the vital currents were exhausted: his flesh felt dry and juiceless, his back was tired, his loins were sterile, the acid burned-out flavour filled him.",

Comparisons have also been drawn between McCandless and Carl McCunn, an affable absentminded Texan who moved to Fairbanks during the 1970s oil boom and found lucrative employment on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline construction project. In early March 1981, as Waterman was making his final journey into the Alaska Range, McCunn hired a bush pilot to drop him at a remote lake near the Coleen River, about seventy-five miles northeast of Fort Yukon on the southern margin of the Brooks Range.",

His main interest is to visit major sites in order to be photographed there, or to attend special cultural events, often especially created for the tourist industry. It is difficult, if not impossible, for him to immerse himself in the foreign culture or delve into the actual realities of the country beyond the display window that has been set up by the travel industry. Above all, the tourist returns home the same person he left.",

Why talk and eat and make up other combinations with other people? From this moment I am solitary. No one will know me now. I have three letters, “I am about to play quoits with a colonel, so no more”, thus he ends our friendship, shouldering his way through the crowd with a wave of his hand. This farce is worth no more formal celebration. Yet if someone had but said: “Wait”; had pulled the strap three holes tighter—he would have done justice for fifty years, and sat in Court and ridden alone at the head of troops and denounced some monstrous tyranny, and come back to us.",

    "target_paragraph": "After all, Miss Barrett had but glanced at the faces of those men and she remembered them all her life. Flush had been at their mercy in their midst for five whole days. Now as he lay on cushions once more, cold water was the only thing that seemed to have any substance, any reality. He drank continually. The old gods of the bedroom – the bookcase, the wardrobe, the busts – seemed to have lost their substance. This room was no longer the whole world; it was only a shelter. It was only a dell arched over by one trembling dock-leaf in a forest where wild beasts prowled and venomous snakes coiled; where behind every tree lurked a murderer ready to pounce. As he lay dazed and exhausted on the sofa at Miss Barrett’s feet the howls of tethered dogs, the screams of birds in terror still sounded in his ears. When the door opened he started, expecting a hairy man with a knife – it was only Mr Kenyon with a book; it was only Mr Browning with his yellow gloves. But he shrank away from Mr Kenyon and Mr Browning now. He trusted them no longer. Behind those smiling, friendly faces was treachery and cruelty and deceit. Their caresses were hollow. He dreaded even walking with Wilson to the pillar-box. He would not stir without his chain. When they said, ‘Poor Flush, did the naughty men take you away?’ he put up his head and moaned and yelled. A whip cracking sent him bolting down the area-steps into safety. Indoors he crept closer to Miss Barrett on the sofa. She alone had not deserted him. He still kept some faith in her. Gradually some substance returned to her. Exhausted, trembling, dirty and very thin, he lay on the sofa at her feet.",

The Eye is a massive crater believed to have been formed when a large meteorite struck the earth.

Then, if one applies one’s ear to the door, one hears a muted sound like a nest of wasps. Then everything falls silent again. Towards midday, a second blow is given and the same sound heard, but a little louder. In the afternoon, they strike the bolt again, with the same result. The commander only retires at sunset. The point of these blows is to tell those on the other side of the door that the guards are at their posts and to let them know that Gog and Magog have made no attempt against the door.",

This fascination was fostered in part by the Sublime, and in part by the fondness for the Rococo style which characterized art and architecture of the later 1700s. The Rococo aesthetic cherished immateriality, evanescence and fragility, qualities supplied in abundance by the filmy effects of light or cloud, by the fleeting blue and green tints of ice, by mist, clouds, snow, spume, spindrift, and by all the other phantasmagoria on display in the high mountains. Painters squared up to the challenge of how to paint sunsets, cloud formations, fog and the other miasmic aerial effects of mountains. Writers lavished long descriptions on how clouds formed around the summit of peaks like white Elizabethan ruffs, or on top of them like floury wigs. Goethe, during his winter trip to the Savoy Alps, wrote a detailed analysis of the behaviour of freezing fog, and also tried to puzzle out how altitude affected the blueness of the sky. A few years later Shelley lounged on sun-warmed boulders on the lower slopes of the Alps and let his imagination model the passing clouds into animals and scenes from the Bible. There was an exciting sense of volatility to the upper world, which contrasted so pleasingly with the solidity of its rocky substructure.",

Their clothes, like ours, were stained with sweat and wrinkled from too many hours in coach. The line of bodies rushed the exit door where, by twos and threes, they slipped into the darkness. A steward hovered over our row and asked if we needed help with our luggage. In other words, it was time to go.
