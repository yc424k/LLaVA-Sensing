They lit a scene of bustling anarchy. Thousands of Arabs were massed baying on the quay and within seconds of us touching the pier head, hordes of them had swarmed up the walkways and along the guy ropes. It took well over two hours to fight our way ashore. The girder-faced receptionist broke down in tears as a party of Palestinians took a short cut over her desk, scattering her papers, and an epileptic had a fit on the lower deck amid a carpet of pistachio shells. One old woman fainted. As we tried to edge our way towards the gangplank, a Lebanese merchant began quizzing us on our journey:",

I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a house—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one cares.",

This perhaps was the Peace of Islam. My pool of sunlight had already turned to shade when I looked up to find a beautiful, dark-haired girl walking towards me. From a distance I thought she must be Italian, but when she introduced herself it turned out that she was Turkish. Her name was Kevser, and she had just come back from Germany where her father had been a guest worker. She had lived there for eleven years, but when her father died her mother had had to return. She did not know whether she would be able to go back. She had taken exams and if she passed she might be able to get a place at a German university; like me she was in the limbo state of awaiting results. When I asked which of the two countries she preferred her reply surprised me.",

God is guarded, reserved and looks serious, fastidious, cool and disinterested. Yet he can act. When we turn on the camera he plays down his fame and turns up his humility. When Jonathan asks the secret of his success he says, “You’d better ask the person upstairs that. Things have just happened to me. I didn’t try too hard, things just flowed. I find it very embarrassing to be seen as a god, sometimes shocking. In India people have a more emotional attachment to their heroes, a unique way of showing affection.”",

As we were walking away with our purchase, for which I had gladly paid 2,400 soles – the correct price, according to a sticky label – Señora came rushing after us waving 400 soles. We’d been accidentally overcharged: that sticky label belonged to another pair of slacks … This sort of honesty partly explains the blessed absence of haggling in these markets. Most items have a fixed price and if you don’t like it you can push off. This suits me as I’m not a bargainer by nature; to have to haggle, as is the custom in some countries, embarrasses me quite ridiculously.",

If, however, they noticed that traffic was backing up ahead of them, they would simply swerve across to the other side of the carriageway and navigate the circle in a clockwise course, against the flow of approaching traffic. It looked chaotic, but everyone seemed to understand that the first rule of Syrian driving was there were no rules, and the traffic generally kept moving!",

In the frame of our window, blocking out the stars, the silhouettes of two men were beckoning him away. He lit a nurse’s lamp on the floor, then dithered towards my bed. His ancient head seemed to surmount the body of a stunted youth, its muscles barely slackened around his stomach. His hand extended towards me, rubbing its remaining fingers against his thumb. ‘Money?…money?…’ I closed my eyes. Then he let out a soft ‘Ya-aach!’ and tugged on his pullover, a pair of split trousers, his hat. The faces outside were still pressed against the glass.\nThe next moment a nurse rushed in and seized him by the arm. ‘You’ve had enough drink!’ she screamed. ‘You’ve had enough!’ He wrenched himself free, but she seized him again and he collapsed on to his bed and started to sing in a plaintive alto, like a woman. The faces vanished from the window. For a long time I lay trying to sleep, listening to the whimpering of the awakened child, while Stepan’s singing faded away.\nIn the dawn I went out to escape him, past the shuttered houses and growling kennels, to the river. A steamer was expected at noon, and I was hoping to leave. Half the day I waited among the thistles and grass on a high foreland, straining my eyes for the shadow of a ship. But the grey flood of the Yenisei suddenly looked hostile, flowing between dead banks, and nothing came. There had been storms upriver, somebody said.",

A man was ploughing in a cup of land so far below that he was the size of a grain of oats; the brown-turned earth grew in size, the olive-coloured unturned earth diminished until there was only a thin lozenge in the middle of the field. The crows were flat below, wheeling in mid-air at the height of a cathedral spire. The man sang as he ploughed, his voice as loud as a gramophone in the next room, but I could only catch one word—‘angels’. When the lozenge disappeared, I could see him lead his horse to the hedge and a thin fume of smoke came up but dispersed long before it reached me. He was burning weeds.",

The parcel lay on his knees and he now opened it after the ancient laborious ritual, picking patiently at the pink knot until a younger person would have screamed at him. Old Bayard merely lit a cigar and propped his feet against the fireplace, and in good time old man Falls solved the knot and removed the string and laid it across his chair-arm. It fell to the floor and he bent and fumbled it into his blunt fingers and laid it again across the chair-arm and watched it a moment lest it fall again, then he opened the parcel. First was his carton of tobacco, and he removed a plug and sniffed it, turned it about in his hand and sniffed it again. But without biting into it he laid it and its fellows aside and delved further yet. He spread open the throat of the resulting paper bag, and his innocent boy’s eyes gloated soberly into it.",

Now came the great question: even if we managed to smuggle ourselves into the town, would we be able to stay there? We had no money left. How, then, were we going to live? And our appearance! We looked more like brigands from the Changthang than Europeans. Over our stained woollen trousers and torn shirts we wore greasy sheepskin cloaks, which showed, even at a distance, how we had knocked about in them. Aufschnaiter wore the remains of a pair of Indian Army boots on his feet, and my shoes were in fragments. Both of us were more barefoot than shod. No, our appearance was certainly not in our favour. Our beards were perhaps our most striking feature. Like all Mongols, the Tibetans have almost no hair on their faces or bodies; whereas we had long, tangled, luxuriant beards. For this reason we were often taken for Kazaks, a Central Asian tribe whose members migrated in swarms during the war from Soviet Russia to Tibet. They marched in with their families and flocks and plundered right and left, and the Tibetan army was at pains to drive them on into India. The Kazaks are often fair-skinned and blue-eyed and their beards grow normally. It is not surprising that we were mistaken for them, and met with a cold reception from so many nomads.",

The look on their cold faces and in their fox-eyes said to him that there was no hope, no work, no joy, no triumph, and no love for such as he, that there could be nothing but defeat, despair and failure for the living of this world, that life had been devoured and killed by such as these, and had become rats’ alley, death-in-life for ever.",

She’d seen just a small portion of what went on that day on the Malecón, but there was no doubt in her mind that it hadn’t been caused by delinquents. It was a spontaneous public demonstration against Castro’s government—the first she’d ever seen. The first anyone in Cuba had seen. The crowds were protesting the hundreds of days without electricity, overheated apartments, bad food, dirty clothes, mind-numbing television—when there was electricity. What had once been inconceivable—that the Cuban people would turn on Fidel, denounce the revolution, and pour into the streets like an angry, desperate mob, breaking windows, stealing from the stores, and agitating for the end of the government—had happened right across the water from her own Guanabacoa. There was only one national news program in Cuba, and what was being reported about that day simply wasn’t true. And if this report was a lie, she had to consider, what about all the things that she’d heard on TV or read about in Granma but hadn’t seen for herself? What about the hijacked ferries? What about Spike and the tugboat?",

A baffling air of sleepy normality hung over everything. Birds sang in the hedges, and the first lizards scrambled among the thickets, teased by these sunny premonitions of the summer to come. Panos sighed and settled himself more comfortably after this interlude with its crowded human panorama and liveliness, so foreign to the slow dragging tempo of this spring day. The road looped and coiled twice like a snake and then suddenly untied itself to run, straight as a die, between the carob-groves; and here, marked by a single tall cypress tree, was the turning which led off towards the sea, and the desolate headland where the great house (‘Fortuna’ it had been christened) was to stand. We chose to leave the car somewhere near the main road and walk down the soft dust pathway between the trees which would lead us, after many a curve and twist, to the headland where the charming little toy church of Saint George stood, glittering white against the backcloth of blue sea. Early lizards scuttered among the stones and the rank grass beside the road was full of the busy clicking and scratching of anonymous insects, stretching down in a whispering wall of green to where the sound of the sea took over – racing blue and fair today, bursting among the grottoes and caves with dull explosions and filling the beaches with the passionate scrabbling of pebbles sucked back in the dark undertow. On the outward breastwork of the magnificent little bay stood the old Mosque where I had spent so many precious hours; Marie’s house was to be built in such a way as to let the windows on the seaward side frame a view of it.",

During the ‘non-attributable war’ all these caves were occupied by local peasants who had to cultivate under cover of darkness; they described this as ‘living like an owl during the day and a fox during the night’. Every year airpower – T-28 fighters from Long Tieng, F-4s and 105s from Udorn, B-52 bombers from Uttaphao–destroyed much of that hard-won rice harvest. And these unfortified caves provided limited protection; the Americans soon perfected the art of killing cave dwellers with phosphorus rockets and napalm. The casualties went uncounted. This was what Timothy Castle would then have thought of as ‘successful flying’.",

In the case of a Tibetan mandala, there is a universe of esoteric symbolism: colors, directions, the names of Buddhas and their attributes. But even the most simple painting of trees or grasses might also conceal secrets. One night, David opened a pair of six-paneled gold screens in the living room. They made up a willow-bridge painting, a conventional theme in which weeping willows stand beside a curving wooden bridge. These screens, however, were particularly old, and seemed to have an expressive power lacking in later versions. We began to discuss what made them so different. As we talked, we noticed that the willow branches to the left hung straight, while those on the right swayed, as if a breeze were blowing though them. To the left was the moon; on the right, no moon. We realized that the screens were depicting the transition from night to day, the breeze being the first breath of dawn. Then someone pointed out that the branches on the trees to the left were bare; the branches on the right were sprouting young leaves. So the screen was also depicting the moment when winter passes into spring. In the river under the bridge, waterwheels were turning, and the bridge itself, which in Japan symbolizes the arrival of messengers from the other world, was a great arc curving towards the viewer. Everything in these screens was turning and transforming from old to new and from dark to light. ‘And so,’ concluded David, ‘these screens are a painting of the moment before glory.’",

Conspicuous, that is. Very. Her black, as Manby described the soberest of her suits, didn't seem sober at all set beside the clothes of the poor. Inevitably, seeing the House it came from, there was an air about it, and an air, too, about her small black hat, pulled at the precise right angle over one eye. This hat, a most rakish and provocative affair in the eyes of the humble women on the platform, was perfectly plain except for a single scarlet quill sticking out, gaily and brightly, in the gloom, and her eyes, though the reverse of gay, were bright, too, from her recent scrap with Sir Stilton, and her cheeks were still flushed with fury. So that altogether she was a conspicuous figure; and a knot of harassed women, drooping beneath bundles and babies, watched her, half envious and half shocked.",

Studies of beechwoods show that big old beeches are already beginning to lose their vigour long before their usual time, and trees of fifty years’ growth are showing decline more usually associated with trees three times that age. Unlike the elm, however, the beech will not vanish; it will migrate. Beechwoods will follow the isotherms, searching for the cooler land, as the snow hares did after the Pleistocene. The beeches will find fresh habitats and ranges in the newly warmed north. Not the death of a species, then, but its displacement. The loss would still be great, though, and it could happen in my lifetime: the beechwood might die before my eyes.",
