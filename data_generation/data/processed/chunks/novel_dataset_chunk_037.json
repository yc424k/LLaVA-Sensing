The rails swept northwards towards the dark, and in the moon the rails were like two living strands of burning silver, and between the rails the heavy ballast rock was white as lunar marble, and the brown wooden ties were resinous and dry and very still.",

During those two decades with Aramco, the internet was launched, the world became more interconnected, and the United States invaded then departed Iraq. Our story seemed to parallel that of a shrinking globe: massive diversity and greater opportunities for intercultural understanding and faith surrounded us. Walking down those steps with John, I trusted that the giant leap we had just made was going to be an expansive experience full of opportunity and possibility. I couldn’t have known to what extent relocating would shift my perspective on just about everything. There was no sign that said, “Welcome to the Middle East. Prepare yourself for a life-changing experience.”",

Her son Kolya had been among the people who had stood with Yeltsin when he defied the generals’ putsch in August, just a year before. She said Kolya’s photo had been in the news—he was standing on a barricade in his white shirt like a hero of the War of 1812, she said. Katya translated fragments of the story for me. Neither she nor I had slept for at least a day, so after a while Chuda showed me a bed in her son’s room where I could take a nap. I lay down but didn’t sleep, or read, or even think. I stared at the ceiling, where a paper airplane hung from the chandelier. This paper airplane had sharp angles, and fins, and a strange projectile sleekness, like the elegant arrowhead-shaped MiG fighter jet. No one in America would have made such a paper airplane. It swayed in the breeze from the tall, narrow windows.",

But the night moved still faster; the mass of them had already faded completely into it before they had crossed the parade ground, so that it was the sound, the howling, which seemed to roll on and crash and recoil and roar again against the wall beneath the lighted window and the motionless silhouette of the man standing in it, and recoiled and roared again while a hurried bugle began to blat and whistles to shrill and a close body of white infantry came rapidly around the corner and began to push them away from the wall with short jabbing blows of rifle butts.",

Of course, most of my guests are wholly unaware of this – they probably just think I have a bad problem with flies! On the opposite wall is a pair of scrolls, a conversation in the form of calligraphy. The first, by a Kyoto potter of the 1930s, reads, ‘With the hossu, I brush away all worldly desires’. Next to it is the reply by the Zen abbot Nantenbo: ‘I brushed away everything, but the dust won’t move!’ From scrolls such as these and implements like the whisks I surmised the existence of the Japanese literati; but there are no illustrated books about them, no museums devoted to their art, and no hereditary schools dedicated to passing on their wisdom. It was only because of an experience at Oxford that I knew what to look for.",

The night had grown cold and still, a thick layer of clouds reflecting the grayish lights of the city. The trees and bushes we passed were still leafless, but looking closely, I could see the tips of twigs swollen with clustering buds; in this calmest hour of the night, a subtle odor of vegetation—more a phantom than an actual smell—floated lightly in the air. We were silent and elated, walking down the center of the deserted street with a buoyancy to our stride as if we were half flying, infrequently passing other night-walkers who were also returning from Easter services. We crossed Herzen Street and entered a neighborhood of beautiful old mansions, many of them embassies, the gray-uniformed Soviet guards looking out curiously at us from their tiny sentry boxes. We had turned down a side street when we heard shouts, and saw, on the corner across from us, a man and woman circling and aiming blows at each other, while two or three men stood looking on. From their features and language, they all seemed to be Tartars. The woman’s long dark hair was spilling over her shoulders, and her slanted eyes and high cheekbones were clearly visible in the streetlight. She cried out again and again at the man, and in her voice there was something violent yet wailing and mournful that seemed to echo up and down the street. A child of about two stood crying unheeded a few yards away. The sight of this evil little drama gave me a chill; a militsiya car turned the corner and we hurriedly cut through a muddy alleyway. We emerged facing a tree-filled park immortalized in Bulgakov’s Master and Margarita as being the site of the Devil’s first appearance in Moscow; here, after encountering Lucifer in the shape of a dapper foreigner, a pompous journalist slips in a pool of sunflower-seed oil and is decapitated by a passing tram.",

It wasn’t that serious a wreck, though, considering what it might have been. My bicycle was fine, although the basket was bent and my helmet was cracked.

The worst of the damage was a deep cut on my knee, full of bits of pebbles and dirt, that proceeded—over the next few days in the moist tropical air—to become nastily infected.",

In a minor example, when new neighbours moved in next door I was astonished to see them take a chainsaw to anything resembling greenery. In less than an hour, a pretty garden of wild flowers, tall trees and bushes had been reduced to a drab concrete patio adorned only with two chairs and a table, surrounded by tree stumps and trampled flowers. ‘Beautiful, eh?’ the neighbour called to me over the fence, thrilled with his ability to get unruly nature under control.",

The map showed no village ahead and neither the terrain nor the weather favoured camping. I realised then how different was Kenya from tourist-free Cameroon where I had trekked in 1987. There, at sunset, one can be sure of a warm if puzzled welcome in any remote compound. Here, only some extreme emergency could adequately explain a mzungu’s seeking hospitality in the bush. Because tourists are amply catered for by Kenya’s smart hotels, the notion of any White curling up happily in the corner of a hut would shock and upset; I knew that intuitively. On my return to Kenya four months later, for a longer period, I realised that this potential for embarrassment between the races is not entirely based on the existence of an organised tourist industry. A half-century of White settlement created a racial chasm unknown in Cameroon.",

She’s a nurse now, and lives south of Glacier with two lively girls and her husband, Rob, a timber framer. Their annual Christmas letters boast photos of Reba hiking in the park with her daughters, past rock walls we built. Annie writes me a postcard once in a while. She’s been back to school again, had what our mothers call a “real job” in the Midwest, but kept her house in Montana. Abby and Sherri moved on to other parks, and we haven’t been in touch. But when I sharpen a hand tool or drop my knee into a telemark turn, when I teach a newbie to place rocks in a wall that will outlast us both, I think of those women in their flannel shirts and tank tops and work pants, marching around in the sun, packs over their shoulders, modeling for me a possibility. I didn’t know then about their worries and insecurities, didn’t guess about the eating disorder, fights with a new husband, the joints wearing out, wanting to fall in love for real. Later, I’d see their faults—short-tempered, quick to blame—and also the fullness that comes from vulnerability. But first, I saw toughness, that assurance and vigor. I couldn’t take my eyes off it.",

I am not quite sure what to expect, but I know I do not want to go on a walk up that monstrous pile of slate rubble behind it, another suggested outing. In I go. No matter what I expected, it is here. Eclecticism to a degree never before encountered, from velour paintings, to animal bones, antiques, and actual pieces of art.

Then he mounted the stairs and opened his door and entered the cold room where between the secret walls she lingered yet in a hundred palpable ways—in the mirror above his chest of drawers, in the bed, the chairs; on the deep rug before the hearth where she had crouched naked and drowsing like a cat. The fire had burned out; the ashes were cold and the room was icy chill: outside, the graying twilight. He built up the fire and drew his chair close to the hearth and sat before it, his thin delicate hands spread to the crackling blaze.",

On one corner stood a newly installed statue of Joseph Stalin, and on the second corner a Russian Orthodox Church featuring an image of the last Tsar of Russia, his head haloed in gold. On the third corner, there were flags promoting President Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party. Close to the fourth corner, or thereabouts, stood a children’s school of art, with numerous modern grand pianos partly paid for by the diamond company that employs much of the community. Standing here felt like being at the centre of a whirlwind: how can Putin, Stalin, the last Tsar and big business all coexist like this, as if the past and future are in harmony? The confluence seemed to me bewildering, made all the more haunting by the music playing out of the loudspeakers in every street.",

When they did not hurt he did not hurt either.\n“Your pitted compatriot eats in bed at his hotel, my colleague tells me,” he confided to the Colonel. “We may have a few Belgians. ‘The bravest of these were the Belgians,’ ” he quoted. “There is a pair of pescecani from you know where. But they are exhausted and I believe they will eat, as pigs, in their room.”\n“An excellent situation report,” the Colonel said. “Our problem, Gran Maestro, is that I have already eaten in my room as pitted does and as the pescecani will. But this lady—”\n“Young girl,” interrupted the Gran Maestro with his whole-face smile. He was feeling very good since it was a completely new day.\n“This very young lady wants a breakfast to end breakfasts.”\n“I understand,” the Gran Maestro said and he looked at Renata and his heart rolled over as a porpoise does in the sea. It is a beautiful movement and only a few people in this world can feel it and accomplish it.\n“What do you want to eat, Daughter?” the Colonel asked, looking at her early morning, unretouched dark beauty.\n“Everything.”\n“Would you give any suggestions?”\n“Tea instead of coffee and whatever the Gran Maestro can salvage.”\n“It won’t be salvage, Daughter,” said the Gran Maestro.\n“I’m the one who calls her Daughter.”\n“I said it honestly,” the Gran Maestro said. “We can make or fabricar rognons grilled with champignons dug by people I know. Or, raised in damp cellars. There can be an omelet with truffles dug by pigs of distinction. There can be real Canadian bacon from maybe Canada, even.”\n“Wherever that is,” the girl said happily and unillusioned.\n“Wherever that is,” said the Colonel seriously. “And I know damn well where it is.”\n“I think we should stop the jokes now and get to the breakfast.”\n“If it is not unmaidenly I think so too. Mine is a decanted flask of the Valpolicella.”\n“Nothing else?”\n“Bring me one ration of the alleged Canadian bacon,” the Colonel said.\nHe looked at the girl, since they were alone now, and he said, “How are you my dearest?”\n“Quite hungry, I suppose. But thank you for being good for so long a time.”\n“It was easy,” the Colonel told her in Italian.",

Here in Devon’s bleak little hotel bar I haven’t been allowed to pay for my Castles and concerned locals have made me promise to send the hotel a postcard confirming my safe arrival in Cape Town. But the Afrikaners’ thinking (wrong word: their mindset) is depressingly uniform. Groups of blacks often disagree in conversation, groups of Afrikaners only rarely. One senses Afrikanerdom’s mould holding them together, reducing them to an essential passivity in relation to South Africa’s future, even when their response to changing circumstances involves aggressive language. For the blacks, changing circumstances hold a promise and a challenge. For the sort of whites I am meeting in these little dorps, changing circumstances represent defeat – not stimulating argument but encouraging laagerism.",

He apologized for not asking me to stay, he himself had to spend the night with friends nearby – that is, an hour’s drive away. This was a momentous night. His land must be irrigated when the flood came down at about 4 a.m. – or maybe 3 a.m. – a ‘boy’ would be on guard all night watching the river. However, Retha and Tertius could give me a bed, not only for the night but for a week – or a month, should I wish to make an in-depth study of the Klein Karoo. As the nearest dorplet (offering no entertainment) is twenty-five miles away, and there are on average twenty miles between farms, this boundless hospitality is understandable.",

Trucks growled down Vía Blanca, roosters kept crowing long after sunrise, and scrawny street dogs seemed to fall in love with the sound of their own barking. But on the morning after Irma, the old town was unsettlingly quiet, noiseless in the same way that the air clears seconds after a crash. Exhausted from her night of terror, and with the clocks in her house still dead, Cary wasn’t sure what time it was when she finally ventured outside to check on the damage Irma had done to her street. In the gray light of after-storm, she saw that several trees had been destroyed, including the lemon tree next door that she liked so much. She walked to her gate, and from there it galled her to see that garbage from the wretched corner dump had scattered everywhere, with scraps of paper and plastic embedded in her own chain-link fence. Palm trees nearby still stood tall, but the fierce winds had stripped them nearly bald. The metal roof of the warehouse across the street was peeled back like a can of tuna.",

He was leaning rather heavily.\nHe saw what she saw: the immense coffin set up on trestles at the foot of the bed; the sheeted body packed tight in the padded white lining, the hands, curling a little, smooth and stiff, the hands of a wax figure; the firm, sallowish white face; the brown stains, like iodine, about the nostrils; the pale under lip pushed out, proudly.\nA cold, thick smell, like earth damped with stagnant water, came up to them, mixed with the sharp, piercing smell of the coffin. The vigilant, upright coffin-lid leaned with its sloping shoulders against the chimney-piece, ready.\nIn spite of his heavy hand she was aware that Uncle Victor's consciousness of these things was different from hers. He did not appear to be in the least sorry for Papa. On his face, wistful, absorbed, there was a faint, incongruous smile. He might have been watching a child playing some mysterious game.\nHe sighed. His eyes turned from the coffin to the coffin-lid. He stared at the black letters on the shining brass plate.\nEmilius Olivier.\nBorn November 13th, 1827.\nDied January 2nd, 1881.",

    "target_paragraph": "But the Borrovian example – as reported in his tendrilled prose – proved wildly influential. The breeze on the face, the stars for a ceiling, the fire by the wayside, hedgerow philosophizing, open journeyings: Borrow set such images loose in the nineteenth-century imagination. Most of his emulators gained blisters rather than enlightenment as a result, but the cult of leisured vagabondage grew. By the end of the 1800s, walking clubs were being founded in number and a profuse literature of old-wayfaring had emerged. Pocket-sized books with titles like The Open Road or On Foot, bound in green buckram or red suede, became best-sellers. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote his dark and mystical Songs of Travel (1896) – which take their tempo from the rolling tread of the long-distance walker. The ornithologist W. H. Hudson pioneered a pastoral psychogeography, tramping for months along England’s footpaths, waiting for what he called the ‘charm of the unknown’ to set his rods quivering (his journeys shaped in part by Borrow but also by earlier English mystics like Thomas Traherne, Henry Vaughan and Thomas Browne). At the turn of the century Hilaire Belloc strode from France to Italy, and wrote his bombastic pilgrim’s tale The Path to Rome (1902). John Muir walked a thousand miles from Indianapolis to the Florida Keys in 1867, veering as he went between extremes of hunger and of ecstasy; seventeen years later a young man called Charles Lummis tramped across America from Ohio to California and claimed that he had made ‘the longest walk for pure pleasure that is on record’. The Sierra Club was founded in 1892, inspired by Muir’s convictions that the walker’s bodily contact with the wild world benefited both walker and world, and that ‘going out…was really going in’.",
