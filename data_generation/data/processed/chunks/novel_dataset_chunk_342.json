Throughout the day, he let Monitor steer Lone Eagle, adjusting her heading only at each bend in the channel with little tugs on the control lines. Lone Eagle stayed right on course – he could even go below for a few seconds to pop in a new CD or grab a sandwich out of the fridge. Relief, he thought. I can do this – I can sail Lone Eagle solo! The relief that washed over him was palpable. He walked up on deck while Monitor steered Lone Eagle down the ICW, and danced to Christopher Cross’ Sailing as Lone Eagle powered ahead and Monitor kept her right on course.",

Ketiwe had helped me buy a long, flowing djellaba gown that I would wear out there. In Wuse Market we had consulted with some stall owners, five old Muslim men, about whether I needed to wear one. They said I didn’t have to wear a djellaba, but if I respected myself and I wanted respect from others, then I should wear one.\nThe north was a very different place, foreign enough to make me feel like a true tourist. Without family connections here, I planned on exploring the region as if I were on one of my guidebook-writing trips. As a pure tourist I could replace my increasing emotional baggage with a (metaphorical) knapsack and travel lightly. That was the plan, at least.\nSaying goodbye to Abuja would be a wrench, however. I’d gotten rather comfortable here. Leaving my brother’s home felt like an ejection from the warmth of a duvet into the cold of the bedroom air, and I slightly dreaded having to reorient myself in a new city once again.",

The preceding decade had been productive, and his work was well regarded. But he was dissatisfied with some of his output, convinced that the light he had worked under in Chile and Mexico had held him back. He soon discovered, as had Román Calvo after a long sea voyage, that the country he came home to was far different from the one he had left thirteen years earlier. The Castros were still running things, but this Cuba was filled with material shortages, bureaucratic obstacles, and a disheartening decline in civility that would challenge Arturo day in and day out. Raúl Castro had introduced economic changes that would have been unthinkable in the Cuba ruled by his brother, but only by comparison to the worst days of the special period did living in Cuba seem bearable.",

When the rain came we crowded into the hoteli to continue our discussions of multi-party democracy, marriage and AIDS. Everyone was outspokenly anti-Banda and fearful of his heir presumptive, an unsavoury and by now extremely powerful character called John Tembo. All but one were devoted to the notion of multi-party democracy without even slightly comprehending it. For many young Africans it has become a fetish; given that reform, all problems can be solved overnight. No one thought women should be given the vote – ‘In our country they are not educated and can’t understand politics.’ It shocked them to learn that in the West young people choose their own marriage partners and brides come free. ‘That is very bad!’ exclaimed Patrick. ‘Then the husband does not own his wife – she may run away!’",

Near the municipal offices Jacob suggested a picture of the ‘famous’ Irish writer looking at the Mayor’s collection of genuinely famous rocket cases – thousands of them, forming a grim cliff.

Nearly a year had passed since her previous visit to Mrs. Hochmüller, and a chilly April breeze smote her face as she stepped on the boat. Most of the passengers were huddled together in the cabin, and Ann Eliza shrank into its obscurest corner, shivering under the thin black mantle which had seemed so hot in July. She began to feel a little bewildered as she stepped ashore, but a paternal policeman put her into the right car, and as in a dream she found herself retracing the way to Mrs. Hochmüller’s door. She had told the conductor the name of the street at which she wished to get out, and presently she stood in the biting wind at the corner near the beer saloon, where the sun had once beat down on her so fiercely. At length an empty car appeared, its yellow flank emblazoned with the name of Mrs. Hochmüller’s suburb, and Ann Eliza was presently jolting past the narrow brick houses islanded between vacant lots like giant piles in a desolate lagoon. When the car reached the end of its journey she got out and stood for some time trying to remember which turn Mr. Ramy had taken. She had just made up her mind to ask the car-driver when he shook the reins on the backs of his lean horses, and the car, still empty, jogged away toward Hoboken.",

She, meanwhile, was in the process of tearing up the life she’d made and burning down her house: preparing to leave her husband, take off on her own with her kids and commit herself to everything that was unknown to her, stepping a little away from the collective script that is Japan’s unchanging musical score.",

But when she walks, the full-petticoated peasant woman, then the red goes flash-flash-flash, like a bird showing its colours. Pretty that looks in the sombre street. She has a plain, light bodice with a peak: sometimes a little vest, and great full white sleeves, and usually a handkerchief or shawl loose knotted. It is charming the way they walk, with quick, short steps. When all is said and done, the most attractive costume for women in my eye, is the tight little bodice and the many-pleated skirt, full and vibrating with movement. It has a charm which modern elegance lacks completely—a bird-like play in movement.",

Many local Moroccans were kind and friendly, but I couldn’t help noticing that the tearaway kids who repeatedly tried to steal my bike, the young men who deliberately bumped shoulders when they walked past, the teenagers who shouted through my open apartment window, were always of Moroccan descent. The playgrounds around my house were permanently populated by hangjongeren – young, predominantly Moroccan ‘hang-around-boys’, who spent much of the day and night perched on the vertical backrests of benches, spitting on the floor and reacting aggressively towards anyone who asked them to keep the noise down. The contrast with ever-polite Dutch teenagers was stark. It didn’t help that parents sometimes made little effort to discipline their children – on one occasion, I saw a Moroccan boy of about twelve try to pull a passing blonde woman’s hair for no reason. When she shouted at him the boy’s father, who was standing nearby, told her angrily to leave his son alone. On another occasion, a Moroccan man nearly ran me over in his car as I cycled to the train station one morning. When I rang my bell at him he drove after me all the way across town, and then followed me through the station repeatedly challenging me to a fight. Making generalisations about ethnic groups was a dangerous habit to get into, but in the area where I lived, the young Moroccan men were considerably more confrontational and less friendly towards me than the Dutch were.",

Included in the various methods of cooking and preservation is the pig boil.

So in the morning I get up early and return alone for the darshan where the swami actually moves among his disciples. At six, the queue is already long. The devotees are immaculately groomed and dressed in their very best chiffon saris and white kurtas. All want to attract God’s attention and earn an interview after the darshan, but thousands will be disappointed. Again the lineup, the queue lottery (apparently controlled by him) and the hushed hurry to flank the red carpet he will walk upon. I get close; I must have good karma. Then God performs another miracle. Sai Baba is the first Indian I’ve ever seen arrive early. He shuffles along the carpet as the crowd ripples and does a wave of namaste moves, touching their hands together in the prayer position.",

One, getting tens of thousands of pounds moving from zero to 55 mph takes time and space. I stepped on the accelerator, and the truck slowly gathered momentum. Two, a concrete retaining wall stood a few dozen yards ahead. I had to accelerate while driving straight toward it. Three, traffic on the highway drove at, well, highway speeds. And everyone who wanted to take I-40 eastward had to get in the lane I needed.",

Glacier meant friends, people we’d known for years. Cordova meant co-workers, often testy, missing home (like us). Glacier had seven-hundred-plus miles of trail; Cordova Ranger District had about thirty. No more eight-day hitches, long miles of sawing, those body-busting ten-hour days. Cordova hitches were shorter and rare; mostly, we worked eight hours local, and returned to an overheated apartment every night, where I played Scrabble with our white-haired landlady, Rose. Delicate and proper, her lacy living room downstairs belied a steely past. She grew up on a fox-farm island in the Sound and ran her own bowpicker for years. This is what we meant: Glacier was ours. Cordova belonged to others.",
