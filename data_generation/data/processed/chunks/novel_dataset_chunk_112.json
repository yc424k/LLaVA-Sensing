Suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an open carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.",

From Phari, they have a new route to Kampa Dzong – higher, but shorter by two days than the version of 1921. It takes them over the Donka La. As they approach the pass, the air becomes violently cold, and it begins to snow. It snows all night on 8 April. Mallory is concerned for the animals, and in the darkness he walks over the soft, sticky snow from his tent to where the yaks and mules are tethered. They are standing in untidy rows with snow lying like rugs on their backs. They shift unhappily from foot to foot, and from their nostrils snort out jets of wet white breath into the dark air. The mule-men are squatting in a circle behind a shelter of rocks. They seem happy enough despite the brutal cold, and not too concerned for their animals, so Mallory goes back to his tent, and falls asleep to the quiet carillon of yak bells.",

Pizarro returned to Spain and received permission to conquer this promising new land in the name of the crown.",

I was not yet tired of the sight of naked bodies (later I began to feel as if I had lived for years with nothing but cows), or else these women were prettier and more finely-built than most of those I saw in the Republic. It was curious how quickly one abandoned the white standard. These long breasts falling in flat bronze folds soon seemed more beautiful than the small rounded immature European breasts. The children took their milk standing; they ran to the breasts in pairs like lambs, pulling at the teats. But though the region of modesty had shrunk, it was still there. The train crossed the Mano river; far down below the bridge, a hundred yards away, natives were bathing; they covered their private parts with their hands as the train went by.",

He had not even had the energy to finish his packing, and his clothes and papers lay on the floor about the portmanteau. Presently he unlocked his clasped hands and stood up; and Charity, drawing back hastily, sank down on the step of the verandah. The night was so dark that there was not much chance of his seeing her unless he opened the window and before that she would have time to slip away and be lost in the shadow of the trees. He stood for a minute or two looking around the room with the same expression of self-disgust, as if he hated himself and everything about him; then he sat down again at the table, drew a few more strokes, and threw his pencil aside. Finally he walked across the floor, kicking the portmanteau out of his way, and lay down on the bed, folding his arms under his head, and staring up morosely at the ceiling. Just so, Charity had seen him at her side on the grass or the pine-needles, his eyes fixed on the sky, and pleasure flashing over his face like the flickers of sun the branches shed on it. But now the face was so changed that she hardly knew it; and grief at his grief gathered in her throat, rose to her eyes and ran over.",

Inside, I was instantly transported back to the glamour of a vanished age—Shanghai, 1936—when the air was electric with talk of “democracy.” In every other brown-and-white snapshot, proud young men, solemn in their horn-rimmed glasses, impeccably garbed in three-piece suits and sleek overcoats, posed gravely in front of statues whose erectness was outdone by their own; and in every other stamp-sized picture, their glamorous sisters and fiancées showed off the latest fashions from Wellesley or Milan. Every shot, moreover, caught the whole golden confederacy in a moment of splendid preparation—seated in rows before large houses, looking up from long tables at lavish banquets, striking Hollywood poses at some ski resort. This gentleman, explained the old man, was now an important professor in America, this man had followed General Chiang to Taiwan, this lady was a socialite in New York. Every one of them had fled—except, so it seemed, our gentle host.",

The capital-move initiative had been on the primary ballot, and Hensley had spoken against it wherever he went. He thought that Alaska, whose budget had more than quadrupled in a few years’ time, was heading for failure and could ill afford to crown it with a billion-dollar capital city. Privately, he regarded his achievements in the legislature as “crumbs” begged for and sent back to his people. If so much money were to go for a capital, he feared for the faraway villages. There would be funds not even for crumbs. “When there is a budget crunch, the bush loses,” he said. He compared the capital-movers to a young couple whose eyes shine at the prospect of a new house but who find themselves unable to cope with the terms of the mortgage. A federal building then projected for Anchorage was going to cost at least a hundred million dollars. So how much would an entire city cost? If Alaska were to build a capital, state-federal sharing money would be applied to the airport, utilities, highways, housing—money that would otherwise go to existing communities. The capital-move prevailed, but Hensley lost. Before long, he found himself on the Capital Site Selection Committee, the lone native, the lone northwestern member.",

It was something eternal, unbroachable: I was free, in this heavy, ice-cold air, this upper world, alone. London, far away below, beyond, England, Germany, France--they were all so unreal in the night. It was a sort of grief that this continent all beneath was so unreal, false, non-existent in its activity. Out of the silence one looked down on it, and it seemed to have lost all importance, all significance. It was so big, yet it had no significance. The kingdom of the world had no significance: what could one do but wander about?",

You would have known it even if, every morning at the\nsame hour, you had not come upon Gertrude standing on a chair winding up\nthe clock that Jane invariably forgot to wind. You felt that by no\npossibility could Gertrude forget to wind up anything. She herself was\nwound up every morning. She might have been a clock. She was wound up by\nBrodrick; otherwise she was self-regulating, provided with a\ncompensation balance, and so long as Brodrick wound her, incapable of\ngoing wrong.

    "target_paragraph": "But there is none of this in the two baths. If there is any character there it would seem to be the Empress, poor thing, with her ladies; whose husband intends to outshine Augustus, while she with all her determination and advantages has never managed to be Livia or anything like it. Her intrigues are halfhearted, her influence nil, her body, her virtue and her mind wasted and misinterpreted; she has been portrayed in marble as Venus, and will be remembered as the world’s greatest sexual supernumerary. Her most intimate failure becomes a public cult. Yet one can imagine a certain social rapport between them, and he is perhaps not unkind, or not willfully; he may even have designed the little baths for her, where she can steam away some of her frustrations in a flawless sequence of caldarium, tepidarium, frigidarium, etc. without retracing her steps: that is what the building is known for after two thousand years, though what strikes one more is the grace of the proportions, and the marvelous ingenuity as well as the beauty of the vaults, looked at as a problem in building. Not that they are more marvelous than many larger ones, only they are better preserved than most, and one is more likely to think of construction on a small scale, that is in tranquillity.",

The plane I flew home in was the Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin. Naming planes after Russian writers may have been the British PR firm’s idea. If it was, it had the intended effect on me.",

I think I would have come if I had never heard of you before – I was so bewildered and rattled by this new life, and so overwhelmed by living in a big city for the first time in my life that I would have accepted any kind of invitation – jumped at the chance of meeting anyone! However, I already knew who you were when your invitation came. I had heard that a man named Starwick was Hatcher’s assistant. I figured therefore that the invitation had something to do with your connection with Professor Hatcher and the course – that you were inviting me to make me feel more at home up here, to establish a friendly relation, to give me what information you could, to help the new people out in any way you could. But when I met you, what happened?’ he went on indignantly. ‘Never a word about the course, about Professor Hatcher, about your being his assistant – you pumped me with questions as if I were a prisoner in the dock and you the prosecuting lawyer. You told me nothing about yourself and asked a thousand questions about me – and then you shook hands coldly, and departed! – Always this air of secrecy and mystery, Frank!’ the boy went on angrily. ‘That’s always the way it is with you – in everything you do! And yet you wonder why people are surprised at your behaviour! For weeks at a time I see you every day. We get together in your rooms and talk and argue about everything on earth. You come and yell for me in my place at midnight and then we walk all over Cambridge in the dead of night. We go over to Posillippo’s place in Boston and eat and drink and get drunk together, and when you pass out, I bring you home and carry you upstairs and put you to bed. Then the next day, when I come round again,’ the boy cried bitterly, ‘what has happened? I ring the bell. Your voice comes through the place as cold as hell –“Who is it?” you say. “Why,” I say, “it’s your old friend and drunken companion, Eugene Gant, who brought you home last night.”–“I’m sorry,” you say, in a tone that would freeze a polar bear –“I can’t see you. I’m busy now”– and then you hang up in my face.

She had to keep every window in the house shuttered. Cary had had just about all she could take. Greater Havana’s 2.1 million people relied on the large plastic containers, about the size of household freezers, that were placed on random corners to collect the 700,000 cubic feet of household trash, yard waste, and construction debris that was thrown out every day. In Guanabacoa, there might be just one or two containers for dozens of families living along a few city blocks, and the containers filled quickly. Three or four weeks might go by before the city came to empty them, and by then, the containers would be overflowing, the garbage knee deep and spreading into sidewalks, streets, even the many streams that once made Guanabacoa famous.",

More than 80 percent of the country consists of ice fields, tundra, lava fields, and barren mountains, and huge stretches are as blank and inhospitable as anything in the Australian Outback. Such settlements as do exist look like suburbs in search of a city—a solitary farmstead here, a lonely lighthouse there, occasionally an isolated steeple: a small huddle of concrete inside a giant’s rough paw. Nature adores a vacuum here. And the ground itself is like nothing so much as a geologist’s textbook, a pockmarked mess of volcanic craters and hissing plumes of smoke till it looks as if the earth itself is blowing off steam, and the soil in parts is so hot that, only a few inches down, you can actually boil an egg. In Iceland, in John McPhee’s happy phrase, “the earth is full of adjustments, like a settling stomach.”",
