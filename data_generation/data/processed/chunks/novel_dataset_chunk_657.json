Instead of accounts of key games or late-inning heroics, Oh devotes most of his space to chronicling his “fatheaded clumsiness” as a youth, his typical off-field errors in the entertainment districts of the Ginza, his sense of obligation to the fans. “Outside the world of baseball,” he matter-of-factly reports, “I was a fairly boring fellow.” And instead of dwelling on his greatest hits, he concentrates on the stages of his often painful quest for spiritual maturity. The stars of this morality play are Providence and Time; its protagonists a strange, half-magical group of spirits and forces and guardian angels that seem to govern Oh’s destiny much more than the man himself.",

Why none of the Thracian tribes fought Darius, with the exception of the fierce Getae, not even Herodotus explained. But common sense comes to mind: the Thracians were too fond of their leisure and their gold, and the Persian army was the largest in the known world. The Getae at the mouth of the Danube, unfortunately for them, ‘offered fierce resistance and were at once reduced to slavery’, Herodotus notes, before they were forced to join the war march to the north. Perhaps Darius visited the sanctuary of what is now Saint Nicholas, and washed in its icy spring where Thracians worshipped the cave–womb of their Mother Goddess, where pagan locals would be forcibly christened (ironic, when you learn of the high number of local Christians who were horribly martyred by the Romans), and where Tako chilled his bottles of cheap wine. It’s also where tourists fell in the water now, because the local authorities had stopped Tako from building a railing.",

The steam room was iconic, in that you could scarcely see anyone except as hazy, dim blobs, and also I couldn’t breathe properly. My absolute favourite was the aroma room. This was the hottest thing on offer, and the emptiest, and I loved it. It boasted a range of 40–50°C (100–120°F). A warning sign picture suggested flipflops would melt. It was heavenly and so unpopular that the heat had built up fantastically behind closed doors, especially on the top shelf where you couldn’t possibly lean against the wall for fear of scorch marks. All muscle knots from a lifetime melted in minutes. This is why I love the tropics. What better relaxant than warmth?",

Billed as the world's highest pub, at 2874 metres, Sani Lodge was a strangely low-key affair. With faded sepia photos, a dusty dining room with no obvious signs of any cooking taking place and a musty moth-eaten bar, it seemed deserted. We took the obligatory photo with the 'World's Highest Bar' sign, and drove on to the Lesotho border post, around one hundred feet further along the dirt road. If we'd viewed the lodge as eccentric, Lesotho's passport control was truly bizarre. A paint splashed breeze-block building with no windows, proclaiming itself as 'Lesotho Bordar' in mismatched, hand painted letters, and a three-legged plastic classroom chair, propped alongside a kitchen table on a rickety balcony, was our welcome to the mountain kingdom. Unsurprisingly, we had to rap on the door to rouse a slumbering official from his mid-morning nap, and he painstakingly stamped and signed our passports while peeking from beneath a colourful blanket like a sleepy toddler.",

Nordenskiöld had visited here in 1878, describing in his notes the remnants of ancient dwellings and prolific bone piles of reindeer and bears. The waters here were said to be rife with whales and walrus. Through blurring vision, Bartlett could see four yarangas spread in a semicircle, and he stopped at the largest of them. An old man poked his head outside the door and waved for them to enter. They were whisked inside by an elderly woman who quickly had their boots and stockings off and, before any words were spoken, had turned the four pairs inside out and hung them to dry. As Bartlett’s eyes adjusted to the lamplight, he could tell that the owner of this place was prosperous: the house was immaculate, recently swept, devoid of the usual smoke and foul air, and there were thick furs lining the pallets and stacked around, some draping the inside walls. Two young girls, the daughters, brought the weary travelers tea with sugar.",

The site occupied a headland beside a shallow bay, with a brook running into it, just as the sagas described. And here were the “large houses” the Norse wintered in.

Will some perfectionist snug in the arms of his chair under the marble eyes of Beethoven shudder at the thought? I suppose so, but if there’s a fledgling juggler of notes and cadences, less loyal to the stolid past, who seeks a new theme for at least a rhapsody, he may buy a ticket at any gate and see how they run. He will do what I cannot. He will transpose and change and re-create the sound of hooves that pelt like rain, or come like a rolling storm, or taper like the rataplan of fading tympani. He will find instruments to fit the bellow of a crowd and notes to voice its silence; he will find rhythm in disorder, and build a crescendo from a sigh. He will find a place for heroic measures if he watches well, and build his climax to a wild beat and weave the music of excitement in his overtones.",

As I waited for someone to fetch him from a back room, I watched the well-rehearsed ballet of the printing press—a large black machine as big and noisy as a car. A shirtless man wearing a labourer’s knee-length longyi worked the levers, and another man crouched beneath the machine to catch the printed pages as they came flying out. A woman sat cross-legged on the floor next to the press. She stacked the freshly printed sheets, folded them inside covers and, with thick thread, sewed the still-warm pages into a book. Next to her, a man with ink-stained hands and a greying white singlet organized a neat pile of finished books. He inked up a rubber stamp bearing the publisher’s logo and began punching it firmly on to the front page of each volume.",

    "target_paragraph": "From the start, Bolívar recognized that control of the Río Magdalena was critical to the republican cause. He began his campaign in the last days of 1812, moving his men upriver in a small flotilla of ten champanes. On December 21, with a force of just two hundred, he stunned the Spaniards at Tenerife; the entire garrison, some five hundred royalists, scattered in panic and wild abandon. Having scavenged muskets, swords, powder, and shot, Bolívar assembled the local ribereños, chastised them for their fidelity to Spain, and then, through the power of his oratory alone, enlisted hundreds to his cause. The next day, reinforced and well equipped, the rebel force moved on Mompox, where they encountered not bloodshed but jubilation as the momposinos welcomed them with a festive ball. By all accounts, Simón Bolívar’s charm and grace on the dance floor yielded another substantial infusion of volunteers by morning.",

The next night the Communists met in the slums at the end of a cul-de-sac. They kept on reading out telegrams from the platform and everyone sang the Internationale; then they’d speak a little and then another telegram arrived. They were poor and pinched and noisy; one wondered why it was that they had so much good news coming to them which didn’t make any difference at all. All the good news and the singing were at the end of an alley in a wide cold hall; they couldn’t get out; in the little square the soldiers stood in tin helmets beside their stacked rifles. That night from the window of a hotel I saw a man and woman copulating; they stood against each other under a street lamp, like two people who are supporting and comforting each other in the pain of some sickness. The next day I read in the paper how the Reds had tried to get out, but the soldiers had stopped them; a few people were hurt, a few went to prison.",

The approach is relatively steep. You go from five thousand feet to sea level in fourteen-pointseven nautical miles. If you miss, you do a very steep, sharp climbing turn to avoid hitting something. An airplane is most inefficient when making a sharp turn and climbing. A mile from the runway you go over a five-hundred-foot hill, and the top has been cleared of trees so that planes will not hit them. Now, is that or is that not a little hairy? After crossing the hill, you have to make a dogleg to the right before touching down.”",

    "target_paragraph": "The ferry docked and I shuffled on board with the others. Windermere looked serene and exceedingly fetching in the gentle sunshine. Unusually there wasn’t a single pleasure boat disturbing its glassy calmness. To say that Windermere is popular with boaters is to flirt recklessly with understatement. Some fourteen thousand powerboats—let me repeat that number: fourteen thousand—are registered to use the lake. On a busy summer’s day, as many as sixteen hundred powerboats may be out on the water at any one time, a good many of them zipping along at up to forty miles an hour with waterskiers in tow. This is in addition to all the thousands of other types of floating objects that may be out on the water and don’t need to register—dinghies, sailboats, sailboards, canoes, kayaks, inflatables, various excursion steamers, and the old chugging ferry I was on now—all of them searching for a boat-sized piece of water. It is all but impossible to stand on a lakeside bank on an August Sunday watching waterskiers slicing through packed shoals of dinghies and other floating detritus and not end up with your mouth open and your hands on your head.",

Finding the center of gravity, and then the sweet spot where the two stones came together, I slowly adjusted the stone. After about ten minutes, I had a single stone standing on end.

Perhaps, the confusion was historical, the mistaking of the pile of old Greek stones for the Roman ones that Luisa had used as a point of reference along Via Marina. Things didn’t bode well. We were ushered into two seats reserved in the second row. Although there was plenty of space in the back, this positioning was a show of respect as Luisa had brought along a foreign guest. We pulled away, and Prudenzia, hairdresser and tour organizer, grabbed hold of the microphone. I turned to Luisa and said, “She’s not speaking in Italian, is she?” And in that moment I had my first clue that the trip was definitely going to be different, at least for me. Actually, it had first come to me as the motor coach flew by us, then again as we approached our leader, and as we entered the bus.",

Several garish Hindu oleographs were pinned to the walls between a large photograph of King Mahendra with Queen Elizabeth II and a TWA picture calendar for 1952. And, presumably as a demonstration of strict neutrality, small photographs of Nehru, Gandhi, Chou-en-lai, President Kennedy and Khrushchev were huddled companionably in a corner by the door.",

The air seems wetter, the sky darker, the buildings somehow haunted. Roofs sag, hollow-backed, and walls slump against one another. Plants force their way through cracks in the boards, press their leaves against the glass from the inside. Broken chairs and old strollers block pathways through overgrown lawns. It is not there, and then it is. Here, it has a name: the blight.",

Round a bend, as though the whole of Kirishima had turned into a fairy tale, stood two harnessed horses that might have been waiting there a hundred autumns ago to haul their logs down to the valley farms. The road was silent but for the rustle of the leaves. Three cars passed me in the space of an hour, and in the one or two that stood parked by the roadside, honeymoon couples stared sleepily out at the century-old horses and at the fiery trees and me.",

Mulberry trees and a trellis of vines sheltered it from the heat of the day and the grass was green. Willows overhung the river, which here ran swift and deep except close into the bank where some quirk of the current made it move sluggishly upstream. Beyond the narrow road which divided it from the garden was the house, like all the other houses, a fortress of brown mud with loophole windows, wooden gutter pipes and a flat wooden roof with wide eaves. From it came the sound of giggling and there was a swirl of gaily coloured cloth on the roof as his wives gazed down on us, until he shouted something sharp at them and they vanished.",

    "target_paragraph": "“Barbels,” said Luke, calming down so instantly it seemed not right; it was a small betrayal of sorts, considered emotionally, man to man: Luke had re-entered his world of quiet scholarship, of gentle science, and left me all alone, outside. “I’ll be honest with you,” he said, so happy, so excited. “When I first saw this in the hopper I thought it was a new species! And I went all hot and cold, you know, dizzy. But at least I had the sense just to lay it gently in the basket and try to forget about it and to get on with life—and when the haul was over and you’d gone to the galley and I was all alone in here, I felt calm enough to go to the shelf in the laundry-room (I’d named it, just for now, the snotfish!) and I got out volume three here, and I compared it… I knew it had to belong to the family Liparididae, the sea-snails, you know, their bodies gelatinous, jelly, full of water for their life at ridiculous depths, down to 7,000 metres. Anyway …” He placed the snotfish in front of me on the steel shelf. And beside it he laid volume three of Fishes of the North-eastern Atlantic, the book of books, protected in its multiple brown-paper covers, open, the Liparididae. Luke’s right index-finger hovered above the drawing of Careproctus longipinnis, Burke, 1912. (“Common Synonyms: none. Common names: none.”) It would not be a good idea, I realized, to touch the pages of this sacred book, especially not with a fish-wet-slimy finger—if I do that, something told me, Luke will slit my throat. But hey—come on—in the illustration the sleek line of the downward-curving head, the level mouth, the swept-back barbels, the gaunt and muscled flanks: apart from its printed measurements, the picture bore no resemblance whatever to our beautiful fat little slob of a fish, a fish that had enjoyed life to the full, and drank, and slurped spaghetti… “But Luke!” I said. “I thought you had balls. It’s obvious—this is a new species. And you—you’ve lost your nerve!”",

Set on the bank of the swift and muddy Nambucca River, it was essentially just a pause in the highway: a tentacle of neatly gardened bungalows and small office buildings leading to a very compact town center. Though the road through town is the Pacific Highway, the main artery connecting Sydney and Brisbane, only two cars passed as I followed its dusty margin into town. At the heart of the modest community stood the large and fading Nambucca Hotel, and I stepped in, glad to escape the heat. It was a roomy place but nearly empty. Two older guys in tank tops and battered bush hats propped up one end of the long bar. In a side room a man and a woman sat in silent absorption amid the soft, mechanical glow of pokie machines. I procured a beer, stood long enough to establish that no one was going to take any interest in me that might lead to a conversation, and retired to the central portion of the bar where I parked myself on a stool and idly watched the evening news on a silent TV mounted on the wall.",
