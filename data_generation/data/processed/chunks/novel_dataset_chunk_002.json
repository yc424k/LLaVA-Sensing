His fur is puffed out, moist with sweat. He’s a tiny red yeti with clutching fingers. His skin feels smooth as cured leather. But thin too. Around the edges of his joints, across his distended stomach, it feels fragile, as if by pressing too hard, I’ll break through to his bones. In those places, he feels like silk. All I can hear is his breathing and the steady beat, beat, beat of our hearts.",

I didn’t want to be rude but I just had to ask. He explained that it was like a suit of armour that he wore to protect himself from the sharp claws of the dogs who jumped up on the people they love. They loved him very much because he took them for walks down to the lake.\nWe spent a couple of peaceful hours wandering around in the sun, photographing the birds and collecting the lumps of glittering obsidian that littered the ground. In the absence of any furniture, we sat on upturned tree stumps and spread out the picnic on a rug on the ground. The ladies who were working on James’s turf area were invited to join us, but they were very shy and uncomfortable in our company, preferring to take some food and go to eat it a distance away. I smiled to myself as I watched them piling their plates high with food from Muthaiga Country Club, their country’s most exclusive establishment. I hoped they would enjoy it.",

Hardwick, head of the Senate Immigration Committee, had just taken delivery of a small brown package and was carrying it to the kitchen when it exploded, blowing off her hands. The next day a New York postal employee read about the bombing and realized that the description of the parcel exactly matched sixteen parcels he had put aside at a sorting office for insufficient postage. He rushed back to work and found the packages still there. All were addressed to prominent public figures?John D. Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the chief justice of the United States, and several governors and congressmen. All bore return address labels to the Gimbel Brothers department store at Thirty-Second and Broadway in Manhattan. It was subsequently discovered that several other packages had already been posted. In one bizarre incident, a package was returned to Gimbel Brothers for insufficient postage. A Gimbel’s clerk opened the package, examined the odd contents?bottle of acid, timer, explosives?then packed it all up again, added the necessary postage, and mailed it on. Altogether thirty-six bombs were found. Apart from the unfortunate maid, no one else was injured and no arrests were made.",

Right and left of the path were first a bed of gooseberry-bushes, next of currant, next of raspberry, next of strawberry, next of old-fashioned flowers, at the corners opposite the porch being spheres of box resembling a pair of school-globes.

The other day, I rode up to the heron sanctuary, with its grudging welcome sign (“OK, you can see herons here”), but there were no herons that day, just ducks, so I watched the ducks for a while, then rode on into the next village.

You step into a chapel on the ground floor, and make out frescoes barely visible in the faint light, smell centuries of melted yak butter, see the sun coming in great shafts through the dust to light up ancient Buddhas. Outside are short, steep ladders that lead to the next terrace, and the next. You climb up, past kitchens and schoolrooms and treasure halls and toilets, and finally you come to a flat rooftop from which you can see nothing, across a wide expanse, but the far-off snowcaps, the blue skies extending in every direction, the frayed prayer-flags snapping in the wind. You’ve entered the higher, clearer dimension that The Snow Leopard makes its (temporary) home.",

These reindeer are domesticated and fairly friendly, since they have been reared and hand-fed by the tribe since they were babies. The males can grow to a height of 135 centimetres, from hooves to shoulders and around 1.8 to 2.1 metres long with a weight of up to 240 kilograms. Females are typically 25 per cent smaller. The reindeer are usually grey white with brown and are covered in fur from their nose to the bottom of their hooves. The furry hooves may look funny, but this gives them a good grip when walking on frozen ground, ice, mud and snow and especially when pulling a heavy load. As soon as the reindeer were harnessed to each of the sleighs, the tribe was ready to go. We perched on the sleighs and began the 20 to 25-kilometre journey to the next encampment, forming a 2-kilometre-long convoy snaking its way across the frozen landscape. Some of the younger Nenets men would then use their snowmobiles and the dogs, to move the reindeer herd and guide them south along our route.",

While walking out here time and consciousness expanded. There was something special about traveling on foot. It’d taken me weeks on the trail to see this, but the real value of wilderness lay in its expansiveness. In the space and solitude it afforded for reflection. It was a universal yardstick.

I tell her that I don’t need to see the menu but could she just bring me the best food possible because this is my first night in Sicily. She rubs her hands together in pleasure and yells something in Sicilian dialect to her even-more-elderly mother in the kitchen, and within the space of twenty minutes I am busily eating the hands-down most amazing meal I’ve eaten yet in all of Italy. It’s pasta, but a shape of pasta I’ve never before seen—big, fresh, sheets of pasta folded ravioli-like into the shape (if not exactly the size) of the pope’s hat, stuffed with a hot, aromatic puree of crustaceans and octopus and squid, served tossed like a hot salad with fresh cockles and strips of julienned vegetables, all swimming in an olivey, oceany broth. Followed by the rabbit, stewed in thyme.",

    "target_paragraph": "I HAD TO ADMIT THAT, in part, Mark had succeeded with me. I was surfing more than I would have. I had acquired a couple of new boards—three-fin designs known as thrusters—and a better wetsuit, reducing my hypothermia problem. We made surf runs north and south. When Ocean Beach was big and blown out, we headed to Mendocino County, where Mark knew some sheltered spots. In summer, when O.B. was hopeless, he took me to his favorite south-swell reefbreak, in Big Sur. His generosity seemed effortless, his natural element. He had appointed himself my surf coach, health director, and general adviser. Now he was sitting happily for his portrait. I was thinking more about surfing, if only because I had volunteered to write about it. But was I taking surfing more seriously? Not really. I was taking more notes, but going surfing still felt like something I did basically because I had always done it. Surfing and I had been married, so to speak, for most of my life, but it was one of those marriages in which little is said. Mark wanted to help me and surfing patch up our stubborn, silent marriage. I didn’t think I wanted it patched up. Having a sizable tract of unconsciousness near the center of my life suited me, somehow. I almost never talked about surfing except with other surfers. It contributed little to how I saw myself. I was reluctant to think of it as part of my real life as an adult, which I was now busy trying to kick-start. Journalism was ferrying me into worlds that interested me far more than chasing waves.",

The man is short, about the same height as Mila, half a head shorter than me, about two heads shorter than Dolf. He’s got a serious, heavy-set look, his eyes almost hidden by deep lines, and he is watching us warily. I quickly lower my torch. I can’t tell how old he is. Older than I imagined, older than Agustino. He’s wearing a Boca Juniors football shirt, jeans and ragged trainers, and he’s chewing a ball of coca the size of a fist. There are green stains engrained around his lips and a shotgun slung over his shoulder. A machete wedged in his belt. Two ratty terriers are snuffling around his feet.",

This ersatz army also included civilians—black slaves and native servants, soldiers’ wives, five friars (Marcos among them), even two painters—as well as 550 horses and innumerable livestock. In all, some two thousand people and approximately as many animals trod north across the arid frontier. Their passage must have created a mushroom cloud of dust.",

    "target_paragraph": "As a recovering political hack, I was routinely amazed by the lack of political rancour around even the most controversial issues in the Netherlands. Coverage of politics on Dutch television was limited, and most cabinet ministers could walk down the street not only unguarded but completely unnoticed. It was exceedingly rare to hear a Dutch person express a strong opinion about any political issue, and unusual to hear current affairs discussed in a bar or over dinner. When the former health minister Els Borst was found dead in early 2014, the news barely merited a mention on the front pages of national newspapers – even after the police said they thought she had been murdered. Vigorous political protest or public rallying was almost unheard of, and at election time many people were genuinely unsure who to vote for – perhaps because coalition governments meant it was impossible to be sure a party would deliver on its promises. The choice available to voters seemed overwhelming: at the 2014 European elections, no fewer than 19 parties were listed on the ballot sheet, with a combined 345 candidates competing for just 26 seats. Even if the Prime Minister gave a major speech about a contentious issue – immigration, say – the response from most of his political opponents would be polite agreement, with perhaps a few mild suggestions for improvement. The next day newspapers would report the speech on perhaps page seven, in a brief column summarising what was said, with little opinionising or speculation about its impact on his political future. People generally thought that politicians were decent and hard-working, and free from the taint of corruption or self-interest.",

The addition was a spontaneous decision that brought added responsibilities, an entrée into an entirely different world—the world of “horsey people”—and great joy in seeing our daughter grow up with plenty of fun. Owning our horse was a gift that changed our daily routines and expanded our circles. We were constantly interacting and working closely with the grooms who managed the care, feeding, walking and well-being of our animal.",

There were, of course, no roads in the jungle, just trails, one of which we were on. Before we had even reached the trees, we had realized that the harvest would have to be carried out.

    "target_paragraph": "‘It’s got the old rests by the side of the fireplace, where the men hung their guns,’ said Elizabeth, leading the way, with a tall brass candlestick in her hand, down a passage. ‘Show Mr Denham the steps, Christopher … When the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were here two years ago they said this was the most interesting part of the house. These narrow bricks prove that it is five hundred years old—five hundred years, I think—they may have said six.’ She, too, felt an impulse to exaggerate the age of the bricks, as her father had exaggerated the number of trucks. A big lamp hung down from the centre of the ceiling and, together with a fine log fire, illuminated a large and lofty room, with rafters running from wall to wall, a floor of red tiles, and a substantial fireplace built up of those narrow red bricks which were said to be five hundred years old. A few rugs and a sprinkling of armchairs had made this ancient kitchen into a sitting-room. Elizabeth, after pointing out the gun-racks, and the hooks for smoking hams, and other evidence of incontestable age, and explaining that Mary had had the idea of turning the room into a sitting-room—otherwise it was used for hanging out the wash and for the men to change in after shooting—considered that she had done her duty as hostess, and sat down in an upright chair directly beneath the lamp, beside a very long and narrow oak table. She placed a pair of horn spectacles upon her nose, and drew towards her a basketful of threads and wools. In a few minutes a smile came to her face, and remained there for the rest of the evening.",

Originally having planned to follow the Gulf coast, so he could meet supply ships from Cuba, De Soto changed course.

In this region of southern Nepal live various hill peoples of Mongol and Aryan mix, most of them Paharis, or hill Hindus. For centuries, the Hindus have come up along the river valleys from the great plain of the Ganges, while Tibetans crossed the mountain passes from the north: the Tibetan-speaking Buddhist tribes, which include the Sherpas, are called Bhotes, or southern Tibetans. (Bhot or B’od is Tibet; Bhutan, which lies at the southern edge of Tibet, means “End of Bhot.”) Of the tribes represented by the porters, the Gurungs and Tamangs tend toward Buddhism, while the Chetris and Magars are Hindus. Whether Hindu or Buddhist, most of these tribes—and the Gurung especially—pay respect to the animist deities of the old religions that persist in remote corners of the Asian mountains.",
