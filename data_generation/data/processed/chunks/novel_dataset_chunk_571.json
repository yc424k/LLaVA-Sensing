Now I was going back there, this time with twenty thousand miles of hiking under my feet and enough experience and knowledge to know I was in over my head. I was also aware that no matter the cost, I wanted to make it to Springer Mountain. I was no longer an overweight flatlander without a clue: I was a cheetah in training.",

As a gay man, Fortuyn reserved particular vitriol for the assault that he perceived Muslim immigrants were making on sexual liberty. If the Netherlands were to maintain its traditional freedoms, he said, it would have to address the hidden danger lurking in its midst.",

In Out of Africa, Nairobi was depicted as a sunny little country town, so I am disappointed to find that at some time in the past 50 or 60 years they took away that pretty scene and replaced it with Omaha, of all things. Nairobi is merely yet another modern city with traffic lights and big buildings and hoardings advertising Samsung televisions and the like. Our hotel is a Holiday Inn—very nice and comfortable, but hardly a place that shouts: “Welcome to Africa, Bwana.”",

I noted a sign with the village’s name: KHOLODNAYA (Cold). We crossed the upper Angara River, a lake-wide plain of ice, where sharp-tipped icy mountains ranged like fence palings to the north. We disappeared into long, dark tunnels, including the ten-mile one. Occasionally the bigger BAM towns had a railroad station even wackier than Severobaikalsk’s. These stations sported turrets, semicircular windows, conning towers, and giant clocks, among other flights of sub-Arctic surrealism. At several stations I got off and walked around. The way the arrival and departure announcements echoed in the boundless emptiness gave a new dimension to train yard solitude. Temperatures were holding at about −10°F; perhaps a frozen silence is a more profound kind. Occasionally, children’s voices would rise from someplace in the vicinity, or a distinct and singular clink of metal would ring out. Sounds of hissing would burst suddenly from the train, followed by more deep-taiga silence.",

I suppose because we always took our vacations between June and August it implanted in me the idea that everywhere in America outside the Midwest was hot the year around. Wherever you went in the summer in America it was murder. It was always ninety degrees. If you closed the windows you baked, but if you left them open everything blew everywhere – comic books, maps, loose articles of clothing. If you wore shorts, as we always did, the bare skin on your legs became part of the seat, like cheese melted onto toast, and when it was time to get up, there was a ripping sound and a screaming sensation of agony as the two parted. If in your sun-baked delirium you carelessly leaned your arm against the metal part of the door on to which the sun had been shining, the skin where it made contact would shrivel and disappear, like a plastic bag in a flame. This would always leave you speechless. It was a truly amazing, and curiously painless, spectacle to watch part of your body just vanish. You didn’t know whether to shriek at your mother as if you had been gravely wounded, or do it again, in a spirit of scientific enquiry. In the end, usually, you would do nothing, but just sit listlessly, too hot to do anything else.",

He was going at furious speed, dipping and rising over the rolling land.... And as he spurred wildly up the little hill where we stood, we saw a horror. A fan-shaped cascade of blood poured from the front of him. The lower part of his mouth was quite shot away by a soft-nosed bullet. He reined up beside the colonel, and tried earnestly, terribly, to tell him something; but nothing intelligible issued from the ruin. Tears poured down the poor fellow’s cheeks. He gave a hoarse cry, and, driving his spurs deep in his horse, fled up the Santo Domingo road. Others were coming, too, on the dead run—those who had been the Puerta guard. Two or three passed right through the hacienda without stopping. The rest threw themselves upon\nDon Petronilo, in a passion of rage. \"More ammunition!\" they cried.\n\"More cartridges!\"",

All decent and generous impulse had not yet been killed or deadened in him; he still possessed a warped and blunted friendliness, the rudiments of some youthful feeling for a better, warmer, bolder, and more liberal kind of life. As time went on, he made a few awkward, shamed, and inarticulate advances toward friendship; he began to come into the young man’s room from time to time, and presently to tell him a little of his life at college and his hopes for the future. He was a little fellow, with the same dry, febrile, alert, and corky figure that his father had: he was one of the dark Irish; he had black hair and black eyes, and one of his legs was badly bowed and bent outward, the result, he said, of having broken it in a high-school football game. The first time he came into the room he stood around shyly, awkwardly, and mistrustfully for a spell, blurting out a few words from time to time, and looking at the books and papers with a kind of dazed and stricken stupefaction.",

A sign informed us that we were about to enter the Al Montazah Palace Area, a public park that was once a luxurious estate for Egypt’s elite classes. While we stopped to take a few photos, a taxi pulled alongside. “The park is closed,” the driver cried. “Come, I will take you.” Where he wanted us to go, I can only guess, but the park was, in fact, very much open. We paid a small entry fee – a few pound each – and soon found ourselves on a wide, paved road guarded by neat columns of palms. A roadside map illustrated the sprawling complex of buildings and beaches and gardens that lay ahead. We counted two palaces, a mosque, and a hotel… then another taxi driver rolled to a stop and shouted to us. “More to see, come with me,” he said, but, at that moment, we just wanted to enjoy a quiet stroll through the estate. “La, shokrun. No, thank you,” I said. We turned off the main road and found a footpath tucked under a towering canopy of exotic trees that hid the sun from view. The temperature dropped a few degrees and the air felt fresh, like that of a warm spring morning.",

One moronic young clerk – perhaps merely stupefied by boredom – squatted in a corner wrapped in a red-brown blanket and morosely cracking walnuts. He looked just like a squirrel. I couldn’t send off my postcards, which I would have entrusted to the System as a test case, because there were no stamps available, pending the arrival of the next plane at some remote future date. This institution was established by the British and seems physically unchanged, in every particular, since its opening a century ago. But now the reliable Mail Runners have been largely superseded by capricious aeroplanes so it has given up the struggle to be efficient.",

A Jewish woman who hung an Israeli flag from her balcony in Amsterdam was beaten up by three men ‘wearing Palestinian-style scarves’. One survey of Dutch Turks aged 18 to 34 found that an astonishing 80 per cent thought there was nothing wrong with waging jihad against non-believers. The findings were disputed, but were worrying nonetheless. Then, as 2015 dawned, terrorists rampaged through the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. The Dutch were naturally horrified that such a thing could happen so close by, and feared they might be next. Rotterdam’s Ahmed Aboutaleb condemned Islamic extremism so strongly and repeatedly that people began speculating whether he was positioning himself to become northern Europe’s first Muslim prime minister one day. Soon after the rally on the Stadhuis steps, he even managed to wangle an invitation to the White House to meet Barack Obama.",

As a result of enjoying this modest feast Hugh was very ill.",

Two Westerners walked toward them and passed them, and everyone continued their progress. Within about 35 seconds they suddenly experienced an enormous boom. The pavement shook; they turned around and were faced with an explosion fifty to seventy feet away. Body parts were flying through the air amid the acrid smell of burning flesh. The women instantly reacted with shock, grabbed each other and ran down a side street. A cab picked them up, and they piled into it holding onto each other the entire trip back to camp. A car bomb had gone off, and one of the Westerners they had just passed was killed in the blast, while the other was critically injured. Leova and her friend had just experienced a near-miss. Although this was a one-off experience, there was a series of events like this over several months.",

He closed in too fast; maybe he was afraid he wouldn’t be there in time to see him when he treed. It was the best race he had ever seen. He had never seen old Jake go that fast, and nobody had ever known Tomey’s Turl to go faster than his natural walk, even riding a mule. Uncle Buck whooped once from the woods, running on sight, then Black John came out of the trees, driving, soupled out flat and level as a hawk, with Uncle Buck right up behind his ears now and yelling so that they looked exactly like a big black hawk with a sparrow riding it, across the field and over the ditch and across the next field, and he was running too; the mare went out before he even knew she was ready, and he was yelling too. Because, being a nigger, Tomey’s Turl should have jumped down and run for it afoot as soon as he saw them. But he didn’t; maybe Tomey’s Turl had been running off from Uncle Buck for so long that he had even got used to running away like a white man would do it. And it was like he and old Jake had added Tomey’s Turl’s natural walking speed to the best that old Jake had ever done in his life, and it was just exactly enough to beat Uncle Buck to the ford. Because when he and the pony arrived, Black John was blown and lathered and Uncle Buck was down, leading him around in a circle to slow him down, and they could already hear Mr Hubert’s dinner horn a mile away.",

His other hand lay on the back of the chair and upon that dead surface it moved tentatively, delicately, as if he were picking an inaudible tune out of the dead void, and once he even forgot to tease Ben with the spoon while his fingers teased out of the slain wood a soundless and involved arpeggio until Ben recalled him by whimpering again.",

Once upon a time I’d made a vow to myself here: to thru-hike the Pacific Crest Trail. It seemed like a promise made in another lifetime, by another person altogether. Since the Chairbacks, I’d vacillated between the desire to give up and the tenacious hope that things would get better. Over and over, I tried to recall what the first weeks of the PCT had been like. There were vague memories of heat, thirst, and pain. Nothing like the wet, cold, rocky miles of the northern AT. One thing I recalled was that although my body eventually hardened to the miles, my mind never did. Every day I had clung desperately to the hope that it would get easier. But no matter how strong my body was, staying focused and intent on the goal was always mentally draining. When I’d finally learned to accept that it wouldn’t get easier, I’d been able to let go of that hope without falling apart. But I had to always remind myself that everything that happened along the way was out of my control, that I could only change my reactions, and dedicate myself to putting one foot in front of the other, even when I wanted to stop.",

He is a Pathan, as are the owner of the chi-khana and the proprietor of the Hotel. The locals are as yet too unworldly to take commercial advantage of their jeep-track and Abbas Kazmi explained that all along it Pathans are to be found running stores or hotels. Often these are relatives of the jeep-drivers who in summer regularly carry loads to Skardu. Both Pathans and Punjabis are disliked throughout Baltistan, partly because of the normal antagonism felt towards meddling outsiders by isolated communities, and partly because many immigrants cheat when financially innocent villagers wish to exchange chickens, eggs or fruit for tea, sugar or cloth. However, not all immigrants exploit and despise the rough rug-headed Balti kerns. Some, including Zaffir Khan, are sympathetic, condoling with them on the recent loss of their ‘Rajas’, who were really petty chiefs traditionally subject to the Raja of Skardu.",
