Angel entered, and went through the silent passages of the house to the back quarters, where he listened for a moment. Sustained snores came from the cart-house, where some of the men were lying down; the grunt and squeal of sweltering pigs arose from the still farther distance. The large-leaved rhubarb and cabbage plants slept too, their broad limp surfaces hanging in the sun like half-closed umbrellas.",

They were thick-set, broad-shouldered men, with features of marked irregularity and projecting teeth, and they were cold and wet with rain. Room was made for them in the circle round the hearth, and they stretched out their fingers to the blaze, while the talk went on uninterrupted, for they were only three men of the Sherarāt, come down to buy corn in Moab, and the Sherarāt, though they are one of the largest and the most powerful of the tribes and the most famous breeders of camels, are of bad blood, and no Arab of the Belka would intermarry with them. They have no fixed haunts, not even in the time of the summer drought, but roam the inner desert scarcely caring if they go without water for days together. The conversation round Nahār’s fire was of my journey. A negro of the Sukhūr, a powerful man with an intelligent face, was very anxious to come with me as guide to the Druze mountains, but he admitted that as soon as he reached the territory of those valiant hillmen he would have to turn and flee — there is always feud between the Druzes and the Beni Sakhr. The negro slaves of the Sukhūr are well used by their masters, who know their worth, and they have a position of their own in the desert, a glory reflected from the great tribe they serve. I was half inclined to accept the present offer in spite of the possible drawback of having the negro dead upon my hands at the first Druze village, when the current of my thoughts was interrupted by the arrival of yet another guest. He was a tall young man, with a handsome delicate face, a complexion that was almost fair, and long curls that were almost brown. As he approached, Nahār and the other sheikhs of the Sukhūr rose to meet him, and before he entered the tent, each in turn kissed him upon both cheeks. Namrūd rose also, and cried to him as he drew near:",

The waves were uncommonly steep and the lee rail buried itself underwater as we fell off a wave and created miniature rainbows in the splashing wake. I weighed taking in the third reef, which would let Varuna sit up a little straighter, but would also decrease our speed. The jib was already reefed down and there were two in the main. Looking back to Akka, I said to myself, “Nah. The two boats seem to be going at about the same speed and besides, we’re screaming along.”",

Instead he whipped out my Swiss knife and said, ‘For me!’ His face was transformed; now he looked like the nastiest sort of bandit. Momentarily I was too taken aback to react. Then I made to grab the knife and he transferred it to his other hand, yelling abuse. Enraged, I struck him hard on the shin with my stick and, as he doubled up in pain, prised the knife from his loosened grip. I felt slightly scared of the possible reaction of the half-drunken crowd all around; it seemed ominous that Petru had felt free to rob me in public. As quickly as my condition permitted – not even glancing at Lilia and her husband – I descended the steps and made for my hotel in a state of mild shock.",

    "target_paragraph": "Erected in the fourteenth century BC, of sandstone quarried in Lower Egypt, the twin statues depict Amenhotep III seated on thrones at the gates to what was once the largest and most opulent temple in Egypt. The pedestals alone, half-buried in silt, rise more than ten feet, and the statues’ heads, draped with headdresses called the Nemes, reach sixty feet high. By then we had seen the pyramids of Giza and the temples of Karnak, but in those places, the statues and monuments seemed proportionate to the next. The Colossi, of which we had read a bit, appeared suddenly and seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Surrounded by an empty field, they were literally giants. Though now cracked and defaced, the imposing, megalithic statues look as though they were airlifted by helicopters – large helicopters – and left there as a warning to invading forces. There are few other signs of the massive temple complex that stood here for centuries. It was built on the immediate floodplain of the Nile and suffered catastrophic damage within a few centuries. Today, other than the Colossi, the grounds are marked by a handful of foundation walls, smaller statues and a few sphinxes, all dredged from the surrounding fields, and left to dry on temporary pedestals. (Though we now know the statues depict a pharaoh of the New Kingdom, early Greek explorers believed the monuments depicted Memnon, a mythical king and hero of the Trojan Wars.)",

When he turned round and found them gone, that was the balm he clapped on his wound. He would go and see Mira; Mira at least would be glad to see him. Thus when he left the club he turned not East, where the busy men were going; nor West where his own house in Abercorn Terrace was; but took his way along the hard paths through the Green Park towards Westminster. The grass was very green; the leaves were beginning to shoot; little green claws, like birds’ claws, were pushing out from the branches; there was a sparkle, an animation everywhere; the air smelt clean and brisk. But Colonel Pargiter saw neither the grass nor the trees. He marched through the Park, in his closely buttoned coat, looking straight ahead of him. But when he came to Westminster he stopped. He did not like this part of the business at all. Every time he approached the little street that lay under the huge bulk of the Abbey, the street of dingy little houses, with yellow curtains and cards in the window, the street where the muffin man seemed always to be ringing his bell,where children screamed and hopped in and out of white chalk-marks on the pavement, he paused, looked to the right, looked to the left; and then walked very sharply to Number Thirty and rang the bell. He gazed straight at the door as he waited with his head rather sunk. He did not wish to be seen standing on that door-step. He did not like waiting to be let in. He did not like it when Mrs Sims let him in. There was always a smell in the house; there were always dirty clothes hanging on a line in the back garden. He went up the stairs, sulkily and heavily, and entered the sitting-room.",

The fields were being ploughed by the most primitive methods, which involve tremendously hard work on the part of the men as well as the yokes of bullocks, and irrigation channels were rippling smoothly along between the cultivated patches. In the village, of well-fortified houses, the little children were so terrified at the sight of me that they fled like chickens before a fox. Yet to my extreme astonishment when a group of ten- to fourteen-year-olds gathered to investigate me and asked where I came from and when I replied ‘Ireland’ they immediately said ‘Dublin!’ in unison. They were dressed in the usual filthy rags, but instead of begging from the tourist they offered me revolting fly-blown sweets, nuts and raisins out of the (probably lousy) recesses of their garments. I didn’t like refusing but one has to draw the line somewhere. They also organised a bird-fight for my entertainment; this is one of the most popular sports among the villagers. Two birds, about the size of hen-pheasants, but in build and plumage like doves, are released from their cages on the ground and go for each other; the fight lasts until one bird has the other pinned to the ground so that it can’t get up. There’s no bloodshed and no killing, only plenty of feathers flying, and since the tactics are quite beautiful to watch it was a lot more enjoyable than I had expected. Of course my last film had been used on the Buddhas; I’ve discovered that one of the chief griefs of a photographer’s life is that the last film has always been used immediately before a ‘special’ picture presents itself.",

At full moon we dined there, barefooted on the dark grass, to watch the lights winking away along the fretted coast and the great bronze coin shake itself free of the sunset-mist and climb with slow, per­fectly punctuated steps into the nether heaven, bubbling into the great rose-window of the eastern wall like a visitant of the Gothic world. Here in the striped darkness, dotted with pools of luminous moonlight, we walked and talked, the smell of roses and wine and cigars mingling with the humbler scent of the limes, or the whiffs of bruised sage coming to us from the face of the mountain behind where Buffavento rose slowly to meet the moon, like a mailed fist. And somewhere upon the outer silence would come the haunting liquid music of a flute perhaps, its five-tone scale like a thread spun upon the silent air between the pines.",

Signage is unnecessary, unless you happen to be me. I bumble around finally figuring out that if I ask the shop owner about the ferry, she will call the captain on her landline since no mobiles work here. If the ferry is running (which it may not), he will get the message (sometime), call her when it is convenient (for him), and provide an answer (perhaps) or request for additional information (more likely). I will then reappear at the shop (sometime) and be informed (or not). This stresses me out. I want a ticket window and a ticket. I want a spot on that boat because it only has twelve seats. I want to know how this bike thing is going to work because I look at the promotional photos and that boat doesn’t look bike friendly to me. In a lather, I wander back to the campground and settle in for the night. The weather has turned for the better. The wind has died. The sun is out, until 11pm. Time to look on the bright side.",

    "target_paragraph": "In the professional ranks, of course, the regimen was even more tyrannical. Before every single game of the season, whether in midwinter or 100-degree heat, the players had to practice for four hours and run three miles. One team did a daily “Death Climb” that included twenty sprints up and down the 275 steps of a Shinto shrine; others did “1,000 ground ball” drills, performed 500 “shadow swings” daily, or ran sprints with weights tied to their backs and tires attached to their legs. A laggard player was routinely humbled by having balls hit directly at his body for hours on end. In the United States, star pitchers are handled like precious objects who need at least three days of rest between appearances; in Japan, a successful pitcher is made to appear day after day after enervating day, until he virtually collapses into retirement in his mid-twenties. “American players start spring training on March 1, Japanese on January 15,” Whiting explained succinctly in a television interview. “American players spend an average of three hours a day on the field, the Japanese spend eight. Americans run one mile a day on average in camp, Japanese run ten.” In 1987, even Lou Gehrig’s seemingly unbreakable record of playing in 2,138 consecutive games had been shattered by Sachio Kinugasa of the Hiroshima Carp, who had appeared in every game for 12 years.",

One of them, Avi, had ice-blue eyes, a crazily naughty smile, and, despite the fact that he was built like Kate Moss and was probably too young to legally drink in the U.S., both he and his friends seemed confident that he would be taking me to bed. (In Israel I was told a joke about fighter pilots, and the punch line had something to do with them thinking they could cut diamonds with their penises. So, there’s a swagger.) Later in the night we met Alfred, a German hippie mountaineering guide who was taking a few days off from his job in Torres del Paine—the national park in Chile where I was supposed to be. He was as goofy and cheerful as Germans rarely are, with white-guy dreads and a deep joy from getting to sleep indoors for a few days. There was Elizabeth, the tall, blond Australian student/​waitress/​singer, who was traveling around the world for a year on her own. There were Noa and Eli, a lovely Israeli couple on their post-army trip together, who had met during their tours of duty in the Israeli equivalent of the USO. She sang for the soldiers, and he set up the sound system, and they were the kind of in love that made you want to take pictures of them in the sunset. And, lastly, there was Nick, an adorable blue-eyed science teacher from Maryland who had just come in from a week backpacking alone in the cold wet tundra of Tierra del Fuego, and who, it turned out, was hungry for some warmth and company. But more on him later.",

During our previous visit, we stayed in a river-view room, with a lovely bed, large bathroom, and a balcony that overlooked the Nile (and the neighboring sewage treatment plant). Though the view from that room was great, we wanted to save a few dollars on our return trip, so I reserved a city-view room. The room was about the size of a walk-in closet. The twin beds were hard as rocks; I guessed they were just box springs set on box springs with no mattresses at all, but Teresa insisted I was crazy. The noise from passing traffic was bad, but the noise from the service quarters next door was even worse. Then, later that evening, we noticed a foul smell, like burning plastic. At first it was faint, like someone was smoking next door, but the odor grew stronger and more foul. We looked out the window and saw the bright glow of a large fire, about a block away. It flickered and wavered for a minute then exploded in a ball of yellow and red. Even over the sound of traffic, I heard the flames pop. The glow from the fire lit up the sides of several buildings, and the smoke cast a shadow over the street. We closed the drapes and went to bed.",

The first cover of Life magazine, published three years before I was born, featured a photo of the three-and-a-half-mile Fort Peck Dam, built by government workers during the Great Depression. Established in the late 1800s as a fur-trading post, it swelled to a boom-town of ten thousand in the 1930s. Now, the one-gate local airport welcomes travelers from neighboring states and Canada intent on seeing not only one of the largest man-made lakes in the world, but also to enjoy the fine tourist amenities.",

The furniture consisted of two brass bedsteads appointed with satin bolsters, and a ring of stiff settees, upholstered in white, before each of which stood a small white-covered table bearing dishes of melon, grapes, and sweets. In the middle of the floor, which was covered with two layers of carpets, stood three tall oil lamps, unshaded.

They were dressed in colorful costumes of bright cloth adorned with freshly picked flowers. The men started to play a traditional Kiribati piece and the children sang along in sweet child voices. Then the girls performed a dance that emphasized hand and arm movements and quick, bird-like moves of the head—a very traditional Kiribati style. It was all really cute and well done, and it was obvious they’d spent long hours practicing. We all clapped and cheered. Their bright smiles reflected the pride they felt in their performances. Afterward, Paeniu asked everyone to get up and dance to a song, which turned into several songs and several dances, with everyone laughing and having a good time.",

    "target_paragraph": "At 9.45 the ominously hot sun was tempered by a headwind against which I couldn’t pedal much above walking speed. It came tearing across the plain of Nkonde – flat, fertile, bright green – and here I remembered with grief the fate of the Wankonde, a tribe who lived next door to Paradise before the slavers arrived. (One can and does mourn uselessly in certain places.) This plain was once a haven of tranquillity and abundance, protected to the north by the mountains I had just crossed, to the west by the mountains I was about to cross, to the east by Lake Nyasa – and never encroached on from the south because no one bothered to find out what went on at that extremity of the inland sea. (Livingstone imagined Lake Nyasa to be a hundred miles shorter than it is and none of the Africans he met on its shore was in a position to put him right.) ‘Nkonde’ means ‘banana’; this tribe took its name from the plant that supplied not only its main food but fuel, roofing material, plates, umbrellas, soap from the sap and fibre for weaving into blankets. (The Wankonde went naked during the day, apart from the women’s token apron of bark-cloth, some nine inches square.) Plump cattle grazed the pasturelands between the banana groves, and the stands of cotton trees and sycamore, and Thomson wrote ecstatically, ‘I felt as if I had fallen upon some enchanted place’. But a decade later came the Arabs from Tanzania, who had heard talk of these happy people, lacking a warrior tradition and there for the taking. Monteith Fotheringham, an African Lakes Company employee then managing the Company’s new store at Karonga, described the slavers ‘burning village after village, slaughtering without stint, and those women they did not kill they put in irons and reserved for a fate still more severe’. All this was the standard prelude to the enslavement of the most saleable members of a tribe. Fotheringham – the only European in the region – at once took it upon himself to organise an ultimately successful campaign against the Arabs and their local half-breed ally, the infamous Mlozi. But by then the tribe’s ‘perfect Arcadia’ – Thomson’s phrase – had been destroyed forever.",

She had read somewhere that to take alcohol was to send the blood into the surface vessels of the body, thus engendering a feeling of warmth.

Because that was as close as he got; he said he hollered at them to go on home to the Snopes, I mean the Jefferson Hotel but they just stood there looking at him and he said he never intended anything: just to get them moving since maybe they didn’t understand what he meant yet. So he sort of flung his arms out and was just kind of jumping at them, hollering again, when he stopped himself just in time, the knife already in one of their hands with the blade open at least six inches long; so fast that he never even saw where it came from and in the next minute gone so fast he still didn’t even know which one of the three in overalls—the girl or the two boys—had it; that was when Mr Connors went to Dink Quistenberry the next morning and told him he would have to keep them off the streets at night.",

    "target_paragraph": "“This is the ranger’s residence, just a few years old,” John said. “It has solar panels and an electric water pump to raise the water from the cistern up to the gravity tank, so we have running water at the turn of the tap.” He was clearly proud of the building. It was simple but functional with a concrete floor that was also the top of the underground cistern. The lower level was open on three sides with a kitchen set off to the south end and an enclosed toilet and washroom on the east side. A large picnic style table dominated the open space. There was a stairway up to the upper level, which contained the sleeping quarters and private living space. Somebody had mounted a varnished driftwood plaque on the front of the building announcing the Suwarrow Yacht Club in letters engraved with a router. The flags of many nations were tacked up all around the open sides, traditional mementos from visiting yachts.",
