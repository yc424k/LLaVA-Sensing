Domenico, foreseeing this, had sent his aunt's fly, driven by her son his cousin; and his aunt and her fly lived in Castagneto, the village crouching at the feet of San Salvatore, and therefore, however late the train was, the fly would not dare come home without containing that which it had been sent to fetch.",

We are only bodies jogging along side by side. I exist only in the soles of my feet and in the tired muscles of my thighs. We have been walking for hours it seems. But where? I cannot remember. I am like a log slipping smoothly over some waterfall. I am not a judge. I am not called upon to give my opinion. Houses and trees are all the same in this grey light. Is that a post? Is that a woman walking? Here is the station, and if the train were to cut me in two, I should come together on the further side, being one, being indivisible. But what is odd is that I still clasp the return half of my ticket to Waterloo firmly between the fingers of my right hand, even now, even sleeping.’",

'Go on, go on,' I called to the driver with a wave of my hand seeing him hesitate; and then stood waiting for Brosy who was some little way behind pushing his bicycle dismally through the sand, meditating no doubt on the immense difficulties of dealing with mothers who do things one does not like. When he realised that the solitary figure with the peaked hood outlined against the sullen grey background was mine he pushed along at a trot, with a face of great distress. But I had no difficulty in looking happy and assuring him that I liked walking, because I really was thankful to get away from the bishop's wife, and I rather liked, besides, to be able to stretch myself thoroughly; while as for getting wet, to let oneself slowly be soaked to the skin while walking in a warm rain has a charm all its own.",

It was this: there was a company of old men and women at dinner, seated together around a table. All of them were very old, older than his uncle; the faces of the old men and women were fragile and delicate like old yellowed china, their faces were frail and sexless, they had begun to look alike. In their youth all these people had known one another. The men had drunk, fought, whored, hated one another, and loved the women. Some had been devoured by the sterile and corrupt fear and envy that young men know. In secret their lips were twisted, their faces livid, and their hearts bitter; their eyes glittered with a reptilian hatred of another man – they dreaded his success, and they exulted in his failure, laughing with a delirious joy when they heard or read of his hurt, defeat, or humiliation. They had been afraid to speak or confess what was in their hearts, they feared the mockery of their fellows; with one another their words were careful, picked, and disparaging. They gave the lie to passion and belief and they said what they knew was false. And yet along dark roads at night they had shouted out into the howling winds their great goat-cries of joy, exultancy and power; they had smelled snow in thick brooding air at night, and they had watched it come, softly spitting at the window glass, numbing the footfalls of the earth with its soft silent fall, filling their hearts with a dark proud ecstasy, touching their entrails with impending prophecy. Each had a thousand dark desires and fantasies; each wanted wealth, power, fame and love; each saw himself as great, good and talented; each feared and hated rivals in business or in love – and in crowds they glared at one another with hard hostile eyes, they bristled up like crested cocks, they watched their women jealously, felt looks and glances through their shoulder-blades, and hated men with white spermatic necks, amorous hair, and faces proud and insolent with female conquest.",

She had known that it would feel like that.\nAnd, as sometimes happens to people who are going to die and know it, there came to her a peculiar vivid and poignant sense of her surroundings. Of Rowcliffe's room and the things in it,—the chair he had sat in, the pipe he had laid aside, the book he had been reading and that he had flung away. Outside the open window the trees of the little orchard, whitened by the moonlight, stood as if fixed in a tender, pure and supernatural beauty. She could see the flags on the path and the stones in the gray walls. They stood out with a strange significance and importance. As if near and yet horribly far away, she could hear Rowcliffe's footsteps in the passage.\nIt came over her that she was sitting in Rowcliffe's room—like this—for the last time.\nThen her heart dragged and tore at her, as if it fought against her will to die. But it never occurred to her that this dying of hers was willed by her. It seemed foredoomed, inevitable.\n* * * * *\nAnd now she was looking up in Rowcliffe's face and smiling at him as he brought her her tea.\n\"That's right,\" he said.\nHe was entirely reassured by her appearance.\n\"Look here, shall I drive you back or do you feel like another four-mile walk?\"\nShe hesitated.\n\"It's late,\" he said. \"But no matter. Let's be reckless.\"\n\"There's no need. I've got my bicycle.\"\n\"Then I'll get mine.\"\nShe rose. \"Don't. I'm going back alone.\"\n\"You're not. I'm coming with you. I want to come.\"\n\"If you don't mind, I'd rather you didn't—to-night.\"\n\"I'll drive you, then. I can't let you go alone.\"\n\"But I want,\" she said, \"to be alone.\"\nHe stood looking at her with a sort of sullen tenderness.\n\"You're not going to worry about what I told you?\"\n\"You didn't tell me. I knew.\"\n\"Then——\"\nBut she persisted.\n\"No. I shall be all right,\" she said. \"There's a moon.\"\nIn the end he let her have her way.\nMoon or no moon he saw that it was not his moment.",

She hadn’t much. Her legs dragged. It really was intolerably hot. She wanted to sleep. She didn’t want to do anything more that day, but just sleep. After all, what was all this hurry?

Our room, which overlooked the Nile and the adjacent sewage treatment facility, had floor-to-ceiling windows, and the drapes, heavy though they were, offered little resistance to the morning light. The sun beat through the drapes and painted the room with undulating waves of orange and white, which, in the winter, might have been interesting, but, in the summer, were uncomfortably warm. I had set the air conditioner to full blast before we went to sleep, but, sometime overnight, the power failed. Hours later, as we lay in bed, the vents blew warm air, and as the sun crested the horizon, the warm air became unbearable. Unable to sleep, we showered and dressed and lazed about the room. The lights flickered on and off every once in awhile. So, too, did the air conditioner. Teresa wiped her brow and told me to check the thermostat. I didn’t have to. “Rolling brownouts, get used to it,” I said. Rolling brownouts are common in Egypt, and you can predict their frequency with a simple formula: the further you are from the presidential palace, the more likely you are to suffer a brownout. So the hotel, like many public facilities – including hospitals and police stations – had a generator to cope with the loss of power, and like most generators, the hotel’s was strong enough to operate the lights, but little else. Over the next few days, whenever we heard the clunk, spit, sputter, clunk, clunk, pfffft, we knew what to expect, and we avoided the elevators whenever possible.",

Messengers had arrived in the Mongol camp with the news that five thousand miles away in Karakorum, Ogodai, the successor of Jenghiz Khan, had died; and all at once, on the marches of Siberia and beyond the Great Wall, in the ruined kingdoms of the Caliphate, among the wreckage of Cracow and Sandomir and the Moravian pine forests and the smoking Magyar cities, a scattering of savage princes turned their slant-eyed boyish faces towards Chinese Tartary; the race for the succession was about to start; and by the middle of March, they had all vanished. Béla, returning from an island refuge in Dalmatia, found his kingdom in ruins. Death and capture had halved the population and the survivors were cautiously beginning to emerge from the woods. His task resembled the founding of a new kingdom, and the first step was to make it secure against the Mongols. Hence the castle that I was striding through at Visegrád. Up went this tremendous stronghold and many others followed; and the next time the Mongols invaded, they were repulsed.",

In a corner two giggling young women were drinking ersatz orange juice, the sort that stains your teeth for a week. I ordered two Tuskers; the young Luo seemed to need a drink. His name was Isaah and he claimed to have a BA in ‘History, Comparative Religion and Eng. Lit.’ He couldn’t have passed an O Level examination in any of these subjects yet he wanted – longed – to do a postgraduate course in Britain. Listening to him I felt a sort of despair, tinged with that guilt which, like the dust, gets into all one’s African reactions. Isaah was not stupid but had been messed up by an educational system that was irrelevant, inadequate, confusing and ultimately deeply frustrating. When I had explained, as gently as possible, that a postgraduate course in Britain could not possibly be organised, by anyone, he looked at me with a mixture of grief and resentment.",

He would kiss and perhaps bite her tender shoulder haunch, and smell the pungent but not unpleasant odor, already slightly moist with passion. And this odor of an erotic female would have neither the rank stench of a coarse-bodied woman, nor some impossible and inhuman bouquet, disgusting to a healthy taste. It would be delicately vulgar: the odor of a healthy woman and a fine lady, who has not only been housed, clothed, fed, and attended with the simple best, but has been derived from ancestral loins similarly nourished, so that now the marrow of her bones, the substance of her flesh, the quality of her blood, the perspiration of her skin, the liquor of her tongue, the moulding of her limbs—all the delicate joinings and bindings of ligament and muscle, and the cementing jellies, the whole incorporate loveliness of her body—were of rarer, subtler, and more golden stuff than would be found elsewhere the world over.",

We steered off the duckboard trail early, and pushed our bikes along the beach in an attempt to foil the law enforcement welcoming party we felt sure would be waiting for us in town. Back at the guest house, we stashed the borrowed bikes under a tarpaulin at the back of a garage, and hoped no one had noticed they'd been removed.",

It seemed only a matter of time before flesh and bone came into the equation. We decided to repair to the rooftop restaurant on the seventh floor in search of a more serene and composed environment. The restaurant was a large room with big windows giving expansive views over Darwin by twilight. Of the perhaps fifty tables in the room no more than three or four were occupied, so it came as a surprise when the hostess informed us, with a look of stark panic, that no tables were available at the moment.",

Vance had never been in a house so big and splendid, never even imagined one. From the room of the tapestries they passed to another, all in dark wood, with pictures on the panels, and great gilt standards bearing lights; and finally came to a small circular apartment where there were forced flowers in porcelain bowls, more pictures, books, and low wide armchairs covered with dove-coloured silk. Vance gazed at it all, enchanted. “Do you live here all alone?” he asked.",

    "target_paragraph": "Mr Msilana introduced himself, with a twinkle, as ‘a retired collaborator’. He had been a minor civil servant – very minor, of course. Demographic pressures, he explained, had compelled Pretoria to employ thousands of blacks; without them the Republic’s gigantic, unwieldy bureaucracy could not possibly have functioned. The notion of blacks helping to run the apartheid state – in effect, making it possible – always discomfited anti-apartheid campaigners far away in the West. They didn’t want to hear about all the Mr Msilanas who felt they had no choice but to do the best they could for themselves and their families within the apartheid structure. Most of the millions who consistently defied it, deviously and in desperation, were bottom-of-the-pilers who had to be defiant to survive. Now, among the Young Lions, it is cool to despise the docile oldies. The post-Soweto generation has grown up in an atmosphere of revolution, change, hope. They were ready to risk – and thousands endured – detention, torture and death. They cannot remember how it was under Verwoerd and Vorster, when the apparently immutable status quo made Mr Msilana and his educated ilk grateful for even the most minor post.",

As Pablo Escobar unleashed his war against the state, random violence terrorized her city, laying waste to her teenage years. Bombs were a constant: in her neighborhood, near her school, in restaurants and bars, in the lobby of the Intercontinental Hotel just two blocks away from her home, a blast that blew in the front door and shattered the windows of her house. Only by a fluke of good fortune, a touch of pure serendipity, had her parents one night escaped death. Heading out for a simple dinner, they were about to back into a parking place in front of the restaurant when an aggressive driver behind them stole the slot. They drove on and parked up the street. By chance, as they strolled back to the restaurant, they ran into some friends and joined them for a quick drink. As they were getting ready to move on to dinner, the entire city block was rocked by a massive explosion that completely destroyed the restaurant they had originally chosen, leaving its outdoor tables mere splinters of metal and wood, reducing cars along the street to twisted and burning wreckage.",

The party brought along nearly enough arms to do so: “two Winchester rifles, a Mauser, and two Winchester repeating shotguns, beside three revolvers and a sufficient supply of ammunition.”",

Then, an hour later, I saw to my relief that Jock was being loaded, and at 9.45 he was led out of the compound by a little boy and I was escorted by my host, and two other greybeards, on to the path for the Semiens. A short, steep climb brought us to a narrow, level ridge – with profound chasms on either side – that led to an extraordinary square mountain immediately ahead. At the foot of this obstacle, hardly two miles from the compound, we stopped suddenly, and everyone sat beneath a tree in a pleasantly cool breeze, and a lengthy discussion took place between the grey-beards. Meanwhile nine other men, including a fourth grey-beard with a rifle, were converging upon the tree from various unlikely directions; and when all had assembled the momentous chit was passed from hand to hand and looked at every way up and feelingly discussed – the only snag was that nobody could actually read it. Then a tall, handsome young man emerged from the depths of the eastern gorge. His alert manner distinguished him from the average peasant and he could read, if slowly and unsurely, so he declaimed the contents of the chit to the assembly. Another vigorous and verbose debate followed, after which my host eloquently dictated his own chit to the young man – who used the faranj’s pen and paper, watched by an assembly now awed to breathlessness. (As I should know, few things fascinate these highlanders as much as the act of writing.)",
