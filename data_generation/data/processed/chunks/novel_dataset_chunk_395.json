But it was mere aimless wandering; he had written nothing, collected nothing, brought nothing for science out of the twilight of the forests, which seemed to cling to his battered personality limping about Sulaco, where it had drifted in casually, only to get stranded on the shores of the sea.",

Our chicken arrived next. Its flesh was burned to a perfect crisp. The charred skin flaked off to reveal moist, tender meat. Finally, the host delivered a plate of fresh pita. It was steaming hot and fat and round like a football. The chicken was far too spicy for either of us, but it was also so good that we ate most of it anyway. We raised our drinks and toasted the host and the cooks. A stray cat curled up on the ground under my chair. It had no interest in the chicken, it just wanted a friend.

To digress slightly, I once read an account of life in Tibet before it was invaded by China, when Tibetan culture still flourished. One day, the author met a group of Tibet’s high-ranking statesmen traveling in a convoy across the steppe. They were a blaze of color: even the horses were draped in gorgeous silk and handwoven blankets. The statesmen wore garments of yellow brocade on which blue dragons, purple clouds and green waves danced wildly, and in their hair they wore beads of turquoise and coral.",

Bomb damage was everywhere, the harbour was full of sunken ships, everything was dingy and unpainted. Only 150 cars were left in the entire colony, and the 17,000 telephones of 1939 were reduced to 10,000. There was no time for reproach, as Government and business community alike, British and Chinese, civilians and military, set about repairing the damage. Admiral Harcourt himself had defined his task, when his ships swept into harbour that day, as being to return to Hong Kong ‘freedom, food, law and order and a stable currency’. So successfully was the job done, and so quickly was confidence in the colony restored, that by the end of 1945 the population was back to 1.6 million – just what it had been at the beginning of 1941 – and Sir Robert and Lady Ho Tung were able to celebrate their Diamond Jubilee quite in the old style, in the presence of His Excellency at the Hong Kong Hotel.",

Still, they are interesting, and they are important, because they are the bridge by which Charlotte Brontë passed into her own dominion. She took Wordsworth with his Poems and Ballads for her guide, and he misled her and delayed her on her way, and kept her a long time standing on her bridge. For in her novels, and her novels only, Charlotte was a poet. In her poems she is a novelist, striving and struggling for expression in a cramped form, an imperfect and improper medium. But most indubitably a novelist. Nearly all her poems which are not artificial are impersonal. They deal with \"situations\", with \"psychological problems\", that cry aloud for prose. There is the \"Wife\" who seems to have lived a long, adventurous life with \"William\" through many poems; there is the deserted wife and mother in \"Mementos\"; there is \"Frances\", the deserted maiden; there is \"Gilbert\" with his guilty secret and his suicide, a triple domestic tragedy in the three acts of a three-part ballad; there is the lady in \"Preference\", who prefers her husband to her passionate and profoundly deluded lover; there is the woman in \"Apostasy\", wrecked in the conflict between love and priestcraft; and there is little else beside. These poems are straws, showing the way of the wind that bloweth where it listeth.",

On the surface of the spring the sky lay reflected, stippled over with windless beech leaves. Hub squatted leanly with his brown forearms clasped about his knees, smoking a cigarette beneath the tilt of his hat. Suratt was across the spring from him.

Gazelle and deer antlers spiralled out from the walls like giant coat hooks, between an arsenal of swords, daggers and axes fixed to the wallpaper, which, over time, had absorbed moisture from the walls and begun to ripple and crease like used wrapping paper. Gold silk cushions shone like caramel on matching sofas and the smell of old velvet and mahogany hung in the air. Upstairs, the bedsteads gleamed, inkwells sat on desks and lace-edged duvets were tucked into place. At the back of the house was a library available for guests. I was in awe of the Kanwar’s home. It looked frozen in time and I was scared to tread my Adidas across his carpets. I knelt down to examine the cases of books that the Kanwar had numbered by hand, including A History of Amersham, while he rubbed a bridge table with his arm until it shone. He glanced up.",

Tuscan food of this season calls for massive appetites. For us, long walks build us up to the hefty dishes that we order in trattorie: pasta with wild boar ragù, lepre, hare, fried mushrooms, and polenta. The rich smells drifting from our kitchen are different in winter. The light summer fragrances of basil, lemon balm, and tomatoes are replaced by aromas of succulent pork roast glazed with honey, guinea hens roasting under a layer of pancetta, and ribollita, that heartiest of soups. Subtle and earthy, the fine shavings of Umbrian truffle over a bowl of pasta prick the senses. At breakfast, the perfumed melons of summer are forgotten and we use leftover bread for slabs of French toast spread with plum jam I made last summer from the delicate coscia di monaca, nun’s thigh, variety that grows along the back of the house. The eggs always startle me; they’re so yellow. The freshness does make a tremendous difference, so that a platter of eggs scrambled with a big dollop of mascarpone becomes a very special treat.",

The minute you get out of the train station, you realize that you are in another country: drunks and homeless people stagger by, and young men are more likely to be wearing wide laborer pants and boots than the latest fashions from Tokyo’s trendy Harajuku area. You pass a street market where you can buy second-hand underwear or a single shoe. Janjan Yokocho is dark and dingy – you see the occasional rat scurrying across from one building to another – but it is crowded with people. They are coming to eat at the kushikatsu restaurants lining the street, which feature cheap meals of pork, chicken, onions and eggs, deep-fried on wooden skewers and washed down with plenty of beer and shochu (vodka made from rice). Interspersed among the kushikatsu restaurants are shogi halls, where people sit in pairs playing Japanese chess, watched through open latticed windows by knots of people gathered on the street outside.",

Both he and his wife had no fondness for Washington, particularly in the sapping mugginess of summer, which was why he was pleased to take such a long vacation in 1927. Nor was it as if he had a great program to see through. Whatever mark Calvin Coolidge was going to leave on the world was unlikely to be altered by another four years in office. Coolidge also seems to have enjoyed a certain prescience regarding the economy. “Poppa says there’s a depression coming,” Grace Coolidge remarked to an acquaintance soon after her husband announced his decision.",
