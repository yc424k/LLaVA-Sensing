At the entrance, an expressionless Chinese couple ushered me into the main banquet hall, and a friendly Syrian boy who could not speak Arabic led me to a table with a rose. The Syrian boy removed the rose, the Chinese couple closed the door so they could sing along with the Muzak, and I found myself alone in an elaborate chamber of red lanterns and mock T’ang dynasty paintings. From the kitchen, a dog barked plaintively.",

He would endure malaria and dysentery, torrid wetlands and the bitter cold of snow-swept mountains. In camp, he slept as did his soldiers: sometimes in a hammock, never in a bed, often on the hard ground or a bare floor, wrapped only in a cape, curled up like a dog. His one indulgence was personal hygiene. In an era when British laborers and lords took a bath once a month, if needed, Bolívar bathed every morning at dawn, and twice more during the day. Meticulous about cleanliness at the table, he carried his own silverware. Though a notorious womanizer, he rarely drank and never smoked; he was especially proud of his teeth, a complete set, perfectly aligned and brilliantly white, a rare achievement in a time of wooden dentures and toothless grins. He also had a passion for cologne, which his immediate entourage struggled to supply. His soldiers tolerated the cloying scent as the one flaw in their otherwise exemplary and truly exceptional commander.",

Avery, on the other hand, died in 1952, a quarter-century before MacKaye and when the trail was still little known. But it was really Avery’s trail. He mapped it out, bullied and cajoled clubs into producing volunteer crews, and personally superintended the construction of hundreds of miles of path. He extended its planned length from 1,200 miles to well over 2,000, and before it was finished he had walked every inch of it. In under seven years, using volunteer labor, he built a 2,000-mile trail through mountain wilderness. Armies have done less.",

It had more the character of disorderly conduct; disorderly without the human excuse of drunkenness, which at any rate implies good feeling and an amiable leaning towards festivity.

It recalled to him Miss Spear’s description of that temple to Apollo, somewhere in Greece, which had been built by the birds and bees; and looking at the burnished neck of the dove he thought: “That might have been one of the birds.” There was a good-natured-looking woman in the shop, and he ventured to ask her the price of the object he coveted. She smiled a little, as if surprised. “Why, that’s twenty-five dollars.” Vance crimsoned. “I was looking for something for thirty.”",

    "target_paragraph": "No sooner had the rioters reassembled with arms on January 2, than they were directed to the house of the Kurdish family. Sheikh Sayyid was a man of eighty-five, but he had the courage of his race. When he heard the mob storming at his doors, he took the ?uran in his hand and clothed in years and sanctity stepped out into the street, intending to take refuge in the serai. Its door was opposite his own, and the Vali from a window watched the scene. The rabble gave way before the venerable figure clasping the holy book, but before he could reach the serai, it closed in upon him, he was cut down and hacked to pieces. His house was then sacked and seventeen of his descendants were murdered. If the leaders of the reactionary party had wished to embarrass the government and to show up its weakness, they were more than commonly successful. During the six weeks that elapsed before the arrival of troops from Diyarbekr and elsewhere, Mo?ul was in a state of complete anarchy. Christians were openly insulted in the streets, the civil and military authorities were helpless, and no less helpless was the local committee of Union and Progress. When the troops came some degree of order was restored, but the reactionary movement was not arrested. The formation of the League of Mohammad, which was designed as a counterblast to the Committee of Union and Progress, went on apace. It appealed to Moslems of the old school, who had a genuine dread of the effects of the new spirit upon the observance of the laws of Islam; it appealed to the ignorant, to whom the conception of the equality of Christian and Moslem is incomprehensible, and it was eagerly welcomed by all who were opposed to constitutional government on grounds more or less personal to themselves. One great magnate went through the bazaars collecting the signatures of adherents to the Mu?ammadiyeh, and for a time the situation was exceedingly critical. It was however significant that the Na?ib of Mo?ul, the leading doctor of Islam, steadily refused to sign the papers or to have anything to do with the League. Meanwhile a new and capable Vali had been appointed to the province, but he had gone straight to Kerkuk, where matters were in a still more parlous state, and lawlessness walked abroad unchecked in the streets of Mo?ul. At length the Vali realized the dangers that threatened the province through its capital, and being a man of action he travelled post haste to Mo?ul, and set about the restoration of order. He arrested and imprisoned a number of persons and administered severe rebukes to the leading Moslems, together with assurances that the government would protect the rights of the Christians. These warnings were repeated in strong language the day after the accession of Mu?ammad Reshad when the first rumours of a massacre of Armenians at Adana reached the bazaars.",

She examined it as well as she could. The liquid was of a brownish hue, and bore a label with an inscription in Italian. He had probably got it in his wanderings abroad. She knew but little Italian, but could understand that the cordial was a febrifuge* of some sort. Her father, her mother, and all the household were anxious for her recovery, and she resolved to obey her husband’s directions. Whatever the risk, if any, she was prepared to run it. A glass of water was brought and the drops dropped in.",

As though in a kind of self-preservation, her mind had turned to quite simple people, humble people sprung from the soil, from the same kind soil that had nurtured Morton. None of her own strange emotions had touched them, and yet they were part of her own emotions; a part of her longing for simplicity and peace, a part of her curious craving for the normal. And although at this time Stephen did not know it, their happiness sprung from her moments of joy; their sorrows from the sorrow she had known and still knew; their frustrations from her own bitter emptiness; their fulfilments from her longing to be fulfilled. These people had drawn life and strength from their creator. Like infants they had sucked at her breasts of inspiration, and drawn from them blood, waxing wonderfully strong; demanding, compelling thereby recognition. For surely thus only are fine books written, they must somehow partake of the miracle of blood—the strange and terrible miracle of blood, the giver of life, the purifier, the great final expiation.",

Just as an important part of exploring Brazil is to visit its shantytowns, it is an important part of understanding the French culture to eat at a gourmet restaurant in Paris. It is not necessary that the traveler experiences the expensive side of Paris, but he should not reject it because it is outside his own familiar world, or because of the cost. He should account for it in his budget, and plan to attend at least one such event to get a glimpse into a whole new world of Parisian life that is not immediately visible and cannot be experienced in any other way. Similarly, the traveler must not shrink back from those parts of a culture that make him feel uneasy. He must not avoid geographical regions because they seem too cold or too hot, or shy away from cramped minibuses because they are uncomfortable. [Chickens]",

    "target_paragraph": "Mrs Ambrose looked and listened obediently enough, but inwardly she was a prey to an uneasy mood not readily to be ascribed to any one cause. Looking on shore as Mr Flushing bade her, she thought the country very beautiful, but also sultry and alarming. She did not like to feel herself the victim of unclassified emotions, and certainly as the launch slipped on and on, in the hot morning sun, she felt herself unreasonably moved. Whether the unfamiliarity of the forest was the cause of it, or something less definite, she could not determine. Her mind left the scene and occupied itself with anxieties for Ridley, for her children, for far-off things, such as old age and poverty and death. Hirst, too, was depressed. He had been looking forward to this expedition as to a holiday, for, once away from the hotel, surely wonderful things would happen, instead of which nothing happened, and here they were as uncomfortable, as restrained, as self-conscious as ever. That, of course, was what came of looking forward to anything; one was always disappointed. He blamed Wilfrid Flushing, who was so well dressed and so formal; he blamed Hewet and Rachel. Why didn’t they talk? He looked at them sitting silent and self-absorbed, and the sight annoyed him. He supposed that they were engaged, or about to become engaged, but instead of being in the least romantic or exciting, that was as dull as everything else; it annoyed him, too, to think that they were in love. He drew close to Helen and began to tell her how uncomfortable his night had been, lying on the deck, sometimes too hot, sometimes too cold, and the stars so bright that he couldn’t get to sleep. He had lain awake all night thinking, and when it was light enough to see, he had written twenty lines of his poem on God, and the awful thing was that he’d practically proved the fact that God did exist. He did not see that he was teasing her, and he went on to wonder what would happen if God did exist—‘an old gentleman in a beard and a long blue dressing-gown, extremely testy and disagreeable as he’s bound to be? Can you suggest a rhyme? God, rod, sod—all used; any others?’",

The architecture of saltmarshes, and the mudflats into which they dwindle, is formidably complex: a maze of rays, wriggling channels, creeks, fleets, gutways and swatchways, all of which are kept clear by the sluicing action of the tide.",

There are no steam cracks or signs of heat anywhere. Superb caves or lava-bubbles abound at a height of 6000 feet. These are moist with ferns, and the drip from their roofs is the water supply of this porous region.",

I’ll have to pay, too, you know, for the rest of my life. Doesn’t that matter to you?”\n\n“I’m not going to get killed,” I answered. “Don’t be melodramatic.”",

There is no need to be particularly explicit about this; sexuality is general in Rome. These huge cold monoliths, stolen from Egypt, are affirmation and definition, the complement of water, and as Rome was as it has remained the least feminine of cities, the thefts, of an extraordinary number of the things and undertaken at fearful cost, were to satisfy a real necessity. They were its other most necessary image, and it seems an appropriate rumor that the largest of them all is still buried in the neighborhood of the Pantheon, as though the city were still keeping its most spectacular energies secretly in reserve. Most of the others are combined in some way with water, and take from that element of memory their vivid strength.—Of course in Egypt there might have been a different logic of feeling altogether.",

It takes knouse to build the stack and many of them are quite artistic. Or, you can toss the sedge from a finished section back into the bog to make room for the next successive cut.

We sat chatting, watching the iridescent blue and orange glow of late evening. I was exhausted after the day’s routine. Kurt had kept me trotting at a brisk scurry from feed shed to camel to yard and back again. I had weeded a garden, trimmed a mile of couch-infested curbing with a pair of scissors, had led countless objectionable tourists around the oval on camel-back and had cleaned, mopped, scraped and lifted until I thought I would collapse. The pace had not slackened for a minute and all the while Kurt had been scrutinizing me and my work, alternately muttering that I might turn out all right and screaming abuse at me, in front of bewildered and embarrassed tourists. While I was working I was too preoccupied to think whether I would be able to stand such treatment for eight months, but as I talked to my young friend all the anger that I felt towards the man was bubbling away deep down inside. Arrogant prick, I thought. Miserable, tight, obsessional, whingeing little creep. I hated myself for my infernal cowardice in dealing with people. It is such a female syndrome, so much the weakness of animals who have always been prey. I had not been aggressive enough or stood up to him enough. And now this impotent, internal, angry stuttering. Suddenly, Kurt appeared around the corner – an apparition in white taking giant strides. I could feel his fury before he reached us and stood up to face him. He pointed a shaking finger at my friend and hissed through clenched teeth:",

Our main guide was an expert tracker called Kerry Glen, a British lady who grew up in Kenya and who walked on the trail carrying a rifle on her shoulders. Her signature outfit, a khaki safari skirt that arrived at the knee, was the envy of all the ladies on the trek. Kerry knew the area like the back of the hand and was the founder of the company that organizes these walking safaris.",

Walking wasn’t an option: the sun-struck, car-spaced sprawl of modern Florida is as inhospitable to foot traffic as the state’s swamps had been to the Spanish. Development hadn’t been kind to Florida’s history, either. At Bradenton’s museum, I learned that most of the mounds and shell middens that once marked Indian settlements had been bulldozed for use as road fill.",

Lowering my head I chant, “Food, I have food.” Shrinkage of the codline around the cutting board has warped a trough into it. I wedge the trigger under the line in the trough and try to strike it unconscious with my flare gun. It’s like clubbing concrete. Powerful thrusts with my knife finally penetrate the trigger’s armored skin. Its eyes flash, its fins frantically wave about, its throat cracks, and finally it is dead. My eyes fill with tears. I weep for my fish, for me, for the state of my desperation. Then I feed on its bitter meat.",

One cold January day, she had flown to the tiny community of Pelee Island to conduct the twice-monthly church service. The short flight from the mainland had been a white-knuckle one but had managed to reach Pelee without incident. As the plane unloaded its cargo and prepared for the return flight to the mainland, Georgina stood on the tarmac chatting with several men who had spent a few days hunting pheasant and were about to fly back with their catch. When the plane was ready to go, the hunters waved good-bye to Georgina and boarded. It had no sooner lifted off the runway when something happened that caused the plane to careen back to Earth, plunging through the thick layer of ice coating Lake Erie. It took two weeks for divers to recover the bodies. The incident so traumatized Georgina that it shook her faith, and she stepped away from the priesthood. She was not certain she had the courage to face daily life, let alone the Camino. But she decided to come anyway and hoped the journey would aid her healing.",

Arundhati Roy had beckoned me to Kerala, Suketu Mehta to Mumbai and Kiran Desai was soon to entice me to Darjeeling.

Almost everything else is either too light and big or too dark and small, and all of it pours into the hemmed-in outdoors, as in a hopeless cross between claustrophobia and agoraphobia, so that the whole place comes to have the feeling there is in the communal guests’ latrine, of an endless roiling togetherness. It is the normal Roman business of building around a court or atrium, and the proportions are the proper ones for a gregarious balcony civilization, in which the dark airless retreat is good enough for what little privacy is needed. But there is a snake in the case this time, that leads you on through space after hollow space once designated for every kind of social going-on imaginable.",
