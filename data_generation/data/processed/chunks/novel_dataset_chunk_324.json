That was of course especially true of books about Siberia, a region used by the Soviets as a penal colony screened off from the world. Even relatively lighthearted books—I Wonder as I Wander, by the American poet Langston Hughes, about his round-the-world ramblings in the early thirties—take on a queasy air because of what we know was happening offstage. At least Hughes had a sense of humor and was no ideologue; foreign travelers (and Russians as well) writing in moods of political rapture, real or feigned, produced books about Siberia that are embarrassing to look at today.",

There are three different sized sound stages, for all the various musical and dance events. There are roadies who loiter, leer, and wear black T-shirts. There are all kinds of cheap plastic souvenirs for sale, even joke dog turds. It’s a proper carnival.",

Its interior décor, restrained and adult, is by the eminent theatrical designer Don Ashton; a running motif, appearing throughout the hotel, is the Seal of the Grand Secretary, mandarin of mandarins in the old Chinese Empire. Everything is just sufficiently orientalized to make you feel you might be sleeping in the guest quarters of one of the more traditional Anglo-Chinese hongs – a contemporary version perhaps of Jardine’s old No. 1 House. For many years a soignée White Russian widow lived in the hotel (you could recognize her room from the outside by its profusion of potted plants), and moved about the building not like a customer at all, but absolutely like a friend of the taipan.",

They felt the grass flicking wet against their stockings, and the invisible flowers were everywhere. Then up again through trees, along a zigzag path with the smell all the way of the flowers they could not see. The warm rain was bringing out all the sweetness.

I could barely hear him because my teeth were chattering so hard. John clambered atop a former usnu. I turned to look at the ground we’d covered that day. Far off in the distance we could see a row of snowy peaks, which turned out to be the Pumasillo Range. I could scarcely believe that this was the backside of one of the mountains that I’d seen from the top of the ruins at Choquequirao.",

The flat seemed thick with love. One waded. He caught himself putting up his hand to unbutton his collar. Perhaps the stuffy weather had something to do with it. July was getting near its end, and there was no air at all in Hertford Street. London was a rotten place in July. He always walked to his office and back so as to get what exercise he could, and every Saturday they went down to his uncle for golf; but what was that? He ached to be properly stretched, to stride about, to hit things for days on end, and his talk became almost exclusively of holidays, and where they should go in August when his were due.",

I slogged on, the sky still bright, smoke drifting lazily out of the silent volcano (signboards at intervals along the road welcomed tourists to ‘the Fire Country’), and followed a wooded path round the rim of the crater until I reached the point where Highway 57 broke through the towering caldera wall and rushed off down its western slope toward the city of Kumamoto, some forty kilometers further on. All afternoon tourist-filled buses passed me on the highway with their uniformed guides chirping mechanically into microphones, and between the buses, taxis ferried gray-faced company presidents into the crater, grimly bent on enjoying themselves in the spas that the autumn had wasted. A beautiful white dog came limping along with blood trickling out of its hind legs, yelping whenever a taxi passed and cringing at each bus.",

This event was pure Waugh and sublimely funny: the reason for its being a cause of concealed and supercilious white giggles was that today the blacks were putting on a show copied from the whites, and when they copy they are absurd. (Since 8 a.m. the chiefs and retainers had been waiting, immobile, on the road to the airport.) At the airport, always under this sun, in the burning dry still air, the Jeunesse Camerounaise was lined up in ranks. Boys and girls, dressed in a uniform of orange and green calico, printed with the Cameroun flag and the portrait of President Ahidjo; their clothes were the first treat, and to see them being serried, “scoots, clin in taught, word and did,” was hilarious. The tarmac of the airfield looked as if it would bubble and boil any minute. Important chiefs sat under black cotton umbrellas, near the airport building; masses of the superior gentry stood in the sun between the Jeunesse Camerounaise and the chiefs; there were some uniformed soldiers, a guard of honour. The whites of the town were all present, wearing jackets and ties; ladies also nattily gotten up in hats and gloves. The bar did a roaring business in anything wet and cold.",

He’d hold my hand when we walked down the street. When he was in junior high and I was still in grade school, he got out earlier than me, but he’d hang out at his friend Brian Paskowitz’s house so we could walk home together.”",

Here were stern mountains, nearby on my right, contrasting with the bland Mekong plain on my left. I had hoped to reach Lao Pako by sunset (Marie and I were to meet there) but after sixty-five miles the afternoon sun defeated me. Instead I spent the night in a friendly little riverside ban a few miles off Route 13 where the primary school teacher eagerly offered hospitality – then gathered his forty-three pupils for an impromptu English lesson.",

I walked far out onto the broad and leafy avenues and narrower side streets to the north of the downtown, all of them lined with six-storey apartment buildings, stern and stolid and yet oddly homy, and at least three-quarters of the windows were darkened.

Then she managed to remove his boots, and, as he could now keep himself upright by leaning upon her on one side and a walking-stick on the other, they went thus in slow march out of the room and up the stairs. At the top she took him along a gallery, pausing whenever he required rest, and thence up a smaller staircase to the least used part of the house, where she unlocked a door. Within was a lumber-room, containing abandoned furniture of all descriptions, built up in piles which obscured the light of the windows, and formed between them nooks and lairs in which a person would not be discerned even should an eye gaze in at the door. The articles were mainly those that had belonged to the previous owner of the house, and had been bought in by the late Mr. Charmond at the auction; but changing fashion, and the tastes of a young wife, had caused them to be relegated to this dungeon.",

Here was something aesthetically abhorrent, in such a setting, yet at that moment part of me was quite pleased to see it; the ‘romance’ of fording rivers with a bicycle tends to wane after the fifth immersion of the day. Did the bridge lead back to Route 6? I hoped not. In fact my track went nowhere near and the final steep climb to a biggish ban on a ridge-top felt longer than it was; I had been in action for eleven hours.",
