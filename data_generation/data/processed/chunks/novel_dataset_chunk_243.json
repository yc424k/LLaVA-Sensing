And then rubbing our cold hands walked slowly back to the car to feel the first thin rays of the sun upon us, by whose light we finished the last of our wine and biscuits while Panos expounded the meaning of Aphrodite’s legend which he believed had been misinterpreted by the historians. She was a symbol, he said dryly, not of licence and sensuousness, but of the dual nature of man – the proposition which lay at the heart of the ancient religions from which she had been derived, and to which her legend itself was the most enduring and poetic of European illustrations. She belonged to a world of innocence outside the scope of the barren sensualities which are ascribed to her cult; she was an Indian.",

Instead of the previous day’s breeze, a strong wind tossed the trees, swaying their curtains of tangled lianas, and a few detached epiphytes lay on the road – grotesquely beautiful bundles. Occasional shafts of sunlight gilded patches of lichen, their sudden glow amidst the green shadows seeming almost artificial.

Anon came some yawning cleft or an assemblage of dizzy rock-needles, fused into whimsical tints and attitudes, spiky, distorted, over-toppling; then a bold tufa rampart, immaculate in its beauty, stainless as a curtain of silk. And as the boat moved on he looked into horrid dells which the rains had torn out of the loose scoriae. Gaping wounds, they wore the bright hues of corruption. Their flanks were blotched with a livid nitrous efflorescence, with flaring sulphur, unhealthy verdure of pitchstone, streaks of arsenical vermilion; their beds—a frantic maze of boulders.",

But even since yesterday the rains had wreaked havoc on the path above the paddy-fields, and somewhere amidst those minor landslides I took a wrong turning which eventually brought me to the village – after many bewildered wanderings in various directions – from below instead of above.",

The foothill canyon opened, but tall upheavals still confined the sky when I got to Tomeşti at nightfall, where I found another prearranged haven under the roof of Herr Robert v. Winckler; he was a tall, thin, scholarly man, living alone with his books and his guns on the steep edge of the forest. He and his library were a treasure-house of relevant knowledge, and the stairs, on the way to bed, were forested with horns, antlers, fowling-pieces and wolf-traps. There were the skins of two enormous wolves on the landing, a stuffed lynx on the wall, a row of boars’ tushes and a bear’s skin on my bedroom floor; and the last thing I remember before blowing out the candle is the double reflection of the wick in its glass eyes. The depth of the flared embrasures showed the thickness of the walls and the logs stacked to the ceiling beside the massive tiled stove told how cold it must have been in winter. It was hard, in the summer moonlight, to imagine the onslaught of the wind along the canyons, the icicle-portcullises and the silent obliterating flakes that would place all these buildings under siege.",

The air smelt of snow and lemon-blossom, and old Panos beside me huddled gratefully in the duffle coat I had loaned him, talked quietly and methodically of the vine which he was going to select for the balcony from a special vineyard near Kuklia. We had set off by night upon an impulse, taking with us some wine and biscuits to sustain us for the three hours’ drive; it would be perhaps the last chance Panos would get before the school term began again to visit the obscure holding which had once belonged to his grandfather, and where the famous vine of his choice still grew.",

Whatever its bleak and airy charms, Shetland would still be just another piece of Britain, with the same shops, the same television programs, the same people in the same Marks & Spencer cardigans. I didn’t find this depressing at all—rather the contrary—but I didn’t feel any pressing need to see it just now. It would still be there next time.",

But different in Memphis: himself and his guide stepping out into the street where the whole city lay supine now to take him into itself like embrace, like arms, the very meagre wad of bills in his pocket on fire too which he had wrung, wrested from between-crops labor at itinerant sawmills, or from the implacable rented ground by months behind a plow, his pittance of which he would have to fight his father each time to get his hands on a nickel of it. It was warm here too and almost empty and this time the policeman had jerked him awake before he had even known he was going to sleep. Though this one was not in uniform.

That’s not entirely true, undercurrents are always changing – the pace quickening since the second Intifada. You were on the West Bank during Cast Lead, you saw how that shifted global opinion – and internal Palestinian alliances. As did the Flotilla killings while settlement expansions got more aggressive by the day. It all adds up, making for international isolation. When Netanyahu whines about enemies trying to “delegitimise” Israel he sounds crazed. We’ve delegitimised ourselves time and again giving two fingers to UN Resolutions.

It flipped me very rapidly and then drove me so deep that I hit the bottom face first. Normally I would have had an arm in front of my face, but I was trying to be a missile, letting the wave propel me where it would. The face-plant in blackness was a shock, but the blow was to my forehead, and it wasn’t particularly fierce, and at least part of the shock was the realization that I was not in very deep water. I was possibly fairly close to shore. When I finally surfaced, the village lights were above me, and the roar of whitewater hitting the rocks was horribly/encouragingly close. I let the next wave hit me the same unnatural way. It drove me onto the rocks, then hauled me off. The downcoast current now had me in its grip. It carried me quickly down the point, very close to shore, bouncing me across the bigger rocks. Another wave came and threw me against the seawall just above the boat ramp. Trapped in a surge, I slid across the mossy surface of the ramp, unable to find a handhold, and spilled off the downcoast side into blackness. I could hear people yelling. They had seen me slide past. I could hear my board clonking hollowly—it was still attached to my ankle. Then the current, interrupted by the rock wall of the ramp, lost its hold on me as the shorebreak drained off the rocks. I got an arm around a rock, hung on, and felt the water, weakening, leave me. I turned and, from a sitting position, hauled in my board across the rocks. With it under my arm, I scampered up the lee wall of the boat ramp. And there was Peter, staggering up the same wet-moss incline with his board.",

The great pines still clinging to the inaccessible corners of this canyon are monuments to a ruined wilderness: very soon, the last of the trees that hold these mountainsides together will be gone. The flood carries eroded stone down from the glaciers, and the deep canyon it has carved across the ages, with its extraordinary layers of folded rock, is remarkably hot and dry, almost xerotic, by comparison to river canyons at this altitude on the far side of the Jang. We notice, too, that the clouds that come up every afternoon south of the Jang are missing here as we draw closer to the mountain deserts of the Tibetan Plateau, which is cut off from the monsoon rains by the rising of the Himalaya. Yet despite the heat, a cool breeze is flowing up the canyon, and the river path is pleasant. On rock tumulus I spy a goral, a neat small brown goat-antelope related to the chamois and the North American mountain goat; otherwise, a hoopoe and white butterflies are the only signs of life.",

Sorrow and bitterness in the sky, and floods of agonised tears beating against the panes. I lay awake last night, and I could hear the scrape of snails creeping up the window glass; it was so sad! My eyes were so heavy this morning that I could have wept my life away. I cannot bear you to see my face; I keep it away from you purposely. Oh why were we given hungry hearts and wild desires if we have to live in a world like this? Why should Death alone lend what Life is compelled to borrow—rest?* Answer that, Doctor Fitzpiers.”",

Once, a roe deer picked its way nervously into the middle of a field, until something startled it and it escaped in urgent, arched bounds. Hours later, as the air was hazing up, we returned to our holloway hide-out, dropping down by the old ash tree again into the near-darkness. We cleared nettles and briars, moved loose trunks to make seats, and then Roger built a fire to cook supper on - a pyramid of small sticks, with a hot centre of tinder, that produced an intense and almost smokeless fire. We ate a spicy tagine that Roger had made in advance and carried up with him. Firelight flickered off the walls of the holloway and on the hedge canopy above us, and set complicated shadows moving in the leaves. As we sat there in the thickening dark, talking, the day seemed to convene itself around the furnace-point of the flames.",

They were not drunk now. They didn’t even have time to be sick. ‘Christ yes,’ the voice said. They got up, staggering for balance, shaking and trembling, and stumbled through the door and huddled, blinking against the fierce glare until they could bear it. Except that it was electricity; it was still last night (or perhaps tomorrow night, for all they knew or for the moment cared even): two searchlights such as anti aircraft batteries had used against night-flying aeroplanes during the war, trained on the carriage and in the glare of which men on ladders were nailing long strips of black and funereal bunting along the eaves of the carriage: to whom—which—they paid no attention.

The house had gone to sleep long before and there was no sound anywhere: it was late in winter, along in March, and the ice and snow had been packed and frozen on the earth for months with a kind of weary permanence – with a tenacity that gave to winter a harsh and dreary reality, a protraction of grey days and grim grey light which made the memory of other seasons, and particularly the hope of spring, remote and almost unbelievable. The street outside was frozen in this living and animate silence of great cold: suddenly this still perfection of night and darkness was shattered by the engines of a powerful motor which turned into the end of the street from Massachusetts Avenue, and tore along before the house at drunken speed with a roaring explosion of sound. Then, without slackening its speed, the brakes were jammed on, the car skidded murderously to a halt on the slippery pavement, and immediately backed up at full speed until it came before the house again, skidded to a halt and was abruptly silent.",

A flawless spine sends out side branches and those again break off into little veins. The flat young leaf blown sideways, insists on inference. Its underside is like the rose leaves that Helforth and Kora exclaimed over, in the smoke-amethyst rose-bowl Kora brought from her room last night, to place on their dining table.

The police claim they had to open fire because the mob was petrol-bombing the station. They shot four people dead. Five were critically wounded, 245 suffered lesser injuries including a BBC soundman, Lee Edwards, who was peppered with bird-shot and is now in hospital. According to him, the shooting took place after the ANC marshals had called for restraint and the marchers were dispersing. But obviously some Young Lions had planned an attack; people don’t carry petrol bombs around like handkerchiefs, just in case they might come in handy.",

There is always deep below it, even when we arrive punctually at the appointed time with our white waistcoats and polite formalities, a rushing stream of broken dreams, nursery rhymes, street cries, half-finished sentences and sights—elm trees, willow trees, gardeners sweeping, women writing—that rise and sink even as we hand a lady down to dinner. While one straightens the fork so precisely on the table-cloth, a thousand faces mop and mow. There is nothing one can fish up in a spoon; nothing one can call an event. Yet it is alive too and deep, this stream. Immersed in it I would stop between one mouthful and the next, and look intently at a vase, perhaps with one red flower, while a reason struck me, a sudden revelation. Or I would say, walking along the Strand, “That’s the phrase I want”, as some beautiful, fabulous phantom bird, fish or cloud with fiery edges swam up to enclose once and for all some notion haunting me, after which on I trotted taking stock with renewed delight of ties and things in shop-windows.",

For often Sir William would travel sixty miles or more down into the country to visit the rich, the afflicted, who could afford the very large fee which Sir William very properly charged for his advice. Her ladyship waited with the rugs about her knees an hour or more, leaning back, thinking sometimes of the patient, sometimes, excusably, of the wall of gold, mounting minute by minute while she waited; the wall of gold that was mounting between them and all shifts and anxieties (she had borne them bravely; they had had their struggles), until she felt wedged on a calm ocean, where only spice winds blow; respected, admired, envied, with scarcely anything left to wish for, though she regretted her stoutness; large dinner-parties every Thursday night to the profession; an occasional bazaar to be opened; Royalty greeted; too little time, alas, with her husband, whose work grew and grew; a boy doing well at Eton;* she would have liked a daughter too; interests she had, however, in plenty; child welfare; the after-care of the epileptic, and photography, so that if there was a church building, or a church decaying, she bribed the sexton, got the key and took photographs, which were scarcely to be distinguished from the work of professionals, while she waited.",

Grumbling, I follow Jane along the waterfront to her destination as she fills me in. Eric Morecambe was born John Eric Bartholomew but adopted the surname of his home town. He then went on to be a famous comedian, so much so that the Queen unveiled this statue. It is early hours but already admirers are gathered to have their picture taken with this fanciful artwork. I refuse to wait in the queue. Jane manages a photo with Eric. Her level of delight is such that I feel like the cantankerous Grinch I am. The ominous weather isn’t helping my mood, either, since Jane has announced that her rain gear is the equivalent of a dry cleaning bag.",

It’s about a fifteen-minute walk from the train station in the rain, don’t even worry about it, just go. You need to get there fairly early in the day because sometimes they run out of dough, which will break your heart. By 1:00 PM, the streets outside the pizzeria have become jammed with Neapolitans trying to get into the place, shoving for access like they’re trying to get space on a lifeboat. There’s not a menu. They have only two varieties of pizza here—regular and extra cheese. None of this new age southern California olives-and-sun-dried-tomato wannabe pizza twaddle. The dough, it takes me half my meal to figure out, tastes more like Indian nan than like any pizza dough I ever tried. It’s soft and chewy and yielding, but incredibly thin. I always thought we only had two choices in our lives when it came to pizza crust—thin and crispy, or thick and doughy. How was I to have known there could be a crust in this world that was thin and doughy? Holy of holies! Thin, doughy, strong, gummy, yummy, chewy, salty pizza paradise. On top, there is a sweet tomato sauce that foams up all bubbly and creamy when it melts the fresh buffalo mozzarella, and the one sprig of basil in the middle of the whole deal somehow infuses the entire pizza with herbal radiance, much the same way one shimmering movie star in the middle of a party brings a contact high of glamour to everyone around her. It’s technically impossible to eat this thing, of course. You try to take a bite off your slice and the gummy crust folds, and the hot cheese runs away like topsoil in a landslide, makes a mess of you and your surroundings, but just deal with it.",

Paint, varnish and brass railings gave an air of opulence to the outer precincts, and the inner room, with its mahogany bookcases containing morocco-bound “sets” and its wide blue leather armchairs, lacked only a palm or two to resemble the lounge of a fashionable hotel. Moffatt himself, as he came forward, gave Ralph the impression of having been done over by the same hand: he was smoother, broader, more supremely tailored, and his whole person exhaled the faintest whiff of an expensive scent.",

But when the road began to climb above deep gorges, like a ribbon unfurling, the blossoms disappeared. Black fir trees hung over the road, barely attached to cliffs so high their tops couldn’t be seen. Top-heavy lorries caterpillared ahead, with a sheer drop to one side. The tarmac was eroded by fresh snow melts and piled with forest debris, but accidents were surprisingly rare. Drivers knew that no one would come looking for you if you came off the road. You would biodegrade at the bottom of the gorge and vultures would pick your bones clean, so you clung to the tarmac for dear life.",

He did not need to look far. Glassy-eyed vendors patrolled the length and breadth of Freak Street, walking in circles, talking in circles, muttering a steady litany: “Buy hashish. Buy hash. Buy hashish!” One dazed fellow sat in a dusty doorway intoning a steady monklike chant: “Hash. Hashish. Change dollars. Traveler’s checks.” Another entrepreneur, hands thrust into his pockets against the winter chill, fast-talked his way through his own unorthodox rosary: “Brown sugar, white sugar, coke, smack, or dope.”",

It was too hot to talk, and it was not easy to find any book that would withstand the power of the sun.

Up the Gorge towards Skardu cloud still hung about the tangled summits and as we set off to find the village of Ronda the mountain-side was crisp with a thin layer of frozen snow, while the swift stream beside our path was invisible – though audible – beneath a lid of ice. We went slowly, for Rachel is having altitude trouble. ‘I feel panted!’ she exclaimed graphically and plaintively as her mamma bounded along, feeling as always more energetic at 8,000 feet than at sea-level.

Then he darted straight up the steep rock face above the shrine, Dr Jaffery and myself following as best we could. We reached the top just in time to see the dervish dive down into a narrow crevice. I went over to where he had been standing. A flight of steps cut into the rock led downwards. At the bottom was the mouth of a cave.

It signifies the readiness to act or react in an unplanned, impulsive manner to the new discoveries of the journey: We may be exploring a Tarahumara Indian village in Mexico, under the sweltering sun. To cool off, we buy an ice cream and we realize that a few locals sitting nearby are lustfully staring at our ice cream, which they cannot themselves afford. With an impromptu gesture, we decide to buy them some ice cream so that we can all enjoy it together. [No Thanks, But Thanks] We may be visiting the Sri Ramana Maharshi ashram in Arunachala, India, a day before the monthly Giri Pradakshina festival, in which case we spontaneously decide to join the pilgrims and circumambulate the nearby Arunachala hill in the heat of the day, becoming Hindu pilgrims ourselves, if only for a day. We may be in Ternate, Indonesia, during the month of Ramadan when, early one morning, we are awoken by deafening music. Upon inquiring, we discover a centuries-old tradition: High school and university students move from one neighborhood to another in trucks carrying huge loudspeakers and singing religious songs to wake up the faithful for the early morning prayer. What would be more natural than to… climb on the truck and join the team in order to experience the living tradition and have a unique interaction with Muslim youth!",

The pigeon rose. I jumped up and ran after the words that trailed like the dangling string from an air ball, up and up, from branch to branch escaping. Then like a cracked bowl the fixity of my morning broke, and putting down the bag of flour I thought, Life stands round me like a glass round the imprisoned reed.",

Now, as the helicopter moved farther from land, the Diomedes approached on our left, with the much smaller and uninhabited Fairway Rock to the south of them; in the clear distance, just a few ticks to the right of dead ahead, the easternmost cape of Asia rose into view, gray and vast, disappearing around the earth’s bend. Meanwhile, over our right shoulder, the Cape of Wales’s white hills stood out vividly in the sun. Few travelers to the region have seen this sight. The ill-starred Vitus Bering sailed through the strait twice without guessing how close he was to land. Captain Cook’s ships, on the other hand, happened to hit good weather when they came through in July of 1779. A journal of the voyage states: “The weather becoming clear, we had the opportunity of seeing, at the same moment, the remarkable peaked hill, near Cape Prince of Wales, on the coast of America, and the East Cape of Asia, with the two connecting islands of St. Diomede between them.”",
