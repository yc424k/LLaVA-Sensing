The showerhead didn’t work, so I bathed the way most people in India did: by filling a large bucket with as much hot water as possible and then scrubbing myself raw while crouching on the freezing concrete. In bed, I cocooned myself in blankets. I couldn’t doze for long: my glow-in-the-dark watch told me I’d have to be awake soon. In less than two hours, I’d have my first chance to see the guru I’d come to meet. One of the most powerful and influential men in India, he had gathered millions of disciples and devotees worldwide, attracted by his claims about the curative power of yoga and ayurvedic medicine. It was believed that his practices could cure cancer and reverse diabetes, but his most controversial claim was that he could cure people of homosexuality. Of course, I had heard this before, but Ramdev was different. In India, he was a household name.",

Long minutes later she returned and said in precise English, ‘Welcome to our country! But I am sorry, we must charge you 300 lei for one night. It is too much, but that is the rule for tourists. I am sorry again that the restaurant has no food. This is not a good time for tourism. But your room will be warm. Since the revolution, our Front for National Salvation has given us more heating.’",

The Italians sure know how to arrange things. I had a couple of beers in the Caffe Funicolare, then wandered idly into the main square. The German and Japanese tourists were nowhere to be seen, presumably tucked up in bed or more probably hustled back to the mainland on the last afternoon ferry. Now it was just locals, standing around in groups of five or six, chatting in the warm evening air, beneath the stars, with the black sea and far-off lights of Naples as a backdrop. It seemed to be the practice of the townspeople to congregate here after supper for a half-hour’s conversation. The teenagers all lounged on the church steps, while the smaller children raced among the grown-ups’ legs. Everyone seemed incredibly happy. I longed to be part of it, to live on this green island with its wonderful views and friendly people and excellent food and to stroll nightly here to this handsome square with its incomparable terrace and chat to my neighbours.",

Here was kindly old Ben Chifley, a Labor PM just after the war and so much a man of the people that when in Canberra he stayed in the modest Kurrajong Hotel at a cost to the taxpayer of just six shillings a day, and could be found each morning strolling in his bathrobe to the communal bathroom to shave and wash with the other guests. Then there was the grand and leonine Robert Menzies, who was prime minister for seventeen years but thought of himself as “British to the bootstraps” and dreamed of retiring to a cottage in the English countryside, evidently happy to turn his back on his native soil forever. And poor old Harold Holt, whose fateful plunge into the sea in 1967 earned him my permanent devotion.",

Souvenir shops. Pubs. Lodging. Rumour has it that if you stay for the night, the spirituality of the place envelopes you. It must have enveloped St Columba because he dawdled in these waters and on the Inner Hebridean islands for a while before putting down roots at Iona. The attraction may have been that the island is small enough to provide privacy but large enough to support agriculture. Iona is much smaller than Colonsay but has a population 50% larger, employed supporting the tourists. I wander through the remains of a 13th century nunnery and proceed on to the restored Abbey. In front of it are St Martin’s Cross, a five metre high 8th century medieval stone Celtic cross, ornately carved. A replica of St John’s Cross, the original shattered, adjoins it. The Abbey itself seems less religious than attraction, which is not fair, but that is how I feel.",

If anyone fluffed the pronunciation of Scheveningen, they were presumed to be a foreign spy. As Pete Jordan recorded, the Cyclists Regiments were deployed at key points along the defences. One of their members, Roelof Keppel, wrote to his wife: ‘Cyclists have a dangerous job. They seek danger and they find it.’ The next day he was killed.",

Two days after that he stood with his class before the Bench in an actual courtroom in Oxford and was admitted to the Bar, and it was finished. He made one that night at a noisy table in the hotel diningroom, at which the Judge presided, flanked by the law professors and the other legal sponsors. This was the anteroom to that world he had been working to reach for three years now—four, counting that first one when he could not yet see his goal. He had only to sit with that fixed expression and wait until the final periphrase died, was blotted by the final concussion of palms, and rise and walk out of the room and on, his face steady in the direction he had chosen to set it, as it had been for three years now anyway, not faltering, not looking back. And he could not do it. Even with that already forty miles of start toward freedom and (he knew it, said it) dignity and self-respect, he could not do it. He must return, drawn back into the radius and impact of an eleven-year-old girl who, even while sitting with veiled eyes against the sun like a cat on the schoolhouse steps at recess and eating a cold potato, postulated that ungirdled quality of the very goddesses in his Homer and Thucydides: of being at once corrupt and immaculate, at once virgins and the mothers of warriors and of grown men.",

I remember stopping at a nameless stream, in whose water small black trout sped and darted, and picking up the bleached skull of a gull.

Dr. Brodin is an Inuit whose grandfather was an Inuit from Siberia who crossed the Bering Strait and settled in Alaska in the early 1900s. The family still has relatives on the other side, and Dr. Brodin knows a lot about the region. The news story said that Dr. Brodin was raising money for an evangelizing expedition that would go by snowmobile across the frozen Bering Strait to native villages on the Siberian side. The boldness of this idea struck me, so I gave Dr. Brodin a call, and then drove down to see him in Kimberly, Idaho, where he lived. Dr. Brodin runs an organization called Indigenous Messengers International, which works to bring the Gospel to Inuit communities from Siberia to Greenland. He told me about that, and about the language problems involved—Siberian and Alaskan Inuits can talk to each other, but both have a harder time understanding Greenland Inuits—and about the upcoming snowmobile journey, which he said would go in February if they raised enough money and had thick enough ice.",

I could see sailboats tied bow- or stern-to along a quay, and in the middle, Akka’s white masts and black hull stood out from the other less travel-weary boats. Happily surprised that he had arrived before me, I called out Olivier’s name but received no answer. There was some space next to Akka, and preparing the fenders and mooring lines, I motored up alongside her, threw the gears into neutral and jumped aboard. As I snugged Varuna up, I realized that this was my second to last landfall before home. If all went as planned, the last would be Gibraltar, the gateway into the Atlantic.",

We crossed the Calle de Portales to the gorgeous Paseo Principe de Vergara, with its lush decorative topiaries. We dodged rush-hour traffic while jaywalking across Rey Juan Carlos. We trolled the streets of Logroño hunting for anything that resembled a hotel, or had the words hotel or pensione in its signage. We passed the modern and majestic Carlton Rioja, which positively screamed, “Big, fluffy bathrobes,” but Kate and Beth did not want to spend the money.

Mambo Etienne and Annee’ La Cour cut the fringe away from the central stalks and draped the “plumes” over the back of a chair. These were going to be cut into smaller pieces and used to decorate the peristyle and the various repositories of the gods. More work was going on out under the great elm tree that was to be dedicated to Loco and late in the night I went out there and spread up my bed to sleep. The next morning Dieu Donnez himself arrived with the rest of the clan in tow, and there was a great ceremony at the entrance for him. We were given some delicious hot tea called channelle before breakfast and it was a most refreshing and surprising thing. Channelle tea is a lovely habit for anybody to have. I was put to work cutting up the colored paper to be strung across the peristyle to decorate it and spent the entire morning at it. By that time a crowd was beginning to collect. When the peristyle was all decorated, I went out to the cooking place where the women were cooking great quantities of food. I noticed that Madame Etienne found the rocks herself to support the large cooking pots, and that she marked each rock with a cross mark in charcoal. She answered me that this was done to keep them from breaking when they were heated.",

There was the African Plate, the Cocos Plate, the North American Plate, the Nazca Plate, the Iran Plate, the Antarctic Plate, the Juan de Fuca Plate, the Australian Plate, the Arabian Plate and the decidedly unfragile China Plates. Driven by convection currents or ‘cells’ within the semi-liquid mantle of the earth, and pulled by their own weight, these plates move around relative to each other. Where their edges meet beneath the ocean, either a mid-ocean ridge or a subduction zone is formed. At mid-ocean ridges the boundaries of two plates are continually being pushed apart by action in the mantle. Magma rises into the gap, and cools to form sea-floor basalt. Mid-ocean ridges are therefore raised above the surrounding ocean floor, like the seam on a cricket ball. A subduction zone, by contrast, is where the edges of two plates are forced together, and the less buoyant plate slides underneath the other. There, the rock of the subordinate plate is pushed down into the mantle, where it melts and comes bubbling back up in liquid form, causing super-heated wounds in the crust. These subduction zones form the oceanic trenches: the Aleutian Trench, the Java Trench, the Marianas Trench. At the bottom of these trenches – the Marianas Trench is deeper than Mount Everest is high – the atmospheric pressure is so enormous that, were you to materialize at that depth, your body would instantly be compacted to the size of a tin can.",

A quaint old Receiving Ship still dominated the harbour view – the former troopship Tamar, but looking much like the old Victor Emmanuel – and the fact that the Praya now extended further to the west, running in a wide sweep along the foreshore towards Possession Point where it all began, only seemed to confirm the sensation that this was the definitive Hong Kong, as it always would be. The French observer, Albert Demangeon, writing in 1925, summed it up, once and for all it seemed, as ‘the proudest monument of England’s commercial genius’.1",

When we’re all dressed in silks and suits, we walk into town over the Roman road. Ed carries our good shoes in a shopping bag. Susan has brought Chinese painted paper parasols for everyone because of the midday sun. We walk through town and up the steps of the twelfth-century town hall. It’s a dark, high-ceilinged room with tapestries and frescoes and high judicial-looking chairs, an impressive room to sign a treaty in. The city of Cortona has sent red roses and Ed has arranged for Bar Sport to come over right after the ceremony with cold prosecco. Susan’s cousin Brian runs all around with his video camera, getting shots from every angle. After the brief ceremony, we cross the piazza to La Logetta for a Tuscan feast beginning with a selection of typical antipasti: crostini, little rounds of bread topped with olives, peppers, mushroom, or chicken liver; prosciutto e melone, fried olives stuffed with pancetta and spicy bread crumbs; and the local finocchiona, a salami studded with fennel seeds. Next they bring out a selection of primi, first courses to try, including ravioli with butter and sage, and gnocchi di patate, little “knuckles” of potato served here with pesto. Course after course arrives, culminating in platters of roast lamb and veal and the famous grilled Val di Chiana steak. Karen notices the grand piano in the corner under a massive vase of flowers and prevails upon Cole, who is a pianist, to play. Ed is at the other end of the table but he catches my eye as Cole begins Scarlatti. Three weeks ago this was a dream, a long shot, a frightening prospect. “Cheers!” the English cousins call out.",

I tried to slip by at a distance I considered safe, but the chimpanzee, who was lying on the floor in what appeared to be a pensive mood, suddenly whirled around on her bottom and, stretching out, reached my skirt with her foot. Before I could get out of the skirt, she had pulled me over and was holding me fast by the leg, and Mrs. Cass's experience would have been repeated if I hadn't had the padlock key in my pocket. As it was, I unlocked the chain. One good turn deserves another. Chimpo immediately released me. For the rest of the day, we were on friendly terms. I even allowed her to open the door for the grocery boy. I had hoped to surprise him, but he didn't turn a hair. He addressed Chimpo in her own language, a coughing grunt, and walked in, unconcerned, to put down the groceries.",

The Church should provide a context, but it is busy with things eternal. And Milan is not so much a Catholic city as a Calvinist city. . . .”",

It was Lugard, the Governor, who proposed the foundation of Hong Kong University, but it was the business community that paid for it. Today the Treasurer of the Chinese University is usually the chairman of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, and the third university has been largely financed by the Jockey Club. Most of the land reclamation has been done by private enterprise: the very name of the reclaimed district called Kai Tak, where the airport is, commemorates its capitalist creators, Sir Kai Ho-kai and Mr A. Tack.13 The mounted troop of the Hong Kong Volunteer Regiment was raised and commanded by Jardine’s, and until 1922 there was no official fire brigade – the business houses each had their own. The buses, the trams, the Peak tram, the ferries, the telephones, the electricity services are all privately run; of the basic services, only water is provided by the public sector. The harbour pilots are members of a private cooperative, radio and TV are largely commercial, and many of the hospitals and clinics are financed by the Jockey Club or private enterprise.",

Like Borrow, too, walking was one of the few activities that could lift him from his depressions. He would cut a stick – holly was his favourite staff-wood – and set off along ‘indelible old roads’, ‘worn by hoofs and the naked feet and the trailing staves of long-dead generations’. Ancient ways were ‘potent, magic things’, on which he could ‘make time as nothing’ while ‘meandering over many centuries’. Hansel and Gretel being led into the wood, but dropping a trail of white stones behind them and finding their way back, came to his mind to be ‘one of the great stories of the world’.",

The marchers were still plodding along, perhaps a little fewer in number than before, but the atmosphere had improved: less funeral march, more chatting and laughing. I couldn’t help noticing, however, that the various religious groups didn’t mingle much but remained separate – a cluster of Muslim women gossiping here, a handful of Jewish men there – which seemed rather to defeat the point of the exercise. Loitering on the edges of the group I caught snatches of dozens of conversations, all unrelated to the march itself: Feyenoord’s recent performance, what someone’s sister’s husband had done, what to do about the downstairs bathroom. Protestant or Catholic, Muslim or Jew, there was nothing the Dutch liked better than chatting with strangers.",

The ripe, the golden month has come again, and in Virginia the chinkapins are falling. Frost sharps the middle music of the seasons, and all things living on the earth turn home again. The country is so big you cannot say the country has the same October. In Maine, the frost comes sharp and quick as driven nails; just for a week or so the woods, all of the bright and bitter leaves, flare up: the maples turn a blazing bitter red, and other leaves turn yellow like a living light, falling about you as you walk the woods, falling about you like small pieces of the sun, so that you cannot say where sunlight shakes and flutters on the ground and where the leaves.",

There were things up there rotting in the drawers—it was a shame to leave them so, she said. The place was gone to rack and ruin. Only the Lighthouse beam entered the rooms for a moment, sent its sudden stare over bed and wall in the darkness of winter, looked with equanimity at the thistle and the swallow, the rat and the straw. Nothing now withstood them; nothing said no to them. Let the wind blow; let the poppy seed itself and the carnation mate with the cabbage. Let the swallow build in the drawing-room, and the thistle thrust aside the tiles, and the butterfly sun itself on the faded chintz of the armchairs. Let the broken glass and the china lie out on the lawn and be tangled over with grass and wild berries.",

Entering the Sangatsu-do Hall, next door to the Hall of the Great Buddha, you find a quiet room far removed from the flurry of people in the park. In this dim space, there towers a magnificent gilt statue of the Fukukensaku Kannon Buddha, surrounded by a mandala arrangement of statues of guardians, the Sun and the Moon, and other bodhisattvas. From the halo behind the Buddha’s head project gilded rays, gleaming in the darkness. Tourists come into Sangatsu-do talking and laughing, but they soon fall silent in the presence of Fukukensaku Kannon’s fearsome light. None of them, including myself, has the slightest idea what the significance of Fukukensaku Kannon is. It doesn’t matter – those beams of light are enough.",

She couldn’t tug at her quick-release belt to free her from her board, which caused her to stay submerged, wedged between two rocks, for some time. The water crashed wildly around her and the current was extremely strong. Luckily, Anthony’s assistants, our two intrepid safety kayakers, were with her within seconds of her fall, and helped her get untangled. She managed to swim safely down the rest of the rapids and put on a brave smile when she re-joined the team. In the evening we discovered that she had a massive bruise and a cut from a rock that had pierced her wetsuit down the whole length of her leg. Thankfully, she was otherwise okay and keen to continue on the board the next day. This was my second teammate to get hurt and I, as their team leader, was naturally concerned. I was, indeed, responsible for their well-being and safety, but I felt that with Anthony and our two safety kayakers by our side, we were going to be just fine.",

The small compound we were assigned to was a soporific little beach community on the Strait of Hormuz just across from Iran. With my face pressed up against the window, the journey from Dhahran to Ras Tanura unfolded in a landscape devoid of color, detail and obvious life. I was hoping for a camel sighting or even a Bedouin tent but was met with power lines, a gray desert, overcast skies and bleakness. Driving onto the compound for the first time and navigating the security gates, it dawned on me that we were entering a different world, even more rare than the Arabian reality. The compound was organized Western-style with wide streets, cul-de-sacs and front lawns. Homes with red-tiled Western roofs were arranged in predictable patterns, just like in the US. It all seemed somehow shabby and slightly rundown after Japan. However, we were determined to be optimistic, and when we saw the location of our new home, right on the corner of Sand Dollar and Surfboard streets, that lifted our spirits. We were a three-minute walk to a beach–oh joy, this seemed like an omen.",

    "target_paragraph": "In the morning the Kuma mist had invaded the city, and though it had vanished by the time I left the ryokan, the sky was dark with clouds and for the first time in two weeks it looked like rain. On the way out of Hitoyoshi I passed an elegant old lady with white hair and a shopping basket walking slowly along the main street and bending down every five yards with considerable effort to pick up trampled cigarette packets. Out of the city the road grew steep, laboring up between drab brown harvested fields toward the prefectural boundary with Miyazaki. The rolling slopes of the plateau soon replaced the somber fields. I passed a roadside stall, decorated with Union Jacks, that had once sold pears but was shuttered now and dead as the landscape. In the gutter lay a dried-up tortoise – somebody’s pet – and I was startled to find my shirt speckled with the corpses of half a hundred baby flies.",

Surely she was right now when she said she would just kill herself, for that was the only way now she could do.",
