This has a barbarous sound, but it was delicious – Spritzer they called it in German, and, in Magyar, hoszú lépés, ‘a long step’, one of the many terms for the degrees of dilution. Generically, all these wines were unmistakably from that particular region, yet each one seemed to change with the roof under which it was to be drunk. It was ready for drinking from the moment the vintage had settled from fermentation, and after years in cool cellars, it was beyond praise. At dinner, decanter on decanter was emptied, undiluted now, by the light of candles in tall glass tulip-shaped shields. Jaš liked sitting late after dinner when rash and varied talk ranged far into the small hours. When he lifted a forefinger, we would fall silent and listen to the nightingales for a minute. A restless geometry of fire-flies darted about under the spatulate volume of the chestnut trees, and getting up one night to go to bed, we found emerald-coloured tree-frogs smaller than threepenny-bits clinging to the leaves like miniature green castaways on rafts.",

There was a powerful masculine stench of broad dock-leaves, a hot weedy odour. They moved over a pathless field, knee-high in a dry stubbly waste, gathering on their clothes clusters of brown cockle-burrs. All the field was sown with hot odorous daisies. Then they entered the wood again, mounting until they came to an island of tender grass, by a little brook that fell down from the green hill along a rocky ferny bed in bright cascades.",

    "target_paragraph": "BRILLIANT SHAFTS of sunlight stabbed through the leafless trees in camp. The rays of white heat stalked us into every corner of our island. It seemed as if there were no longer any seasons—only heat. Each day was like the last, each week, each month the same. By September 1979, Deception Valley had received only four inches of rain in twenty months. The Kalahari was an expanse of grey earth stretching out to a grey sky, as if reaching for rain that would not come.\nOne of our thermometers, nailed to a tree in camp, rose past 122 degrees and stuck; surface temperatures on the open riverbed were near 150. Every day we poured small puddles of water onto our canvas cots and wallowed there, in a stupor, for hours. Or, like roaches seeking the cooler darkness, we pressed ourselves to the floor of the tent or sprawled on a corner of the ground sheet.\nThe heat clung to us like a leech, sucking away our strength. When we had to perform some task—anything—we dragged through it in slow motion, exhausted. Often, when we stood up from our cots, dark spots would spread behind our eyes; dizzy, we would lower our heads between our knees until the nausea passed. The hours of torpor scrambled our brains and confused us. Sometimes we had to stop and think, “Why are we still here, trying to survive the fifth—or is it the sixth?—dry season . . . the first—or second—year of drought?”\nBecause the relative humidity was so low and the evaporation so intense, we did not sweat; that is, the moisture from our bodies was vaporized before it could dampen our skin. We drank quarts of water, hot and smoky from being boiled on the fire, but it tasted good just the same. When the sun finally sagged behind West Dune, our skin felt chilled beneath a sticky film of dust mixed with dry perspiration salts. We could hardly wait to sponge-bathe. But when we stood naked and wet in the boma, with the wind rushing through the flimsy reed walls, we shivered—angry that we were always either too hot or too cold.\nOften apart, sometimes together, Muffin and Moffet roamed for months over miles of wasted desert. At times they were as much as thirty or forty miles from any of their scattered lionesses, and we seldom found them with their females anymore. It was a time of social disintegration, of enforced isolation, for members of the Blue Pride. The most the lions could find to eat was a rat here, a springbok there, a porcupine or steenbok (if they were lucky), but never enough to allow them to stay together as a pride.\nLike us, Muffin and Moffet spent the hot days in torpor, lying on bare sand and fire-blackened stubble beneath any sterile bush that offered a little shade. They constantly worked their mouths, pushing their tacky tongues out through dry lips, slowly rolling their vacant eyes toward us when we collected their scats for analysis. Their bellies were high and tight against their spines, their manes thinned, ragged, and lusterless, like the hair of bed-ridden invalids.\nIt had been more than a week since they had fed on anything substantial. With no large antelope left in their former Deception Valley territory, they had moved east, hunting every night through the open woodlands near the border of the game reserve. Now the two lions lay panting next to a bush, the only sign of life in sight.\nWhen the heat subsided that evening they walked east to the boundary of the reserve and crawled through the wires of the fence. They could smell not only prey but also water. Ahead, cattle stirred uneasily inside a boma of felled thom branches. The lions silently stalked forward.\nSuddenly a white-hot pain shot through Muffin’s leg. He roared and lunged against the trap, his foot twisting in its jaws. Biting at the steel, he rolled over and over, shredding the muscles of his leg as he pulled at the chain and the log to which he was bound. Moffet rushed to him and smelled the mangled foot and trap, but there was nothing he could do.\nAll night long Muffin fought to get away, panting and staggering as he hauled the heavy log in circles over the sand. Moffet watched nearby. In the morning, a native rancher on horseback rode up, lifted his rifle, and shot Muffin in the face and chest. Moffet turned and ran west toward the game reserve, the man and his pack of baying dogs tearing through the scrub after him. A rifle cracked repeatedly and bullets slapped into the sand around the fleeing lion.\nLater that morning I flew over the spot where I had last found Muffin and Moffet, near the fence. They were no longer there and I could hear Muffin’s signal coming from far away in the east. With a heavy feeling growing in my chest, I banked the plane and headed out of the game reserve toward his transmitter. I kept thinking that maybe he’d gone to the river for water or followed a herd of antelope, but I knew by the unusual clarity of the radio signal that he was no longer wearing his collar.\nSixty-five miles east, the signal peaked over the village of Mopipi near Lake Xau. By flying low, back and forth over the thatched roofs of the huts, I pinpointed the one with the collar and transmitter. When I looked down, the skin of a large male lion was pegged out in the sand near a low shed. People were scurrying through the village, all pointing up at the plane.\nI landed in a clearing nearby and was surrounded by a throng of natives clapping their hands, waving, and laughing. Scowling and silent, hurting inside for yet another dead friend, I made my way through the crowd and into the village to the hut I had singled out from the air. A middle-aged black woman came warily to the door and peered around its edge at me. “Someone from this house has shot a lion,” I said. “You must have the collar that was around its neck.”\nUnable to understand what had led me to her rondavel, for a moment the woman seemed confused and frightened. I managed a weak smile to reassure her. Then I saw Muffin’s worn and blood-stained collar hanging behind her on a post, its transmitter still functioning. She gave it to me and I asked her how many lions had been shot. She said she didn’t know, but that her husband had brought only one skin to the village from the ranch. I told her I would be back in a few days to get the details of Muffin’s death from him.\nAirborne again, I tuned in Moffet’s frequency, but I could not hear his signal. It was not easy to tell Delia that Muffin was dead and that I could not find Moffet.\nFor weeks I continued to search for Moffet from the air, but never heard his signal. I figured he must have been wounded and had wandered off to die. One of the bullets had probably smashed his transmitter.",

The Kurhotel’s three rivals occupy forested slopes linked by concreted roads, all the gradients so severe that stairways replace footpaths.

The river looks terribly immense and powerful, swollen with snow-melt from the western slope of the Rockies and from the Wind River Range in Wyoming, a veritable Mississippi of a river rolling between redrock walls. Our rubber boats, after we inflate them, seem gaudy, flimsy and much too small. Inevitably we’ve forgotten a few things, among them life jackets, and I can’t help thinking that maybe we should make the trip some other time. One of the things that worries me, besides the missing life jackets and the obvious fragility of our Made-in-Japan vessels, is the fact that Ralph has only one good leg. He can walk but not hike; he can swim but not very far.",

The image of him I have in mind is from a photograph taken in Tibet during the approach march to Everest in 1922. Having undressed for a river crossing, Mallory is naked except for a dark felt hat and a rucksack. He is side-on to the camera, and his left leg is pushed chastely forward so that his thigh is concealing his groin. His skin is luminously pale and his body surprisingly curvaceous: there is a roundness to his buttocks and the bow of his stomach. His face is shadowed from the pure white Tibetan sunlight by the brim of his hat, and he is looking directly at the camera and giving a saucy, seaside smirk. He emanates warmth and good humour. Two years after the photograph was taken, the geologist and climber Noel Odell would watch two dark specks – one was Mallory, the other Andrew Irvine – making their way slowly up the final slopes of Everest, until the cloud swirled in and hid them for ever.",

It often shows curiosity and comes up to look at passers-by—and then turns and trots off in the most elegant manner. The kyang feeds on grass and is left in peace by the inhabitants. Its only enemy is the wolf. Since I first saw them these untamed beautiful beasts have seemed a symbol of freedom.",

In the first half of the month of January, still penitently true to the New Year’s reformation, he begot a child: by Spring, when it was evident that Eliza was again pregnant, he had hurled himself into an orgy to which even a notable four months’ drunk in 1896 could offer no precedent. Day after day he became maniacally drunk, until he fixed himself in a state of constant insanity: in May she sent him off again to a sanatorium at Piedmont to take the ‘cure,’ which consisted simply in feeding him plainly and cheaply, and keeping him away from alcohol for six weeks, a régime which contributed no more ravenously to his hunger than it did to his thirst. He returned, outwardly chastened, but inwardly a raging furnace, toward the end of June: the day before he came back, Eliza, obviously big with child, her white face compactly set, walked sturdily into each of the town’s fourteen saloons, calling up the proprietor or the bar-man behind his counter, and speaking clearly and loudly in the sodden company of bar clientry:",

    "target_paragraph": "So the old fat clean horse (it looked always as if it had just come back from the dry-cleaner’s; you could almost smell the benzine) moved on again, with a rich preliminary internal chord, going on along the gapped and weathered picket fence. Ratliff sat in the still-motionless buckboard and watched it and the lean, loose-jointed figure which, with the exception of the three-year runabout interval, had bestridden it, the same saddle between them, for twenty-five years, thinking how if, as dogs do, the white horse or his own two either had snuffed along that fence for yellow-wheeled buggies now, they would not have found them, thinking: And all the other two-legged feice in this country between thirteen and eighty can pass here now without feeling no urge to stop and raise one of them against it. And yet those buggies were still there. He could see them, sense them. Something was; it was too much to have vanished that quickly and completely—the air polluted and rich and fine which had flowed over and shaped that abundance and munificence, which had done the hydraulic office to that almost unbroken progression of chewed food, which had held intact the constant impact of those sixteen years of sitting down: so why should not that body at the last have been the unscalable sierra, the rosy virginal mother of barricades for no man to conquer scot-free or even to conquer at all, but on the contrary to be hurled back and down, leaving no scar, no mark of himself (That ere child aint going to look no more like nobody this country ever saw than she did, he thought.)—the buggy merely a part of the whole, a minor and trivial adjunct, like the buttons on her clothing, the clothes themselves, the cheap beads which one of the three of them had given her. That would never have been for him, not even at the prime summer peak of what he and Varner both would have called his tom-catting’s heyday. He knew that without regret or grief, he would not have wanted it to be (It would have been like giving me a pipe organ, that never had and never would know any more than how to wind up the second-hand music-box I had just swapped a mail-box for, he thought.) and he even thought of the cold and froglike victor without jealousy: and this not because he knew that, regardless of whatever Snopes had expected or would have called what it was he now had, it would not be victory. What he felt was outrage at the waste, the useless squandering; at a situation intrinsically and inherently wrong by any economy, like building a log dead-fall and baiting it with a freshened heifer to catch a rat; or no, worse: as though the gods themselves had funnelled all the concentrated bright wet-slanted unparadised June onto a dung-heap, breeding pismires. Beyond the white horse, beyond the corner of the picket fence, the faint, almost overgrown lane turned off which led to the Old Frenchman place. The horse attempted to turn into it until Varner hauled it roughly back. Not to mention the poorhouse, Ratliff thought. But then, he wouldn’t have been infested. He shook his own reins slightly. “Boys,” he said, “advance.”",

I had seen it from the start, though many people either didn’t seem to make the assumption or didn’t indicate that they had. Others simply clocked the pair of us, as if taking in some matter-of-fact information, then carried on with their business.

He had grown up in a young country pleased with the promising beginning it had made and eager to spread the good news of its political system. For Americans like Kennan, a hopeful future was unthinkingly assumed, leaving the present as the main item of business at hand. The American Revolution had been relatively benign; his view of Russian possibilities bent under the weight of his native optimism. The slippery Stepniak himself described Kennan as “deeply interested in the country [Russia], which he truly loves.” But Russian politics and policy interested Kennan only on their surface. Better than any other American, or perhaps than any other non-Russian, Kennan registered the deeper Russian passions of his time.",

I should see the tall, green slopes of an island, if my sextant is correct. I should hit Antigua—ironically, my original destination. But who knows? I could be hundreds of miles off. This triangle of pencils may be a foolish bit of junk. The chart could be grossly inaccurate. I spend endless hours scanning the horizon for a cloud shape that does not move, searching the sky for a long wisp of cloud that might suggest human flight. Nothing. I feel like a watch slowly winding down, a Timex thrown out of an airplane just once too often. I’ve overestimated my speed, or perhaps I’m drifting diagonally across the shelf. If there was only some way to measure the current. I’m assuming that I’m within two hundred miles of my calculated position, but if I’ve been off by as little as five miles a day, I could be four hundred miles away from where I hope I am—another eight or even fifteen days. “Water, Captain. Please? Water.” Tick, tick, slower and slower. When will it stop? Can I wind it up until the end of the month without breaking the spring?",

I adored being here, and even though it was not in tune with my new philosophy, I had grown rather attached and was going to miss it. The train was rolling at little more than a walking pace through the outskirts of the city. On the verge of setting, the sun was stretched out across rooftops, spilling a papaya glow across the slums. I had always watched sunsets from the doorways, but this time I finally saw the spectrum of tones blending from yellow into orange into red, ever-changing, before there were little more than a few sprays of pink across the horizon. My ears pricked up at the sound of gushing water and as I leant out of the door I saw a burst water hydrant at the end of the tracks, shooting a jet into the air. As we drew closer, I noticed that a man was sitting at the base of the jet – the embodiment of Indian opportunism, he had brought a piece of soap to the broken hydrant and was squatting on the wall in his shorts, scrubbing himself all over and making the most of the free power shower.",

At least we weren’t fighting a headwind. The air was hot and heavy, and without the usual breeze was sticky on our skin. The wind had been our friend throughout the night—a light northeasterly that let us easily sail from Chub Cay to the Rose Island pass—but slowly abandoned us as we crossed onto the shallow banks east of Nassau.

It was in Sauk Centre, two years after their arrival, that the elder Lindbergh suffered a famously horrific injury. While working at a sawmill, he slipped and fell against the whirring blade, which tore through his upper body at the shoulder, creating a hole so large that his internal organs were exposed?one witness claimed he could see the poor man’s beating heart?and leaving his arm attached by just a few strands of glistening sinew. The millworkers bound the injuries as best they could and carried Lindbergh home, where he lay in silent agony for three days awaiting the arrival of a doctor from St. Cloud, forty miles away. When the doctor at last reached him, he took off the arm and sewed up the gaping cavity. It was said that Lindbergh made almost no sound. Remarkably, August Lindbergh recovered and lived another thirty years. Stoicism became the Lindbergh family’s most cultivated trait.",

The open-air dining-room is a circular palm-thatched space – ancient tree roots writhing in one corner, the table and benches of rough-hewn palm trunks. That evening was overcast with humidity off the scale and thunder rumbling for hours around the Sierra Cristal. Here I encountered the first mosquitoes of this journey, as active within my room as outside. Although I didn’t complain Eduardo heard me slapping my flesh and before I could intervene he had drenched my room from a giant can of spray – a frighteningly effective mix.",

I swam underwater to the shelter of a rock and then peered out hopefully, feeling that this sort of thing could not go on for long. Nor did it – a moment later the hail ceased, to be replaced by swirling snow. And that, as you might say, was the end of my swim. But the freakish thing is that the temperature didn’t drop appreciably and I was quite warm walking home clad only in a shirt and shorts. Of course Oliver and Juliet were politely disbelieving when I reported my misadventure; the camp had enjoyed a flawlessly sunny afternoon, disturbed by no more than a few rumbles of distant thunder, and ‘travellers’ tales’ of blizzards around the corner were just too incredible.",

They ordered Veronese pastry on lawns like lace curtains at Versailles and chicken and hazelnuts at Fontainebleau where the woods wore powdered wigs. Discs of umbrellas poured over suburban terraces with the smooth round ebullience of a Chopin waltz. They sat in the distance under the lugubrious dripping elms, elms like maps of Europe, elms frayed at the end like bits of chartreuse wool, elms heavy and bunchy as sour grapes. They ordered the weather with a continental appetite, and listened to the centaur complain about the price of hoofs. There were bourgeois blossoms on the bill-of-fare and tall architectural blossoms on the horse-chestnut and crystallized rose-buds to go with the Porto. The Americans gave indications of themselves but always only the beginning like some eternal exposition, a clef before a bar of music to be played on the minors of the imagination. They thought all French school boys were orphans because of the black dresses they wore, and those of them who didn’t know the meaning of the word “insensible” thought the French thought that they were crazy. All of them drank. Americans with red ribbons in their buttonholes read papers called the Eclaireur and drank on the sidewalks, Americans with tips on the races drank down a flight of stairs, Americans with a million dollars and a standing engagement with the hotel masseuses drank in suites at the Meurice and the Crillon. Other Americans drank in Montmartre, “pour le soif” and “contre la chaleur” and “pour la digestion” and “pour se guerir”. They were glad the French thought they were crazy.",
