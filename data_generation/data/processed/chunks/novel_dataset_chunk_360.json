I turned on a sprinkler and came back with a wet handkerchief, but there was no mark on Stahr – he must have been hit in the side of the head. He went off behind some trees and was sick, and I heard him kicking up some earth over it. After that he seemed all right, but he wouldn’t go into the house till I got him some mouthwash, so I took back the whiskey bottle and got a mouthwash bottle. His wretched essay at getting drunk was over. I’ve been out with college freshmen, but for sheer ineptitude and absence of the Bacchic spirit it unquestionably took the cake. Every bad thing happened to him, but that was all.",

The writing-table, however, was piled with manuscript, and a table was drawn out to stand by the armchair on which were two separate heaps of dark library books, in which there were many slips of paper sticking out at different degrees of thickness. Miss Allan had asked Rachel to come in out of kindness, thinking that she was waiting about with nothing to do. Moreover, she liked young women, for she had taught many of them, and having received so much hospitality from the Ambroses she was glad to be able to repay a minute part of it. She looked about accordingly for something to show her. The room did not provide much entertainment. She touched her manuscript. ‘Age of Chaucer; Age of Elizabeth; Age of Dryden,’ she reflected; ‘I’m glad there aren’t many more ages. I’m still in the middle of the eighteenth century. Won’t you sit down, Miss Vinrace? The chair, though small, is firm … Euphues.* The germ of the English novel,’ she continued, glancing at another page. ‘Is that the kind of thing that interests you?’",

Having failed to find an open café, I rambled around the old residential area – long straight nineteenth-century streets of solid one-storey Magyar houses, some newly painted in contrasting pastel shades, some with pairs of gaudy plaster gnomes grinning in porches, or comic wooden masks (locally carved) hanging beside hall doors. This is a pleasingly rural town. Cocks crow far and near, hens wander on pavements, turkeys gobble in little front gardens, invisible pigs grunt in sheds.",

Here, one would have thought them destroyed long ago, the commercialization of life is otherwise so evident. Even here, along this road over the pillaged land between Kure and Hiroshima, there are hills with crests of trees, and groves remain here and there.\nAt the same time I notice that there is no field, no hillock, no convenient turn in the highway without its advertisement. Lion Tooth Powder—this I make out as the bus bounces by. Then something about the new Toyopet—legend and happy picture—natural in this automobile-ridden land. Then, suddenly, I decipher: Cancer Cured! And this also one expects in a country where patent medicine is gobbled like candy.\nThe next four or five signs I cannot read. I am relieved. Since I do not read well, these millions of advertisements are not actually offensive to me. Rather, they are pretty. They add to the general air of the unkempt picturesque. Japan can be very beautiful to us illiterates.",

The old hall had acquired the vast and aseptic impersonality of an airport lounge. (Greek architects have forgotten the saying of their ancestor Isocrates about man being the measure of all things.) Beyond it, the bar, the noisy and delightful meeting place of many years, had become a silent waste dotted with lost and furtively murmuring customers dwarfed by their habitat into air-conditioned skaters on a rink of marble. Only the old barmen were unchanged. They looked puzzled and wistful . . . (At the moment of writing, this bar is closed yet again for its fifth alteration in the last three decades. I wonder what Babylonian phoenix will emerge.)",

    "target_paragraph": "Decoud stood as if paralyzed; only his thoughts were wildly active. In the space of a second he remembered the desolate glance of Antonia as he left her at the bedside of her father in the gloomy house of Avellanos, with shuttered windows, but all the doors standing open, and deserted by all the servants except an old negro at the gate. He remembered the Casa Gould on his last visit, the arguments, the tones of his voice, the impenetrable attitude of Charles, Mrs. Gould’s face so blanched with anxiety and fatigue that her eyes seemed to have changed colour, appearing nearly black by contrast. Even whole sentences of the proclamation which he meant to make Barrios issue from his headquarters at Cayta as soon as he got there passed through his mind; the very germ of the new State, the Separationist proclamation which he had tried before he left to read hurriedly to Don José, stretched out on his bed under the fixed gaze of his daughter. God knows whether the old statesman had understood it; he was unable to speak, but he had certainly lifted his arm off the coverlet; his hand had moved as if to make the sign of the cross in the air, a gesture of blessing, of consent. Decoud had that very draft in his pocket, written in pencil on several loose sheets of paper, with the heavily-printed heading, “Administration of the San Tomé Silver Mine. Sulaco. Republic of Costaguana.” He had written it furiously, snatching page after page on Charles Gould’s table. Mrs. Gould had looked several times over his shoulder as he wrote; but the Señor Administrador, standing straddle-legged, would not even glance at it when it was finished. He had waved it away firmly. It must have been scorn, and not caution, since he never made a remark about the use of the Administration’s paper for such a compromising document. And that showed his disdain, the true English disdain of common prudence, as if everything outside the range of their own thoughts and feelings were unworthy of serious recognition. Decoud had the time in a second or two to become furiously angry with Charles Gould, and even resentful against Mrs. Gould, in whose care, tacitly it is true, he had left the safety of Antonia. Better perish a thousand times than owe your preservation to such people, he exclaimed mentally. The grip of Nostromo’s fingers never removed from his shoulder, tightening fiercely, recalled him to himself.",

Each cleric stared out blankly through heavy Joe-90 spectacles, under a tightly wrapped and immaculately starched white turban: as strange and surreal a sight as a line of giant Andy Warhol Marilyns raised above a motorway. Interspersed between the mullahs, much smaller and crudely nailed onto a low picket of wooden posts, stretched a line of idealised portraits of smiling, bearded shaheedin, the Hezbollah ‘martyrs’ who had died fighting the Israelis in occupied southern Lebanon. To indicate the heavenly bliss currently being enjoyed by these fighters, their heads were sometimes shown floating on clouds of white cumulus. Other hoardings showed the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, inscribed with a series of fearsome invocations to Free Palestine and Crush the Zionist Entity, along with other varieties of the sort of bloodcurdling threats, promises and admonitions which Shia fundamentalists like to read as they drive into town to do their shopping.",

The steps about the public places were filled with jonquils and roses dyed orange, dripping red water. Alabama went to see the wax Nativities at Benediction. There were calla lilies everywhere and tapers and worn, bland faces smiling convulsively over the season. From the reflection of the candle flicker on the gilt, from the chants that rose and fell like the beating of the tides on amorphous shores before the birth of man, from the spattering tread of the women with heads bound in lace veils, Alabama absorbed a sense of elation as if she marched to the righteous tune of spiritual organization. The surplices of the priests in Naples were of white satin, lush with passion flowers and pomegranates. During the services Alabama thought of Bourbon princes and haemophilia, papal counts, and maraschino cherries. The gleam of gold damask on the altar was as warm and rich as what it represented. Her thoughts prowled about her introspection like leopards in a cage at the zoo. Her body was so full of static from the constant whip of her work that she could get no clear communication with herself. She said to herself that human beings have no right to fail. She did not feel what failure was. She thought of Bonnie’s tree. Mademoiselle could get it together as well as she.",

It was quickly dismembered and soon every bit had been bought; the pretty little hooves were sold in pairs. Then a youth appeared with four squirrels – fawn backs, white bellies, russet tails. One had to walk carefully between the long rows of butchers’ stalls where the ground was slippy with blood and guts, and the air rent with the shrieks and squawks of dying pigs and poultry. I paused to watch one elderly woman preparing her stock of a special Lao delicacy: buffalo hide with the hairs still attached, sold in thin eighteen-inch strips. She was using a pointed stick to hold the hide in place and chopping with a heavy sharp knife; buffaloes are thick-skinned creatures and having completed her task she looked exhausted. As usual, the traders were women, many wearing tribal costumes – Hmong, Phu Noi, Thai Khao, Thai Daeng, Thai Neua. Perhaps their presence accounted for the market atmosphere’s being so friendly.",

She had grown up on a farm on the Murray River.

    "target_paragraph": "She had frequent periods of sickness. She went constantly to the doctors for treatment and advice. Sometimes she went to the hospital for several days. Her illness manifested itself in various ways – sometimes in a terrible mastoid pain, sometimes in nervous exhaustion, sometimes in an hysterical collapse in which she laughed and wept by turns, and which was governed partly by Gant’s illness and a morbid despair over her failure to bear a child. She drank stealthily at times – she drank in nibbling draughts for stimulus, never enough for drunkenness. She drank vile liquids – seeking only the effect of alcohol and getting at it in strange ways through a dozen abominations called ‘tonics’ and ‘extracts.’ Almost deliberately she ruined her taste for the better sort of potable liquors, concealing from herself, under the convenient labellings of physic, the ugly crawling hunger in her blood. This self-deception was characteristic of her. Her life expressed itself through a series of deceptions – of symbols: her dislikes, affections, grievances, brandishing every cause but the real one.",

These are seamless days of walks and books, of taking trips to Anghiari, Siena, Assisi, and nearby Lucignano, whose town walls describe a graceful ellipse. At night, we grill in the fireplace—bruschetta with melted pecorino and walnuts, slices of fresh pecorino with prosciutto, and sausages. Scamorza, more native to the Abruzzo but growing popular in Tuscany, is a hard rind cheese shaped like an 8. It melts to almost a fondue and we spread it on bread. I learn to use the hearth to warm plates and keep food hot, just as my imagined nonna must have done. Our favorite pasta becomes pici con funghi e salsiccie, pencil-thick pasta with wild mushrooms and the grilled sausages. A seven-mile walk along the fire road cancels the effects of one evening of grilling.",

The angry, gray, foaming-at-the-mouth waters were transformed into sparkling blue mounds with bubbly crests blowing up into a spray that shimmered like crystals. The sun, I knew, was a major factor in determining my daily mood. It was hard to dwell on black thoughts when the sun beamed warmly down on Varuna’s deck, her sails, her wake and my face and everything began to emit a radiant glow. Even Tarzoon and Mimine came out to sit on the drying wood of the cockpit, watching me steer by hand past the lighthouse, playing with the waves and gusts. In the distance, to the right and left, the gentle crests of waves lapped over the reefs. I studied the compass to keep the exact course in the plan of approach that I had had plenty of time to mull over and memorize, and the beauty of the sunny morning erased my fatalistic gloom of the day before.",

But the town’s shapeless sprawl of concrete slabs and tin sheeting, with a tarred strip running down the centre of two wide main streets, seems closer to hell than to heaven. Other roads overlook the surrounding cratered paddyfields and a few large stagnant ponds. The banks, government offices, police station and post office stand on wasteland. Everything looks unplanned and unfinished, as though this urban project had been abruptly abandoned at an early stage – which may well be the case, given the circumstances of the 1970s. Phonsavanh is also the dustiest town I have ever been in – and before pronouncing this judgement I searched my memory carefully. Motor traffic is minimal but on windy winter days a dust cloud replaces vehicle pollution. And the social atmosphere is uneasy – not tense but curiously restless, as if people feel they don’t belong (which in a sense they don’t, being recent transplants) and can’t take seriously Phonsavanh’s status as a provincial capital. Yet individually the inhabitants, representing a bewildering tribal mix, are friendly.",

For Than Win, this was HIV’s ghastly end point: someone moaning for death and covered in their own filth. It was a glimpse into her future unless she did something soon. After her uncle died and they left the hospital together, Than Win’s grandmother scolded her and wailed.",

With the other hand he silently gesticulated; and the moonlight, falling upon his bare brow, showed him to have dark hair, and a high forehead of the shape seen oftener in old prints and paintings than in real life. His curious and altogether alien aspect, his strange gestures, like those of one who is rehearsing a scene to himself, and the unusual place and hour, were sufficient to account for any trepidation among the Hintock daughters at encountering him.",
