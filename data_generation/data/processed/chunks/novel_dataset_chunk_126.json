One entered from a street through a gate set in the wall: one rang a bell, and presently la concierge pressed a button which released the door. Inside, it was very quiet and still and grey with the grey morning light of New Year’s Day. And all the city was shut out. Then they entered Starwick’s studio: in the grey light a big room with a slanting roof of grey glazed glass emerged: around the walls were paintings, the limbs and fragments of unfinished sculptures, a few chairs and tables, and a couch bed. At the back there was a balcony, and steps ascending to it: here too there was a cot, and Starwick told Eugene he could sleep up there.",

Every time he turns one he utters the lotus prayer and flicks forward one of the 108 beads on his string, amassing multiples by a system I cannot understand. He is near the telling of a million prayers now, he says. Under his tangled hair his face has the calm burnish of a statue. ‘I do this not just for myself but for everybody. I do this for the world. For all its souls.’\nI listen to him tramping down the aisle of wheels, his Om mani padme hum droning, repeating, fading. I wonder how he sees the soul. Is he also praying for mine? The soul leaves no tracks across the ashes of the hearth, says local shamanism, and passes noiselessly over dead leaves. Sometimes it takes the form of a bee. Sometimes it can even die.\nLong after the old man has moved on, the turned prayer-drums whirr like a flock of birds taking off into the night.",

Mrs M. had written me that having a bathroom made her “almost happy.” The kitchen-sitting room was about eight feet wide by twelve feet long, furnished with an old cooker and fridge, a small sink, a kitchen cabinet, a high-backed carved dark wood bench, a round table and metal folding chairs. The bedroom was also twelve feet long but only wide enough for a less than single bed and small bedside table. Bookshelves were nailed high on the wall in a corner, a chest of drawers and a small round table filled the end by the window.",

Everyone else seemed to be inside the resort hotels and nightclubs where they splashed in saltwater pools and sipped frozen cocktails under palm fronds and beach umbrellas. On one corner, we passed a group of young children, eight or ten years old I guessed. They saw us from a mile away. Euro! Euro! They held out their tiny hands and smiled big, toothy grins. I reached into my pocket and found the sticks of gum that I got as change the day before. One child, a pretty girl with long black hair, grabbed the gum with one hand and held out the other. She smiled and laughed, then shouted again, Euro! Euro! The children followed us for a full block, but lost interest at the first corner.

As soon as we stood before them we realised that the moment of our unmasking had come. As we had agreed to do in such a case, I began to speak to Marchese in French. Immediately the Indian broke in, speaking also in French, and told us to open our packs. When he saw my English-Tibetan grammar he said we might just as well say who we were. We then admitted that we were escaped prisoners but did not give away our nationality.",

The sea is reversing the flow of history, lifting pages from the pile of paper, so that even as time moves forwards day by day it also moves backwards year by year. When the sea recedes, a fresh silt surface is exposed – and sometimes this surface will carry the marks of prehistoric foot-journeys. The prints are legible again only for a few days or even a few hours. Each newly revealed layer survives only until the next strong tide or storm, when it in turn is lifted off to uncover the one beneath.",

Through cloud breaks they sometimes saw Wrangel Island’s humpbacked silhouette in the distance, and that drove them onward. The dogs were now slat ribbed and weak, sometimes buckling to their knees.

The archway at the top of these shallow steps, avoiding the threatened anticlimax of a flattened ogee, deviated in two round-topped lobes on either side with a right-angled central cleft slashed deep between the cusps. There had been days, I was told, when horsemen on the way to the indoor lists rode in full armour up these steps: lobster-clad riders slipping and clattering as they stooped their ostrich-plumes under the freak doorway, gingerly carrying their lances at the trail to keep the bright paint that spiralled them unchipped. But in King Vladislav’s vast Hall of Homage the ribs of the vaulting had further to travel, higher to soar. Springing close to the floor from reversed and bisected cones, they sailed aloft curving and spreading across the wide arch of the ceiling: parting, crossing, re-joining, and – once again – enclosing those slim subdivided tulips as they climbed. Then they cast their intertwining arcs in wider and yet wider loops with the looseness and the overlap of lassoos kept perpetually on the move, accelerating, as they ascended, to the speed of coiling stockwhips … Spaced out along the wide ridge of the vault, their intersections composed the corollas of marguerites and then fled away once more into wider patterns that needed another shift of focus to apprehend. Travelling the length of that arched vista of ceiling, the loops of the stone ribs expanded and crossed and changed partners, simultaneously altering direction and handing on the succession of arcs until the parabolas, reaching the far limit of this strange curvilinear relay-race, began to swing back. Nearing home and completing the journey in reverse, they rejoined their lost companions at their starting point and sank tapering and interlocked. The sinuous mobility entranced the eye, but it was not only this. Lit by the wintry chiaroscuro of the tall windows, the white tulip-shaped expanses that these stone ribs enclosed so carelessly seemed to be animated by an even more rapid and streamlined verve. Each of these incidental and sinuous facets reflected a different degree of white, and their motion, as they ascended the reversed half-cones of the vault and curled over into the ceiling, suggested the spreading and upward-showering rush of a school of dolphins leaping out of the water.",

We chose high, dry ground, as Karl instructed, and set about our usual preparations. I couldn’t work with my wounded hand and just sat watching Karl and Kevin set up camp, while Marcus ground spices together with stones that he found lying about. After the tent was up, Karl began skinning the sloth. It was a difficult task, because he didn’t have a sharp enough knife. The monkey was easier. Karl tossed the whole thing into the fire, and its fur burned right off. It was a disgusting sight: its face was all shrivelled up, its teeth and nose bone were stark white, the eye sockets were creepy, and the hands and feet looked human. I could hardly stand to watch. Karl was soon crouched over the stream cleaning out the innards and thoroughly washing the entire carcass. I helped him cut the animals to pieces. He stuck the sloth meat on green, skewer like branches and set them down near the fire.",

The Red Sea, which separates like a forked serpent’s tongue the continent of Africa from the countries of Asia, had almost finished me with its searing heat and relentless headwinds. Unable to sleep for more than thirty minutes at a time for twenty days as a result of the weather, the sea conditions and a continuously breaking engine, I was overcome with dizziness and fever spells, and my normally 120-pound frame had shrunken to a skeletal 105 by the time Varuna arrived in Egypt. I hadn’t regained enough strength before setting out through the Mediterranean, and had paid the price by almost losing my boat and my life 200 miles off the coast of Spain, with only a brief respite in Gibraltar before heading across the Atlantic. I had no choice. The deadline was bearing down like a grizzly after a field mouse and I had to carry on.",

She had no playmates, no inseparable girl companion. She did not want them. She never formed one of those violent, sometimes short-lived intimacies in which two female children form embattled secret cabal against their masculine co-evals and the mature world too. She did nothing. She might as well still have been a foetus. It was as if only half of her had been born, that mentality and body had somehow become either completely separated or hopelessly involved; that either only one of them had ever emerged, or that one had emerged, itself not accompanied by, but rather pregnant with, the other. “Maybe she’s fixing to be a tomboy,” her father said.",

And, for my part, I was getting so fed up with apologizing for myself, and having to be apologized for, that I ended up having a brief, bitter row with them. I told them I wanted to phone Tokyo and they said I would have to use the pay phone, which only took ten-yen coins one at a time. That was ridiculous, I scoffed, since I should need to insert about two hundred coins at four-second intervals. So I insisted, to their unconcealed annoyance, on phoning the operator on the ryokan’s private phone and getting her to tell me the time and charges. They fumed all the way through the call, and when I had finished it and gone back upstairs, I heard them ring the operator again to make sure I’d quoted them the right amount. I expect it was my language skills they mistrusted.",

The streets were empty, and the shops closed for the day. I tried to admire the tree-lined streets and broad sidewalks, but the scene felt too familiar, too staged, too suburban. Frustrated and bored of our walk, I flagged a passing taxi. As we settled into our seats, Abdel, the driver, turned off his stereo and treated us to his ethnography of the city. His father sent him to university, where he earned a degree, in what I cannot remember, but he made more money driving a taxi, he explained. Years ago, when Abdel was very young, his family tended a plot of land not far from the corner where he found us. That was before Nasser dammed the river and the fields turned to dust, Abdel told us. He rubbed his fingers together and threw an imaginary pinch of dust to the wind. There was a time, he continued, when all of Giza – from the Nile to the pyramids – would flood every year: farmland one day, an ocean the next. He waved his hand over the dashboard to illustrate the annual floods. In wet years, the water would spread across the valley and swallow the Sphinx and the pyramids till there was nothing left to see, he declared. Abdel laced his stories with a healthy share of hyperbole, but his point was well taken. Within his lifetime, concrete and steel swallowed a way of life that pre-dated Egypt itself. The farms live on, all over Giza, but you can’t see them from the street, you have to look.",

She quietly asked if Deborah was “interested in Christmas” to which Deborah responded with a questioning nod. The Saudi woman beckoned her to follow. They arrived at the Saudi lady’s house on camp and proceeded directly upstairs, where this gal opened the spare bedroom door. To Deborah’s amazement she was staring at about forty assembled Christmas trees. Each had been unboxed and set up ready for this one-to-one marketing effort. Apparently, this gal’s cousin or nephew was employed at Dammam port, where shipments arrived and were culled for various and sundry illegal imports—like Christmas trees. This fellow was the quintessential entrepreneur; his relative was well placed to fetch more than market value for holiday trees by living on the compound—one of the fun ways to be in the recycling business in Arabia.",

I wondered if he could have been of Armenian descent: numbers of these, respected for their nimble wits and teased for their prominent noses, were scattered about the country like little gatherings of toucans. But it wasn’t an Armenian name, nor yet Hungarian. Rumanian names originating in a profession – equivalent of ‘Potter’ or ‘Tyler’ – sometimes ended in –ar, but not here, I think: well-known engravings of Kossuth and Déak hung in his drawing-room and apart from the not very fluent German in which we conversed, Magyar was his only language. I had dinner with him and his family in a restaurant in the main street under a new moon and a trellis heavy with lilac (orgona in Magyar; the word has suddenly surfaced in my mind after nearly half a century). The air was motionless after the shower and it was suddenly very hot. The little town was full of evening strollers and many of them halted at our table for a chat; I had a mental glimpse of what towns on the Great Plain must be like in August. Dinner, and then bed appeared as though pre-ordained. Raven-fed like Elijah, I was no longer surprised; but never stopped rejoicing.",

    "target_paragraph": "In feeling and workmanship a far cry from the Tortoise Fountain, and more typical of the Roman water-art, the great fountain century there having been the 17th. The fountain figures, when there are any, are neither sensitive in the Florentine fashion nor academic. They are on the whole coarse, and have often a careless-looking air of not having quite left the state of raw materials—showing more plainly than dry sculpture the baroque derivation from late Michelangelo. Their subtlety is of the grand stride, the profound suggestion, the fantastical arrangement, e.g. the position of the obelisk in Piazza Navona. Bernini appears to have learned a great deal from the Apollo Belvedere in his youth, but the most obvious parentage for the Triton, who is more than anything a study in back muscles, is the Belvedere Torso, by Apollonius son of Nestor, sculptor also of the bronze Sitting Boxer in the Museo Nazionale. It recalls Pasquin too, that nearly shapeless lump of marble out on a street corner, so hidden behind its other, satiric personality it is hard to think of as art, which Bernini is said to have called the most beautiful statue in Rome. Another round sinewy back, same masculine vigor and realistic modeling, just adumbrated now, and with a further energy from the activity, only to be guessed at, of the group it is broken off from. The explosive suggestion of these paraplegic stones, headless besides or nearly, was what genius in Bernini’s own explosive time could use. The Triton is an athlete—of the spirit; no trickler; he blows his single jet of water straight up in the air.",

He wore the characteristic earthquake look, a dazed and bewildered expression of countenance; he spoke in a singularly deliberate manner. Knowing the country, I was soon bending my steps in the direction of the cemetery, chiefly for the sake of the exquisite view from those windswept heights, and to breathe more freely after the dust and desolation of the lower parts. This burial-ground is in the same state as that of Messina, once the pride of its citizens; the insane frolic of nature has not respected the slumber of the dead or their commemorative shrines; it has made a mockery of the place, twisting the solemn monuments into repulsive and irreverential shapes.\nBut who can recount the freaks of stone and iron during those moments—the hair-breadth escapes? My companion’s case was miraculous enough. Awakened from sleep with the first shock, he saw, by the dim light of the lamp which burns in all their bedrooms, the wall at his bedside weirdly gaping asunder. He darted to reach the opening, but it closed again and caught his arm in a stony grip. Hours seemed to pass—the pain was past enduring; then the kindly cleft yawned once more, allowing him to jump into the garden below. Simultaneously he heard a crash as the inner rooms of the house fell; then climbed aloft, and for four days wandered among the bleak, wet hills. Thousands were in the same plight.\nI asked what he found to eat.",
