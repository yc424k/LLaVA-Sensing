Near our camp we came on another squalid miners’ settlement, even more depressing than yesterday’s, and not far from that was a long-established mining-town which stank of piss’n’shit. Everything looked decrepit and sleazy, including several newish eight-storey blocks of jerry-built flats. It was then 7.45 a.m. but few people were about and there was no food, drink or fodder to be had. It took us over an hour to get through this town, which is built in tiers on an unreasonably steep mountainside overlooking a gorge so deep we couldn’t see its floor. The road fell from one tight hair-pin bend to another in as remarkable a display of engineering genius as ever I’ve seen. When we paused to gaze up at it from the base of the mountain it literally did look like a corkscrew. A truck-bus arrived just then from Pampas but made no attempt to ascend the ‘main street’.",

This would be followed by dinner in a neighborhood bistro of charm and hearty portions. But diversions of this or any other type seemed signally lacking in the sleepy streets of Canberra. Eventually, and abruptly, I turned a corner and was downtown. Here at last were stores and restaurants and all the other commercial amenities of a city, but all were closed. Downtown Canberra was primarily a series of plazas wandering between retail premises, and devoid of any sign of life but for a noise of slap and clatter that I recognized after a moment as the sound of skateboards. Having nothing better to do, I followed the sounds to an open square where half a dozen adolescents, all in backward-facing baseball caps and baggy shorts, were honing their modest and misguided skills on a metal railing. I sat for a minute on a bench and with morbid interest watched them risking compound fractures and severe testicular trauma for the fleeting satisfaction of sliding along a banister for a distance of from zero inches to a couple of feet before being launched by gravity and the impossibility of maintaining balance into space in the direction of an expanse of unyielding pavement. It seemed a remarkably foolish enterprise.",

On the other, it plunged south-west down a gorge that would lead to the lowlands, and, at last, to the everyday world: but there was no hint of this yet. The chasm was silent except for the sound of water and the echo of an occasional rock falling. But while I gazed, clouds at the head of the ravine were breaking loose and spreading crumpled shadows across the juts and the clefts; then they blotted out the sun in an abrupt upland storm. The wind sent a few sighting shots, followed by a swish of raindrops. Sheltering under an overhang, I watched them turn into hailstones the size of mothballs: they bounced and scattered downhill by the million; and in half an hour, their white drifts were all that was left. The washed rocks looked newly cut, there was not a cloud in sight and a breeze smelling of bracken and wet earth kept the air from stagnating.",

Shoppers shopping, beggars begging, taxis loading and unloading, traffic racing, teenagers stuffing their faces with fast foods, hawkers trading, Muslim schoolchildren streaming home from their academy beside an imposing mosque, the dainty little girls wearing long stockings and tight headscarves despite the heat. Perhaps at that very moment unspeakable atrocities were being committed nearby. Yet I find myself unable to believe that South Africa now – even kwaZulu/Natal – is a country about to implode into civil war. Am I being an obtuse outsider, unaware of all the nuances? Or as an outsider am I sensing something the South Africans themselves have lost sight of under the pressure of day-by-day destabilizations? I am very conscious of a nationwide longing for peace and calm, a force that feels stronger than the destabilizers.",

I paused to look in some shop window and realized after a moment that a middle-aged man a few yards to my right was peeing down the front of it, as discreetly as he could on a lighted street, which wasn’t very discreetly at all. He was seriously intoxicated, but he had a suit on and looked prosperous and educated, and I felt immensely disappointed in him, and in all the hundreds of people who had dropped hamburger boxes and crisp packets all over the streets. This was unworthy of the Swedes. I expected better than that.",

The name had called to his mind a vision of sweet, green fields, thick-sown with towns and villages. It was, he had thought, a place of peace and tranquil spires, as well as a kind of wonderful urbs in rure, a lovely countryside of which all parts were within an hour's run of London, a place where one could enjoy bucolic pleasures without losing any of the convenient advantages of the city, and a place where one was never out of hailing distance of his neighbour. But the region they had now come to was not at all like this. It was densely wooded, and as wild and desolate on that stormy night as any spot he had ever seen. As the car ground slowly up the tortuous road, it seemed to George that they were climbing the fiendish slope of Nightmare Hill, and he rather expected that when the moon broke from the clouds again they would find themselves in a cleared and barren circle in the forest, surrounded by the whole witches' carnival of Walpurgis Night. The wind howled through the rocking trees with insane laughter, the broken clouds scudded across the heavens like ghosts in flight, and the car lurched, bumped, groaned, and lumbered its way up a road which must have been there when the Romans came to Rye, and which, from the feel of it, had not been repaired or used since. There was not a house or a light in sight.",

We are much happier in the Residencial Plaza, also just off the Plaza de Armas, where for 380 soles we have a double room (sans bedding) with a big table beneath a dim electric light bulb. There is no window, but the door opens onto a balcony running around three sides of an open patio where geraniums blaze and sheets are hung to dry.

Helped by Namu and Tasi Fintso, he loads yak meat and potatoes on the four remaining yaks and dzos that stand hobbled in front of the gompa. With their short noses and short fluffy tails, yaks have an appealing air, but they are shaggy brutes of a half-ton or better, with rude temperaments to match. Tasi Fintso is gingerly in their presence, but Tundu is firm and gentle with the balky animals, talking to them in a soft no-nonsense way as he straps on pack saddles of wood and leather, hoists cargo sacks of striped brown-and-white homespun, and lashes down the lot with braided rope. There is a quiet in his actions that gives him a strong presence, and apparently he is the headman here: he will bring the key to the gompa in five days or so, when he comes back from Saldang. Without a word, he leads his yaks away into the east, leaving behind his little girl, Chiring Doma, who sits on a blanket with Nyima Poti, eating potatoes in the sun. The gompa yard is windy and cold, yet Nyima Poti is naked, while her brother, Karma Chambel, is clad in a rag smock. In her dust and burlap, the red-cheeked Chiring Doma looks like a smiling potato given life. Once Tundu is gone, Namu resumes her work of spreading yak-dung fuel to dry along the prayer walls and abandoned houses.",

    "target_paragraph": "After breakfast the next morning, I strolled in the dewy morning greyness and exchanged greetings with a passing old couple, who were one of the few pairs of guests at the ranch during this post-Christmas period. At the top of a hill I sat on a bench and watched cows chewing the cud on the grassy slopes, and the sweetest kid goat bleating forlornly for its mother. Within minutes, the mist rolled in amazingly quickly, erasing the hills, cows and trees, and wrapping me in a sea of white oblivion. I strolled down to the ranch’s Beehive Natural Reserve, a wedge of forest at the bottom of a hill with a tropical microclimate all of its own. In a matter of minutes I went from the Yorkshire Dales to a humid rainforest rustling with dewy, hundred-year-old ferns.\nThe afternoon sun vaporised the mist, allowing me to take a ride on the cable car, the ‘longest in Africa’. The car floated above the hills and cows grazing next to a precipice I hadn’t realised was there. As I moved above and past it, the ground plunged into a valley hundreds of feet deep, giving the impression that the cable car was taking off vertically. Yellow-grassed mountain peaks jutted in every direction, interspersed with red-leafed trees. And it was deathly quiet, the cable car moving along as if propelled on silent wings.\nThree maintenance workers passed me in the opposite direction and waved hello, nonchalantly reclining in a shallow metal crate and looking perfectly at ease with the frightening altitude. Suddenly, my cable car stopped. Perhaps the electricity had cut out. My car hung noiselessly, suspended in mid-air. Fighting an urge to throw my notebook out of the window, I eyed the valley floor through the glass floor. For three minutes I sat back and daydreamed in the cool, tranquil air. Stillness of this kind was hard to come by in urban Nigeria; I inhaled deeply, savouring every moment, amazed at the restorative power of a few minutes of dead air. My mind was made up: this is what I ultimately needed, to be away from the commotion of people and okadas, and away from the oppressive sterility of quiet hotels – hanging in the middle of absolutely nowhere, in a mist of white nothingness. Sometimes, changing altitude, not latitude, was the best way to find peace.",

From inside the most modern church in town, I heard choirs singing hallelujahs in the cool, severely tall white nave. Hallgrimskirkja has the whitest, chastest interior I have ever seen, snow-capped islands misty through the windows behind its altar’s cross.

The long sable cloak, which had slipped back over the chair, justified Mme. Lebel’s description, but the dress beneath it appeared to Campton simpler than Mrs. Brant’s habitual raiment. The lamplight, striking up into her powdered face, puffed out her underlids and made harsh hollows in her cheeks. She looked frightened, ill and yet determined.",

Israeli citizens were not allowed to stay overnight on the West Bank but for Levinger the governor, Uzi Nrkiss, made an exception.

In a side room was a small theater showing one of those desperately upbeat promotional films with a title like Canberra—It’s Got It All!—the ones that boast how you can water-ski and shop for an evening gown and have a pizza all in the same day because this place has…got it all! You know the kind I mean. But I watched the film happily because the room was air-conditioned and it was a pleasure to sit after walking so far. It was just as well that I didn’t require an evening gown or a pizza or water-skiing when I returned to the street because I couldn’t find a thing anywhere. My one tip for you if you ever go to Canberra is don’t leave your hotel without a good map, a compass, several days’ provisions, and a cell phone with the number of a rescue service. I walked for two hours through green, pleasant, endlessly identical neighborhoods, never entirely confident that I wasn’t just going around in a large circle. From time to time I would come to a leafy rotary with spoked roads radiating off in various directions, each presenting an identical vista of antipodean suburban heaven, and I would venture down the one that looked most likely to take me to civilization only to emerge ten minutes later at another identical rotary. I never saw another soul on foot or anyone watering a lawn or anything like that. Very occasionally a car would glide past, pausing at each intersection, the driver looking around with a despairing expression that said, “Now, where the fuck is my house?”",

And one still feels it, feels cut off from the rest of the world—though cars careen on roller-coaster roads, on one side the rock, on the other the precipice. In the coolness of the arched streets (which echo a fantastic archway in gigantic rock, brazen but inevitable in the water), in those streets where sobriety and intoxication fight for equal time, one feels it. Among the confused shining of hot cliffs one feels it. One feels it mostly as a blessing, but occasionally as a haunting. From a promontory in Capri Tiberius threw his victims to the sea, and there a band of Roman men received them and broke their bones with clubs and oars.",

A number of natives assembled to see us start, and they all shook hands with us, exchanging alohas, and presenting us with lei, of roses and ohias.

It was truly a feat of engineering. I packed up and spread the duff back over the site so it looked undisturbed. Exhausted from so little sleep after hiking forty-seven miles, I headed out. My head ached and I felt sluggish as I climbed. But once I attained the ridgeline, bathed in early morning light, I was rejuvenated. The dazzle of the sun chased the cobwebs from my mind as well as the chill from my skin. At last I dropped to a highway crossing where I discovered a woman in a lawn chair with breakfast: fruit, coffee, and other staples.",

Simple wooden crosses, embedded in the evergreens, bore photographs of the dead, and messages from their families – often ‘To The Rumanian People’ – and commemorative poems carefully handwritten, mounted on wood and protected by transparent plastic. People of all ages, on their way to work, were crossing the wide streets to light candles and stand by this memorial for a little time. No doubt some were relatives or friends of the dead and the majority still looked traumatised. Many crossed themselves repeatedly and prayed before one of the icons, kneeling on the ice. A few added new inscriptions, tying them to the fir branches with numb, fumbling fingers. Some leant forward, their faces taut, staring intently at the photographs as though striving to reinforce their own courage by recalling the courage of those heroes. The silence was complete; no one spoke, or prayed aloud, or sobbed – or even looked at anybody else.",
