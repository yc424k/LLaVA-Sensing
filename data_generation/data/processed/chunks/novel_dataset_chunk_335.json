Beams of light shine in through our windshield and bounce eerily around the fabric of our tent. I am not at all used to this idea of sleeping in a public place in the middle of the wilderness, so the arrival of a stranger in the night is intimidating. I push aside thoughts of theft or assault, and unzip my window and peer out. A beaten-up old car parks nearby. I wonder if I should go find the can of bear spray that is our only weapon, but I don’t want to take my eyes off the vehicle. There is some movement and a headlamp beam flickers around. I watch as long as my weary eyes let me but eventually fall asleep again.",

The sky is bowed and veined like a blue shell, pressing down hard in the brief segments of canopy that it’s managed to push apart. The jungle seems confused, the smells familiar but not, thicker than it was, wetter, sweeter. The pervasive rot, the slickness of new growth, the waning of another rainy season that I’ve again missed. I don’t care that rainy season sounds awful. I just wish I’d been here. The path trails in front of us. At first all I can feel is the weight of it pressing on my shoulders. I stagger along with a bowed head, gazing at the backs of Mila’s yellow gumboots. We walked down the road in silence, past Wayra’s witch trees, and in at the turning by the big lagoon. I can’t think where she’s taking me. Not to Wayra’s, anyway. And other than that, I don’t think I care. I will never see her again. The sounds pass me by, the smells. I think my feet are on the ground but otherwise, I’m not there. I could be back in Buenos Aires, lying on that sticky plastic bed, or on a flight to London, drinking wine and watching mind-numbing, awful reruns of Friends.",

I won’t say the Georgia Mountain had food I would travel for, even within Hiawassee, but it was certainly reasonably priced. For $5.50 each, we got “meat and three,” a trip to the salad bar, and dessert. I ordered fried chicken, black-eyed peas, roast potatoes, and “ruterbeggars,” as the menu had it—I had never had them before, and can’t say I will again.

He stole a glance at his companion, wondering if she shared his feelings. Her rapt profile betrayed no unrest, but politeness might have caused her to feign an interest that she did not feel. He leaned back impatiently, stifling another yawn, and trying to fix his attention on the stage. Great things were going forward there, and he was not insensible to the stern beauties of the ancient drama. But the interpretation of the play seemed to him as airless and lifeless as the atmosphere of the theatre. The players were the same whom he had often applauded in those very parts, and perhaps that fact added to the impression of staleness and conventionality produced by their performance. Surely it was time to infuse new blood into the veins of the moribund art. He had the impression that the ghosts of actors were giving a spectral performance on the shores of Styx.",

Gradually, these businesses evolved into roadside taverns offering cold beer, sports TV, and bar girls, who rented rooms in cheap motels nearby. “The main thing they wash clean is your wallet,” he said.",

Perhaps the fear of ice-jams kept boats at anchor. I could walk for hours without hearing a siren. At rare intervals a string of barges, usually from one of the Balkan Kingdoms, would toil upstream with a cargo of wheat. After delivering their freight and loading up with planks or paving stones, they would glide downstream again with the current. These cargoes were quarried and felled from the banks. Huge horseshoe-cavities were blasted out of the cliffs, and the mountains, from the water’s edge to their summits, were a never-ending stand of timber. Deep in snow, the nearly perpendicular rides sundered the forests in long white stripes that were scattered with thousands of felled tree-trunks like the contents of spilled match-boxes. Smaller trunks were cut and stacked in clearings and I could hear the sound of the felling and the voices of the woodmen long before I saw them. From the riverside, every mile or so, rose the zing of a circular saw and the echo of planks falling, where cloudy ghosts covered in sawdust were dismembering sledge-load after sledge-load of forest giants.",

They are renowned for their longevity and their taste for butter buried in the ground for one hundred years. Huddled miserably in the back of the truck we left the valley and entered a harsh landscape that reminded me of the wastelands of Arthurian romances. We crossed a wide, deserted plateau, flat-bottomed and covered in sand dunes. White outcrops rose from the granite slopes, riddled with holes like diseased teeth. Then we turned into the valley of the Gilgit River and the road became lost in the pebbles of the alluvial plain. The truck skidded on the rocks and splashed through tributary streams. Twice we passed side valleys blocked with the white mass of unmelted glaciers. It grew increasingly cold, and the drizzle changed to half-hearted gusts of snow.",

It does not lure me. That the jasmine on the high fences has climbed to my third floor and blooms profusely around the stair railing, I am thankful for. At night after work, I can step out to water my pots and watch for stars and find the tumbling vines sending out their dense perfume. Such flowers—jasmine, honeysuckle, gardenia—spell South, metabolic home, to my psyche. A fragmental connection though—my feet are three stories off the earth. When I leave my house, concrete separates my feet from the ground. The people who have bought the flats on the first and second floors are friends. We have meetings to discuss when to repair the steps or when to paint. I look into or onto the tops of trees, wonderful trees. My house backs onto the very private gardens unhinted at by the joined fronts of Victorian houses in my neighborhood. The center of the block is green. If all of us took down our fences, we could wander in a blooming green sward. Because I like my flat so much, I didn’t know what I missed.",

The rock and coral sticking up, all the sea life down in the cracks.”",

The new black crinkly hair around her ears belied the rest – straightened, dyed auburn, pulled tightly back into a ponytail. Moreover, her purely European features are contradicted by distinctively African buttocks – also to be observed among certain Afrikaner women whose ancestors mated democratically. (The longer one spends in South Africa the more sensitive one becomes to these physiological nuances; not a desirable sensitivity, but inevitable.) Sadly, Cinder likes to present herself as white: there was much talk about her Irish mother, and growing up on a big farm, and her wonderful father who was related to the Duke of Kent … Well, I know nothing of the Dukes of Kent and I daresay it’s possible that one contributed to the Cape’s gene pool.",

The shadows were beginning to slope across grass cropped as level as a lawn, and the sound of munching was broken now and then by the deep clank of the bell-wethers. Even the ewes had short curved horns, the lambs shorter still; but bell-wethers and rams were armed with heavy crinkled spirals that could have shaken the walls of Jericho. The woods still mounted interminably but now dark streaks of pine strove with the deciduous trunks and entwined their roots with those of oak and alder and hornbeam. It was only possible to descry the tops of the lower mountains now by peering from the outer edge, where the tree-tops fell away. The westering sun lit a faraway parade of level clouds, and shade filled the intervening valleys. The lower sierras of the Banat, several leagues away, were rimmed with light like a half-submerged shoal of sea-creatures.",

I lean my cheek against the hot metal of the truck and watch motorbikes swerve over potholes and kick dust into the air. I’m parked just outside the mercado, the town’s covered market. Inside, people come together to share stews and meat on sticks. Around the food are stalls that sell anything from monkey wrenches to princess crowns to knock-off electronics to watermelons. Along one side of the market, next to the food tables, are the butchers, where flies congregate and blood and the smell of old meat drips off hanging carcasses. Doña Bernita, our meat lady, is second on the right. It’s from her that I picked up the cows’ heads, hanging from hooks above her white tiled table. We respectfully stuffed them into sacks before I lugged them, horns and all, into the truck.",

Ah!” she broke off on a deep breath; for a faint vibration, less of light than of air, a ripple of coming life, had begun to flow over the sky and the opposite mountains, hushing every incipient sound. There was a lull after that first tremor; a lull lasting so long that it seemed as if, after all, nothing in the landscape had moved or altered. Then Miss Spear, laying her hand on Vance’s shoulder, turned him about toward a break in the swarthy fell of the eastern mountains; and through it came the red edge of the sun. They watched in silence as it hung there apparently unmoving; then they glanced away for a moment, and when they looked back they saw that it had moved; saw the forerunning glow burn away the ashen blur in the forest hollows, the upper sky whiten, and daylight take possession of the air. Again they turned westward, looking toward the Hudson, and now the tawny suffusion was drawing down the slopes of the farther shore, till gradually, very gradually, the river hollows also were washed of their mists, and the great expanse of the river shone bright as steel in the clear shadow.",

    "target_paragraph": "Mila and Agustino both left the parque about six years ago. Not easily. It was long, drawn out and painful. They suffered from undiagnosed PTSD, grief, stress on top of stress on top of stress. They have other jobs now, other families, in other parts of Bolivia, and I hope they are happy. In the years since, despite their roles being portioned off in an attempt to make the running of this place more sustainable, it isn’t sustainable. This isn’t a conventional job. We need local staff, but local staff are hard to find. The pay is low, the conditions difficult. We continue to depend on foreigners and volunteers that might leave at the drop of a hat—or that might stay, but who knows? We ask people to give up their lives and often their mental and physical health for little money. People have been doing this same thing for decades, in grassroots organisations and NGOs across the world, because there’s always the next disaster to deal with, right, and too little support? But every year, it seems to get harder, particularly for the people who stay. Friends leave, volunteers don’t extend their trips anymore. The world is uncertain, jobs are harder to secure. Travellers stick to their schedules. They travel to a plan and it’s rare that they’ll change it, even for something as magical as peeling away your onion layers and losing all your body weight and probably your hair just to make the jungle happy.",

At 11.05 we were on the doorstep, planning to buy emergency rations for our trek. But alas! This tienda’s edibles were limited to maize crisps (dyed orange and red), packets of six sweet biscuits from Argentina, chewing-gum from Brazil (does that count as an edible?) and toffees sold singly at half a convertible peso apiece. Glass-topped cabinets displayed imported plastic toys, children’s garments, two boxed sets of tin cutlery and a few enamel dinner plates. Behind the counter a high shelf held five dusty bottles of Scotch and two of London Dry Gin.",

Scree slowed the pace and buttresses of rock, smooth as boiler-plates or spiked like iguanas, imposed gruelling swerves. Gleams across the cliffs revealed faraway threads of water; close to, they coiled and cataracted through the tree-trunks as the ledges of the forest dropped. The conifers abdicated when the hardwoods began to outnumber them; and the ravine, deepening fast, coaxed the trees higher and higher until the oaks, mantled with ivy, pronged with the antlers of dead boughs and tufted with mistletoe, grew into giants. Clearings of beech opened their forest-chambers and bracken gave way to mares’ tails, hemlock and the tatters of old man’s beard. The damp, which covered everything with moss, looped the branches with creepers and plumed the clefts and forks overhead, and the flaking bark, shaggy with lichen, greaved the tree-trunks like metal tainted with verdigris, filling the slanting world underneath with a stagey green-grey light. The woods had become an undercroft of acorns, beech-nuts and moaning wood-pigeons; the sound of water grew louder; and soon, flecked by leaf-shadows and askim with wagtails and redstarts, the ice-cold Cerna was rushing by under the branches. The mysterious river split and joined again round blades of rock, slid over shelves that combed it into symmetrical waterfalls and rushed on chopping and changing down the gorge. Then I came down into quieter reaches. Shoals of trout anchored themselves among the reflections of elderflower or glided to new retreats, deep in the shade, where only a few wrinkles hinted at the current, and the black rocks, which gave the river its dark Slavonic name, cumbered the depths.",

San Luca, an Aspromonte mountain village in the Locride is the historic seat, where heads of the local organizations from all over the world meet once a year in a nearby Christian sanctuary. Many Italians view the whole area with trepidation. Once, returning from Reggio by train, I got into a conversation with a young man from Catania, Sicily, a city with a considerable criminal element. He had recently moved to Locri where he was living with his fiancée’s family. His Sicilian parents were against the relocation—they feared for him. He said that at first he felt like a gumshoe in a B movie, cautiously looking around corners before he rounded them, literally expecting to be confronted with illicit activity at every turn. However, suspicious looks were all he observed. Upon entering a barbershop, for example, conversation would immediately stop until he identified who had sent him, and only then would the cold mistrust begin to recede from their eyes.",

With all its anfractuous and crazy anomalies Athens was Europe. Nicosia could only be compared for twentieth-century amenities with some fly-blown Anatolian township, bemused and forgotten on the central steppes. On all sides we were confronted with modern towns like Beirut and Alexandria. The comparison was unfair, of course, but it was inevitable, and one made it mentally a hundred times a day. Nicosia was a town which had been left becalmed by the Turks, to drowse away its life on the dusty Mesaoria; what had been done to awaken it? There had been no need until now.",
