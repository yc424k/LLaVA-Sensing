I have noticed before that the author of Welcome to Ethiopia makes it a point of honour never to mislead faranjs on the subject of Ethiopian hotels, and in his anxiety to be objective he sometimes goes too far. This enormous, clean building is furnished with elaborate tastelessness and, to the extent that only two of its one hundred and four bedrooms are occupied tonight, it does perhaps justify the adjective gloomy. Yet the staff welcomed us so cheerfully that it seems to me quite a jolly place. Two maidservants conducted me to my room, down an interminable carpeted corridor on which I deposited ounces of mud at every step; and when I apologised for the havoc in my wake they laughed loudly, patted me forgivingly on the shoulder and told me that I was like a buccolo in the tukul. Perhaps they were glad to have something to do.",

On the stage, the satin-suited dancers entertaining the crowd were dressed in blackface, with black afro wigs, thick chocolatey face paint, bright red lipstick and chunky gold earrings. Perhaps a third of the people in the crowd were similarly attired. Close to where I was standing, near the steps leading up to the Erasmusbrug, a cute young girl shared a bag of pink candy with her bobble-hatted younger brother, both of them wearing fuzzy black wigs and black makeup. Behind them, their sandy-haired mother clapped happily along to the music, a wide grin cracking her thick dark face paint. Everywhere I looked there were blackface characters in striped gold-and-purple uniforms: clowning for the children, handing out crunchy pepernoten cookies, riding unicycles and directing traffic in the car park. In a country known for its enlightened attitudes, a tradition that was banned in much of the western world – and outlawed in Germany by Adolf Hitler in the 1930s – was apparently still going strong.",

They threw their arms around the soldiers’ necks, assisting the wounded, patting them shyly on the shoulders and calling them \"brave.\" Desperately poor themselves, they offered food, and beds, and fodder for the horses, inviting them to stay at Santo\nDomingo until they should become well. I already had a place to sleep.\nDon Pedro, the chief goatherd, had given me his room and his bed in a gush of warm-hearted generosity, and had removed himself and his family to the kitchen. He did so without hope of recompense, for he thought I had no money. And now everywhere men, women and children left their houses to make way for the defeated and weary troops.",

The terror and menace of such a disgrace were heightened by the intrusion into the scene at the apex of such a moment of riot and rebellion of one of his employers, the Dean, the head of the department, or a creature with a wry lean face, a convulsive Adam’s apple, a habit of writhing his lean belly and loins erotically as he spoke, and a mind of the most obscene Puritanism, who was employed to oversee the work and methods of the instructors: he could visualize the moment of their fatal entrance into the classroom, and hear their words of stern, curt and immediate dismissal as they drove him out and gathered the reins strongly into their own parched and freckled hands.",

In the fleets of general contractors, it had spent its lifetime ripping raw California land, making freeways, and preparing building sites on beaches and deserts. Who, watching it there—clanking, dozing, wheezing, roaring, grunting like Pete the Pig—could ever in farthest-fetched imaginings have guessed where it would go? It went to Seattle by train, and by barge to Whittier, in Prince William Sound. There the Alaska Railroad picked it up and took it to Fairbanks, where, in early April, a lowboy hauled it up the dirt road north. Forty miles from Central, the haul stopped—blocked by the still unbroken winter snows. The road had been smothered since October. Ed Gelvin, who was observing from the air, landed on the road and with Stanley put the blade on the Cat. The weather in a general way was warming. Snow was melting. Ice was beginning to rot. If the D9 was going to move up frozen stream beds and climb into the mountains, it had to keep going now. If the road was closed, the Cat would open it.",

Then I walked on through the pass and so crossed out of Hyogo Prefecture and into Okayama. The Kinki Region had taken me a bare seven days, but they had been very hard ones. Now, on the last leg of my walk through Honshu, I was entering the Chugoku (‘Middle Country’) District – not to be confused with Chubu (the ‘Middle District’, from Niigata to Fukui) nor with the Japanese word for China, which is also Chugoku (that land having been known throughout most of its history as the Middle Kingdom). ‘Middle’ at first seems an odd thing to call this extreme western tip of the main island, until you remember that the first Japanese settlements were almost certainly in the northern half of Kyushu while the first real center of political power grew up in the Nara basin. It is midway between these two pivotal points that the Middle Country lies.",

The owners, a nervous couple, were on the run from the law, and so was their one employee, a red-bearded draft dodger who went by a variety of names. They needed help, but all regarded me warily. Did I look like a federal agent? I was eighteen, rail-thin, with scraggly shoulder-length hair, a sardonic girlfriend, worn-out flip-flops, sun-faded trunks, a disintegrating T-shirt. They decided to take a chance. They had a comprehensive book-knowledge test, imported from the L.A. store. All prospective workers had to pass it. (The retail book business has changed since then.) The test was written, and was not take-home. Caryn spent an evening drilling me on titles and authors. It occurred to me that she had a better chance of passing the test than I did. (She later worked in a French-language bookstore near UCLA.) She was, in fact, the most widely read teenager I knew. As I surfed in the afternoon glare off Lahaina Harbor, she curled up on the seawall with Proust, in French. Still, I took the Either/Or test, and I got the job.",

It was hard to distinguish between the ‘public highway’ and the corridors that lead from one part of a dwelling to another, and for once no curious inhabitants appeared. Yet I was all the time aware of being watched as I hesitantly made my way through the twilit passages, towards the snow slopes beyond. I could not, however, get very much further.

I assumed he would carry it downstairs. I waited by the lift but nothing happened, walked back down the corridor and saw my suitcase. Picked it up. Was told by the floor wardress that I could not carry it. WHY? Because she must telephone downstairs for a porter to come up and collect it. WHY? It is the rule. Do it, do it, do it, I jabbered. And let me get out of this vile country before I blow my top.",

It had all the warmth of a concentration camp—barbed wire and bland design. Apparently, a cairn existed nearby where pilgrims of yore placed a stone from home, and that act would net them one hundred days off their stint in purgatory. Nowadays, a night at the Monte del Gozo refugio confers the same benefit. Thanks, but I’ll take my chances with purgatory: I had no desire to stay there, and, thankfully, neither did Colin. (Still, pilgrims were raving about Monte del Gozo like Pentacostals.)",

His hair was iron red and his face a splodge of freckles. Painfully shy, he failed to find a single fraternity that wished to have him as a member?a level of rejection that was more or less without precedent. Only the kindly Dwight Morrow befriended him. With all others he was almost completely silent. “Often hardly a word would pass his lips for days at a time, except such as were absolutely necessary to keep him supplied with food and to report his presence in the classroom,” the writer and advertising man Bruce Barton, also an Amherst alumnus, wrote years later in a recollection.",

She whined at us dismally that this was the house: the dusty rambling shuttered house stuffy with the smell of vermin, torn mosquito-wire across the windows. She couldn’t find the keys and gazing through the windows I could see stacks of missionary literature on wobbly tables and piles of broken filters against the peeling walls. ‘You see, I’m all alone here,’ the American woman wailed, trailing around the building looking for the keys, but she checked herself, when she had taken another look at my dirty shorts, my dirty face and unshaven skin, and when a little later I insisted, ‘Are you really quite alone?’ she wouldn’t answer the question, scared, I suppose, for her goods and her honour.",

All the pent-up passion of months, all the terrible, rending, destructive frustrations must burst forth from her heart: ‘Love me, only love me the way I love you. Angela, for God’s sake, try to love me a little—don’t throw me away, because if you do I’m utterly finished. You know how I love you, with my soul and my body; if it’s wrong, grotesque, unholy—have pity. I’ll be humble. Oh, my darling, I am humble now; I’m just a poor, heart-broken freak of a creature who loves you and needs you much more than its life, because life’s worse than death, ten times worse without you. I’m some awful mistake—God’s mistake—I don’t know if there are any more like me, I pray not for their sakes, because it’s pure hell. But oh, my dear, whatever I am, I just love you and love you. I thought it was dead, but it wasn’t. It’s alive—so terribly alive tonight in my bedroom…’ And so it went on for page after page.\nBut never a word about Roger Antrim and what she had seen that morning in the garden. Some fine instinct of utterly selfless protection towards this woman had managed to survive all the anguish and all the madness of that day. The letter was a terrible indictment against Stephen, a complete vindication of Angela Crossby.",

    "target_paragraph": "The King was aged 22 when installed as the eighth Zulu monarch in 1971. He makes an ideal pawn, being not very bright and fond of money. By European standards the Zulu monarchy is very new. Yet its power enabled King Zwelithini’s canny relatives – the Royal House – to legitimize Buthelezi’s rule over kwaZulu as an autocratic Chief Minister. That remained his status from 1976 until he became GNU’s Minister for Home Affairs.",

He would still go at nights and sit outside in the gardens of the Neue Börse. There were still people at the tables on the terrace. The gardens were almost bare. His feet would crunch sparely on the dry gravel. The doors and windows of the great café were closed. Inside, the place was crowded. The orchestra was playing. The air already was a little thick, thick with the warmth of food and people, thick with music, thick with beer. But he would sit out on the terrace, hearing a leaf that scratched across the gravel, feeling at length the ghost of Autumn in the air.",

She was as beautiful as always in the hard, morning light that came across the flooded square, and she said. “Please, Richard. Are you all right? Please?”\n“Sure,” the Colonel said. “You wonder beauty.”\n“Did you go to all our places in the market?”\n“Only a few of them. I did not go to where they have the wild ducks.”\n“Thank you.”\n“For nothing,” the Colonel said. “I never go there when we are not together.”\n“Don’t you think I should go to the shoot?”\n“No. I am quite sure. Alvarito would have asked you if he wanted you.”\n“He might not have asked me because he wanted me.”\n“That’s true,” the Colonel said, and pondered that for two seconds. “What do you want for breakfast?”\n“Breakfast is worthless here, and I don’t like the square when it is flooded. It is sad and the pigeons have no place to alight. It is only really fun toward the last when the children play. Should we go and have breakfast at the Gritti?”\n“Do you want to?”\n“Yes.”\n“Good. We’ll have breakfast there. I’ve had mine already.”\n“Really?”\n“I’ll have some coffee and hot rolls, and only feel them with my fingers. Are you awfully hungry?”\n“Awfully,” she said, truly.\n“We’ll give breakfast the full treatment,” the Colonel said. “You’ll wish you had never heard of breakfast.”\nAs they walked, with the wind at their back, and her hair blowing better than any banner, she asked him, holding close, “Do you still love me in the cold, hard Venice light of morning? It is really cold and hard isn’t it?”\n“I love you and it is cold and hard.”\n“I loved you all night when I was ski-ing in the dark.”\n“How do you do that?”\n“It is the same runs except that it is dark and the snow is dark instead of light. You ski the same; controlled and good.”\n“Did you ski all night? That would be many runs.”\n“No. Afterwards I slept soundly and well and I woke happy. You were with me and you were asleep like a baby.”\n“I wasn’t with you and I was not asleep.”\n“You’re with me now,” she said and held close and tight.\n“And we are almost there.”\n“Yes.”\n“Have I told you, yet, properly, that I love you?”\n“You told me. But tell me again.”\n“I love you,” he said. “Take it frontally and formally please.”\n“I take it anyway you want as long as it is true.”\n“That’s the proper attitude,” he said. “You good, brave, lovely girl. Turn your hair sideways once on top of this bridge and let it blow obliquely.”\nHe had made a concession, with obliquely, instead of saying, correctly, oblique.\n“That’s easy,” she said. “Do you like it?”\nHe looked and saw the profile and the wonderful early morning colour and her chest upstanding in the black sweater and her eyes in the wind and he said, “Yes. I like it.”\n“I’m very glad,” she said.",

He glanced at her, and ground out further steps in his argument, determined that no folly should remain when this experience was over. Next moment, a silence, sudden and complete, descended upon them all. The silence of all these people round the untidy table was enormous and hideous; something horrible seemed about to burst from it, but they endured it obstinately. A second later the door opened and there was a stir of relief; cries of ‘Hullo, Joan! There’s nothing left for you to eat,’ broke up the oppressive concentration of so many eyes upon the table-cloth, and set the waters of family life dashing in brisk little waves again. It was obvious that Joan had some mysterious and beneficent power upon her family. She went up to Katharine as if she had heard of her, and was very glad to see her at last. She explained that she had been visiting an uncle who was ill, and that had kept her. No, she hadn’t had any tea, but a slice of bread would do. Someone handed up a hot cake, which had been keeping warm in the fender; she sat down by her mother’s side, Mrs Denham’s anxieties seemed to relax, and everyone began eating and drinking, as if tea had begun over again. Hester voluntarily explained to Katharine that she was reading to pass some examination, because she wanted more than anything in the whole world to go to Newnham.*",

You can’t rot it out, you can’t rattle it or shake it, you can’t kick holes in it, it will keep you warm in Winter and cool in Summer, and fifty years from now, or a hundred for that matter, it will still be here. I don’t like lumber,” Mr. Webber would go on doggedly. “I don’t like wooden houses. I come from Pennsylvania where they know how to build. Why,” he would say, with one of his rare displays of boastfulness, “we’ve got stone barns up there that are built better and have lasted longer than any house you’ve got in this whole section of the country. In my opinion there are only two materials for a house—stone or brick. And if I had my way,” he would add a trifle grimly, “that’s how I’d build all of them.”",
