In a moment he expressed his pleasure, much to her comfort.\n\n‘This is the sort of country I thought you’d live in, Mary,’ he said, pushing his hat back on his head, and looking about him. ‘Real country.

A bomb crater, wide enough to swallow a lorry, had split the road at the school entrance in two. The roof of the classroom block was crushed into a jumble of wood and metal and dust. Olanna did not recognize her room. All the windows were blown out, but the walls still stood. Just outside, where her pupils played in the sand, a piece of shrapnel had drilled an elegant hole in the ground. And as she joined in carrying out the few salvageable chairs, it was the hole she thought about: how hot carnivorous metal could draw such pretty ringlets in the soil.",

While the sheets were yet unthawed, sleep was out of the question. I lay awake listening to the noise of the wind and wondering what would be the effect of the hurricane on those flaming jets of natural gas for which Pietramala is renowned.

In Peter Wohlleben’s book The Hidden Life of Trees, he sheds light on how trees are social beings who suckle their young, nurse sick neighbors, and send tiny electrical currents across a fungal network that scientists call the Wood Wide Web to warn each other of danger. They use this network to work together as communities, to share resources and increase their overall strength. Entire forests are connected in this way, silently talking to each other beneath the unknowing crunch of our shoes. For centuries after a tree has been felled, its surrounding community will keep the stump alive by feeding a sugar solution into its roots for reasons unknown. There are so many unknowns in nature, and yet we’ve arrogantly come to see it as an insentient provider for our needs—wood and oxygen or shade on a hot summer’s day, not a civilization full of its own rich and meaningful activity. How condescending. Their inner worlds are far more complex and intelligent than we recognize.",

The real problem with Adelaide these days, I suspect, is that it has just stopped being interesting.",

It had been almost three years since he first met Esther and since he had begun to love her, and now, like a man who emerges from the blind rout and fury of a battle and, looking back across the field, sees clearly for the first time that he is party to a broken force, sees legible at last the news of his own defeat, so now it was possible for Monk to see all of the emergent and consecutive stages through which his love for her had run.",

Even without human intervention most landscapes change over time: trees fall or take root, collapsing banks alter river courses, landslides reshape the contours of mountains.

The great cumulus cloud continues its slow-motion explosion: burly bosses growing out of themselves, volutes and corbels, gullies, seracs and great white bolls. A lateral shear-line at the cloud’s base, below which hang black sheets of rain. Northwards, the man and I reach a patch of small footprints: children playing in the mud. Two children are there now, today, jumping about barefoot. Suddenly I feel a tidal pull homewards, to my own children, wanting to keep them safe against harm and time.",

We are already on a close reach, so there is no question; I will use Andrew Evan’s technique. I hank on the smaller sail beneath the genoa, then drop the genoa during a tack, remove it and raise the smaller headsail on the opposite tack. All this is done while sailing fast across the blue-grey water and we lose no ground. I’ve gotten better at this since the beginning of the voyage; this time it only took fifteen minutes from start to finish. The number two jib is up and we continue to charge north by northeast. I plan to give Cape Canaveral a very wide berth, as shallow sandbars stretch way out to sea around the cape, and shipping traffic near the Canaveral Inlet might be heavy.\nLand is fading away and soon the view in all directions is ocean as we approach Cape Canaveral from the south. This cape is the last great milestone of my long journey home. Once around it we will be on the home stretch. But rounding any cape can be a challenge. Capes are known to harbor strong currents as water is deflected around them. If the wind blows against the current then the conditions on the sea can get very rough very quickly.\nRight now the wind is blowing from the west, a favorable direction as we can proceed on a beam reach at maximum speed and in relative comfort. The west wind kicks up minimal waves as the fetch (the distance the wind blows over the water) is small where I am. But should the wind shift northward, all this could change for the worse. As for now, all is well and the sailing is fine.",

She had never swindled a railway company, brought dutiable scent past a customhouse or represented to a second-hand dealer that her clothes were less worn than they were, though with her prestige she could actually have done this.

I was disturbed to learn that for the entire 7,800 miles there’d be no deviating, no shortcutting, no self-determination. It’s what makes a rally so quirky and appealing. To some. We are all making a gentleman’s agreement that we’ll go exactly where the organizers tell us and that we’ll move at a pace and time of their choosing. Of course, there’s great temptation to stray, which is why they set up points along the route where each car checks in with a course marshal during the day.",

But summer was waning in the high valleys of the Dolomites; tourists were scattering, the big hotels preparing to close. By-and-by a cold sparkle began to fill the air in the early mornings, and at night the temperature fell to freezing. On the lower slopes the larches were turning to pale gold, and the bare cliffs burned with an intenser fire against a sky as hard as metal. The very magic of the hastening days warned Boyne that they could not last, and that the change in the landscape symbolized another, as imminent, in the fortunes of his party.",

Sometimes he sat among the masters of the earth in rooms of manlike opulence: dark wood, heavy leathers of solid, lavish brown, were all around him. Again he walked in great chambers of the night, rich with the warmth of marble and the majesty of great stairs, sustained on swelling columns of a rich-toned onyx, soft and deep with crimson carpets in which the foot sank down with noiseless tread. And through this room, filled with a warm and undulant music, the deep and mellow thrum of violins, there walked a hundred beautiful women, and all were his, if he would have them. And the loveliest of them all was his. Long of limb and slender, yet lavish and deep of figure, they walked with proud, straight looks on their fragile and empty faces, holding their gleaming shoulders superbly, and their clear, depthless eyes alive with love and tenderness. A firm and golden light fell over them, and over all his love.",

With lids lowered and fixed lips he looked strangely different again—rather like his own memorial bust in bronze. She shivered a little . . .\n\n“Father! Your coffee’s getting cold.”\n\nHe pushed aside the paper, glanced at the letters piled by his plate, and lifted his eyes to Nona’s. The twinkle she always woke seemed to struggle up to her from a long way off.",

    "target_paragraph": "As my bus descended before dawn to Magadan, the capital of sorrow, it flooded up in a constellation of lights against the unseen Pacific, and I realised with disgust that it was handsome. Squeezed between sea and hills, its main street dipped and climbed through facades of golden stucco and stone, before it dropped out of sight to the harbour.\nAfter locating a hotel and wrangling about my visa, I marched out into a smarting wind. Everything here was in place, or nearly. The banners in Lenin Square were rasping on their poles, frozen stiff, and Lenin himself (who stood, hands in pockets, giving nothing) stared across with demonic authority to where gold-mining offices had supplanted the Dalstroy building. The tallest edifice in the city–the aborted headquarters of the old Communist Party–had been stopped in mid-construction ten years before, and gaped behind him. The wind howled through its apertures.\nAlong the main street the high-pedimented, high-columned offices and tenements looked built to stamp out the earth and its memories for ever, stuccoed with flags and hammers. Alongside, the classical blocks built by Japanese POWs loomed in facades of plastered honey. The whole city core was convict-built. The old telegraph office remained; so did the theatre (now a market) where condemned divas and ballerinas sang and danced for their persecutors.\nIn those years prisoners who endured to the end would be assigned work in this limbo of Magadan. It was full of strange meetings and deranging memories. The survivors, wrote Ginzburg, had the omniscient look of snakes. And fear remained. They knew that the next political earthquake might see them all rearrested. Nobody trusted, nobody confided. It was overwhelmingly male. The scarcity of women turned wives faithless, men said, and attracted prostitutes. ‘Kolyma is the land where the sun is without warmth, the flowers without scent, and the women without hearts.’ In the 1980s Magadan was still the divorce capital of Russia.\nNow the populace was less than 150,000, and falling. Many workers had come temporarily to earn the ‘long rouble’ of high pay in eastern Siberia, and were returning west. The mines and fisheries were in decline. In the shifting cold, almost no one was about. The wind was slicing snow off the hills. I followed Transport Road where the columns of prisoners had climbed up from the port. It was grimly ordinary. A few people were clearing snow from their doors. A pack of dogs scavenged in the wastes. To the north, long ridges were pressing on the suburbs, and factory chimneys smoking beyond, as if a steamer was sailing just behind the hills. Below me the circling mountains and promontories of the bay threw a snow-capped palisade over the sea. The water was slate-blue, and so calm that it still showed the passage of a vanished ship.\nI was descending the road which prisoners had hewn out round the headland from the quay. Along its crest a few huts threw down rickety stairs. It was shored up with concrete slabs, and the road was rutted concrete. Nobody was on it. Only in my mind they were marching up to meet me.\nI dipped my hand in the water beyond its fringe of ice. I felt an odd, transient elation. Everything that had happened here seemed immeasurably past. It could never (could it?) happen again. The shore was littered with iron and cables, burst concrete, old ropes, unhewn stones. A few cargo boats were anchored offshore. Then my head began filling with other ships: the ‘death-ships of the Okhost Sea’, Sakharov called them, carrying their human cargo of 8,000 or 12,000 slaves caged in their holds. As they passed Japan the hatches were battened and they moved unlit through the night. In 1939 the SS Indigirka went to the bottom with her freight trapped inside. In 1933 the SS Dzhurma mistimed her sailing and was locked in pack-ice for nine months while her 12,000 prisoners all froze to death, and half the crew went insane.\nWhen ships docked, the sick and the dead were laid together on the quayside where I stood. Yevgenia Ginzburg was one. She was saved by a woman doctor, who nursed her back to life, and who was trying to atone, perhaps, for her husband’s atrocities as a police interrogator. Ginzburg understood. In Kolyma, she said, the most unendurable thing was the memory of those you loved.",

It would take him about an hour to get out of his chair, and another hour to shuffle the few feet to the window and finagle it open with the pole, and another hour to lean the pole against the wall and shuffle back to his desk. The instant he was reseated, the man who sat opposite him would bob up, stride over, bang the window shut with the pole, and return to his seat with a challenging look on his face, at which point the old boy would silently and stoically begin the chair-scraping process all over again.

In fact by mid-December, we began to consider it rather a triumph if ever we succeeded in summoning a taxi from International Backside, especially after sunset. In the hot season, the night shift at the stand would always lie out under the stars on their charpoys. Unable to sleep, they would appear at our door within minutes of us ringing for them. But in winter Balvinder and his brothers retreated into their taxis, under mountains of old blankets, and greatly disliked answering the telephone which lay outside, six freezing feet away in the taxi-stand tent. On the rare occasions we did manage to rouse one of the brothers that winter, we were treated to a ride in a taxi sweetly scented with sleeping Sikh.",

Interestingly, this image depicts Mary of Egypt, patron saint of penitents, rarely portrayed in southern Italy, leading some scholars to the conclusion that female ascetics may have inhabited the sanctuary during a period of its history. Our pondering on the lives passed and the events transpired was cut short by the cavern’s winter dampness. Up in the parking lot, a forest ranger was sitting in his car, eyeing us a bit curiously and offering to lead us back out. We had thought we were alone, but were thankful for his assistance as our stomachs were telling us it was time for lunch.",

Then he went to the bed and lay down on it, rigid, staring up at the dark ceiling even after he heard Henry raise onto one elbow, looking toward the bed with slow and equable astonishment. “Are you going to sleep up there?” Henry said. “Well, all right. This here pallet sleeps all right to me, but I reckon I just as lief to if you wants to,” and rose and approached the bed and stood over the white boy, waiting for him to move over and make room until the boy said, harsh and violent though not loud:",
