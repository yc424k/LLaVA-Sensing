Western Electric had been using the triode to develop public address systems for conveying speeches to large crowds or announcements to fans at baseball stadiums and the like. But in the 1920s it occurred to some forgotten engineer at the company that the triode detector could be used to project sound in theaters as well. The upshot was that in 1925 Warner Bros. bought the system from Western Electric and dubbed it Vitaphone. By the time of The Jazz Singer, it had already featured in theatrical presentations several times. Indeed, the Roxy on its opening night in March 1927 played a Vitaphone feature of songs from Carmen sung by Giovanni Martinelli. “His voice burst from the screen with splendid synchronization with the movements of his lips,” marveled the critic Mordaunt Hall in the Times. “It rang through the great theatre as if he had himself been on the stage.”",

The Humboldt Current, thick with plankton and the siege of anchovies that feed on it, was like a rich corridor of marine life. Often, I found Dinghy dragging in scaly flying fish or squid that had become marooned on deck. Pleased that he had provided for one of his own meals and that I wouldn’t have to open another can from the dwindling supply, I wasn’t quite so happy with the mess that his snacks left behind. Flying fish hold such a gluey substance to their scales that it wouldn’t be surprising if rubber cement was derived from it. The squid invariably would leave behind a smelly inkspot on the fiberglass deck or my bed and Dinghy never cleaned up after himself, no matter the meal.",

    "target_paragraph": "Like thunder, the stable clock struck four. Never did any earthquake so demolish a whole town. The gallery and all its occupants fell to powder. Her own face, that had been dark and sombre as she gazed, was lit as by an explosion of gunpowder. In this same light everything near her showed with extreme distinctness. She saw two flies circling round and noticed the blue sheen on their bodies; she saw a knot in the wood where her foot was, and her dog’s ear twitching. At the same time, she heard a bough creaking in the garden, a sheep coughing in the park, a swift screaming past the window. Her own body quivered and tingled as if suddenly stood naked in a hard frost. Yet, she kept, as she had not done when the clock struck ten in London, complete composure (for she was now one and entire, and presented, it may be, a larger surface to the shock of time). She rose, but without precipitation, called her dogs, and went firmly but with great alertness of movement down the staircase and out into the garden. Here the shadows of the plants were miraculously distinct. She noticed the separate grains of earth in the flower beds as if she had a microscope stuck to her eye. She saw the intricacy of the twigs of every tree. Each blade of grass was distinct and the marking of veins and petals. She saw Stubbs, the gardener, coming along the path, and every button on his gaiters was visible; she saw Betty and Prince, the cart horses, and never had she marked so clearly the white star on Betty’s forehead, and the three long hairs that fell down below the rest on Prince’s tail. Out in the quadrangle the old grey walls of the house looked like a scraped new photograph; she heard the loud speaker condensing on the terrace a dance tune that people were listening to in the red velvet opera house at Vienna. Braced and strung up by the present moment she was also strangely afraid, as if whenever the gulf of time gaped and let a second through some unknown danger might come with it. The tension was too relentless and too rigorous to be endured long without discomfort. She walked more briskly than she liked, as if her legs were moved for her, through the garden and out into the park. Here she forced herself, by a great effort, to stop by the carpenter’s shop, and to stand stock-still watching Joe Stubbs fashion a cart wheel. She was standing with her eye fixed on his hand when the quarter struck. It hurtled through her like a meteor, so hot that no fingers can hold it. She saw with disgusting vividness that the thumb on Joe’s right hand was without a finger nail and there was a raised saucer of pink flesh where the nail should have been. The sight was so repulsive that she felt faint for a moment, but in that moment’s darkness, when her eyelids flickered, she was relieved of the pressure of the present. There was something strange in the shadow that the flicker of her eyes cast, something which (as anyone can test for himself by looking now at the sky) is always absent from the present—whence its terror, its nondescript character—something one trembles to pin through the body with a name and call beauty, for it has no body, is as a shadow without substance or quality of its own, yet has the power to change whatever it adds itself to. This shadow now, while she flickered her eye in her faintness in the carpenter’s shop, stole out, and attaching itself to the innumerable sights she had been receiving, composed them into something tolerable, comprehensible. Her mind began to toss like the sea. Yes, she thought, heaving a deep sigh of relief, as she turned from the carpenter’s shop to climb the hill, I can begin to live again. I am by the Serpentine, she thought, the little boat is climbing through the white arch of a thousand deaths. I am about to understand… .",

    "target_paragraph": "Our autumn walks were delightful; the sun ceased to scorch; the want of flowers was no longer peculiar to Ohio; and the trees took a colouring, which in richness, brillance, and variety, exceeded all description. I think it is the maple, or sugar-tree, that first sprinkles the forest with rich crimson; the beech follows, with all its harmony of golden tints, from pale yellow up to brightest orange. The dog-wood gives almost the purple colour of the mulberry; the chestnut softens all with its frequent mass of delicate brown, and the sturdy oak carries its deep green into the very lap of winter. These tints are too bright for the landscape painter; the attempt to follow nature in an American autumn scene must be abortive. The colours are in reality extremely brilliant, but the medium through which they are seen increases the effect surprisingly. Of all the points in which America has the advantage of England, the one I felt most sensibly was the clearness and brightness of the atmosphere. By day and by night this exquisite purity of air gives tenfold beauty to every object. I could hardly believe the stars were the same; the Great Bear looked like a constellation of suns; and Jupiter justified all the fine things said of him in those beautiful lines, from I know not what spirited pen, beginning,\nI looked on thee, Jove! till my gaze\nShrunk, smote by the pow’r of thy blaze.",

Outside, a gray drizzle blurs the intense green grasses that thrived on November rains. I put my hand on the window. Cold. He’s right, of course. If we pick today, the wet olives might mildew if we don’t finish and get them to the mill. We gather our osier baskets that strap around the waist—so handy for stripping a branch—and the blue sacks the olives are loaded into, the aluminum ladder, our rubber boots. Still jet-lagged and dazed, we’re up early, thanks to Marco’s arrival at seven-thirty when it barely was light. He tells us to go make an appointment at a mill; maybe it will clear up later. If so, the sun will dry the olives quickly.",

He read in a rapid high-pitched voice, turning the pages with a trembling claw, and thrusting his long fingers nervously through his disordered mop of jet-black hair. As he went on, the polite attention of the class was changed insensibly to a paralysis of stupefaction. Professor Hatcher’s firm thin lips became much firmer, thinner, tighter. A faint but bitter smile was printed at the edges of his mouth. Then, for a moment, when the playwright finished, there was silence: Professor Hatcher slowly raised his hand, detached his gold-rimmed glasses from his distinguished nose, and let them fall and dangle on their black silk cord. He looked around the class; his cultivated voice was low, controlled, and very quiet.",

    "target_paragraph": "July 1st.—I think that after roses sweet-peas are my favourite flowers. Nobody, except the ultra-original, denies the absolute supremacy of the rose. She is safe on her throne, and the only question to decide is which are the flowers that one loves next best. This I have been a long while deciding, though I believe I knew all the time somewhere deep down in my heart that they were sweet-peas; and every summer when they first come out, and every time, going round the garden, that I come across them, I murmur involuntarily, \"Oh yes, you are the sweetest, you dear, dear little things.\" And what a victory this is, to be ranked next the rose even by one person who loves her garden. Think of the wonderful beauty triumphed over—the lilies, the irises, the carnations, the violets, the frail and delicate poppies, the magnificent larkspurs, the burning nasturtiums, the fierce marigolds, the smooth, cool pansies. I have a bed at this moment in the full glory of all these things, a little chosen plot of fertile land, about fifteen yards long and of irregular breadth, shutting in at its broadest the east end of the walk along the south front of the house, and sloping away at the back down to a moist, low bit by the side of a very tiny stream, or rather thread of trickling water, where, in the dampest corner, shining in the sun, but with their feet kept cool and wet, is a colony of Japanese irises, and next to them higher on the slope Madonna lilies, so chaste in looks and so voluptuous in smell, and then a group of hollyhocks in tenderest shades of pink, and lemon, and white, and right and left of these white marguerites and evening primroses and that most exquisite of poppies called Shirley, and a little on one side a group of metallic blue delphiniums beside a towering white lupin, and in and out and everywhere mignonette, and stocks, and pinks, and a dozen other smaller but not less lovely plants. I wish I were a poet, that I might properly describe the beauty of this bit as it sparkles this afternoon in the sunshine after rain; but of all the charming, delicate, scented groups it contains, none to my mind is so lovely as the group of sweet-peas in its north-west corner. There is something so utterly gentle and tender about sweet-peas, something so endearing in their clinging, winding, yielding growth; and then the long straight stalk, and the perfect little winged flower at the top, with its soft, pearly texture and wonderful range and combination of colours—all of them pure, all of them satisfying, not an ugly one, or even a less beautiful one among them. And in the house, next to a china bowl of roses, there is no arrangement of flowers so lovely as a bowl of sweet-peas, or a Delf jar filled with them. What a mass of glowing, yet delicate colour it is! How prettily, the moment you open the door, it seems to send its fragrance to meet you! And how you hang over it, and bury your face in it, and love it, and cannot get away from it. I really am sorry for all the people in the world who miss such keen pleasure. It is one that each person who opens his eyes and his heart may have; and indeed, most of the things that are really worth having are within everybody's reach. Any one who chooses to take a country walk, or even the small amount of trouble necessary to get him on to his doorstep and make him open his eyes, may have them, and there are thousands of them thrust upon us by nature, who is for ever giving and blessing, at every turn as we walk. The sight of the first pale flowers starring the copses; an anemone held up against the blue sky with the sun shining through it towards you; the first fall of snow in the autumn; the first thaw of snow in the spring; the blustering, busy winds blowing the winter away and scurrying the dead, untidy leaves into the corners; the hot smell of pines—just like blackberries—when the sun is on them; the first February evening that is fine enough to show how the days are lengthening, with its pale yellow strip of sky behind the black trees whose branches are pearled with raindrops; the swift pang of realisation that the winter is gone and the spring is coming; the smell of the young larches a few weeks later; the bunch of cowslips that you kiss and kiss again because it is so perfect, because it is so divinely sweet, because of all the kisses in the world there is none other so exquisite—who that has felt the joy of these things would exchange them, even if in return he were to gain the whole world, with all its chimney-pots, and bricks, and dust, and dreariness? And we know that the gain of a world never yet made up for the loss of a soul.",

Late on the afternoon of August 20, McKinlay went up to Breddy’s grave to retrieve a snow knife he remembered having left there. As he neared the grave, he thought he heard something over gusting wind—little cries and yelps. Some of the logs they’d piled on the grave had been clawed loose at one end; there were animal markings and scratches in the ground, and strewn wood. McKinlay bent down cautiously and was astonished to see Molly there, having burrowed under the driftwood and skins, nursing a litter of eight puppies right next to Breddy’s body. McKinlay called out for Hadley, who came quickly and threw a lead around Molly’s neck. They collected the puppies—three looked fairly strong and alert, while five were so weak and listless it appeared doubtful they would survive—and McKinlay noticed something disturbing: Breddy’s clothes were ripped open, the flesh of his corpse recently gnawed. “There were clear signs,” McKinlay wrote of the macabre spectacle, “that she was bent on rearing her family from Breddy’s body.”",

    "target_paragraph": "CHAPTER LXV\nEVERY NIGHT when I’m a girl I walk my dogs. There are two of them, the mother named Cupcake and the daughter Puppets, whom I helped whelp one night when Mars burned red in the sky and looked as if it was going to kiss the earth. They don’t require leashes. They follow me wherever I go. I walk them down the long, dark suburban streets where we live. I walk them in the summer when the air is redolent with the smell of lilac and fresh-cut grass and in the winter when the streets are icy and the drifts piled high. My dogs always come when I call or whistle and I can walk them for hours. I walk them only in part because they need me to. Mainly I walk them so that I can get out of the house.\nI have to escape my father’s outbursts. This man who plays jazz piano, cries at movies, and cannot listen to classical music without conducting can’t seem to contain his free-floating rage either. The way the air turns heavy before a tropical storm, these outbursts are usually preceded by lectures. There is a right way and a wrong way for most things, including eating soup. With hot soup you push the spoon away from you, wiping the bottom on the side of your bowl as you blow onto it, thus avoiding dripping soup and a burned tongue. Cold soup you eat the opposite way, bringing the spoon toward you, wiping it on the edge. Or is it the other way around? I am never sure. There is a right way to load a dishwasher and a wrong way. A right way to dress and act. The slightest movements we make are scrutinized. There’s a look in my father’s eyes when he’s getting angry. It’s something out of fairy tales and admonishing children’s books. These are the eyes of dragons and wild beasts. To this day I think they turned red.\nYet he’s unpredictable. He might get angry if the lights were left on. Or he might not. If the garage door is open. We, his children, can’t seem to figure out the rules, and all of these are reasons for lectures that lead to the minefield that becomes my childhood. Yet he never gets mad at the serious things—the big mistakes we might make. Once, shortly after I get my driver’s license, I smash into the car of a friend of his that is parked in our driveway. I drive right into it. And all my father says is “Accidents happen. Be more careful next time.” And once when our neighbor’s daughter got pregnant and her father threw her out, I overheard my father say, “If anything ever happened to Mary, she could always come home.” Years later, when I am single and pregnant with my daughter, Kate, I will learn that he meant it.\nYet small things drive him crazy. The things that he somehow takes as personal slights. A sign that we disrespect him. And once the lecture begins, the fight can’t be far behind. I sigh when being told to take a smaller bite of steak and he launches into “Get in the habit of being a lady.” Then our mother will say, “Can’t we have a meal in peace,” and the next thing we know the shouting begins. My mother retreats to the kitchen, my brother to the TV. And I leave the house. I have the excuse of my dogs.\nFight or flight. I’ve always been interested in this primitive response. When I learned about it in school, it felt right. The two ways to deal with conflict. You face it or you flee it. It is, I suppose, if I wanted to analyze it (and I’m not sure I do), an explanation for my wanderlust. I am always in flight. It is a strange truth about me. I’ve never courted danger. That hasn’t been my M.O. I was never into suicide by adventure. No, for me it was always about escape. It was always about getting away.",

I walked all the way around the block, then stood on the opposite corner and stared at the site for a long time, but it wasn’t possible to imagine it as it had been, any more than it was possible to imagine the Myall Creek massacre from its present peaceful situation. So I returned to the car and headed out of town through the dappled stripes of sun and shade created by the big hotels and lavish palm trees. At the edge of town I rejoined the Pacific Highway and headed south.",

Now the cave was no longer firelit; it was dark and damp; Miss Barrett was outside. He looked round him. Everything had changed. The bookcase, the five busts – they were no longer friendly deities presiding approvingly – they were hostile, severe. He shifted his position at Miss Barrett’s feet. She took no notice. He whined. They did not hear him. At last he lay still in tense and silent agony. The talk went on; but it did not flow and ripple as talk usually flowed and rippled. It leapt and jerked. It stopped and leapt again. Flush had never heard that sound in Miss Barrett’s voice before – that vigour, that excitement. Her cheeks were bright as he had never seen them bright; her great eyes blazed as he had never seen them blaze. The clock struck four; and still they talked. Then it struck half-past four. At that Mr Browning jumped up. A horrid decision, a dreadful boldness marked every movement. In another moment he had wrung Miss Barrett’s hand in his; he had taken his hat and gloves; he had said good-bye. They heard him running down the stairs. Smartly the door banged behind him. He was gone.",

Where else can you go in Alaska where you don’t even hear birds?” He took in the 360-degree view. “I don’t think I’ve ever been out here when it’s so calm.” Katmai is infamous for its williwaws, a type of violent windstorm that kicks up suddenly in places where the mountains meet the sea. When geologist Josiah Spurr came through the area in 1898, he reported that “gusts are so powerful that stones of considerable size are carried along by them.” Robert Griggs had doubted reports of such winds until he was scooped up by one and flown into a mudbank. Kyle pointed out some USGS cabins on top of a mountain. “The wind can get up to a hundred miles per hour down here,” he said. “We can go up there if we really need to.”",

As pictured in every guidebook of Calabria, a small, rocky island crowned with an ancient Benedictine sanctuary Santa Maria dell’Isola (Saint Mary of the Island) juts into the sea at the bottom of the cliff. A narrow footpath leading up from the beach to the church completes the picture postcard. Unfortunately, on that Easter weekend, the structure was entirely covered with scaffolding. Several more months would pass before I was to see the church dazzlingly restored, almost too clean for its naturalistic surroundings. Nevertheless, as I gazed out at the tiny island from a piazza up on the town level that day, I felt a rumbling underfoot. The sound and the vibrations steadily increased. Children began to run up the street in the direction of the encroaching, ever-deafening drumbeat, and I naturally followed, with a fast walk. Clearly, the stone buildings weren’t constructed to absorb the reverberations of a modern drum, as the town’s whole seventeenth-century infrastructure seemed to quiver with the oscillations of the metal snares.",

The last time I had played Scrabble, the minimum word length was three letters. It seems the rules have since changed, and two-letter words are permitted. Immediately, Vivien was making high scores with single letters forming words I’ve never heard of.\n‘What exactly does that mean?’ I asked.\n‘It’s an engineering term,’ she replied vaguely.\n‘But what does it mean?’",

Just inside its firmly double-bolted doors were several color pictures of Brazil—taken from a Playboy spread and concentrating on the country’s topless beauties; on the opposite wall was a huge map of Argentina. Nearby was a series of formal snapshots of a Korean couple on their wedding day, in black tie and white gown, and beside them—quite a coup, I thought—an entire brochure on Paraguay aimed at a Korean audience (and centered around a strong-looking woman in a director’s chair whom the brochure identified as “Producer Kim”). There were also, in the entrance hall, some photos, snipped from Korean fashion magazines, of bedroom sets in Seoul department stores.",

That day, by way of rehearsal for our Dorset adventure, we went out exploring Roger’s hedgerows. Walking the fields, we reached an unusually deep and thick area of hedge. Roger said he had seen a weasel emerge more than once from there, so we decided to try to crawl inside the hedge, to find what world it held. Pulling our sleeves up over our hands, we pushed under the first row of boughs, trying to avoid the biting blackthorns. A few yards in, we reached a natural hollow, where the trunks of the main trees rose, and we sat there, with our backs against a trunk, looking out into the meadow through the skein of briar and leaves, and listening to the life of the hedge. Paths through the leaf-litter around us testified to the hedge’s interior as a high-use animal roadway.",

    "target_paragraph": "The only signs of the herdsman’s former strength are the gnarled hands clenched over his thighs. The swell of his cheekbones drops fiercely to a faltering jawline. He thinks he is eighty-six, but cannot be sure. He is not happy here.\nI stand hesitantly in his room. Its passage is heaped with coal and hung with the antlers of reindeer gathered long ago. He has spent his life with the herds on the far side of the river, but is too weak to sustain that now. The plaster is dribbling from the wattle of his ceiling. His door is locked against drunks.\nHe says: ‘Life was hard over there, but it is better than here. I didn’t choose this.’\nOver there, in the end, you could live on the miraculous reindeer: eat even its ears and lips and bowel contents, resist the harshest cold in its skins, turn its bones to implements or tinder, ride it to new pastures. This, said the old man, was how things had always been. The reindeer could endure on its reserves like a camel, and possessed a third lung which kept it warm inside. Even after the Soviets collectivised the herders–a tragedy which ignored native knowledge–his people had migrated with their sledge-drawn tents between the Arctic Sea and the Yenisei hinterland. The reindeer could sniff the edible lichen beneath the ice, and paw it up. But unnoticeably, acid rain was depleting the pastures.\nThe Entsy remembers this. Under his frosted scalp his face has shrunk to a gremlin watchfulness. He remembers the herds withering away.\nI have left his door open, and now a drunk Russian barges in and demands a cigarette and a glass of vodka. The old man has neither. The youth curses the prices in Dudinka and the fucking Yenisei and a fucking sturgeon that got away, and he leaves. The Entsy has stayed stoical, as if his eyes were retracted into his skull. Above his bed hangs a pair of thigh-length reindeer boots: sheaths of glistening topaz stripes. They shine like an heirloom. But he wears a vinyl jerkin and rubber shoes now, and picks at a salted omul.\n‘You see how it is. That’s what happens here. These people.’ His only son died of a heart-attack in the tundra, he says. His wife is dead. (For the first time one of his hands moves: it gestures to the west.) But it is better over there, he remembers, and he wants to cross back over the river.",

The builders evidently felt a feeble impulse to be ‘Western’, because two spaces have been left unplastered, to serve as windows – though these admit little light, since the roof-stakes project far out and down to form a verandah. (This common device can be a danger to the unwary, especially after dark, as the sharp stakes are often at eye-level.) There is no furniture, the tin door won’t shut and when I arrived the uneven mud floor was thinly covered with straw: but before his departure the Governor ordered a ‘carpet’ of freshly-cut blue-gum branches.",

I continued due west, across level paddyfields, towards the hazy blueness of a low ridge running the whole length of the horizon. For hours a high veil of milky cloud persisted and a cool wind blew strongly from the north – perfect walking weather. The only ban en route – a dozen dwellings – lay in a slight dip among palms and banana groves. The trees’ swaying and rustling in the wind made them seem more animated than these impoverished villagers – the poorest Lao I was to see in three months. Malnourished, ragged and dirty, their only source of water was a sluggish opaque stream too shallow for the usual vigorous bathing and laundering. My arrival startled everyone, yet the elders showed much shy friendliness when I stopped at the ‘shop’ to buy one of its four bottles of Pepsi. Other imports on offer were a few tiny packets of viciously dyed sweets and biscuits hanging from a string above the one-plank counter. Sitting on a stool provided by the shopkeeper, I watched a woman and her two daughters lethargically hacking at coconuts with heavy knives, preparing them for sale in Kasi.",

Ramdev pinned his hands on the floor in a push-up pose, flinging his entire body and legs through his arms – back and forth, back and forth – before sitting with his legs crossed to show us something cool we could do with pranayam breathing. Closing his eyes, he sucked in his gut to make a concave shape between his ribs, a hollow big enough to fit your entire face. He jiggled his gut around rapidly, like a lava lamp in time lapse.

    "target_paragraph": "The A.E.C. provided a guaranteed market at a guaranteed price for a period of ten years beginning in 1949 for all of the uranium ore – at or above a specified grade – which the miners could produce. Plus a discovery bonus of ten thousand dollars. But even so it became apparent after a time that only large-scale operations – in this as in most other businesses – would make a profit. Also the many small ore pockets scattered about the canyon country were soon made insignificant by the location of vast contiguous bodies of uranium in the Ambrosia Lake district of New Mexico and in Ontario. The small independent miners in Utah, forced to transport their ore long distances over the tire-busting, axle-breaking, clutch-burning terrain of the canyonlands (where roads run every way but straight), found themselves up against the overwhelming competition of such giants as the Anaconda Corporation, with generals and admirals on its governing board and senators on the invisible pay roll. When the A.E.C.’s ten-year guarantee ran out most of the independents went out with it – out of business.",

No other passengers were about and the walls were without timetables. I sat on the platform on the opposite side from which I had arrived, not knowing when the next train might come along, not knowing indeed if there might be a next train. It was as lonely a station as you could imagine in such a small and crowded country as Belgium. The tracks stretched in a straight line for two or three miles in either direction. I was cold and tired and my ankle throbbed. Even more than this, I was hungry. I hadn’t eaten all day.",

Then flame wavered, fragile as paper, straight upward, incense. There was heady visual memory of clustered rock and unexplored cove and a garden that was built out on a separate island with a thin breakwater of native stone to join it. There was a villa, whose roof was one gigantic sundial, there was a villa whose pots were enamelled bright blue and bunches of cultivated thistles oddly fumed lavender thistle smoke up into a sky that was almost white from shining radiance. There were the awnings, Chris called, “snails,” and that one house, built blank square with just one huge green snail awning, clinging to its sunside. There were the outsides of villas whose insides could be exactly gauged by their exquisite proportion and there were the smouldering terra-cotta villas whose taste was so atrocious that Christian called them “restful.” “I would like,” he said, “to have one of the worst of those Moorish villas and one cactus in the front yard.” There were steps that led skyward that were hardly distinguishable from irregular aged walls, except that there were no iron-red spikes of wild vervain, growing from the graduated irregularity of their stones. There were the inevitable geraniums, only a little burnt about the bases, and the terracotta was shown to be as cool as glazed bath-room tiles by the rabid gash of hollyhock shaped hybiscus to show what red could be. There were cool immaculate clusters of single white oleander, as delicate as orange blossom and the willow-like branches of other oleander that was now over. There were the turned-up hummocks of raw earth, in the Casino garden, that Chris said were one bank of lilies in the spring and over and through it all like darts puncturing a clear canvas (those darts of ecstasy to ruin a still picture) were the shrill whirl and whirl and sweep and swoop of swallows. There were swallows to shrill continually, early morning, late evening before the tireless monotonous drone of those musical wind-swept telegraph wires (courtilliéres) dragged one to sea-bottom. There were swallows to drag one out of sleep, tireless dart on dart, blue-blue to show blue, what blue should be.",

    "target_paragraph": "Wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow, we haul stone to a pile out on one of the olive terraces. I lift only the small and medium stones; Ed and Stanislao wrestle with the giants. Low-impact aerobics video, eat your heart out. Drink eight glasses of water a day? No problem, I’m parched. At home, in my burgundy leotard, I lift and lift, and one and two, and lift…but this is work versus workout. Bend and stretch—easy when I’m clearing a hillside. Whatever, I’m worn out by this labor and I also like it tremendously. After three hours, we’ve moved about one fourth of the stones. Madonna serpente! Don’t try to calculate how many more hours we’re in for—and all the really huge stones are in the other pile. Dirt and sweat run down my arms. The men are bare-chested, smelly. My damp hair is clotted with dust. Ed’s leg is bleeding. I hear Francesco above us on a terrace talking to the olive trees. Giorgio’s tractor tilts amazingly on one of the narrow terraces but he is too skilled to come tumbling down the mountain. I think of the long, melting bath I will take. Stanislao begins to whistle “Misty.” One stone they can’t budge is shaped like the enormous head of a Roman horse. I take the chisel and start to work on eyes and mane. The sun wheels in great struts across the valley. Primo hasn’t seen us at hard labor. He’s shouting at his men about it. He has worked on many restorations. The foreign padrone, he says, only stands and watches. He poses with his hands on his hips, a curled lip. As for a woman working like this, he raises his arms to heaven. Late in the afternoon, I hear Stanislao curse, “Madonna sassi,” Madonna-stones, but then he goes back to whistling his theme song, “It’s cherry pink and apple blossom white when you’re in love…” The men come down and we drink beer on the wall. Look at what we’ve done. This is really fun!",
