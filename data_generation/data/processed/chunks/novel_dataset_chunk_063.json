The relief was extraordinary. They all seemed to fall away from each other again and to be at their ease and the fishing-lines slanted taut across the side of the boat. But his father did not rouse himself. He only raised his right hand mysteriously high in the air, and let it fall upon his knee again as if he were conducting some secret symphony.",

He’d hardly arrived before Perelman was scouring the lawns for “aquiline-featured cads involved in desperate intrigues with the wives of neighboring planters”.",

    "target_paragraph": "I was woken up in the small hours of next morning by the clanging of bells. The air reverberated with the semantra of the surrounding monasteries. The sound of these flat beams, each of them several yards long with a waisted middle for the monk on duty to grasp with his left hand while he strikes the flat surface in sharp accelerating strokes with a little mallet in his right, carry for miles. The blows are scanned in threes in commemoration of the Trinity. Some say this instrument was invented by Noah in order to summon the world’s fauna to the Ark. It made us think how similar to the Ark were these monasteries, each poised on its private Ararat. Just outside my window, the loud clank of the bell of St Barlaam drove away the last fumes of sleep. I remembered that yesterday had been the vigil of St Demetrios of Thessalonika and, shovelling on my clothes, I made my way by striking matches along the catwalks and staircases to the little church of the monastery. Only a few pale slits in the dark sky predicted a new day.",

The click of steel had followed quickly, had not there come a muttering and shouting from the peasants about the door and from those crowding up behind them; and all knew that these were no children of Queen's Irish or friendly Namaras and Dermotts, but of the wild Irish about Lough Gara and Lough Cara, who rowed their skin coracles, and had masses of hair over their eyes, and left the right arms of their children unchristened that they might give the stouter blows, and swore only by St. Atty and sun and moon, and worshipped beauty and strength more than St. Atty or sun and moon.",

    "target_paragraph": "When tomatoes are ripe, nothing is better than cold tomato soup with a handful of basil and a garnish of polenta croutons. Panzanella, little swamp, is another tomato favorite, a salad of oil, vinegar, tomatoes, basil, cucumber, minced onion, and stale bread soaked in water and squeezed dry—a true invention from necessity. Since bread must be bought every day, Tuscan cooking makes good use of leftovers. The rough loaves work perfectly for bread puddings and for the best French toast I’ve ever had. We go for days without meat and don’t even miss it, then a roasted faraona (guinea hen) with rosemary, or sage-stuffed pork loin, remind us of how fabulous the plainest meats can be. I cut a small basketful of thyme, rosemary, and sage, wishing I could beam one of each plant to San Francisco, where I keep a window box of faltering herbs going. Here, the sun doubles their size every few weeks. The oregano near the well quickly spreads to a circle about three feet wide. Even the wild mint and lemon balm I dug up on the hill and moved have taken off. Mint thrives. Vergil says deer wounded by hunters seek it for wounds. In Tuscany, where hunters long since have driven out most wildlife, the mint is more plentiful than deer. Maria Rita, at the frutta e verdura, tells me to use lemon balm in salads and vegetables, as well as in my bathwater. I think I would like cutting herbs even if I weren’t cooking. The pungency of just-snipped herbs adds as much to the cook’s enjoyment as to taste. After weeding the thyme, I don’t wash my hands until the fragrance fades from my hands. I planted a hedge of sage, more than I ever could use, and let most flower for the butterflies. Sage flowers, along with lavender, look pretty in wildflower bouquets. The rest I dry or use fresh, usually for white beans with chopped sage and olive oil, a favorite of Tuscans, who are known as “bean eaters.”",

Muir had visited there with the Corwin in 1881 and recorded finding a happy Native village whose hospitable residents eagerly shared their uncooked food?wood being extremely scarce?and slept “perfectly nude in the severest weather,” swathed in layers of furs. Merriam was the first Harriman team member to land ashore. He was immediately repulsed by the appearance of the local Eskimos, whose heads were scarred with open sores, signs of syphilis that had been carried by Russian sailors. The expeditioners snapped some photographs, engaged in a little trading, and poked their heads into the Eskimos’ houses, which Dellenbaugh recorded were “smoky and dirty and foul-smelling,” filled with blubber and bloody whale parts. A strong wind chilled everyone but Harriman, who wore a reindeer coat he’d purchased in Dutch Harbor as he handed out tobacco and glass beads to his Siberian hosts. Merriam called Plover Bay “the most barren and desolate place of its size I ever saw.” He had once spent a season in Death Valley.",

The furniture dwarfed everything in sight, leaving almost no space to walk. I bumped into the coffee table.\n“Sorry about that table. Don't worry, you should see me, Qanta. I am the klutz! I am always doing that!” She giggled at her clumsiness while I giggled at a Saudi using idiomatic Yiddish. Ghadah had obviously a lot of experience living in North America.\nWe crossed a marble hallway, entering Ghadah's drawing room. Huge, it looked like a furniture warehouse. The room was scattered with oversized Louis XV armchairs upholstered in garish pony, leopard, and zebra skins. Heavy, plate-glass tables cluttered the room, their bronze pedestals sinking deep into piled carpet that still smelled freshly installed. Tiny, high windows were draped in heavy curtains and (even though it was brilliantly sunny outside) Ghadah scurried around the room switching on the heavy crystal table lamps. Soon the room was dappled with thick umbras of fluttering yellow light perforating the gloom. This formality didn't seem to go with Ghadah's casual outlook at all, but perhaps she entertained here.\nI looked at a series of cushions perfectly arranged on a long, low sofa that looked suspiciously like a Beidermeier. They were white silk, surrounded by thick black borders that framed a central leonine design in raised gold thread. I peered a bit more closely.\n“Ghadah, this reminds me of Versace. The designs are very similar. I saw them in New York when I was last there.”",

Perhaps I don't know how to receive kindness, perhaps one can understand—deeply and fully understand—only that which one was brought up on. Romana and her mate are kind. They have, for example, led us to the Europa Hotel, where, pleasantly, we are now ensconced, the only guests in a hotel that caters to weddings and offers rooms to revelers. It is true that Romana—prune-faced in repose—keeps popping up, with gifts, advice, invitations . . . the all-overness of them! Their love, Laura says (meaning, of course, her family's love, for they have haplessly become stand-ins for our families), “is like a goddamn sticky shroud.”",

Men in black caps slammed machetes onto outsize chopping boards, and others pushed trolleys between the aisles, white boots meeting white rubber aprons. Itinerant guitarists played Violeta Parra folksongs to diners, and the waitress called me the South American equivalent of ‘pet’. A handful of suited executives came in and out, but the mercado was largely the territory of the old school, slicked-back hair, cardigans and string shopping bags. I even got used to spooning shellfish juice into my wine.",

So, reluctantly, for he loathed luxury and conformity, but joyously, because he was to be with George, Campton threw some shabby clothes into a shapeless portmanteau, and prepared to despatch the concierge for a taxicab.",

They walked together toward the wireless station, but when they arrived at the front steps, to Bartlett’s disbelief, the windows were shuttered, and the office was closed for the night.

He’d first met him in 1896, at his father’s fishing station on the Labrador coast, and they’d met again last summer in Nome, when Bartlett was on the way up in the Karluk. Lee wanted to know what in the world Captain Bartlett was doing here, and Bartlett summarily briefed him.",

Just after Christmas in front of our families and friends, Jonathan and I profess undying love and promise to be together forever. Afterward we purge our hotel room of stayers, plot our future and review our past. We give the jingoistic astrologer in Rishikesh good marks. As he predicted, Sonia Gandhi did not win the election and India won the cricket series against Australia. I had faced death and some spiritual truths. And, after a year of ridiculously hard work, Jonathan learned to dance—only hours ago we did the cha-cha to a Barry White song for our wedding waltz. We dismiss the rest of his reading, including his warning of danger for Jonathan. Instead, we plan a year of togetherness, fun and love.",

Each dip of the oars set loose a storm of light: a swarm of fireflies, a wind-curl of fire-leaves outlighting the vortices. Bright particles in ignition; apprehension taking form. Ian glided in to the storm beach. I stepped on shore, globes of dolerite rolling under my feet and knocking together with the hollow clicks of billiard balls. He pushed off with a hushed goodbye. I felt my way up the cliffs to the south until I found a patch of machair a few yards long and a few wide, where I pitched my tent and settled to sleep. The stars stood sharp above. It felt odd to be on rock again, not sea, to think of the ground on which I lay extending down to the floor of the Minch. Lying there, I could still feel the day at sea, blood and water slopping about in my bag of skin, the tidal churn of my liquid body, a roll and sway in the skull. My mind beat back north against the current, thinking of the puffins’ flight, the lines we leave behind us, the spacious weave, our wake, then sleep.",

The sky is gray and white, a winter sky. I stand up and hang from the window. The green of the garden, only yesterday the tropical green of deep summer, is now grayish, as though covered with pumice. The tree trunks, yesterday a rain-forest black, are now pale. The earth itself is no longer brown. It is tan, and a cold breeze stirs the bamboo as though it were January.\nAutumn has come, with the appalling suddenness that is its way in Japan. The long, hot, rainless summer is over. And it is over instantly. One morning it disappears. The leaves hang, and the sky—in the middle of September—looks like snow.\nLike evening in the tropics, autumn here is sudden, unequivocal. You wake up and have winter as though you awoke and had pneumonia. Those summer insects that sang beneath my window last night are now stretched on the underside of leaves, trying to escape from the cold earth with feeble claws. The lizards that ran yesterday among the rocks, the birds that panted with open beaks, the busy wasps reveling in the heat—all are still and cold now.\nI touch a mosquito on the shoji. It does not move. It is as though frozen. In my room, though, it is still summer, because there are my striped shirt, my bathing suit, my sunglasses. But they are no longer needed. I will have to discard them as though I had outgrown them, as though they were things left over from childhood.\nThe mosquito does not know it and may not live to see it, but in a week or so will begin that most miraculous of seasons—Indian summer. It is false and lovely, perhaps lovely because it is false. And it is loveliest of all the seasons in Japan, where, for two, three weeks, it is suddenly summer again—a deep summer with the sky an impossible blue and the sea the color of jade. It is one long and lovely respite before the winter.",

She knew that it was all sentiment, all baseless impressibility, which had caused her to read the scene as her own condemnation; nevertheless she could not get over it; she could not contravene in her own defenceless person all these untoward omens. It was impossible to think of returning to the Vicarage. Angel’s wife felt almost as if she had been hounded up that hill like a scorned thing by those – to her – superfine clerics. Innocently as the slight had been inflicted, it was somewhat unfortunate that she had encountered the sons and not the father, who, despite his narrowness, was far less starched and ironed than they, and had to the full the gift of charity. As she again thought of her dusty boots she almost pitied those habiliments for the scorn to which they had been subjected, and felt how hopeless life was for their owner.",

Behind an inner glazed enclosure, with its one window dimmed by a sooty perspective barred with chimneys, he seated himself at a dusty littered desk, and groped instinctively for the support of the scrap basket. Moffatt, uninvited, dropped into the nearest chair, and Mr. Spragg said, after another silence: “I’m pretty busy this morning.”",

Some of the doors of the empty cells hung open. Others were closed with twists of wire, and last year’s leaves blew about the wide wooden halls. In the little garden, an old shepherd with bright blue eyes, long matted hair, and a spade-shaped beard like that worn on vases by Ajax and Agamemnon, was sitting on a rock with a tall crook over his shoulder. He was shod in cowhide moccasins and dressed in a kind of sheepskin hauberk caught in by a belt. He looked as wild and solitary as Timon of Athens, but over the rare luxury of a cigarette he admitted that he got lonely in Holy Trinity, and added that he was about to abandon the flocks to become a postulant of St Stephen. Delving into a past that seemed almost as remote and nebulous as that of the monastery’s foundation, he recounted his experiences during a short-lived emigration to Louisiana as a hand in the municipal slaughterhouses of Baton Rouge.",

But there is still too much to see and marvel at, the world very much alive in the bright light and wind, exultant with the fever of spring, the delight of morning. Strolling on, it seems to me that the strangeness and wonder of existence are emphasized here, in the desert, by the comparative sparsity of the flora and fauna: life not crowded upon life as in other places but scattered abroad in spareness and simplicity, with a generous gift of space for each herb and bush and tree, each stem of grass, so that the living organism stands out bold and brave and vivid against the lifeless sand and barren rock. The extreme clarity of the desert light is equaled by the extreme individuation of desert life-forms. Love flowers best in openness and freedom.",

While Teresa rested, I toured the room. The floors were white tile, and though most of the walls were painted a bright white, the wall behind the twin beds was painted dark blue. The furniture was modern: dark woods with a desk, mirror, two small chairs, and a flat-screen television. The sliding glass doors by the balcony were glazed with a reflective tint. They reflected a bit of traffic noise and sunlight, but they were hot to the touch. The bathroom was a fair size, and clean, but it had an odd feature. The wall between the bathroom and sleeping quarters had a large, plate-glass window in it, directly over the tub. There was a set of curtains over the window for privacy, but it still seemed like the strangest place to put a window.",

Gant bought him wagons, sleds, drums, horns – best of all, a small fireman’s ladder wagon: it was the wonder, and finally the curse, of the neighbourhood. During his unoccupied hours, he lived for months in the cellar with Harry Tarkinton and Max Isaacs: they strung the ladders on wires above the wagon, so that, at a touch, they would fall in accurate stacks. They would pretend to doze in their quarters, as firemen do, would leap to action suddenly, as one of them imitated the warning bell: ‘Clang-a-lang-a-lang.’ Then, quite beyond reason, Harry and Max yoked in a plunging team, Eugene in the driver’s seat, they would leap out through the narrow door, gallop perilously to a neighbour’s house, throw up ladders, open windows, effect entries, extinguish imaginary flames, and return oblivious to the shrieking indictment of the housewife.",

Words beat and sizzled and a word bent backward like a saw in a sawmill reversed, turned inward, to work horrible destruction. The word “father” as Minnie spoke it, reversed itself inward, tore at the inner lining of the thing called Her Gart. It tore her inner being so that she stood stiff, alert, trying in some undefined and ineffectual manner to be “fair.” What was it Minnie did to her, reversing machinery so that a simple word “father” wrought such untoward havoc?",

Here stands an enormous new dry goods market with a three-tiered roof and an accompanying car park – in anticipation of the happy day when a bridge is built. Nearby, a terrace of twelve breeze-block shops remained unused though obviously this development had long since been completed. Also nearby was a pavilion restaurant – tin roof, no walls – furnished with coffee machines and fridges run off a generator, and serving imitation McDonald’s burgers and chips and instant soup. It was filthy and smelly, the plastic tables unwiped, the fumes from the cooking oil rancid. I ordered a coffee and noted with satisfaction that business was not brisk. This seemed to be the place where rather self-consciously Westernized (or Thai-ized) young locals gathered; at noon heavy metal tapes were shaking the plank floor and youths wearing jeans and baseball caps groped girls very willing to be groped – a distressing deviation from Laotian mores. Here was the sort of cultural contamination the LPRP leaders dreaded (and must still deplore) yet did not know how to avoid. It comes with NEM; if you submit to outside investors, lenders, donors, consultants, you have surrendered your heritage – sold it for a mess of dollars.",

The hotel would host an exclusive party that evening: a private iftar for the visiting Cairenes then asleep in their rooms. Several men and women, all dressed in black, puttered about. They shifted tables and chairs and umbrellas across the sand. I doubt whether they even noticed us, and we walked across the beach unmolested. Teresa dipped her toes in the sea, but the water was cold and she quickly retreated to the sand. We held hands and looked north, to the horizon. Teresa gasped as the sky filled with thick, white clouds. They were the first clouds we had seen in Egypt, and they were beautiful.",

At one point in 1926, more than a thousand new office buildings were being constructed or rebuilt. To try to reduce the crowding, the City of New York enacted tough new ordinances, restricting tall buildings to big lots and forcing architects to design them with setbacks to allow more air to flow between them and more light to reach the ground. The unintended effect of this was actually to accelerate the pace of growth, since big lots required giant structures if they were to offer an economic return. It also encouraged skyscrapers to march northward up Manhattan. By 1927, New York City had half the nation’s skyscrapers, and half of those were in Midtown.* The canyonlike streets and spiky skyline that we associate with New York is largely a 1920s phenomenon.",

    "target_paragraph": "Next is the walk to Fingal’s Cave. I use the term “walk” loosely. There is no path. Fainthearted, you step across the slimy, wet columnar basalt, akin to stepping on uneven raised pavers covered with grease, while holding onto another loose cable as the waves crash. Half this basalt hopping trip includes a gorge with a particularly fearsome race of water surging two metres high within it – and a single orange throw ring mounted on the wall. If you fell in, your best hope would be that the orange throw ring would knock you senseless. There is no hope of survival in that gorge without aide, which is not coming except to haul your dead body out of it.",
