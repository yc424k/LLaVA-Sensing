But Grace went on her course without any misgiving, though there was much underwood here with only the narrowest passages for walking, across which brambles hung. She had not, however, traversed this the wildest part of the wood since her childhood, and the transformation of outlines had been great; old trees which once were landmarks had been felled or blown down, and the bushes which then had been small and scrubby were now large and overhanging. She soon found that her ideas as to direction were vague—that she had, indeed, no ideas as to direction at all. If the evening had not been growing so dark, and the wind had not put on its night moan so distinctly Grace would not have minded; but she was rather frightened now, and began to strike across hither and thither in random courses.",

In late 1944, he died of gas poisoning on his first day of incarceration in the Budapest Ghetto, not in early 1945 as I’d assumed. The Ghetto was created on 29 November 1944, and Elemer died the very next day. I wondered if he was frail, at seventy, and could not survive the move. No, it was noted as a probable suicide. I needed time to take that in. This had never crossed my mind. It stopped me cold. Later, more resigned, I reluctantly accepted that choice in his plight, but I felt so bad for both of them.",

Bulgarian soldiers came across what must have been a very sorry procession of soldiers, peasants, and cattle, and offered the villagers refuge in their once-native Bulgaria. But it was too little, too late: the villagers were so traumatised, they trusted nobody in a uniform. None of them stepped across the line, and the march continued to Enez, a journey of 240 kilometres. Children and old people died en route. The rest eventually made it back here and started again.",

He leaped into the air and knocked his heels together. He whooped. But he couldn’t become part of their dance. Its rhythm was like a smooth glass wall between him and the dancers. No matter how loudly he whooped or threw himself around, he was unable to disturb the precision with which they retreated and advanced, separated and came together again.",

An elegant Afrikaner couple, both tall and slim and wielding calculators, were angrily arguing with the Tswana receptionists. Then a battered cardboard carton was drawn from beneath the counter and placed on top. It contained bundles of R50 notes; outside of a bank, I have never seen such an accumulation of cash. The Afrikaners, tense and narrow-eyed, followed the count while each bundle was checked and rechecked. No one even glanced at me as I stood nearby, leaning on Chris, streaming sweat after that climb. Finally the Afrikaners admitted defeat; they had not, after all, been cheated. But what was all that loot doing in a carton on the floor? When the couple had moved away, I asked. A woman receptionist giggled and explained: ‘Someone’s lost the key of our safe, but don’t tell!’",

The summit was sun-warmed granite, hot to the touch, but there was a wisp of breeze—the first in days—and I found a shady spot beneath a disused fire tower. It was the first time in what seemed like weeks that I had sat anywhere in relative comfort. I leaned back and felt as if I could sleep for a month. Katz arrived ten minutes later, puffing hard but pleased to be at the top. He took a seat on a boulder beside mine. I had about two inches of water left, and passed him the bottle.

Hola. Bonjour. Buongiorno. The language itself didn’t matter one bit—Spanish, Hindi, Vietnamese—though a string of clichés off the top of my head (“Gaudí’s architecture”/“The tapas”/“To learn Spanish”) convinced everyone I told that Barcelona was a precise choice and not just a destination that presented near the top of the drop-down menu on a booking website.",

The ground was as heavy as lead, and all judgment from a fellow’s experience went for nothing. Horses, riders, people, were all blown about like ships at sea. Three booths were blown over, and the wretched folk inside crawled out upon their hands and knees; and in the next field were as many as a dozen hats at one time.

Like a flank of refrigerated meat, the hip slapped heavily onto the bed.\n“Doctora! Good evening! Welcome back!” Juliette was eternally pleasant. Her warmth was genuine.

Then, suddenly, the spaces widened, and we found ourselves in a hanging valley, ablaze with the violent green of ripe paddy terraces. In the Punjab, all the rice fields had been full of villagers grafting and tending the shoots. The Pathans seemed to take a more relaxed attitude to agriculture. They sat on their charpoy, as immobile as the water buffaloes beside them, and waited for their rice to grow. One village made cricket bats, but despite a small pile of finished bats propped up against the wall of one hut, no one seemed to be too busy there either. When we stopped for cay, the male villagers were kind and relaxed and cheerful. They squatted on their hams and offered us dried apricots. We saw few women in these villages.",

He’d departed Seattle expecting to find “a land of deep snow, igloos, Eskimos, polar bears, rough men, fancy women, saloons, fighting sled dogs, intense cold, and gold everywhere.” To his unpleasant surprise, he found in Ketchikan not the Alaskan winter wonderland of his dreams but “a warm, mosquitoey place smelling of fish.” For decades, salmon canning was the primary business in town, and when the Elder steamed through in 1899, tiny Ketchikan consisted of a salmon cannery and a few buildings, not worthy of a stop when world-famous Metlakatla was just twenty miles to the south. Before long, Ketchikan had established itself as Alaska’s “First City,” not because it had the territory’s largest population (which it did by the 1920s) but because it was the first port of call for cruise ships coming up the Inside Passage. More recently, it was the almost home of the infamous Bridge to Nowhere, a four-hundred-million-dollar project to replace the ferry that runs from the airport (which, because level ground is hard to come by near Ketchikan, is located on a nearby island), most of it to be paid for with federal earmarks.",

To really care for. No I have not gone to work yet. This girl goes to the U and she is talking about me going there next year. So I may go there next year.

I only know that I have been driven to find inner peace with methods that might seem a bit drastic for the general populace. (For instance, when I told one friend back in New York City that I was going to India to live in an Ashram and search for divinity, he sighed and said, “Oh, there’s a part of me that so wishes I wanted to do that…but I really have no desire for it whatsoever.”) I don’t know that I have much of a choice, though. I have searched frantically for contentment for so many years in so many ways, and all these acquisitions and accomplishments—they run you down in the end. Life, if you keep chasing it so hard, will drive you to death. Time—when pursued like a bandit—will behave like one; always remaining one county or one room ahead of you, changing its name and hair color to elude you, slipping out the back door of the motel just as you’re banging through the lobby with your newest search warrant, leaving only a burning cigarette in the ashtray to taunt you. At some point you have to stop because it won’t. You have to admit that you can’t catch it. That you’re not supposed to catch it. At some point, as Richard keeps telling me, you gotta let go and sit still and allow contentment to come to you.",

All the other visible hills, including those facing me across the narrow valley, looked to be in good health, except where they had been scarred and gouged by quarrying or strip mining, which was regularly. I walked for a little over an hour until I came to a sudden, absurdly steep descent to Lehigh Gap—almost a thousand feet straight down. I wasn’t at all ready to stop walking—in fact, I was just getting into my stride—but the idea of going down a thousand feet only to turn around and come straight back up held zero appeal, and there wasn’t any way to double back without walking miles along a busy highway. That was of course the trouble with trying to do the AT in day-sized pieces. It was designed for pushing on, ever on, not for dipping in and out of.",

She was in the room again, looking at him. He knew that she not only recognised the place at which he knelt, but that she knew why. Possibly at that instant he believed she had known all the time, because he knew at once that she was neither frightened nor laughing at him, that she simply did not care. Nor did she know that she was now looking at the face of a potential homicide. She merely released the door and came down the aisle toward the front of the room where the stove sat. “Jody aint come yet,” she said. “It’s cold out there. What are you doing down there?”",

A tortoiseshell butterfly flaunted across the window; she saw it settle on a leaf, and there it sat, opening its wings and shutting them, opening and shutting them, as if it feasted on the sunlight. She watched it. The down was soft rust-red on its wings. Off it flaunted again. Then, admitted by an invisible hand, the chow stalked in; came straight up to her; sniffed at her skirt, and flung himself down in a bright patch of sunlight.",

An estimated 210,000 people had been killed, including many civilians, and another 70,000 had died due to starvation and the hardships of war. The economic impact was also devastating: between 1940 and 1945, Dutch real GDP had fallen by some 40 per cent. Economists later estimated that more than a quarter of all the country’s capital stock – houses, machinery, factories and railways – had been destroyed. Within a few years would come the wrenching loss of the Dutch colonies in Indonesia, begrudgingly granted independence by a Dutch government that had neither the capacity nor the willpower to keep fighting for them. Rebuilding the country would be a formidable task. In one telling example, the minister of economic affairs explained that it would prove difficult to resume production of bicycle tyres, because factory workers had no tyres for the bicycles they needed to get to the factory.",

Susan spoke quietly, full of the dulled grief of mourning a person she had never known.

The sound was everywhere, above and beneath, funnelling downward at him; he heard the hooves and as he paused, his breath indrawn, the horse appeared, materialised furiously out of the smoke, monstrous and distorted, wild-eyed and with tossing mane, bearing down upon him. He screamed too. For an instant they yelled face to face, the wild eyes, the yellow teeth, the long gullet red with ravening gleeful triumph, stooping at him and then on as the horse swerved without breaking, the wind, the fierce dragon-reek of its passage, blasting at his hair and garments; it was gone. He ran again toward the cow’s voice. When he heard the horse behind him again he did not even look back. He did not even scream again. He just ran, running, as again the earth, the smoke, filled and became thunderous with the hard, rapid hoofbeats and again the intolerable voice screamed down at him and he flung both arms about his head and fell sprawling as the wind, the dragon-reek, blasted at him again as the maddened horse soared over his prone body and vanished once more.",

At the poles there was cold intense enough to freeze brandy solid, to freeze dogs’ tongues to their coats if they tried to lick them, and to freeze men’s beards to their jackets if they looked down. Woollen clothing stiffened to the rigidity of sheet metal, and had to be beaten with hammers to make it bend. At night the explorers melted their way inch by agonizing inch into their reindeer-hair sleeping-bags, which the cold had hardened into icy scabbards. In the mountains there were the cornices that overhung cliff-edges like horizontal waves, the invisible attacks of altitude, and avalanches and blizzards which could whitewash the world in an instant.",

These days, plays featuring multiple costume changes, actors attached to cables flying through the air, and waterfalls onstage are all the rage. The popularity of keren is a sign of the sickness currently plaguing the traditional Japanese arts in general. When one looks at Japan’s wilderness breathing its dying gasps, the traditional arts seem comparatively healthy. Kabuki has actually experienced a box-office resurgence over the last twenty years, and the theaters are often sold out. But trouble is brewing because of Kabuki’s irrelevance to any life a modern audience can now experience. There is hardly a single object on the Kabuki stage recognizable to young people today. When stage chanters sing of fireflies or autumn maples, such things are now almost mythical subjects in this land of vast cedar plantations.",
