    "target_paragraph": "From the main souk ‘street’ a very low arched doorway (even I had to bend) opened into a longish, dimly lit, stone-walled tunnel. Beyond, a small open-air space was bounded by high irregular walls studded with small oblong or oval windows, all barred. A flight of narrow, steep, uneven steps (open on one side: not negotiable after a night out) led to a wide patio off which opened six spacious unconnected rooms, their roofs domed or flat. Each had superbly moulded ceilings, numerous eccentric curves and niches and storage corners, and short flights of steps linking slightly different floor levels. From two corners, steep stairways led to other roofs/patios. No one walking through the covered souk would suspect that on either side, above the shops, people live in a separate world – a secluded world, pre-settlements. In Jerusalem’s Old City one sees similar homes but too many have been over-modernised. Here the HRC had made few changes to the original structures while providing minimal mod cons. All rooms were tactfully electrified: no wires appeared. In the large kitchen, fitted with gas cooker and sink, one curtained corner served as loo and shower-room, its water supply uncertain; Habsu apologised profusely when the loo became obvious. In my room no Western furniture intruded; colourful cushions and folded quilts were piled around the bases of three walls and in the centre of the smooth mud floor stood a home-made coffee-table – two short planks on a wobbly base. As I wrote my diary, pairs of chain-smoking conscripts stared down at me from their fortified post some 40 yards away on a roof requisitioned for ‘settler protection’. They did six-hour shifts and sometimes shouted to comrades across the rubble of nearby upper storeys, demolished to clear the IDF’s ‘field of vision’. At sunset the guard changed and all night powerful searchlights swept to and fro across the Old City, often shining directly into my eyes as I lay on a soft bed of quilts. The room’s two round windows, set in a four-foot-thick wall, were shutterless and uncurtained.",

And they, too, they are afraid. They cannot give up power now. They know only the gun, and they are scared because they have so much blood on their hands.’ I asked him if he thought the generals believed in any kind of religion. ‘They have no gods,’ he said with disgust. ‘They are always building new pagodas and renovating old ones. They think they are making merit, but God is no fool.’",

    "target_paragraph": "But not nearly as interesting as it ought to be, if you ask me. Back in the 1950s and 60s, the Smithsonian was the Castle. Everything was crammed into this one wonderfully dark and musty old building. It was like the nation’s attic and, like an attic, it was gloriously random. Over here was the shirt Lincoln was wearing when he was shot, with a brown blood-stain above the heart. Over there was a diorama showing a Navajo family fixing dinner. Up above you, hanging from the gloomy rafters, were the Spirit of St Louis and the Wright Brothers’ first plane. You didn’t know where to look next or what you would find around each corner. Now it is as if everything has been sorted out by a fussy spinster, folded neatly and put in its proper place. You go to the Air and Space Museum and you see the Spirit of St Louis and the Wright Brothers’ plane and lots of other famous planes and rocket ships and it’s all highly impressive, but it is also clinical and uninspired. There is no sense of discovery. If your brother came running up to you and said, ‘Hey, you’ll never guess what I found in this room over here!’ you would in fact guess, more or less, because it would have to be either an aeroplane or a rocket ship. At the old Smithsonian it could have been absolutely anything – a petrified dog, Custer’s scalp, human heads adrift in bottles. There’s no element of surprise any more. So I spent the day trudging around the various museums dutifully and respectfully, with interest but not excitement. Still, there was so much to see that a whole day passed and I had seen only a part of it.",

Smoked bacons hung in the pantry, the great bins were full of flour, the dark recessed shelves groaned with preserved cherries, peaches, plums, quinces, apples, pears. All that he touched waxed in rich pungent life: his Spring gardens, wrought in the black wet earth below the fruit trees, flourished in huge crinkled lettuces that wrenched cleanly from the loamy soil with small black clots stuck to their crisp stocks; fat red radishes; heavy tomatoes. The rich plums lay bursted on the grass; his huge cherry trees oozed with heavy gum jewels; his apple trees bent with thick green clusters. The earth was spermy for him like a big woman.",

At night it could serve as a weapon along with the tin can, the spoon, and the pitiful flashlight. I said a short prayer to God and asked forgiveness for eating the unborn birds. Then I gave myself over to fantasies until the break of dawn.",

By July 1921, in only his second year as a full-time batter, Ruth had already hit 139 home runs, more than any other person had hit in a career before. “So compelling is his presence at the plate, so picturesque and showy and deliciously melodramatic his every move and appearance that he is, from the point of the onlooker, a success even when he is a failure,” wrote one observer. Even his pop-ups were sensational; they were often hoisted so high that he had comfortably rounded second base before the ball dropped into an infielder’s glove.",

It worked its way under the doors, through the window frames; on to chests and dressers. But she didn’t care. She was one of the unlucky ones. She had been thinking it was a safe job, sure to last the summer out anyhow. The lady was dead; the gentleman too. She had got the job through her son the policeman. The house with its basement would never let this side of Christmas – so they told her. She had only to show parties round who came with orders to view from the agent. And she always mentioned the basement – how damp it was. ‘Look at that stain on the ceiling.’ There it was, sure enough. All the same, the party from China took a fancy to it. It suited him, he said. He had business in the City. She was one of the unlucky ones – after three months to turn out and lodge with her son in Pimlico.3",

On 26 July 1953 he and twenty-seven other young men attacked Bayamo’s barracks while Fidel and his chrysalides guerrillas were attacking Moncada barracks. The plan was to stymie Batista reinforcements for Santiago. But even the best trained cavalry horses are scared by the unexpected and so many dark shapes silently swarming over the barrack’s walls provoked much loud whinnying. Several of the rebels were immediately shot dead and are commemorated in the park. Ñico himself escaped, joined the Moncada exiles in Mexico in 1955, and in 1956 sailed back to Cuba aboard the Granma. When she was wrecked on the Cuban coast, he was among those killed by the Rural Guard. The few survivors, including Fidel and Che, went on to form the nucleus of the Rebel Army.",

It seemed not only that they expected Pine Rock’s victory, but that they desired it. All of the girls, it seemed to them, were lovely, and all of them, they felt, looked fondly at them. All of the people of the town, they thought, had opened wide their hearts and homes to them. They saw a banner with their colors, and it seemed to them that the whole town was festooned in welcome to them. The hotels swarmed with them. The negro bellboys grinned and hopped to do their bidding. The clerks who waited smiled on them. They could have everything they wanted. The whole town was theirs. Or so they thought.",

Ahead lay an arcade of cusped Shahjehani arches. This was recently the house of the former Indian President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed and so was saved from the rapid eclipse that had blacked out many similar households. Yet even here, the inevitable decay had set in. The outer courtyard had recently been destroyed and its space given over for shops. The balconies were collapsing, the paint was flaking. The veranda lay unswept.",

That was when we went from being friends to being de facto spouses. We called each other husband and wife, because we leaned on each other so completely. We were even great salsa partners (she led, so she was the husband) and slept in the same bed two or three nights a week, depending on which side of town we got drunk on.

    "target_paragraph": "Dr. Reser began to tell of his experiences while in the psychological state known as possession. Incident piled on incident. A new personality burned up the one that had eaten supper with us. His blue-gray eyes glowed, but at the same time they drew far back into his head as if they went inside to gaze on things kept in a secret place. After awhile he began to speak. He told of marvelous revelations of the Brave Guedé cult. And as he spoke, he moved farther and farther from known land and into the territory of myths and mists. Before our very eyes, he walked out of his Nordic body and changed. Whatever the stuff of which the soul of Haiti is made, he was that. You could see the snake god of Dahomey hovering about him. Africa was in his tones. He throbbed and glowed. He used English words but he talked to me from another continent. He was dancing before his gods and the fire of Shango played about him. Then I knew how Moses felt when he beheld the burning bush. Moses had seen fires and he had seen bushes, but he had never seen a bush with a fiery ego and I had never seen a man who dwelt in flame, who was coldly afire in the pores. Perhaps some day I shall visit his roomy porch again and drink his orangeade and listen to him discourse on Aristotle, but even in the midst of it, I shall remember his hour of fire.",

At once he saw the frock coat lying across the bed’s foot, because the man (he really was holding a book, and he wore spectacles) in the chair had given the opening door one alarmed look and sprang up and snatched up the coat and began to put it on. “Never mind,” Ratliff said. “I aint going to stay long. This here cousin of yours. Isaac.” The other finished getting into the coat, buttoning it hurriedly about the paper dickey he wore in place of a shirt (the cuffs were attached to the coat sleeves themselves) then removing the spectacles with that same flustered haste, as if he had hurried into the coat in order to remove the spectacles, so that for that reason Ratliff noticed that the frames had no lenses in them. The other was watching him with that intentness which he had seen before, which (the concentration and intelligence both) seemed actually to be no integral part either of the organs or the process behind them, but seemed rather to be a sort of impermanent fungus-growth on the surface of the eyeballs like the light down which children blow from the burrs of dandelion blooms. “About that cow,” Ratliff said.",

It looked as if they were laughing now and then, and stopping occasionally to glance at something, some book or other object, which the lady carried in her hand. The devil! At times his cousin seemed to be dangerously near the edge—he caught his breath, remembering that sensation of giddiness, of gulping terror, with which he had watched the falcon swaying crazily over the abyss. She was enjoying it, to all appearances. Then, as they retraced their steps, it was the man's turn to take the outside of the path. He suffered as little as she did, evidently, from vertigo. Laughing, and gesticulating. The devil! What were they talking about? What were they doing there, at this impossible hour of the day? Five or six times they went to and fro; and then, suddenly, something happened before Mr. Heard's eyes—something unbelievable.",

    "target_paragraph": "Farnsworth, “the forgotten father of television,” was born in 1906 in a log cabin in Utah. His parents, pious Mormons, moved the family to a farm in Idaho not long afterward, and it was there, in the idyllic surroundings of the Snake River valley, that young Philo spent a happy childhood. He was uncommonly bright and devoured everything he could find on science and technology. In the summer of 1921, while plowing his father’s field, the fifteen-year-old Philo had a scientific epiphany. He had been reading Einstein’s theory on electrons and the photoelectric effect, and now it occurred to him that beams of electrons could be scanned onto a screen in a back-and-forth pattern exactly as he was plowing his father’s field, one line at a time in alternating directions. Within months he had devised a workable plan for transmitting images electronically. He made a sketch of it, which he showed to his high school chemistry teacher, Justin Tolman. Luckily for Farnsworth, Tolman was so impressed that he kept the drawing. It would later confirm Farnsworth’s priority for the invention.",

For it appeared on the crest of an immense wave of cavern and ruin worship that overswcpt Northern Europe - the reaction after the hard and brilliant sceptic movement of the preceding century. It was part of the return to nature; of the revolt from reason. Mankind was weary, for the moment, of straight thinking. Shelley warbled of odorous caves so tunefully that men were almost tempted to become troglodytes again; Rousseau raved of noble savages: he showed us how to discover beauty in Switzerland - the beauty of a coloured photograph. Yes; and long may Switzerland with its sham honey, sham wine, sham coffee, sham cigars, and sham Wilhelm Tell–with its inhabitants whose manners and faces reflect their sombre and craggy mountains–long may it continue to attract, and wholly absorb, the superbly virile energies of our own upper-better-middle classes! Thanks, Rousseau; thanks for not living in Italy.",

While brewing my initiatory demitasse of coffee, Nancy fulminated against the Spanish-Cuban consortium rumoured to be planning another hotel on that wasteland – ‘eight storeys, blocking our sky’. This little house had one uncomfortable eccentricity: all the windows were kept tightly shut, twenty-four hours a day, in an attempt to deter Punta Gorda’s rampant mosquitoes. My room was oven-like, by reluctant choice; it lacked a fan and I couldn’t tolerate the raucous Soviet-era air-conditioning.",
