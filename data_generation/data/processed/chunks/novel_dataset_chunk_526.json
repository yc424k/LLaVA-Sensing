    "target_paragraph": "Morita, by contrast, had been working in the rice fields for fifty cents a day at El Cerrito, a small town on the edge of the Ciénaga de Paredes, when he first saw people shooting manatees for food. Capable of dreaming even in the light of midday, he had a vision, a revelation that convinced him that all of these beautiful creatures had to be loved. He told everyone who would listen, and some who wouldn’t, that no harm was ever to come to what he now called the manatees of God. In 1981, when drought caused much of the ciénaga to dry up, he called on the entire community to help. He and one other man packed wild grass into hundred-pound loads, which they carried back and distributed throughout what remained of the wetland, the scores of small pools where stranded manatees faced starvation. The following day he did it again, only this time accompanied by the entire town. From that moment, he became the community leader, formally anointed by proclamation. It was his first taste of authority, his first experience of activism. In that instant, he saw the well-being of the manatee as inextricably linked to the health of his community. Manatee meat is delicious; however, as Morita knew, men hunt the animals not as gourmands or connoisseurs but because they are hungry and have to feed their families. Thus, to save the manatees, one had to save the people. In becoming, as he put it, the “doctor of his community, both its sorcerer and protector,” he became, in effect, the avatar of the manatees.",

A small boy stood at the edge of a paddy field with a plastic sheet wrapped around his otherwise bare shoulders and a straw hat, dripping with rain. The water turned slate grey as the downpour continued, and soon all I could see was a heavy fog of rain and cloud.

    "target_paragraph": "The house on Piazza di Spagna, of the 18th Century and probably of the same date as the adjacent stairs built by the French, was bought early in this century by public subscription, through the efforts of Lord Rennell of Rodd and others including a number of English and American writers. Its third floor, second by European counting, where Keats died, was officially opened as the Keats-Shelley Memorial in 1909. It is really a little library and museum of the English Romantic movement in general, but not many people stay to read, and an occasional American tourist will wander up who has never heard the two names; when the guardiano patiently explains that they were two young English poets who were buried in Rome a long time ago, they say “Oh” and go away. The bare little corner room, of the rosetted ceiling, is the one, for those who do know; it is a little Gettysburg of the history of poetry, and a conspicuous fact, as on the world’s practical battlefields, is the number of people who have been moved to tears by it, however rarely they may have been anywhere else. Sinclair Lewis confessed to being one of those; one would not have expected it from the author of Babbitt, but he was a disturbed and complicated character, and “Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art,” or almost any line from the three great odes, do in that place put a person’s frailties up for sale. The legend on Keats’s gravestone, beginning “Here lies all that was mortal of a young English poet,” seems there more than ever a travesty, intended though it was, in the first disarray of sorrow, as an act of friendship. The key words of that inscription—“in the bitterness of his heart/ at the malicious power of his enemies”—reflect the disease, not the man, still less anything at all of the poet. There are no such words among those that crowd on the mind in the small room, as they do, from one of the most radiantly simple vocabularies ever put together in English. “. . . keen, fitful gusts . . .” “while thy hook/ spares the next swath . . .” “with patient look, / Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours . . .” “the small gnats mourn/Among the riversallows . . .” Those hours in the plural—who else would have done it? And the line Robert Frost would borrow from: “And I have many miles on foot to fare.” One of the words is not Keats’s own but from his young English doctor there, kind if incompetent, who spoke of him repeatedly as “noble.”",

People crept up to the hangar and watched him working. “He never looked at the crowd, nor did he betray the slightest consciousness of an audience,” wrote a young woman named Elise White, who was present. By the time Lindbergh finished tinkering with his plane, the crowd had grown so large that he needed a megaphone to address it. He asked the people to clear a space so that he could depart, but instead they pressed forward to look at the plane more closely “and he threw the megaphone down in disgust,” related a slightly startled White. This was not the Charles Lindbergh that they had read about.",

    "target_paragraph": "When the Pope opened the Holy Door at Saint Peter’s, open only for the one year in every twenty-five, he was repeating a gesture established through ages of such peril and crisis, the fact of there being by then any door to open might convey less a sense of the Vatican’s practical genius than of its truth in the matter of miracle. Current peril and crisis, not at all dimmed by any analogy, were meeting a power mercifully transcending current confusion, even regardless of any transcendence in the creed. The opening of a door is the natural symbol of such consolation, most of life being a wish to find some door or other that will open: to get out, to be let in, to find elbow-room that is not lonely and meaningless. The Pope did not literally open this one. The brickwork had been replaced ahead of time by a light screen, on which he knocked with a hammer made for the occasion by a Spanish jeweler and given by some of the faithful of Spain—not by the Spanish government, whose representatives caused a good deal of trouble in town when they did turn up to “do” their Holy Year, as the phrase was. Then to the accompaniment of prayer and song, with cardinals, diplomats, and other worthies looking on from the special stands set up for them in the portico and throngs of ordinary people waiting on both sides of the door, workmen lowered the door-filler and tried to get it out of the way. There had been some rehearsal but not enough; the Pope had forbidden it, not wanting to trifle with the mystical significance of the event; consequently there were some hitches in the proceedings and Pius was seen to become somewhat irritated, before the space was finally cleared and he was able to lead the year’s march of the Catholic world in to the deeper symbols of the water and the rock. In the Holy Door the Church had opened, in her terminology, her treasure of grace and pardon, “the fountain of living Water,” radiant as on that bright windy day the two high fountains in the square.

On these twisting streets artisans work; they disregard me—which is the way I like it—as they drink their vin santo; their clothes smell of their work, a sharp smell overlaid by a dusty smell pervades the cool Jolly. These men polish and make brass artifacts; they are woodworkers and carpenters and restorers of antiques and creators of instant antiques. Their shops are hospitably open, allowing me to postpone the ultimate pleasure of Santo Spirito. In one shop there is a lithographer, Viviana Sarubbi, who reproduces old engravings; I like to watch her work with acids and immerse zinc plates in ink baths and hang them up with clothespins to dry. I stop by on days when she is running her press. I love the romantic smell of ink, my father was a printer. I love this part of the Oltrarno with its latterie and gelaterie and wine bars; I love what I think of as the bohemian quarter—though strictly speaking there is no bohemian quarter in Florence, there are artists scattered all over—narrow, sleepy streets with Napoleonic streetlamps, uniform yellow houses, streets that seem to have come to drowsy life from one of Viviana's engravings. At the busy intersection of Borgo San Jacopo and Via dello Sprone there is a curious triangular-shaped building that projects onto the street like the prow of a ship; high above is a partially boarded loggia, beneath it the Medici coat of arms with its six balls, and beneath that, at street level, there is a scalloped basin into which (whence onto the street) a marble satyr spews forth water. This house figures in my dreams.",

I had already learnt that one could not touch the earthen floor with naked feet without catching jiggers under the nails; now I learned that at night anything left outside a case would be eaten—by cockroaches or rats.

Left alone, I am overtaken by that northern void—no wind, no cloud, no track, no bird, only the crystal crescents between peaks, the ringing monuments of rock that, freed from the talons of ice and snow, thrust an implacable being into the blue. In the early light, the rock shadows on the snow are sharp; in the tension between light and dark is the power of the universe. This stillness to which all returns, this is reality, and soul and sanity have no more meaning here than a gust of snow; such transience and insignificance are exalting, terrifying, all at once, like the sudden discovery, in meditation, of one’s own transparence. Snow mountains, more than sea or sky, serve as a mirror to one’s own true being, utterly still, utterly clear, a void, an Emptiness without life or sound that carries in Itself all life, all sound. Yet as long as I remain an “I” who is conscious of the void and stands apart from it, there will remain a snow mist on the mirror.",

He went through an intensive six-week fitness regime, shed forty pounds of doughy fat, and took almost nine inches off his waistline. He had a good season, too: he hit 47 home runs, batted .372, and drove in 146 runs. Above all, he behaved himself, by and large. But in the World Series against the Cardinals, Ruth ended the year with an astoundingly ill-judged play. With two outs in the ninth and the Yankees trailing by one run, Ruth walked and then?to everyone’s astonishment?tried to steal second base. He was thrown out by ten feet, ending the game and giving the Cardinals the World Series. “I guess I did something rash,” Ruth conceded. It was, by nearly everyone’s estimation, one of the most foolish plays ever made in a World Series, and it undid nearly all the good that he had achieved during the season.",

He saw him as high as the red sash on his waist, with a gleam of a white-handled revolver and the wooden haft of a long knife protruding on his left side. Decoud nerved himself for the effort of rowing. Certainly there was not enough wind to blow the candle out, but its flame swayed a little to the slow movement of the heavy boat. It was so big that with their utmost efforts they could not move it quicker than about a mile an hour. This was sufficient, however, to sweep them amongst the Isabels long before daylight came. There was a good six hours of darkness before them, and the distance from the harbour to the Great Isabel did not exceed two miles. Decoud put this heavy toil to the account of the Capataz’s impatience. Sometimes they paused, and then strained their ears to hear the boat from Esmeralda. In this perfect quietness a steamer moving would have been heard from far off. As to seeing anything it was out of the question. They could not see each other. Even the lighter’s sail, which remained set, was invisible. Very often they rested.",

The stars twinkled on the water’s surface in a mesmerizing fashion. Suddenly I realized it was the lake I’d almost fallen into.",

A disembodied voice announced the train’s departure in three languages; signs on the carriage walls added a couple more. The train itself was unexpectedly quiet and comfortable, an extension of the high-speed line running from Amsterdam towards Belgium that had been constructed at great expense in partnership with the Italians as a flagship of European unity and innovation. Unfortunately, the service had proved an abject failure, beset by technical problems and delays. Toilets flushed directly onto increasingly smelly tracks, and marginally faster journey times generally failed to compensate for the extreme delays to the service. The farce had descended into predictable political mudslinging, characterised in the press as yet another conflict between lazy, underperforming southerners and high-tech, high-paying northerners. The Dutch, if one believed the newspapers, had once again been screwed over by their unscrupulous southern neighbours. Some things would never change.",

    "target_paragraph": "There is another compatriot about whom that same lady knows more than most people do nowadays—bearing out the Hardy syndrome, noticeable among living expatriates and wanderers, whereby people from the same country tend to stick together. There are of course pockets, in world society, of fairly real cosmopolitanism, jet-setters, hippies, scholars, artists especially in Paris, and perhaps the Catholic clergy in Rome constitute a kind of melting-pot; at the cemetery Keats and Shelley have an aspect of world property, but by and large visitors tend to linger over their own co-nationals. However the German-born Malwida von Meysenbug, dead in 1903 at the age of eighty-seven, does recall the very different kind of internationalism that swept Europe in the middle to late 19th Century. Not of marxist stripe, for this picture; Rome was not harboring any of that for a long time to come. There are no such rebels in the cemetery, nor apparently, though this is subject to correction, any of what have come to be called the Romantic Revolutionaries except Malwida von Meysenbug herself. By the time she moved to Rome late in life she seems to have given up on all that and gone into mysticism and such. The English version of her memoirs closes with her friendship with, and adulation of, Wagner in Paris, before that move. But her earlier life had been in the thick of that political upsurge, in so far as it had a thick, notably through the Russian intellectual and socialist forerunner, Alexander Herzen, in whose household she lived for a time in London, as a kind of emanuensis, or super-Lizzie, to his children after his wife’s death.",

It contains a sort of temple in which the herbs are sorted and laid out to dry. In winter the youngest of these little monks have to grind the dried herbs into powders, which are kept in carefully labelled air-tight leather bags by the abbot in charge of the school. These schools serve at the same time as pharmacies from which anyone can get medicine gratis or for a small present. The Tibetans are really advanced in the knowledge of herbs and their healing properties, and I have often had recourse to them. Their pills did not do my sciatica much good, but I staved off many a cold and fever with their herb-teas.",

The shops were closed, but one would scarcely have noticed it, so numerous were the glass doors swinging open on saloons, on restaurants, on drug-stores gushing from every soda-water tap, on fruit and confectionery shops stacked with strawberry-cake, cocoanut drops, trays of glistening molasses candy, boxes of caramels and chewing-gum, baskets of sodden strawberries, and dangling branches of bananas. Outside of some of the doors were trestles with banked-up oranges and apples, spotted pears and dusty raspberries; and the air reeked with the smell of fruit and stale coffee, beer and sarsaparilla and fried potatoes.",
