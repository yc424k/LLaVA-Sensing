They gave him the choice of doing their bidding or abandoning the farm. Héctor chose to walk away, quite literally, without pausing to look back on the land where his father lay buried. For nearly a decade he lived in exile, mostly in the foothills of the Andes in Meta, where he rented a small farm and set up another dairy. For several years, the guerrillas there let him be. But then one day they appeared, an entire FARC front, with a warning that the war would soon be upon him. Héctor had but two weeks to sell his cows. The guerrillas took everything they could use. Then came the bombs, destroying much of Héctor’s house. The army came through, followed by paramilitaries, who stole what little was left. Once again, Héctor had lost everything: home, equipment, possessions, not to mention his personal investment of a decade building up the dairy.",

He it was who had vomited on the stairs and now, guilt-ravaged, he had come to crave my forgiveness, bearing a large bottle of tuica. I was quite overwhelmed; where else in the world, in similar circumstances, would the culprit have confessed and been so genuinely upset? By the end of the bottle (we were assisted by my nurse-attendants) Bogdan looked much more cheerful, having been assured that I quite understood his aberration – that occasionally I, too, had over-indulged to the point of throwing up. This admission on ‘granny’s’ part severely shocked Virgil and Teodor: another example of Rumanian primness.",

    "target_paragraph": "In Beijing, moreover, proportion was an expression of priority. The huge public buildings made concrete the assertion of a will that was public, an ego that was only collective; their effect was to state inarguably that the sum of individuals was less than the whole of the state. Beijing thus appeared to be both imperial and impersonal: a city drafted by committee. And this in turn made for a curious disjunction: while the public world here seemed constructed on the epic scale, the private was on the miniature. The place seemed built not for people but for abstractions. The streets were huge, but virtually carless. The official buildings were enormous, but the sidewalk stalls were cramped. The bureaucratic monoliths were gargantuan and yet, by all accounts, private homes were smaller here than anywhere else in the world. Everything, in fact, was topsy-turvily scaled, right down, and up, to a system in which more than a thousand million people were ruled by one twinkling four foot eleven octogenarian who liked to remain behind the scenes. Beijing seemed a Brobdingnag peopled by Lilliputians.",

I tell Kevin I’ve tried earplugs, but I’m still often awakened throughout the night. No solution occurs to me. He suggests a soundproof box that would go over my bed. I love the idea. I realize it will seem weird to most people, so I decide to tell no one except those who might see it. And then only those who see it. Four or five afternoons a week, he works in the basement of my dorm, building what we call the bedbox. No one comes to his work room until, one day, while I’m watching him work, we hear loud footsteps coming down the stairs. I look up to see Betty Ann, the house manager, heavy arms akimbo, angrily asking what we think we are doing. After I explain, she says, “Ha, you must think I’m a fool. I know what you plan to do under that box! And you will not get away with it! This project stops right now.” And she stomped up the stairs.",

The starch in Alabama’s organdie skirts stuck to her hands and sweat rolled into her eyes till she couldn’t see. Choking dust rose off the floor, the intense glare threw a black gauze before her eyes. It was humiliating that Madame should have to touch her pupil’s ankles when they were so hot. The human body was very insistent. Alabama passionately hated her inability to discipline her own. Learning how to manage it was like playing a desperate game with herself. She said to herself, “My body and I,” and took herself for an awful beating : that was how it was done. Some of the dancers worked with a bath towel pinned? around their necks. It was so hot under the burning roof that they needed something to absorb the sweat. Sometimes the mirror swam in red heat waves if Alabama’s lesson came at the hours when the direct sun fell on the glass overhead. Alabama was sick of moving her feet in the endless battements without music. She wondered why she came to her lessons at all : David had asked her to swim at Corne-Biche in the afternoon. She felt obscurely angry with Madame that she had not gone off in the cool with her husband. Though she did not believe that the careless happy passages of their first married life could be repeated—or relished if they were, drained as they had been of the experiences they held—still, the highest points of concrete enjoyment that Alabama visualized when she thought of happiness, lay in the memories they held.",

He told me that the church had a very small parish as only a handful of Anglicans remained in Moulmein. ‘There is much work to do here, but we cannot afford it,’ he said wearily. ‘All we can do is pray that the church won’t fall down.’ Before I left the church, I pushed some banknotes through the cobwebs strung around the donation box.",

Only she wouldn’t be overtired or nervy; and as for things happening to worry her, what could do that in this haven of safety she had got into with Christopher? And she would take the utmost care of herself, now that she was so precious to somebody so dear, and see to it that she kept well and strong; and nerves after all had never in her life yet afflicted her–the utmost sunny tranquillity of mind and body had been hers always; why should she even think of such things? The idea must have got into her head because of the funny feeling she had had that day, the fourth of her happiness, of being on wires. She had been jumpy. The smallest noise or sudden movement made her start. And her body had a queer kind of tingling sensation in it, an uncomfortable sensation of being exposed, raw at the surface; and her skin felt sensitive, as though it were all rubbed the wrong way; and besides, quite without any reason that she could discover, she had wanted several times that afternoon to cry.",

The guard led us through the narrow gate and down a long flight of uneven stone steps. We each braced ourselves with one hand on the wall as we slowly descended, step-by-step, into the cavern. Halogen lights, strung on the walls, illuminated the staircase. The walls and ceiling were unfinished; the only decoration, if you will, were the thousands of pockmarks left behind when the masons carved the tunnel in the limestone. The ceiling drooped, unexpectedly, in several places, and, despite Mohamed’s warning, I cracked the top of my head twice (once going down, once going up). Near the bottom, the stairs turned to the right and the ceiling dropped precipitously; I contorted my body to fit through the narrow doorway that led to the antechamber.",

The wide wings of his black moustache were swept back and up from his mouth. He cocked a barrel of his shot-gun now with a clumsy sort of gesture, intended no doubt to be unobtrusive. The sound of the hammer clicking back was quite audible – like someone cracking his knuckle-bones. ‘Measure for measure,’ I said, and slipped the little pistol under the napkin on my knee, consoled by the cold butt under my fingers and at the same time disgusted – for Panos’ sake. He observed the gesture and made a wry mouth. ‘That won’t be much use,’ he said. I went on eating my sandwich and watching the newcomer lazily out of the corner of my eye. He had stopped now and stood undecidedly beside the trunk of a carob tree. ‘Ho there,’ he called in a deep hoarse voice, and I knew at once from his tone that we had nothing to fear. Sticking the pistol still wrapped in the napkin back into the basket I raised the demijohn of wine and gave him the traditional Cypriot greeting. ‘Kopiaste – sit down and join us.’ He relaxed at once, uncocked his gun, and stood it against the tree before walking over to us.",

Once last night while we were laying there I had to hold him.” They went on, just behind the figure which moved now in absolute silence and with surprising speed. They were in a ravine massed with honeysuckle and floored with dry sand in which they could hear the terrific laboring of the lame leg. Yet still they could hardly keep up with him. After about two hundred yards Armstid turned to climb up out of the ravine. Ratliff followed him. “Careful now,” he whispered back to Bookwright. “We’re right at it.” But Bookwright was watching Armstid. He wont never make it, he thought. He wont never climb that bank. But the other did it, dragging the stiffened and once-fragile and hence maybe twice-fragile leg at the almost sheer slope, silent and unaided and emanating that trigger-like readiness to repudiate assistance and to deny that he might possibly need it. Then on hands and knees Bookwright was crawling after the others in a path through a mass of man-tall briers and weeds and persimmon shoots, overtaking them where they lay flat at the edge of a vague slope which rose to the shaggy crest on which, among oaks, the shell of the tremendous house stood where it had been decreed too by the imported and nameless architect and its master whose anonymous dust lay with that of his blood and of the progenitors of saxophone players in Harlem honkytonks beneath the weathered and illegible headstones on another knoll four hundred yards away, with its broken roof and topless chimneys and one high rectangle of window through which he could see the stars in the opposite sky. The slope had probably been a rose-garden. None of them knew or cared, just as they, who had seen it, walked past and looked at it perhaps a hundred times, did not know that the fallen pediment in the middle of the slope had once been a sundial. Ratliff reached across Armstid’s body and gripped his arm, then, above the sound of their panting breath, Bookwright heard the steady and unhurried sigh of a shovel and the measured thud of spaded earth somewhere on the slope above them. “There!” Ratliff whispered.",

We will not tolerate these vices, they lead the man into trouble, destroy his efficiency, & he sets a bad example to others.’10 ‘The Firm do not approve,’ it was announced in 1900, ‘of their Employees being interested in Race Ponies … to so interest themselves, in future, will certainly prejudice their chance of promotion.’ ‘I hope you will make that young nephew of mine work,’ wrote Warren Swire when John Kidston Swire joined the Hong Kong office in 1914, ‘he is not in China for his own amusement …’ Nevertheless they have prospered ever since. The name of Butterfield was eventually expunged, but the firm remains ubiquitous in Hong Kong, controlling immense properties, running innumerable concerns. It flies its house flag (quartered in white and red, with a blue vertical stripe) on many vessels, and has a controlling interest in the colony’s chief international airline, Cathay Pacific, one of the most important in the east. Listed as one of the most profitable companies in the territory, Swire’s is really a world-wide conglomerate, with interests in tea plantations in Kenya, container terminals in Japan, oil in the Gulf, property in Florida, cold storage in Canada, hotels in Mauritius and bottling in Salt Lake City. Descendants of ‘The Senior’ are still prominent in its affairs.",

The amends he had made in after-life were lost sight of in the dramatic glare of the original act. Had the incident been well known of old and always, it might by this time have grown to be lightly regarded as the rather tall wild oat, but well-nigh the single one, of a young man with whom the steady and mature (if somewhat headstrong) burgher of to-day had scarcely a point in common. But the act having lain as dead and buried ever since, the interspace of years was unperceived; and the black spot of his youth wore the aspect of a recent crime.",

I was going to hike New England, or at least as much of it as I could knock off until Katz returned in seven weeks to walk with me through Maine’s Hundred Mile Wilderness. There are almost 700 miles of gorgeously mountainous Appalachian Trail in New England—about a third of the AT’s total trail length—enough to keep me occupied till August. To that end, I had my obliging wife drive me to southwestern Massachusetts and drop me on the trail near Stockbridge for a three-day amble through the Berkshires. Thus it was that I was to be found, on a hot morning in mid-June, laboring sweatily up a steep but modest eminence called Becket Mountain, in a haze of repellent-resistant blackflies, and patting my pocket from time to time to check that my knife was still there.",

Unexpectedly, it made for a great broadcast voice.\n\nAs one of the only transsexual women on Japanese television, she was in great demand. But her fame was encumbered with the pressure that came with anything one-of-a-kind, a burden of responsibility to ensure she was a good role model.",

As George waited, gradually he became aware of mysterious sounds emanating from beyond the partition. First there was the rustle of heavy paper, as if the pages of a ledger were being turned, and occasionally there would be a quick murmur of hushed voices, confidential, ominous, interspersed with grunts and half-suppressed exclamations. Then all at once there were two loud bangs, as of a large ledger being slammed shut and thrown upon a desk or table, and after a moment's silence the voices rose louder, distinct, plainly audible. Instantly he recognised Randy's voice--low, grave, hesitant, and deeply troubled. The other voice he had never heard before.",

    "target_paragraph": "They moved with grace and precision about the glaucous concavity of the school: caracoling across the raked and muffling tan, rhythmically changing step, passaging, advancing as though double-jointed, flicking out their forelegs as straight as match-sticks, slewing over the manège in side-stepped hesitation waltzes, pawing the air as they backed slowly on their haunches and taking to the air at last like Pegasus and seeming to remain there for long moments of suspension and stasis. Except when a recondite feat evoked a crackle of applause, the sequence unfolded in a stilly hush. Learned writers derive the style from the classical school of the seventeenth century and, in particular, from the principles elaborated in the Duke of Newcastle’s great work. He wrote and published it during the Commonwealth when he was a Royalist general in exile at Antwerp. Anyone turning over the plates in the splendid folio, especially when he gazes on engravings of the author himself in action, will notice the kinship at once. (The dales and the queer rusticated façade of Bolsover sweep across the background and the solitary cavalier, periwigged, ribanded and plumed and as cool as a cucumber, is levitated in patrician aloofness astride a mount with its mane tied in neat bows and curvetting in mid-air with the resilience of a dolphin. Watching his lavoltas and corantos, expert hidalgos from Castille with rowels the size of Michaelmas daisies would make the sign of the cross and cry ‘Miraculo!’.) These later Viennese evolutions were as precise and as complex and as unhastening as the Spanish etiquette which, so the survivors say, constricted the Habsburg court till the end. Poker-faces froze the riders’ features into masks which were symbolic of the arcane and introvert madness which pervades all haute école; and a spell-bound aura, as of four-footed zombies, clothed their neurotic and ravishing steeds. A vision of haunting wonder.",

Sometimes it was men from the other contrade or districts of the town, in blue and white, red and white, black, white and orange, white, green and red, yellow and scarlet. Their bright pied doublets and parti-coloured hose shone out from among the drabs and funereal blacks of the twentieth-century crowd that surrounded them. Their spread flags waved in the street below, like the painted wings of enormous butterflies. The drummer quickened his beat, and to the accompaniment of a long-drawn rattle, the banners leapt up, furled and fluttering, into the air.",

This projection of rock and masonry had once been an isolated southern settlement of the Teutonic Knights – to my surprise: I had always imagined these warriors hacking away at Muscovites in a non-stop snowstorm on the shores of the Baltic or the Masurian lakes. The Thirty Years War raged through the place. Metternich was born a few doors away. But a hoarier, more cosmic chronology had singled it out. Two great rivers, rushing blind down their converging canyons, collide under the tip of the flat-iron and the tangled flux of the current ruffles and dwindles downstream till the Rhine’s great silted volume subdues the clearer flow of the newcomer. The Moselle! I knew that this loop of water, swerving under its bridges and out of sight, was the last stretch of a long valley of the utmost significance and beauty. A seagull, flying upstream, would look down for scores of miles on tiered and winding vineyards, and swoop, if he chose, through the great black Roman gates of Trier and then over the amphitheatre and across the frontier into Lorraine. Skimming through the weather-vanes of the old Merovingian city of Metz, he would settle among the rocks of the Vosges where the stream begins. I was tempted, for a moment, to follow it: but its path pointed due west; I’d never get to Constantinople that way. Ausonius, if I had read him then, might have tipped the scales.",

We look beaten, exhausted, sick of the whole thing. Then the flight is called, we make the interminable trek to the departure gate, we clamber and crush into a bus or if lucky walk straight on to the aircraft. Inside the plane, our faces change, we toss jokes about, laugh, chat to strangers. Our hearts are light and gay because now it’s happening, we’re starting, we’re travelling again.",

The youngest child in a sprawling Catholic family of nine, he (like Cruijff) signed for Ajax while still a teenager. Van Gaal was a skilful player, his long neck and upright posture rendering him particularly adept at headers, and his bent nose telling of countless mid-air collisions with opponents’ heads and elbows. With his hawkish features and regal stance, he was a charismatic figure both on and off the pitch. He was, however, a terribly slow runner and dribbler, and as such played in the Ajax first eleven only once, in a friendly when Cruijff was unavailable. The disappointed young player soon found himself loaned to Antwerp, and later to North Holland’s SC Telstar, before winding up at Rotterdam’s Sparta, a small club often overshadowed by its near neighbours Feyenoord.",

The Cimentaro is a bank of volcanic tufa which lies in a valley above Massa; they hew tunnels into the soft material and extract it as a building stone. You can cut it with a knife. It becomes more valuable–that is less spongy–the deeper you excavate, and the rock is not blasted, but artfully split away from the cliff with wooden wedges and then chopped up into blocks of convenient size. Walls built of such fliable stone must necessarily be thick and coated with plaster against the damp, but it is none the less cheaper than limestone in the long run.",

It was the hideous inconvenience of it all that was gnawing at Wheater—and also, to be fair to him, a vague muddled distress about his children. “I didn’t know the poor little chaps cared so much,” was all this emotion wrung from him; none the less, Boyne felt, it was sincere.",

He passed through the fierce and friendly peasant faces, and came where his good horse and the rough- haired garrons were tied to bushes; and mounted and bade his ungainly bodyguard mount also and ride into the narrow boreen. When they had gone a little way, Duallach, who rode last, turned towards the house where a little group of Dermotts and Namaras stood next to a more numerous group of countrymen, and cried: 'Dermott, you deserve to be as you are this hour, a lantern without a candle, a purse without a penny, a sheep without wool, for your hand was ever niggardly to piper and fiddler and story-teller and to poor travelling people.' He had not done before the three old Dermotts from the Ox Mountains had run towards their horses, and old Dermott himself had caught the bridle of a garron of the Namaras and was calling to the others to follow him; and many blows and many deaths had been had not the countrymen caught up still glowing sticks from the ashes of the fires and hurled them among the horses with loud cries, making all plunge and rear, and some break from those who held them, the whites of their eyes gleaming in the dawn.",

This was Grover – the gentlest and saddest of the boys.",
