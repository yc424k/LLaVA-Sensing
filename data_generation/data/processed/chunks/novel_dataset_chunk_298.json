But her own training had been too different: there were veils she could not lift. She looked back at her married life, and its colourless uniformity took on an air of high restraint and order. Was it because she had been so incurious that it had worn that look to her? It struck her with amazement that she had never given a thought to her husband's past, or wondered what he did and where he went when he was away from her. If she had been asked what she supposed he thought about when they were apart, she would instantly have answered: his snuff-boxes. It had never occurred to her that he might have passions, interests, preoccupations of which she was absolutely ignorant. Yet he went up to Paris rather regularly: ostensibly to attend sales and exhibitions, or to confer with dealers and collectors. She tried to picture him, straight, trim, beautifully brushed and varnished, walking furtively down a quiet street, and looking about him before he slipped into a doorway. She understood now that she had been cold to him: what more likely than that he had sought compensations? All men were like that, she supposed—no doubt her simplicity had amused him.",

Dawa is still groaning with snow blindness, but Jang-bu and Phu-Tsering have crossed Black River to hunt scraps of low shrub juniper for firewood, and GS is up on this Somdo mountainside viewing his sheep; he returns half-frozen toward midmorning. After a quick meal of chapatis, we set off on a survey of other sheep populations in the region, heading eastward up the Saldang trail, which follows the north bank of the White River. Like the Saure and other east-west rivers in this season, this one is snowbound on the side that faces north, and across the water, we can see snow tracks of marmot, wandering outward in weird patterns from a burrow; perhaps the animals, sent underground too early by those blizzards of the late monsoon, had gone out foraging. But they are hibernated now, there is no fresh marmot sign, the land seems empty.",

He managed it by descriptive indirection, by going through another image: ‘The Description which Travellers give of the Seas of Greenland seems to come the nearest to it,’ he wrote. ‘You must imagine your lake put in Agitation by a strong Wind, and frozen all at once.’ It was a brilliant choice of comparison, for it drew upon the travelogues of those few travellers who had sailed west out of Plymouth and then north, towards the unknown upper reaches of the world, and had returned with stories of seas stiff with cold and air so frigid that one’s breath froze and tinkled to the deck.",

It was long and hollow and the prevailing wind on it, remarkably, was almost straight offshore. It seemed that a steep mountain ridge behind the village bent the trades to the west right there, and an offshore canyon somehow combined with a broken slab of reef to bend swells into the wind. The result was a beautiful but lethal-looking wave, almost surely too fast and shallow to ride. It broke below sea level, into a short, deep trough that the wave itself created, then exploded up across an exposed coral shelf. The wave got better as the surf got bigger, though—more possible, at least, to mind-surf without impossible accelerations through ridiculously fast sections. I walked out on the shelf at low tide to study it more closely. The lagoon was full of both urchins and man-made hazards—fish and crab traps with clear line strung between poles. Set after turquoise, wind-brushed set roared past. The biggest waves were breaking maybe five feet from the rocks. No. Uh-uh. We named the spot Almosts.",

We are probably among the last people in the world to have heard of it, though it took place scarcely 150 miles away. The Aurangzebs moved up to Saidu on 21 December, but presumably are safe: the wireless would surely have mentioned it had they been involved. An estimated 7,500 have been killed and 14,000 left homeless. Some forty miles of the new Indus Highway have been demolished and repairs are likely to take a few months, during which no supplies can come through to the Northern Areas by road; therefore serious petrol and kerosene shortages are forecast.",

They make good progress, keeping just off the brink of the ridge, where they are out of the wind, but where the terrain is more difficult. It is, writes Norton afterwards, like climbing up giant overlapping roof tiles. There is nothing to grip on to; everything is trying to shuck you off. Somervell has to stop, but Norton presses on to 28,000 feet before he realizes that he will die if he does not turn back. Precariously he descends the slabs, and meets Somervell. They descend together back towards the col, with Norton perhaps twenty yards ahead of Somervell. Suddenly Somervell coughs hard, agonizingly hard, and feels something from inside him, some object, detach itself and jam in his throat. He begins to choke to death. He cannot breathe, nor can he shout to Norton. Norton turns, but thinks that Somervell is hanging back to make a sketch of the mountain. No, he is hanging back to die. He sits down in the snow, and watches Norton walk on away from him. Then – a final effort – he hammers his chest and throat with his clenched fist, and simultaneously coughs as hard as he can. The thing dislodges itself and jumps into his mouth. He spits it out on to the snow. It is a chunk of his larynx, killed by frostbite.",

The Fairweather Fault, where two tectonic plates scrape past each other, runs through the crossbar of the T at the head of the bay. Such a formation is known as a strike-slip fault. Occasionally the energy built up by this slow friction is released suddenly, causing an earthquake. As happened on the Lamplugh Glacier in 2016, seismic activity can unleash huge amounts of debris. Because of Lituya Bay’s long, narrow shape, these landslides can have the effect of dumping a load of gravel into a bathtub.",

    "target_paragraph": "The tug came back downstream, the water shearing in long rolling cylinders, rocking the float at last with the echo of passage, the float lurching onto the rolling cylinder with a plopping sound and a long jarring noise as the door rolled back and two men emerged, carrying a shell. They set it in the water and a moment later Bland came out, with the sculls. He wore flannels, a gray jacket and a stiff straw hat. Either he or his mother had read somewhere that Oxford students pulled in flannels and stiff hats, so early one March they bought Gerald a one pair shell and in his flannels and stiff hat he went on the river. The folks at the boathouse threatened to call a policeman, but he went anyway. His mother came down in a hired auto, in a fur suit like an arctic explorer’s, and saw him off in a twenty-five mile wind and a steady drove of ice floes like dirty sheep. Ever since then I have believed that God is not only a gentleman and a sport; he is a Kentuckian too. When he sailed away she made a detour and came down to the river again and drove along parallel with him, the car in low gear. They said you couldn’t have told they’d ever seen one another before, like a King and Queen, not even looking at one another, just moving side by side across Massachusetts on parallel courses like a couple of planets.",

The fishermen yell at me to be still, but I make my way forward and swing one leg over the gunwale. I scoot forward so that I’m in shallower water—it would be pretty stupid to fall off and drown six feet from the shore—and lower myself onto what I know is soft white sand, but what feels like a concrete highway swaying in a major earthquake. My eyes seem to be bouncing around like pinballs. I take a step forward and let go of Clemence. My head reels. The ground leaps up and crashes against my knees. As my head swings down to hit the beach, two strong men grab my arms from each side and jerk me up to my feet. They lift me up so that my feet barely touch the ground and carry me away. I go through the motions of walking. We pass small tin-walled houses with cleanly cut and brightly painted gingerbread trim. Fish traps are scattered about. Chickens run clucking out of our way. We pass under a shady tree and out onto black pavement. An entourage follows now. On the first corner we come to is a tall yellow building sprouting flags and emblems. The islanders sit me down in a folding metal chair on a shaded porch. Everyone talks at once in a jumble of Creole and French. Finally they get my name and begin making phone calls. I’m left in peace for a moment.",

All 2,100 miles of the trail, as well as side trails, footbridges, signs, blazes, and shelters, are maintained by volunteers—indeed, the AT is said to be the largest volunteer-run undertaking on the planet. It remains gloriously free of commercialism. The Appalachian Trail Conference didn’t hire its first paid employee until 1968, and it retains the air of a friendly, accessible, dedicated outfit. The AT is no longer the longest hiking trail—the Pacific Crest and Continental Divide trails, both out West, are slightly longer—but it will always be the first and greatest. It has a lot of friends. It deserves them.",

There they set up their headquarters in an extraordinary complex of bomb-proof caves in the karst mountains surrounding the little town. Without that natural resource, they could not possibly have withstood so many years of saturation bombing. The USAF put everything they had into pinpointing the Pathet Lao positions, deployed all their most sophisticated equipment, used their most skilled and bravest airmen. Those were volunteers disguised as civilians because of this being a covert operation: in CIA-speak a ‘non-attributable war’. One volunteer – Timothy Castle, quoted above – recently recalled: ‘Around the airfield at Nakhon Phanom [in Thailand] we were concerned with safe and successful flying, not foreign policy issues. As a twenty-year-old airman I neither knew nor cared about the geostrategic dynamics that had pulled Laos into such a cataclysmic war.’",

Somebody shooting off a cap pistol, I thought. Then came a noise like a very quick motor, louder than the hum of the planes, a merry burble of noise, monotonously regular—machine guns. Each plane dipped behind the island's skyline and then came up again, one, two, three. They wheeled like swallows and dipped again at the same place. The machine-gunning stopped from time to time as if for breath, and then went on. The junk's mast and blackened sail moved a little, and jerked uncertainly, and seemed to sag. It was hard to see just what happened. Nobody said a word.",

Apartments like this expose those secrets, for straight below us, behind the extremely thick walls and beneath banyan scrub, are four concrete concentric structures that look like wide dirt-filled wells. The British called them dakhmas, “the towers of silence.” I have no idea why, as they look nothing like towers. Three are empty, the fourth is not. Inside I can see the shapes of shrunken dead Parsis awaiting their birds of paradise: the white-backed vulture.",

Elegant and refined, yet clearly of the people, she was heavyset but strong, with long white hair pulled back in a tight bun. Her face was deeply lined and bronzed by the sun. Her eyes sparkled. One of twelve children, she had been born in 1928, when Murillo was just a cluster of palm and thatched houses. The town grew in the 1940s as men and women from both sides sought refuge from La Violencia. One main street running past the church was settled by Liberals from Santander. Conservatives from Boyacá built their homes along the street running parallel to it, one block over. The façades on all the houses are today bright and joyous, but after four generations, some families still refuse to speak to one another.",

When I looked at it with insincere admiration and murmured ‘Too much!’ she at once dropped to 1,000 soles. ‘You must buy it to help this family!’ Rachel whispered vehemently – ‘Think of all they’ve done to help Juana!’ And I didn’t resent this rip-off; after all, Señor Antonio is determined to accept no corral payment. The thick warm blanket, of black, red and blue squares, will add a touch of luxury to our equipage and may ease Rachel’s seat during long weeks in the saddle. (Though actually she’s been out of it, so far, as much as in it.)",

It had turned into a bright day, warm and windless, and the landscape was illuminated with the exact, egalitarian sunlight of high places. Sound carried precisely through the thin air, and I could hear the clanking and talking of climbers descending the Weissmies, half a mile or so away. My right hand didn’t particularly feel like part of me. But, I was vaguely relieved to notice, only the pads of three fingers were affected, and those not to any serious depth. When I tapped them against the rock they made a hard, hollow sound, like wood knocking on metal. I got out my penknife and started to whittle at them. On the flat grey rock between my knees grew a pile of little iotas of skin. Eventually, when I had whittled down to pink skin, and my fingers had started to hurt at each scrape of the knife, I cremated the pyre of shavings in the orange flame of a lighter. They went with a crackle and the scent of charred flesh.",

The slightly buckled back wheel was straightened, brake pads and ball bearings were replaced, all the spokes were tightened. The high-tech equipment in use amazed me – though it should not have, given the state of the local roads and the numbers of local bicycles. Cycling fatalities caused by brake failures are common, said the young man. (Like myself, Lao cyclists don’t wear helmets – though most affluent urban Honda riders do.) I asked why the sturdier Chinese machines are not favoured over these Thai disasters-waiting-to-happen and the reply was: ‘Too many kip for the Chinese and the Thai look better.’ Which of course they do if you fancy pink bicycles with Laura Ashley patterned saddles.",

Her parents-in-law had remained in town, and she enjoyed being alone with her husband, exploring and appraising the treasures of the great half-abandoned house, and watching her boy scamper over the June meadows or trot about the gardens on the pony his step-father had given him. Paul, after Mrs. Heeny’s departure, had grown fretful and restive, and Undine had found it more and more difficult to fit his small exacting personality into her cramped rooms and crowded life. He irritated her by pining for his Aunt Laura, his Marvell granny, and old Mr. Dagonet’s funny stories about gods and fairies; and his wistful allusions to his games with Clare’s children sounded like a lesson he might have been drilled in to make her feel how little he belonged to her. But once released from Paris, and blessed with rabbits, a pony and the freedom of the fields, he became again all that a charming child should be, and for a time it amused her to share in his romps and rambles. Raymond seemed enchanted at the picture they made, and the quiet weeks of fresh air and outdoor activity gave her back a bloom that reflected itself in her tranquillized mood. She was the more resigned to this interlude because she was so sure of its not lasting. Before they left Paris a doctor had been found to say that Paul—who was certainly looking pale and pulled-down—was in urgent need of sea air, and Undine had nearly convinced her husband of the expediency of hiring a châlet at Deauville for July and August, when this plan, and with it every other prospect of escape, was dashed by the sudden death of the old Marquis.",

I immediately wished I hadn't, as the equivalent of £450 flashed up on the screen. £450 each. Our flight home was from Panama, so not going at all wasn't an option, and the only alternative to a bank-busting airline ticket, was a treacherous trip by boat and car through the dangerous and largely unexplored Darien Gap.

She read every page of the book, writing down her comments as she went along (an English-language edition, published in 1958, includes them). She notes the book’s illegal parts—“on p. 36 there begins an illegal discussion”—but other of her objections are only literary or commonsensical. Even a reader completely sympathetic to Radishchev might find some of Catherine’s comments hard to argue with. “Arbitrary, quasi-philosophical ravings,” she says of one passage, and I had to agree. In fact, Radishchev’s book is kind of a mess, like a screed written by a junior high student against the school administration. Of one heated thirty-page section, the author says he found it written on a single piece of paper: “Here it says that everything written above was found on a piece of paper which he picked up in the road,” Catherine dryly remarks. And yet the book is also bold, shocking, and moving—not to mention morally right.",

Even in 1935 it wasn’t easy to get a plane in East Africa and it was almost impossible to get very far across country without one. There were roads, of course, leading in a dozen directions out of Nairobi. They started out boldly enough, but grew narrow and rough after a few miles and dwindled into the rock-studded hills, or lost themselves in a morass of red muram mud or black cotton soil, in the flat country and the valleys. On a map they look sturdy and incapable of deceit, but to have ventured from Nairobi south toward Machakos or Magadi in anything less formidable than a moderately powered John Deere tractor was optimistic to the point of sheer whimsy, and the road to the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, north and west through Naivasha, called ‘practicable’ in the dry season, had, when I last used it after a mild rain, an adhesive quality equal to that of the most prized black treacle.",

Her nephew sat without the mellow downward pool of the lamp, with his feet braced against the corner of the hearth from which his boot-soles and the boot-soles of John Sartoris before him had long since worn the varnish away, puffing his cigar.

But she had been put off her balance by the expression of Lewis Tarrant’s face, the intonation of his voice. Evidently he too supposed she was lying to shield her brother, and like the gentleman he was he was going to shield her; and the business was not in the least to his liking.

Then came a long descent into the hot, dusty profundity of the Marañon gorge; this evening we are at 6,100 feet, our lowest point since leaving the coast. Black clouds were assembling around the nearby desiccated mountains as we crossed this senior tributary of the Amazon (some claim that the Marañon is the young Amazon), which here is close to its source, yet wide, deep and swift. A with-it suspension bridge, built in 1956, took our road onto the main Lima-Pucallpa highway – and also onto the ‘main street’ of this sleazy newish settlement (pop. approx. 400). Once Tingo Chico hoped to become an important river port; now it has an air of irremediable failure and seems to be inhabited chiefly by drunks, prostitutes and thin dogs. However, our anxious eyes had discerned from afar an Alf field on the slope behind the houses. We asked two bedraggled mestizo women – sitting on a doorstep, half-heartedly combatting flies – if/how/where we could buy fodder; but they only stared at us blankly before retreating into their casa and banging the door.",
