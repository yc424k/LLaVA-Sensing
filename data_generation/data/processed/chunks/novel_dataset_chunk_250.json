Immediately ahead loomed the magnificent gray-brown cone of Mount Sakurajima, topped by its own little beret of cloud. The road was flat, and all the way the smell of the ocean – of fishing nets drying, of petrol on the water, of open drains, of rubbish tipped onto the beaches, of castor oil and rotting fish heads – floated up to remind me that Japan where the Pacific meets the East China Sea is the same Japan that is lapped by the Sea of Okhotsk.",

And even now, with great civility and customary efficiency, the Bhutanese had foreigners exactly where they wanted them: the foreign advisers were accommodated in the twenty-dollar-a-night hotels downtown, while tourists “in the package form” were sequestered in remote hilltop hotels, an hour’s walk from the locals, paying $250 a night. Protecting the country’s culture was one reason for continuing the policy. But there seemed to be another. For by now, Bhutan’s cachet lies primarily in its remoteness: people want to visit it precisely because most people cannot visit it. Bhutan is a beautiful and peaceful and magical land, but so, too, are many of the areas around the Himalayas; and those who want to explore the mountains can do so with more convenience and comfort, at literally one-tenth the price, in Nepal, while those who are drawn to Tibetan Buddhism can now go straight to the source—Tibet—or to the high lunar spaces of Ladakh. What attracts foreigners to Bhutan is mostly the fact that, as the travel brochure says, it is “one of the most exclusive and rare destinations for any tourist.” And Bhutan guards its chastity with an iron lock. If the Hidden Kingdom were to open up to the world, there might be not only cultural but economic loss.",

Our escort (we had volunteer followers from village to village) had camped meantime on a bit of level ground half-way up the slope, and in the still breathless evening the smell of wood-smoke reached our nostrils from below with the penetrating delicacy of some choice scent. Voices also ascended, wonderful in their distinct and immaterial clearness. Jim sat on the trunk of a felled tree, and pulling out his pipe began to smoke. A new growth of grass and bushes was springing up; there were traces of an earthwork under a mass of thorny twigs. “It all started from here,” he said, after a long and meditative silence. On the other hill, two hundred yards across a sombre precipice, I saw a line of high blackened stakes, showing here and there ruinously — the remnants of Sherif Ali’s impregnable camp.",

I said that I was sorry, but I had been in Italy, adding, “Perhaps the Italians didn’t stamp my passport.” “Yours wouldn’t be the first,” he tersely replied and began cursing the population. I could see that I had pushed the right button, as the Germans were particularly exasperated with their southern neighbors at that time due to their various financial crises. I felt scared but looked him directly in the eyes and made up a date and story of my most recent entry. He asked to see the airplane receipt, but it had been an electronic ticket, which I had thrown away. “Do you have an Italian hotel receipt?” “Certainly, in my checked luggage. I’m returning from my vacation at a Calabrian spa.” I felt as though I was in a scene from a film.

Why, one person in the world, one single person belonging to one, of one's very own, to talk to, to take care of, to love, to be interested in, was worth more than all the speeches on platforms and the compliments of chairmen in the world.

They lay above the streets like a white fog off a swamp. Through the gloom, the whole world went to tea. Girls in short amorphous capes and long flowing skirts and hats like straw bathtubs waited for taxis in front of the Plaza Grill; girls in long satin coats and coloured shoes and hats like straw manhole covers tapped the tune of a cataract on the dance floors of the Lorraine and the St Regis. Under the sombre ironic parrots of the Biltmore a halo of golden bobs disintegrated into black lace and shoulder bouquets between the pale hours of tea and dinner that sealed the princely windows; the clank of lank contemporaneous silhouettes drowned the clatter of teacups at the Ritz.",

In Kenya the main threat to life comes not from the spears or poisoned arrows of inflamed warriors but from the average driver’s attitude to cyclists and pedestrians. Both are expendable, as is proved by the road-death statistics printed daily in the national newspapers. When matatus (mini-van taxis) or buses or trucks are intent on overtaking each other (which is all the time), the presence of wayside travellers is ignored. However narrow the road, overtaking is the name of the game, as though each driver were racing for a valuable prize. The matatu-drivers do indeed have an economic motive for their madness; the more miles they can cover in a day the more they earn. And then the bus- and truck-drivers’ macho distaste for being out-sped causes the whole stream of traffic to become homicidal. The drivers’ own death-rate, to say nothing of their passengers’, is not much less horrendous; that willingness to dice with death which spreads the AIDS virus also prevails on the road.",

It is made so partly by its setting, land and sea so exquisitely interacting, but chiefly by its impression of irresistible activity. It is like a cauldron, seething, hissing, hooting, arguing, enmeshed in a labyrinth of tunnels and flyovers, with those skyscrapers erupting everywhere into view, with ferries churning and hoverfoils splashing and great jets flying in, with fleets of ships lying always off-shore, with double-decker buses and clanging tram-cars, with a car it seems for every square foot of roadway, with a pedestrian for every square inch of sidewalk, and funicular trains crawling up and down the mountainside, and small scrub-faced policemen scudding about on motor bikes – all in all, with a pace of life so unremitting, a sense of movement and enterprise so challenging, that one’s senses are overwhelmed by the sheer glory of human animation.",

Some of the cliffside trail is less than two feet wide—I measure it—and skirts sheer precipice; nor is the rest very much better, for these mountainsides of shining grass are so precipitous, so devoid of trees or even shrubs, that a stumbler might tumble and roll thousands of feet, then drop into the dark where the sun ends, for want of anything to catch hold of.",

At two I was treated to a full-scale bell-ringing display: the bells in the campanile assisted by a selection of handbells, one rung very loudly at the door of my cell by Fr. Theophanes. But as soon as silence had returned I fell asleep again, and it was nearly four a.m. before I finally pulled myself out of bed. It was pitch dark and very cold. I dressed by the light of the lantern, then picked my way down through the empty stairways and corridors of Mar Saba, towards the deep swell and eddy of monastic chant.",

At last the distant lights of Tiel, poised on the first hill I had seen in Holland, twinkled into being on the other bank.

I assumed such open hillsides – though broken by occasional bush-filled gullies – would be easy to negotiate. Not so: within an hour my distinct path had become a maze of pathlets, looking from a distance like a tangle of brown rope thrown on the green slopes. Twice I followed the least indistinct pathlet only to find it petering out in a gully. For over an hour I was flummoxed and in mid-afternoon mightily relieved to see one wide track going directly down to the Bahia Honda-San Cristobal motor road – never far from my route though now visible for the first time. Given my time constraint it seemed sensible to descend here. Thus I came to the road some fifteen miles from San Cristobal and ten miles short of Los Arroyos.",

The Sweethearts piano bar at the local casino serves—inevitably—“crocktails,” and one life-size croc has been created entirely out of beer cans; on the road into Kakadu National Park, some shrewd entrepreneurs have even erected a twenty-foot tall crocodile, cruelly equipped with boxing gloves. Not long ago, the Four Seasons hotel chain opened up, nearby, the world’s first hotel shaped entirely like a crocodile, a 750-foot, $11 million monstrosity with evil yellow eyes and a huge gray spine. When one croc decapitated a fisherman last year, in front of a transfixed group of tourists, it was rumored that a tour operator promptly demanded more of the same.",

Back, in fact, to the unseasonable cold of an Alpine pass in the summer of 1672, where the philosopher and churchman Thomas Burnet is guiding his young aristocratic charge, the Earl of Wiltshire, over the Alps and down to Lombardy. Because before mountains could become loved, a past had to be defined for them, and for that Burnet was to prove essential.",

But at least, I realized, as I rolled myself up and forward on to my knees, I am now, officially, annoyed, I’m active, which is good, really good, because I am no longer in despair. I am not begging for help. And all I need is that camera which I bought specially, just for this, for four hundred whole pounds, and that’s enough to make anyone anxious, a new Nikon FM2, all manual, no computer-nonsense to go wimpy on you the moment it gets wet, and the really sharp 50 mm Microknickers, just right for a snotfish.

    "target_paragraph": "IN June this year there were a few fine days, and we supposed the summer had really come at last. The effect was to make us feel our flat (which is really a very nice well-planned one on the second floor at the corner overlooking the cemetery, and not at all stuffy) but a dull place after all, and think with something like longing of the country. It was the year of the fifth anniversary of our wedding, and having decided to mark the occasion by a trip abroad in the proper holiday season of August we could not afford, neither did we desire, to spend money on trips into the country in June. My wife therefore suggested that we should devote a few afternoons to a series of short excursions within a radius of, say, from five to ten miles round our town, and visit one after the other those of our acquaintances who live near enough to Storchwerder and farm their own estates. “In this way,” said she, “we shall get much fresh air at little cost.”",

We were on an island, with the transparent Salmon River on one side—hurrying, scarcely a foot deep—and a small slough on the other. Deeper pools, under bedrock ledges, were above us and below us. We built our fire on the lemon-sized gravel of what would in higher water be the riverbed, and we pitched the tents on slightly higher ground among open stands of willow, on sand that showed what Bob Fedeler called “the old tracks of a young griz.” We would stay two nights, according to plan, before beginning the long descent to the Kobuk; and in the intervening day we would first assemble the kayaks and then be free to disperse and explore the terrain.",

The waterfront walk remains its most notable urban feature, a broad promenade of shops and stalls and small restaurants where families gather by morning and lovers come together at the end of day. In the open-air fish market, men process their catch, while their women, with the slightest provocation, launch into heartfelt laments recalling the mornings of their youth when fathers and brothers returned with tubs brimming with fish. In the light of such memories, today’s haul, spread across a dozen tables in the shade, appears meager, a shadow of what once was. Still, to anyone unfamiliar with the fishery, it offers an amazing array of exotic and beautiful creatures with strange shapes and odd appendages, fish that to the temperate eye belong less on a plate than in the pages of a rare scientific monograph.",

I went to the library and looked up counterpane in a dictionary so that I might at least escape censure on that score. (I was astonished to find out that it was a bedspread; for three days I’d been fiddling with the window.) Within the house, I tried to remain silent and inconspicuous. I even turned over quietly in my creaking bed. But no matter how hard I tried, I seemed fated to annoy. On the third afternoon as I crept in, Mrs. Gubbins confronted me in the hallway with an empty cigarette packet, and demanded to know if it was I who had thrust it in the privet hedge. I began to understand why innocent people sign extravagant confessions in police stations. That evening, I forgot to turn off the water heater after a quick and stealthy bath and compounded the error by leaving strands of hair in the plughole. The next morning came the final humiliation. Mrs. Gubbins marched me wordlessly to the toilet and showed me a little turd that had not flushed away. We agreed that I should leave after breakfast.",

It was unseasonably hot for September, there had been no rain for weeks, and all afternoon the contours of the eastern seaboard faded away into the weary hazes of the heat. The soil was parched and dusty, and under a glazed and burning sky coarse yellow grasses and the withered stalks of weeds simmered and flashed beside the tracks. The whole continent seemed to be gasping for its breath. In the hot green depths of the train a powder of fine cinders beat in through the meshes of the screens, and during the pauses at stations the little fans at both ends of the car hummed monotonously, with a sound that seemed to be the voice of the heat itself. During these intervals when the train stood still, enormous engines steamed slowly by on adjacent tracks, or stood panting, passive as great cats, and their engineers wiped wads of blackened waste across their grimy faces, while the passengers fanned feebly with sheaves of languid paper or sat in soaked and sweltering dejection.",

In the hard light, the blue-gray creature seems far too swift to catch, yet the streaming wolves gain ground on the hard snow. Then they are whisking through the matted juniper and down over steepening rocks, and it appears that the bharal will be cut off and bowled over, down the mountain, but at the last moment it scoots free and gains a narrow ledge where no wolf can follow.",

Modern ones would call for cigarettes, Grand Marnier, and a pack of cards, and bid the gale howl itself out. But those ancient feathered fowls - did they peck at each other viciously, or content themselves with shivering in silence among their crags? So have I seen, during a blizzard, the bedraggled vultures perched among the bleak hills of Asia Minor. They sat round the corpse of a camel, one of the unhappiest of its race, that had dragged huge carpets over the mountain tracks and expired in the performance of a task for which it seemed peculiarly unfitted. The vultures craned their necks, but not one of them moved from its stone. They were plainly hungry. But they preferred it dry.",

As for Starwick, he remained coldly, wearily, sorrowfully impassive; he accepted this bitter dissolution of their plans with a weary resignation at once sad and yet profoundly indifferent; his own plans were more wrapped in a mantle of mysterious and tragic secretiveness than ever before. And seeing the desperate state which their affairs had come to, and that she could not look for help from these three gloomy secessionists, Elinor instantly took charge of things again and became the woman who had driven an ambulance in the war.",
