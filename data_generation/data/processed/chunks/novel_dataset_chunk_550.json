I put my head gratefully round the corner to breathe the sweet air. The garden is on the west side of the lighthouse on ground falling steeply away to the flat of the cornfields that stretch between Arkona and Putgarten. It is a pretty place full of lilies—in flower that day—and of poplars, those most musical of trees. Rough steps cut in the side of the hill lead down out of the garden to a footpath through the rye to Putgarten; and on the top step, as straight and motionless as the poplars, stood two persons under umbrellas, gazing in silence at the view. Oh, unmistakable English backs! And most unmistakable of all backs, the backs of the Harvey-Brownes.",

Kabul for the most part has an easy unpretentious character, as of a Balkan town in the good sense of the term. It clusters round a few bare rocky hills which rise abruptly from the verdant plain and act as defences. Snow-mountains decorate the distance, the parliament sits in a cornfield, and long avenues shade the town’s approaches. In winter, at a height of 6000 feet, the cold may be inconvenient. But at present the climate is perfect, hot yet always fresh. Cinemas and alcohol are forbidden. The Legation doctor has had to give up treating women at the instance of the Church; though they sometimes visit him disguised as boys. And the whole policy of forcible Westernisation is in abeyance. All the same, Westernisation is progressing by example, and one feels that perhaps the Afghans have struck the mean for which Asia is looking. Even the most nationalist of them makes a pleasant contrast with the mincing assertiveness of the modern Persian.",

In dry sunshine and the limpid breeze down from the mountains, two black cows are threshing rice, flanks gleaming in the light of afternoon. First the paddy is drained and the rice sickled, then the yoked animals, tied by a long line to a stake in the middle of the rice, are driven round and round in a slowly decreasing circle while children fling the stalks beneath their hooves. Then the stalks are tossed into the air, and the grains beneath swept into baskets to be taken home and winnowed. The fire-colored dragonflies in the early autumn air, the bent backs in bright reds and yellows, the gleam on the black cattle and grain stubble, the fresh green of the paddies and the sparkling river—over everything lies an immortal light, like transparent silver.",

After Afghanistan, Burma is the world’s largest producer of heroin. Much of the opium used in heroin production is grown in Wa State, in the rugged north-eastern mountains beyond Maymyo. The business is run by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), a group described by the US State Department as the world’s ‘most heavily armed narco-traffickers’. The Burmese regime is thought to have been benefiting financially from this illegal trade in drugs since the UWSA signed a ceasefire agreement with the Burmese generals in 1989. But the generals insist they are working to eradicate the drug industry, and from time to time they invite foreign journalists to specially organized ceremonies where enormous mounds of heroin, opium and methamphetamine pills are burned to cinders in front of international television crews.",

Toolboxes of varying sizes, hard hats and clay coated work boots, interspersed with an occasional vermin box trap, had replaced the usual hotel corridor litter of discarded room service trays. It was clear the Orange Lodge served as a dormitory for that most discerning of traveller, the transient Bornean construction worker.",

I had seen the wood across the fields, and had thought it might make a good place to sleep. I reached it, and crept into it, pushing low under poplar branches. I remembered exploring the oakwoods of Staverton Thicks in Suffolk with Roger on just such a bright windy day, a year and a half previously, stepping over dozens of fallen oak trunks that were rotting into the ground. Roger had explained to me how essential this decaying matter was to the health of a woodland, that the benign influence of trees continued long after their death. He had stopped by a big prostrate oak limb, and prised off a curved gule of bark; beneath it teemed hundreds of insects: woodlice, ants and others species I could not recognise. Then we had forged on deeper into the wood, to a cleared circle where Roger said he knew local Wiccan enthusiasts came to worship, sometimes naked. I wasn’t sure I believed him, but he held to his line. Talismans were hung by wool and string from oak branches; feathers, rags, fragments of text, spinning and swinging. On the way back through the wood, I had levered a long peat-brown wedge of hard wood from the root of a fallen oak. Later, I sanded it down and gave it to my father as a memento from the Thicks.",

    "target_paragraph": "From the beginning, the river running through the Medio Magdalena was all about the movement of goods and people. Tobacco from Ambalema passed through the hands of German merchants in Barranquilla to reach markets in New York and Hamburg, where it was paid for in gold and celebrated as the finest product of its kind. Vegetable ivory, derived from the seeds of the tagua palm, emerged in the 1880s as one of Colombia’s leading exports, earning literally its weight in gold. Before the age of plastics, tagua was the basis for every button on every garment worn in the industrialized world, and Colombia was the main source. Cotton from Neiva kept alive the textile mills of England, especially as exports from the American South dwindled with the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. From these same cotton fields of the Alto Magdalena came the raw product that two generations later made possible the textile industry of Medellín, with the founding of Coltejer in 1907 and Fabricato, a decade later, in 1920. Cotton for the mills of Medellín, cacao from Cúcuta, coffee from Manizales, leather and hides from Cundinamarca, livestock from Bolívar destined for Jamaica—everything traveled by river, including the engineers and priests, artists and academics, physicians, politicians, common laborers and ranch hands, and all the many thousands of immigrants who washed ashore in Barranquilla throughout the nineteenth century: Italians, Germans, Syrians, and Lebanese, all destined to find new lives in the interior of the country. In a mountainous land where geography alone impeded and defied the growth of a modern state, the Río Magdalena literally made commerce—and, thus, Colombia—possible. Thanks to the river, in 1950 a merchant could ship a bushel of coffee from Medellín to London for less than it cost to send it to Bogotá.",

Husk found a vacant spot in the mouth of Courthouse Wash where, under a splendid cottonwood tree, he set up his base camp. There was a spring nearby, with a pool below it large as a bathtub where his new wife could bathe and wash her flaxen hair. With two charges of blasting powder (one of which failed to go off) Husk excavated a pit toilet in the alluvium (he was in a hurry) and slung a tent over it. The Baptist Church was only five miles away in the heart of downtown Moab behind T. C. Tracey’s gas station but once his family had been established in their new home Husk – a somewhat indifferent Christian – went straight to the Club 66, where the smoke-dense air crackled with radioactivity and the smell of honest miners’ sweat. Here he met his benefactor, a man known as Charles ‘Chuck’ Graham. Or Ingraham – the name has been obscured by the many variants of the narrative.",

This just makes him more nervous and he jumps back as if we are going to hit him. Mild-mannered Abe, however, is Tarzan of the traffic jungle. He knows the strict species pecking order: pedestrians are on the bottom and run out of the way of everything, bicycles make way for cycle-rickshaws, which give way to auto-rickshaws, which stop for cars, which are subservient to trucks. Buses stop for one thing and one thing only. Not customers—they jump on while the buses are still moving. The only thing that can stop a bus is the king of the road, the lord of the jungle and the top dog.",

Warm air, exhaust, and cigarette smoke burned my eyes. I looked around and saw dozens of men: some stood, others sat, and a few more paced in front of the terminal.

Norman Collie, the Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, sent a telegraph to Base Camp. ‘Heroic Achievements,’ read his message, ‘all deeply moved by glorious deaths.’ The Times concurred, running an obituary for Mallory and Irvine which emphasized the fineness of their deaths and professed certainty that ‘they themselves could hardly have chosen a better end’. For Arthur Hinks, the Secretary of the Mount Everest Committee, the deaths were mitigated by ‘the knowledge that they died somewhere higher than any man had ever been before, and it is possible for their relatives to think of them as lying perhaps even at the summit’. Tom Longstaff, the climber who had been on the mountain with Mallory in 1922, picked up on the same idea. ‘Now they’ll never grow old,’ he wrote, ‘and I am very sure they would not change places with any one of us.’",

The dragon-fly poised motionless over a reed, then shot its blue stitch further through the air. The far hum in the distance seemed made of the broken tremor of fine wings dancing up and down on the horizon. The river water held the reeds now fixed as if glass had hardened round them; and then the glass wavered and the reeds swept low. Pondering, sunken headed, the cattle stood in the fields and cumbrously moved one foot and then another. In the bucket near the house the tap stopped dripping, as if the bucket were full, and then the tap dripped one, two, three separate drops in succession.",

The water of the lake at the head of the valley, on whose shoreline I stood, was frozen – the red reed beds at its periphery locked into place by the ice. A big storm was on its way, according to the radio weather report I had listened to back at the road. Away to the east, I could see thunderheads congregating, and the valley was flooded with storm-light. It was a fixing light, which cast the scene – stilled it, held it. But it was also a light which made the most ordinary objects seem marvellous: the individual rocks around the shore, the slopes of snow lying between the firs, the pine-needles, like pairs of dividers, which had blown on to the lake ice.",

I thought it was an astoundingly beautiful city, even its shabbiness. It was big enough to be interesting and small enough to be walkable. Everything was exotic and fascinating. I ate too much and proudly gained a lot of weight. I made some friends in a cool little circle of art teachers, heard many styles of great music, went to dance clubs, did the sights you only ever have to do once, and vowed to come back – someday.",
