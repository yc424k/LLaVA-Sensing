The system of pillars that once helped maintain the peace between warring Catholics and Protestants served only to keep the new minorities isolated from one another, and from the Dutch at large. Generously subsidised to maintain their traditional beliefs, immigrants had fewer incentives to assimilate. Some scholars claimed that because imams brought to the Netherlands were selected by the Dutch government on the basis of their piety, moderate imams were less likely to apply – so the policy ended up importing precisely the intolerant ideas that would have been better left outside.",

Near the qasr he picked up an obviously old path which led down to the floor of the valley, the dry wadi bed. There, the path merged with the wadi, following the natural line in the landscape for both walkers and water. We passed coils of barbed wire, snaking out of the wadi-floor silt. There were more bullet-casings: reminders that this valley was fought over in 1967; that Ramallah was besieged and bombarded as recently as 2003.",

Inside a cavernous record store, the most prominent tape on sale was “Peculiarities of English Usage.” At the local bookstore, the front display was given over to the Paul Simon songbook and The Ultimate Trivia Quiz Book. On some of the shelves were children’s versions in English of Vanity Fair, Goodbye, Mr. Chips and The Helen Keller Story. Upstairs, copies of The Idiot, Oliver Twist, and Madame Bovary were squashed between The Dialectic of Nihilism, The Politics of Bureaucracy, Social Cohesion and, best of all, Beyond Dumping.

She was so frail that we bundled her in blankets and tucked her in a sun trap, out of the breeze, overlooking the waves. Her granddaughters were tucked around her for extra warmth. I mentioned that the waves, though terrible, looked ridable. The west wind was kicking up a running, waist-high right just off the sand. “Go surfing,” my mother said. I didn’t have a board with me. But Colleen had a longboard in her truck. It was an enormous, ancient log, bought at a yard sale for purposes undetermined. Caroline, though rolling her eyes, gave me the nod. I ran out and caught a few waves. The log was ideal for racing the shorebreak, and I flew down the beach, throwing old-school moves on the ratty little waves till I crashed on the sand. I ran back to our little encampment in the dunes. My mother’s blue eyes were bright. I felt about ten years old—showing off for Mom—and she said, grinning, “You looked just like you did when you were little.” It was the antique longboard. Everyone else was chatting and laughing. Had they seen my waves? “No,” my daughter said. “Go get another one.”",

The thin air had a shimmering, crystalline quality that made even distant peaks seem close enough to touch. Extravagantly illuminated by the midday sun, Everest’s summit pyramid loomed through an intermittent gauze of clouds. Squinting through my camera’s telephoto lens at the upper Southeast Ridge, I was surprised to see four antlike figures moving almost imperceptibly toward the South Summit. I deduced that they must be climbers from the Montenegrin expedition; if they succeeded they would be the first team to reach the top this year. It would also mean that the rumors we’d been hearing of impossibly deep snow were unfounded—if they made the summit, maybe we had a chance of making it, too. But the plume of snow now blowing from the summit ridge was a bad sign: the Montenegrins were struggling upward through ferocious wind.",

The room faced north, and close up to its single tall window grew some of the yew-trees which, she supposed, would naturally collect round clergymen. Yew-trees, churchyards, clergymen—they would hang together, surmised Jen, acknowledging, even as she surmised, that she was ignorant. Photographs of people who looked like wives hung on the walls, interrupted at intervals by photographs of college buildings, and of groups of persons dressed alike—boy scouts, volunteer rifle corps, cricket elevens, football teams and such, within the middle of each group an older individual taking evident pains to show that he felt jolly. There was a singular cold smell about, which, she concluded after a period of interrogation, was the smell of abstinences—the smell of not being smoked in, not being laughed in, not being loved in; very like, in fact, the smell, or rather the absence of smell, which till now had pervaded the back diningroom in Gower Street. So that she concluded the clergyman she was waiting for had lost his wife, if he had ever had one, and lost her a good while ago, and that if he had ever had any children he hadn’t got them now. For some reason, too, she was sure he was a dry and stringy man.",

They have no games or sports, no local racing, clubs, cattle-shows, fox-hunting, politics, rat-catching, or any of those other joys that diversify the lives of our peasantry. No touch of humanity reaches them, no kindly dames send them jellies or blankets, no cheery doctor inquires for their children; they read no newspapers or books, and lack even the mild excitements of church versus chapel, or the vicar's daughter's love-affair, or the squire's latest row with his lady—nothing! Their existence is almost bestial in its blankness. I know them—I have lived among them. For four months in the year they are cooped up in damp dens, not to be called chambers, where an Englishman would deem it infamous to keep a dog—cooped up, amid squalor that must be seen to be believed. . . . The most depraved of city-dwellers has flashes of enthusiasm and self-abnegation never experienced by this shifty, retrogressive, and ungenerous brood, which lives like the beasts of the field and has learnt all too much of their logic. . . .",

The rivers of Strandja watered Istanbul, though people said that south of the industrial town of Lüleburgaz they ran black with tar. For several months a year, Strandja shuddered with the northern wind which the Pomaks called studenyak, the coldie. Studenyak and lodos mingled here, and when you drove the forest hours that lengthened into days, you saw for yourself that Strandja had not had an ice age. The hushed forests felt untouched, untrodden, and unknown, despite the fact that the human story here was old. Uninterrupted oak woods were followed by giant-beech plantations, succeeded by an enchantment of sequoia and ash trees whose green light you could taste, and it tasted of chlorophyll.",

Such dogs are also found in northern Nepal, and last year in the Bhote Khosi region GS was set upon by two of them that were guarding some Bhote packs left on the trail; he narrowly escaped serious injury. The mastiffs are so fierce that Tibetan travelers carry a charm portraying a savage dog fettered in chain: the chain is clasped by the mystical “thunderbolt,” or dorje, and an inscription reads, “The mouth of the blue dog is bound beforehand.”12 During the day the dogs are chained; at night they roam as sentinels and guards. In the first of the Dhorpatan encampments, we walked the center of the mud thoroughfares to avoid the snarling, straining animals on both sides. Then one of these broke or slipped its chain and came for us from behind, without a bark.",

Ever since her emergence from the denser plantations about Winterborne’s residence a pervasive lightness had hung in the damp autumn sky in spite of the vault of cloud, signifying that a moon of some age was shining above its arch. The two white gates were distinct, and the white balls on the pillars, and the puddles and damp ruts left by the recent rain had a cold corpse-eyed luminousness. She entered by the lower gate and crossed the quadrangle to the wing wherein the apartments that had been hers since her marriage were situate, till she stood under a window which, if her husband were in the house, gave light to his bed-chamber.",

It would not be after one hour, two hours, three; the dawn would be empty, the moment and she would not be, then he would hear her and he would lie drenched in the wet grass, serene and one and indivisible in joy, listening to her approach. He would smell her; the whole mist reeked with her; the same malleate hands of mist which drew along his prone drenched flanks palped her pearled barrel too and shaped them both somewhere in immediate time, already married. He would not move. He would lie amid the waking instant of earth’s teeming minute life, the motionless fronds of water-heavy grasses stooping into the mist before his face in black, fixed curves, along each parabola of which the marching drops held in minute magnification the dawn’s rosy miniatures, smelling and even tasting the rich, slow, warm barn-reek milk-reek, the flowing immemorial female, hearing the slow planting and the plopping suck of each deliberate cloven mud-spreading hoof, invisible still in the mist loud with its hymeneal choristers.",

The Italians also built a motor-road from Gondar through Debre Tabor to Dessie, but many of the twenty bridges between Gondar and here were blown up by the Italian army as it retreated before the British liberators, and the rest have been allowed to collapse – as has the road itself. It seems that the Government is as casual about roads as the local chieftains are about tracks. In Nepal, where in most areas communication is also confined to mountain tracks, the village headmen co-operate to organise track maintenance; but here such a communal effort would be unthinkable. If a highland track becomes impassable it is usually repaired by the merchants who are most dependent on it, otherwise maintenance is carried out only if the Emperor or a Governor-General is to visit a particular area, and then the work is so inefficiently done that the track soon relapses into its natural ‘state of chassis’.",

I could hardly believe I was in the same place.\n\nBack at the trail crossing, I spied a man outside the fire station. I walked over to him.",

The strangeness of Vieng Xai’s atmosphere is, I felt, only partly owing to this region’s pivotal significance during the Secret War.

Hot on her heels, usually around nine, there would come a further invasion, this time of the moneychangers. Historically, Uigurs have always been the usurers of the East, and during the golden age of the T’ang they had a monopoly on moneylending at Ch’ang-an, the great eastern terminus of the Silk Road. The moneychanging of the Uigurs today is a less glamorous affair. Its object is to buy FECs (Foreign Exchange Certificates), the Mickey-Mouse money given to foreigners entering China, and to exchange it for normal Chinese currency. The foreigner ends up with a large quantity of Chinese money while the Uigur gets some FECs with which he can buy luxury Western items on the black market. Because the transaction benefits both parties the moneychangers assume that Europeans are longing to enter into negotiations at any time of the day, and the earlier the better. They charge into hotel rooms without knocking and corner the occupant, scribbling offers on dirty scraps of paper. Whether or not the foreigner is enthusiastic about the invasion (and at nine in the morning he is generally unenthusiastic) the moneychangers tend to regard themselves as honoured guests and assume an open invitation to sit down and sort through the foreigner’s rucksack. Sony Walkmen, picture books, brightly coloured pills and digital watches will all be brought out and offered in exchange for flat caps, bowls of yoghurt, Mao suits and pieces of fruit. Other moneychangers take the opportunity to practise their English. One man sat on my bed for an hour and a half reciting a curious litany presumably learned from an eccentric English textbook: ‘I have a dog; Mr Brown has an umbrella; I have a dog.…’",

He stood up and wobbled toward her with a severe limp and an extreme S curve in his spine, then collapsed on the ground in front of her. She fed him and tended to him but he hardly moved for the rest of the day and night and was clearly in distress. The next day he was slightly better but still looked horrible, and Cheryl started to talk about maybe calling the vet to see if he should be put down. She decided to give him a few more days, just in case he got better. On the third day his spine seemed a little straighter, and he was moving around a bit more. Things were looking up. Over the next month, he straightened out noticeably, seeming to get a little less crooked each day, and soon he was his old self, scampering around straight-backed, as if it had never happened. It was an amazing recovery; he must have used up seven or eight lives.",

Because of his own legendary soft-heartedness it costs a great deal just to keep that vast hotel ticking over; all other hoteliers have dismissed most of their staff, but Boris argues – ‘It’s not the servants’ fault that there’s a war on.

As I walked into the third of his galleries and began looking around, I noticed, suddenly, that He was there—an elfin figure in a beret, perched on a wooden chair with an aphorism on his lips, and a cigarette too. I began basking in his warmth and serenity. He began quoting prices.\n\nBefore he could start talking discounts, I tried to deflect him. “Ubud must have changed a lot in the twenty years that you’ve lived here.”",

Its crimson skeleton of willow boughs converged on the apex of its dome in a carnival blaze. No surface escaped ornament. Across its tasselled felt hangings the chunky designs marched to and fro like a forgotten script.\nThe thin air made for a febrile sleep. Musings about Nazira shelved into thoughts of home, and other eyes, other voices. Nameless insects were dropping into my hair, and I smelt the musty odour of felt. Hours later I was woken by a calf cropping the grass round the yurt, and I went out into the cold. Moonlight flooded the sky. The gateway to the caravanserai yawned like a cave in the hill, and its towers were frosted columns. Nazira’s donkeys stamped and coughed together.\nI listened to the river, and felt the traveller’s old excitement. The early Silk Road seemed to enter Central Asia as into somewhere wild and opaque. The great empires to east and west–China, Persia, Rome–petered out in its silence. The illusion was of a dark transition. But in fact this black hole in Asia’s heart nursed a delicate interdependence of nomad and settler. A distant disturbance at one end of the road trembled along its length like an electric current, so that the pressure of pastoral tribes along the Great Wall, in a relentless chain reaction, might unleash the Huns over Europe. A disaster could not occur in Asia, wrote Cicero, that did not shake the Roman economy to its foundations.",

He could see nothing of Pennyways, but he soon discerned Bathsheba through an opening into the reserved space at the further end. Troy thereupon retreated, went round the tent into the darkness and listened. He could hear Bathsheba’s voice immediately inside the canvas; she was conversing with a man. A warmth overspread his face: surely she was not so unprincipled as to flirt in a fair! He wondered if, then, she reckoned upon his death as an absolute certainty. To get at the root of the matter Troy took a penknife from his pocket and softly made two little cuts crosswise in the cloth, which, by folding back the corners, left a hole the size of a wafer. Close to this he placed his face, withdrawing it again in a movement of surprise; for his eye had been within twelve inches of the back of Bathsheba’s head. It was too near to be convenient. He made another hole a little to one side and lower down, in a shaded place beside her chair, from which it was easy and safe to survey her by looking upwards.",
