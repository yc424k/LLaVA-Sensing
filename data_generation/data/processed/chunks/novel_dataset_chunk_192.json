The mali was followed first by Murti, the sweeper, then by Prasad, the dhobi, and finally by Bahadur, Mrs Puri’s Nepali cook. I gave up trying to sleep and went downstairs.",

Dear God, the outrage of this for Jamie!\nBut Jamie seemed quite unconscious of outrage. From time to time she stood in the doorway peering over at Barbara’s wasted face, listening to Barbara’s painful breathing, and then she would turn her bewildered eyes on the nurse, on Mary, but above all on Stephen.\n‘Jamie—come back and sit down by the stove; Mary’s there, it’s all right.’\nCame a queer, halting voice that spoke with an effort: ‘But…Stephen…we quarrelled.’\n‘Come and sit by the stove—Mary’s with her, my dear.’\n‘Hush, please,’ said the nurse, ‘you’re disturbing my patient.’",

We talked to her while Sergei made us dinner—frozen pelmeni that he bought at a local shop, boiled, and served with sour cream. I asked the manager what people found to do in Khandyga. She said she and her husband loved to fish and caught many fish in the summer in the Aldan. I was pleased to notice that she spoke with an accent, pronouncing some words differently and dropping the endings on others. I had known there were Siberian accents but had never been sure I was hearing one before. As I ate the pelmeni I found a thick black hair in it and added that, mentally, to the rock I’d bitten down on while eating a beet salad a few days earlier in Yakutsk. This latest surprise put me on a food-poisoning watch again. It would’ve been bad to get sick in this hotel, with twenty-some guests and only one bathroom. And throwing up, etc., outside would have been awkward, too, given the nighttime temperatures. Luckily no postmealtime consequences ensued.",

The smell of woodsmoke, the drift of incense; a procession of monks in black-and-gold robes, one of them giggling in a voice yet unbroken; a touch of autumn in the air, a sense of gathering rain. Bells tolling through the dusk, calling the faithful to prayer.",

Now the Indian economy has started opening up and the top two Bollywood stars are shoving Coke and Pepsi down our throats in ubiquitous advertising. At times I feel like I’m living in America in the fifties. On TV, beautiful housewives sing and dance around new washing machines, air-conditioners, refrigerators and ice machines. On the roads, the increasingly rare Ambassadors are struggling to keep up with the new imported zippy sports cars, and tractors trundle behind fleets of Lexus and Mercedes. The old diesel rickshaws have been replaced with new models powered by Compressed Natural Gas and the pollution is slowly beginning to clear. New electronic shops are doing a roaring trade in flat screen TVs, DVD players and boom box stereos.",

The water’s turbulence was surprising and swift after the night world. I stood for a while watching it, and then drank from the stone cistern it had carved out beneath it, and snapped off an icicle to eat as I walked. Nearby, I found a gourd-shaped hole in a rock, in which water had gathered, and frozen. I pried at the edges of the ice, and found I could lift out the top two inches, revealing clear water beneath. The ice was as thick as the glass of a submarine’s window, and I held it to my eyes, and briefly watched the blurred world through it. Then I drank the sweet cold water beneath it, and set off down the mountain, picking my path through the steep uneven ground.",

It rose higher and higher till it was level with the edge of the steep rock, and then the shapes grew to be solid, and a new procession half lost in mist passed very slowly with uneven steps, and in the midst of each shadow there was something shining in the starlight. They came nearer and nearer, and Hanrahan saw that they also were lovers, and that they had heart-shaped mirrors instead of hearts, and they were looking and ever looking on their own faces in one another's mirrors. They passed on, sinking downward as they passed, and other shapes rose in their place, and these did not keep side by side, but followed after one another, holding out wild beckoning arms, and he saw that those who were followed were women, and as to their heads they were beyond all beauty, but as to their bodies they were but shadows without life, and their long hair was moving and trembling about them, as if it lived with some terrible life of its own. And then the mist rose of a sudden and hid them, and then a light gust of wind blew them away towards the north-east, and covered Hanrahan at the same time with a white wing of cloud.",

He pulled the dugout alongside and dropped down into it, a bit too much off center. The little log craft rolled dangerously to one side. He grabbed our rail for stability, narrowly saving himself from capsize. He sat down and paddled toward the dock at a frenzied pace, weaving first to starboard, then to port, but ending up where he wanted to be—alongside the narrow planked walkway of the dock. As he stood up to climb out the cayuco rolled again, and this time he wasn’t so lucky. He fell back into the water with a splash. After some flailing around and a couple of botched attempts to stand up, he found his footing in the three-foot-deep water. He staggered along beside the dock toward shore, dragging the cayuco behind him, muttering and shaking his head.",

Not only that, but the previous, broken cable had been fished up and repaired, and it now was working, too. Kennan and the others understood what this meant. Some weeks later a Russian-American Telegraph Company ship arrived in the Sea of Okhotsk with the official announcement that the project had been abandoned and instructions that the parties in the field sell off all supplies, pay the remaining debts, and disband.",

He was always scolding people for being jad, the Hindi word for “inert.” He brought ancient concepts of discipline to the lives of his often rebellious young Western followers, commanding them to stop wasting their own (and everyone else’s) time and energy with their freewheeling hippie nonsense. He would throw his walking stick at you one minute, hug you the next. He was complicated, often controversial, but truly world-changing. The reason we have access now in the West to many ancient Yogic scriptures is that Swamiji presided over the translation and revitalization of philosophical texts that had long been forgotten even in much of India.",

He is a man of property, also; and though he cannot speak a word of English, he is well educated in Hawaiian, and writes an excellent hand. I brought a letter of introduction to him from Mr. Severance, and we were at once received with every hospitality, our horses cared for, and ourselves luxuriously lodged. we walked up the valley before dark to get a view of a cascade, and found supper ready on our return. This is such luxury after last night. There is a very light, bright sitting-room, with papered walls, and manilla matting on the floor, a round centre table with hooks and a photograph album upon it, two rocking-chairs, an office-desk, another table and chairs, and a Canadian lounge. I can't imagine in what way this furniture was brought here. Our bedroom opens from this, and it actually has a four-post bedstead with mosquito bars, a lounge and two chairs, and the floor is covered with native matting. The washing apparatus is rather an anomaly, for it consists of a basin and crash towel placed in the verandah, in full view of fifteen people. The natives all bathe in the river.",

Actual, undoubted, night came on without Mr. Green, of whose failure I felt certain, and without food, and being blinded by the smoke, I rolled myself in a blanket and fell asleep on the bench, only to wake in a great fright, believing that the volcano house was burning over my head, and that a venerable missionary was taking advantage of the confusion to rob my saddle-bags, which in truth one of the men was moving out of harm's way, having piled up the fire two feet high.",

The newcomer caused a momentary diversion, and when she had departed the old lady, who was evidently as intolerant of interruption as a professional storyteller, insisted on returning to the beginning of her complicated order, and weighing anew, with an anxious appeal to the butcher’s arbitration, the relative advantages of pork and liver. But even her hesitations, and the intrusion on them of two or three other customers, were of no avail, for Mr. Ramy was not among those who entered the shop; and at last Ann Eliza, ashamed of staying longer, reluctantly claimed her steak, and walked home through the thickening snow.",

The monk Photius, for example, was actually the stepson of Justinian’s greatest general, Count Belisarius. According to Procopius, Photius escaped from the Empress Theodora’s secret torture chambers, into which he had been thrown when he threatened to divulge details of various sexual shenanigans amongst Theodora’s ladies in the court at Constantinople. Eluding Theodora’s secret police, Photius managed to flee to Palestine, seeking refuge as a monk in the desert somewhere outside Jerusalem.",

Some of the huts on the main drag are shops, with fruits and vegetables stacked in wheelbarrows, manned by women in wide velvet skirts, long plaits hanging down their backs, babies on their hips. Some are little eating places with wooden tables where men sit and eat fried chicken, gesticulating with beer cans. Television sets blare out action movies that crinkle painfully at the edges. The dusty verge is littered with rubbish. Bones, plastic bags, broken bottles. Chickens get under our tired feet. Street dogs sleep uncaring in the road.",

A neglected cactus hedge allowed us access to this dismal ex-hacienda where sickly crops are surrounded by overgrown pathlets, creeper-strangled orchards and blocked irrigation channels – either dried up or wastefully flooding. Swarms of black midges, no less dementing than the fruit-flies, were mercifully dispersed when a strong warm wind sprang up at sunset. This is one of our most penitential sites. The tent is surrounded by a long bristly weed that stings mildly and many large sharp stones are deeply embedded in the lumpy earth. Nor is the abundance of firewood any compensation; our coffee-tin was burst during this morning’s misadventure, making a hideous mess in one pannier-bag. For a moment I was baffled on finding everything stuck together with black glue … Four of our books must be thrown away: a devastating blow. Also Rachel’s torch was smashed and our maps badly stained. Yet when we look at Juana, happily devouring that horrid weed, we still feel today was our lucky 13th.",

The little jokes, the chatter, the inanities of the afternoon had shrivelled up before her eyes.

Her sense of safety was shaken, as if beneath twigs and dead leaves she had seen the movement of a snake. It seemed to her that a moment’s respite was allowed, a moment’s make-believe, and then again the profound and reasonless law asserted itself, moulding them all to its liking, making and destroying.",

It was not that wages fluctuated but that the other community needs drew off workmen from one project to another. There was no question of contracts. In the season of olive-pressing or carob-gathering the whole village turned out in a body – and at a blow one lost masons, carpenters, plumbers, everyone. Therefore, in order to build reasonably, one had to plan in short bursts, for such times as one could assemble a whole team. Otherwise work dragged – the absence of a foreman or a carpenter might keep a whole team of masons hanging about while a window-frame or door-jamb lacked, and while the carpenter who should have built it was out in the fields attending to a crop of apples, almonds or carobs. All these hold-ups cost money, and the art of building was to limit them.",

We now head due east. At 3:00pm we tack again and resume our southbound course. As I adjust the lines on the traveler, my knee is braced on the bulkhead, and something beneath my knee snaps. I look down, and see that I have broken my newest pair of sunglasses, which I bought at the Surf Station in St Augustine right before I left town, so they hold sentimental value. I add them to the growing list of casualties.\n​At 6:00pm, I enjoy a beautiful sunset. Rays of orange light penetrate the stratum and shine down on the horizon through a blue-grey layer of clouds.
