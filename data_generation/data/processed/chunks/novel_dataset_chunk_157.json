I ate the smoked ham, fresh bread and ewe’s cheese that Miguel and Elena had packed as provisions for me; drew cool water from a spring and drank deeply. Then from the pass I pushed north-east up through steeply forested ground, towards the summits I’d spotted from Miguel’s observatory – the Siete Picos; the Seven Peaks. The path zigzagged, its route marked by little cairns of white granite which were perched anywhere available – on the ground, on flat-topped boulders and even in the crooks of young trees: a path-marking method I hadn’t ever seen before. As I climbed, the pines thinned in number and then failed altogether, having reached the limit of their range.",

Her couches and chairs are often filled with fundamentalists, river people, bootleggers, and Indians. Old Sarah Malcolm sits there —with moosehide in her lap, sewing—absorbing at least ten times what she pretends to understand. Louise Paul, short and solid, saying nothing, is said to be the matriarch of the Indian Village. Archie Juneby—tall, slender, handsome, with a dark ponytail—drank too much last night with his brothers and smashed up Max Beck’s boat. They come to Elva. Elva goes to them. She knits her day through the Village and the City. Mental health and alcoholism are the principal problems. “In the Village, children’s ears run so much the people once thought that was normal and healthy,” she has told me. “People come in off the river with blood infections, red streaks up their arm. They get cystitis from not enough water. They come down from Dawson with v.d. We don’t have laboratory tests. We treat on symptoms. An outboard motor chewed on a guy’s legs awhile. We sewed him up. I tell everyone, ‘I don’t mind helping you out. Just don’t use me.’ We don’t want to be awakened for nothing, for someone who is merely drunk. For gunshot wounds and stabbings I of course get up. Oh, we have enough of that sort of thing. Yeah. You betcha. We’re getting ready to have dinner with company and they come in and bleed all over the sink. Who needs TV in Eagle? We’ve got action enough in the streets.”",

It was crowded with people who, like me, were trying to fill that empty hour between the shops’ closing and the moment when one might with propriety start to drink. I walked among them, happy to be back in civilization—happy, above all, to be able to eavesdrop on conversations that didn’t involve sheep-dip, temperamental machinery, new wells, or land clearance. (Or rumps, sumps, pumps, and stumps, as I had begun to think of it.) It was clear from the conversations that I had landed in Yuppieville. Most were engaged in the interesting middle-class pastime of identifying all the objects in shop windows that looked like objects belonging to people they knew. Wherever I lingered I could hear someone observing, “Oh, look. Sarah’s got a bowl just like that,” or “Your mother used to have a tea service like that one. I wonder whatever became of it. You don’t suppose she gave it to Samantha, do you?” A few couples were playing a slightly edgier version of this game, which involved supplementary comments like: “No, the one you broke was much nicer” and “But how many pairs of pearl earrings do you need, for God’s sake?” and “Well, if she did give it to Samantha, I’m going to be extremely pissed off, frankly, because she promised it to me. You’ll just have to have a word with her.” These were the people, I guessed, who had driven the farthest to get here and most needed a drink. Or possibly were just assholes.",

Even when the windows were open, I heard no sound, as if this were somehow a holy ritual only for a select few to witness.",

A dozen others followed and then they began to walk across the river. The wildebeeste followed, slowly at first, in an orderly manner, and then in a seemingly endless stream like liquid poured from a bottle, gathering pace, galloping down the bank, plunging into the water – the river was deep after the rain – and following the zebra. A couple of topi joined them.\nOn the bank, the crocodile began to move. It snaked itself from side to side, and slithered into the water.\nThe herds were now thrashing through the river. Some had already reached the other side and were galloping up the bank, onto the red dust and away into the long grass. The noise of splashing water and bleating animals was deafening. Some wildebeeste turned and crossed back, as if they were uncertain which way they were meant to be going. I understood that, it frequently happens to me. The migration is not an annual event, but a continuous cycle of more than a million animals moving back and forwards, following the grazing, and while some may be heading west into the Serengeti in Tanzania, at the same time there are others crossing over into the Masai Mara. But this is the time of year when the mass river crossings take place.\nThe crocodile had disappeared.\nThe herds continued to pour down the bank and swim frantically. You could sense their growing panic and see the rolling whites of their eyes.",

Massive, wide open and without a soul in sight, I felt as if we were stepping back in time, in a place virtually untouched by humanity and its destructive powers. I was quickly drawn into the desert’s warm embrace. I could see how the weather and winds had carved out these towering rock formations, like skyscrapers around us?a rock climber’s fantasy come true! As I evaluated the imposing silhouettes of the Jebels in the distance, I knew that each of my teammate’s endurance, balance, skill and mental preparation, would inevitably be put to the test. Despite the countless hours of training we had put in on Southeast Asia’s tallest, free-standing, synthetic, rock-climbing wall in Singapore, I instinctively felt that scaling natural rock facades, such as the ones standing magnificently before us, would surely be a very different challenge altogether.",

The surf was big—this may have been August 24, the day my journal said was double-overhead—and we had abandoned our established policy of surfing only at high tide. The wave was ridable at lower tides, perhaps even at low tide, provided it was big enough, we saw now. I had been out nearly all day, from sketchy midtide when only the brawniest turquoise screamers cleared the reef by a reasonable margin, through peak tide and the peak of the swell, when the biggest sets actually swung wide, breaking out so far and in such deep water that they sometimes lost the reef and shouldered, rumbling straight in for five or ten seconds, big solid walls of foam with no breaking hook, until they felt the reef again and the walls stood up and resumed their wailing progress. A couple of sets had scared me, not because I took any especially bad beatings, or because I was held underwater extra-long, but simply because the waves were now stepladdering into serious size and I had brief, unpleasant visions of finding something from another realm behind the big wave I was already scratching to get over. Maybe we had no idea what this place was capable of, and the price for all this joy and good luck was about to be exacted? It was the first time I had been afraid of the waves on Tavarua. My fears were unnecessary. Nothing too heavy came. Instead, I caught and rode so many waves, through four or five distinct phases of the day, that I felt absolutely saturated with good fortune, and more deeply connected to the rhythms of the wave than ever before.",

There was none. The policeman never varied by a jot. A powerful, somewhat shambling figure of a man, a little under six feet tall, with a thick neck, coarsely seamed and weathered with deep scorings, long arms, big hands, gorilla-like shoulders, and a kind of shambling walk, a little baggy at the knees—a figure of an immense but rather worn power—he passed by in his somewhat slouchy uniform, seamed down the trouser-legs with stripes of gold, turned in at his house and mounted the front porch steps, with no more excitement than he would show on any other day of the week. And yet the male population of the whole town would be buzzing with excited speculation on the outcome of the match, and the hearts of boys would thud with apprehensive expectation at the very thought of it.",

One hand was on the edge of his gown. How well she knew that gesture of Morris’s, she thought – grasping something, so that you saw the white scar where he had cut himself bathing. But she did not recognize the other gesture – the way he flung his arm out. That belonged to his public life, his life in the Courts. And his voice was unfamiliar. But every now and then as he warmed to his speech, there was a tone in his voice that made her smile; it was his private voice. She could not help half turning to her sister-in-law as if to say, How like Morris! But Celia was looking with absolute fixity ahead of her at her husband. Eleanor, too, tried to fix her mind upon the argument. He spoke with extraordinary clearness; he spaced his words beautifully. Suddenly the Judge interrupted:",

The box was full of things he had been waiting for impatiently; a new volume of Herbert Spencer, another collection of the prolific Alphonse Daudet's brilliant tales, and a novel called \"Middlemarch,\" as to which there had lately been interesting things said in the reviews. He had declined three dinner invitations in favour of this feast; but though he turned the pages with the sensuous joy of the book-lover, he did not know what he was reading, and one book after another dropped from his hand. Suddenly, among them, he lit on a small volume of verse which he had ordered because the name had attracted him: \"The House of Life.\" He took it up, and found himself plunged in an atmosphere unlike any he had ever breathed in books; so warm, so rich, and yet so ineffably tender, that it gave a new and haunting beauty to the most elementary of human passions. All through the night he pursued through those enchanted pages the vision of a woman who had the face of Ellen Olenska; but when he woke the next morning, and looked out at the brownstone houses across the street, and thought of his desk in Mr. Letterblair's office, and the family pew in Grace Church, his hour in the park of Skuytercliff became as far outside the pale of probability as the visions of the night.",

The animals I’ve been calling camels all my life, those tall desert animals with the single hump that show up in Lawrence of Arabia? They’re not camels. They’re dromedaries. These double-humped animals outside my window are the real camels, and while there might be fewer of them now than a hundred years ago, they, at least, have no motorized equivalent. It’s coming off of winter, and they’re shedding. Great heavy patches of brown winter coat hang loose, revealing the smooth summer coat underneath, leaving them looking mangy and ill-kempt. They walk slowly and gracefully, lumpy philosophers deep in thought, covering vast distances to their summer grazing grounds, at home in these barren parts as I’ll never be. Like a whisper they appear on the crest of a sand hill, and like a sigh they’re gone.",

Sparks from the returning fire were actually showering into the streets when rain began to fall. A brief but extremely heavy rainstorm drenched Chatsworth. People who watched the fire from distant hills say that the storm moved across the woods like a dark, reaching arm and, coming to the reddest part of the fire, killed it. Segments burned on for three weeks more, but most of the destruction had been ended by the storm over Chatsworth, which saved the town. Twelve buildings were burned, and nineteen thousand five hundred acres of land.",

They hope that their machine runs better than the other machine, scores more points, wins a victory. They hope their own hired men come out ahead, but they really do not care. They don’t know what it is to care. They have become too smart, too wise, too knowing, too assured, to care. They are not youthful and backwoodsy and naïve enough to care. They are too slick to care. It’s hard to feel a passion just from looking at machinery. It’s hard to get excited at the efforts of the hired men.",

    "target_paragraph": "It seemed an unlikely amenity. The hotel stood in the lake, at one end of a plot of ground about eighty feet long by thirty wide. It was a rough two-storeyed structure with ochre concrete walls, green and chocolate woodwork, and a roof of unpainted corrugated iron. It had seven rooms altogether, one of which was the dining-room. It was in reality two buildings. One stood squarely in the angle of the plot, two walls flush with the water; it had two rooms up and two rooms down. A narrow wooden gallery went right around the top floor; around two sides of the lower floor, and hanging directly above the water, there was another gallery. The other building had one room down and two up, the second of which was a many-sided semi-circular wooden projection supported on wooden poles. A wooden staircase led to the corridor that linked the two buildings; and the whole structure was capped by a pitched corrugated-iron roof of complex angular design.",

    "target_paragraph": "For hundreds of miles my bus crossed a wind-torn wilderness, its surface glazed with pulverised stone swept down from the Kun Lun. The stillness of the previous night had gone. Somewhere in the desert’s core a storm was raging, and soon the sand was streaming over the ground in low, scudding waves, and the sky had dimmed to premature dusk. Objects appeared and melted in the half-light–tamarisk trees, an abandoned truck. The sun died to a white stain. Occasionally we stopped at tiny settlements where sheep were grazing on litter, and brushwood fences bent against the moving sands.\nThe bus was empty except for silent farmers in sheepskin hats and a gang of village youths. Their dark, pitted faces were powdered with beards. One tried to play a bamboo flute, but gave up, and they turned to scrutinise my possessions. How much were my boots, my watch? When I said I’d forgotten, they hooted in disbelief. But now the dust was swirling through the cracked windows and settled in a tawny membrane over every surface, while we retched and coughed.\nOutside, the sand was exploding off the high dunes. The world stopped at fifty yards. The tracks of meltwater rivers wove out of nowhere and disappeared back into the storm. Soon earth and air had fused in a single vacancy. The dunes seemed to be rising vertically above us, and we moving through elemental sand. I imagined the whole desert reassembling, covering its scars. Sometimes the storm brought us to a halt altogether, our headlights flickering weakly, and we sat and listened to the wind howling.\nThese black hurricanes, the kara-buran, I knew, could lift up whole sand dunes and had buried caravans without trace. Even in stillness, the Taklamakan was the most dangerous desert on earth. Its name perhaps means ‘abandoned place’, but in local parlance ‘You go in and you never return.’ In its heart, unlike the Sahara, nothing lives. It is almost rainless. Silk Road merchants found their way by no landmarks but the piled bones of animals and men. And they peopled it with demons. The shifting sand particles in sharp temperature changes stirred plaintive music and piteous cries, which lured travellers to their end. Marco Polo spoke of the tramp and clash of great cavalcades at night, which panicked merchants into believing that an army was on the move. Sometimes magnetic sparks glint like camp fires on the night horizon, and movements close at hand are streaked with uncanny light.\nBut the darkness, as we crept toward Niya, was empty of everything but blown sand. Somewhere we passed the turning where the cross-desert highway comes down from the north to serve the oil wells of Tazhong, and at last we stumbled out into a bare hotel. On this half-abandoned route the inns belong to an older China: flyblown hostels with flooded lavatories and enamel spittoons and stone-hard pillows. Cold water dribbled out of a tap, where electric fittings dangled from cracked tiles. The few carpets were punctured by cigarette burns, and familiar smells–noodles, urine, cooking fat–mingled and drowsed into sleep.",

In summer an all-girls’ orchestra plays with demon exuberance at the swollen piazza café—there is this pushing out and out, a jungle florescence, all over the city in warm weather, everything has too much energy for its space; and at night, oblivious of the hell of neon that bursts forth along the Via Nazionale, the sexy and equally energetic fountain, with its naked can-can ladies and marine monsters, is lit up as if it were the most sacred pride of the city.",

And the image in which Ben now always came to him was this: he saw his brother standing in a window, and an old red light of fading day, and all the strange and tragic legend of his destiny was on his brow, and all that any man could ever see or know or understand of his dead brother’s life was there.",

On benches under trees students do their revision, office workers eat lunch, barrow boys (or girls) pause to rest, parents entertain children, friends sit chatting, elderly folk doze – but one never sees a courting couple. The Lao young, though pre-marital relationships have always been tolerated, do their courting discreetly. A few monks and novices wander about, sometimes sweeping up leaves or hanging robes out to dry on koti balconies, and during the forenoon the Pali chanting of novices may be heard from schoolrooms. Occasionally a worshipper enters the sim or a pedestrian takes a short cut; in the city centre certain wats occupy all the space between two main thoroughfares. Some rich wats have bred mythical hybrids, up to twenty feet tall, which mingle with the luxurious vegetation: green two-legged winged elephants, gold and scarlet eagle-headed four-legged monsters perhaps remotely related to dragons, black lions with blue peke tails and equine hooves, tiger-headed monkeys with tails wound around swords, gold and green and crimson guardian nagas (cobra deities) – some coiled, some thirty feet long – their jaws agape, showing off sharp white fangs. Amidst this surreal menagerie, vaguely Khmer deities appear, sporting lotus bud top-knots; these sit in curiously informal positions on high backless stone thrones, painted blue. In comic contrast, Wat Simuang has added two crude ten-foot plaster statues of contemporary Lao peasants; the young man wears Hmong tribal attire, the young woman a smock recalling the uniform of Soviet factory workers.",

Six people climbed off at Los Arroyos, nine climbed on. As we lurched slowly over potholes, I was just tall enough to be able to appreciate the panorama on our left – ranks of bleakly magnificent rock ridges, utterly unlike the mountains nearer the coast. When the wind became a gale a silver veil was drawn over those ridges and moments later rain drenched us and my shivering companions wailed and cursed. But the deluge was brief. Soon the distant plain came into view, its expanse gold-tinged in the evening light. San Cristobal’s industrial outskirts looked, from afar, more important than the centre. Yet the middle-aged man who had moved to stand beside me, to practise his English, lamented the city’s joblessness. Cuba’s new industry wasn’t helping, no tourist ever visited, the hotel was not for foreigners. But I could try my luck – he scribbled the address on my notebook cover – they might admit a stranded abuela.",
