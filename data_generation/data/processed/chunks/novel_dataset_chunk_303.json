With her ear to her keyhole she heard him feel his way down the dark stairs, and toward the kitchen; and she listened for the crash of the cupboard panel, but instead she heard him, after an interval, unlock the door of the house, and his heavy steps came to her through the silence as he walked down the path. She crept to the window and saw his bent figure striding up the road in the moonlight. Then a belated sense of fear came to her with the consciousness of victory, and she slipped into bed, cold to the bone.",

The Wander-Birds doing their four miles an hour, sweating, up the dusty hill, must envy indiscriminately both the ten and the forty horse power man. True, some of them probably do. But it must not be forgotten that there are pedestrians who walk because they genuinely prefer walking to being carried effortlessly along by a machine. In my youth I used to try to pretend that I preferred walking to other means of locomotion. But I soon found that it was not true. For a little time I was one of those hypocrites of country heartiness (and they are quite numerous) who tramp and drink ale in little inns, because it is the right thing to do. In the end, however, I frankly admitted to myself and to other people that I was not one of nature’s walkers, that I did not like hearty exercise and discomfort, and did not mean any longer to pretend that I did. But I still have the greatest respect for those who do, and I consider that they are probably a superior type of humanity to the idle and comfort-loving breed predominant at the present time. One of the great charms of mechanical progress is that it allows us to do everything quickly, easily and comfortably. This is very agreeable; but I doubt whether it is, morally speaking, very healthy. It is not even very healthy for the body. It is in the civilized countries, where human beings eat most and take least exercise, that cancer is most prevalent. The disease spreads with every fresh expansion of Henry Ford’s factories.",

A van driver who stopped to offer me a lift told me that Koishiwara was still ten kilometers away and that the road there took a turn back into the hills. I thanked him and began to walk as quickly as I was able. By seven the moon was out, horned and half hidden in clouds. It was eight o’clock and pitch dark when I came at last, through the smoke of the potters’ fires and the fires burning chaff, into the empty streets of the village. I had covered, as the crow flies, twenty kilometers and, as the Japanese hikes, more than forty-five.",

Walking alone, I try to think of chariots tearing down the hill, though the only thing I’m likely to meet is a cinghiale, a wild boar, roaming around. One stream still has a trickle of water.

But where the moonlight fell on solid objects it gave them a burnish and a silver plating, so that even the leaves in country roads seemed varnished. All along the silent country roads leading to London carts plodded; the iron reins fixed in the iron hands, for vegetables, fruit, flowers travelled slowly. Heaped high with round crates of cabbage, cherries, carnations, they looked like caravans piled with the goods of tribes migrating in search of water, driven by enemies to seek new pasturage. On they plodded, down this road, that road, keeping close to the kerb. Even the horses, had they been blind, could have heard the hum of London in the distance; and the drivers, dozing, yet saw through half-shut eyes the fiery gauze of the eternally burning city. At dawn, at Covent Garden,1 they laid down their burdens; tables and trestles, even the cobbles were frilled as with some celestial laundry with cabbages, cherries and carnations.",

I closed my eyes and wished I could fall asleep, but the road was a bit too bumpy, and the bus was a bit too warm. Suddenly, the driver slammed on the brakes. I looked through the windshield and watched as the pavement disappeared into a cloud of dust. The highway was caught in some miserable purgatory halfway between destruction and construction; a hundred miles of roadworks shuttered for the month of Ramadan. Orange traffic cones and mounds of gravel marked the travel lanes for much of the way. Hulking tractors, graders, and dump trucks idled on the unpaved shoulders – steel giants left to rot in the summer sun. The driver shifted into low gear, and the bus crawled along the naked roadbed.",

I sat for a while in a tiny, totally empty railway station – no staff, no ticket barriers, no sign of a train; only a little notice to remind travelers that this was ‘Everybody’s Station’ – and then crossed the river onto the highway from where I glimpsed, towering beyond the little city, the mountains of Miyazaki. Hitoyoshi was flat and quiet with fewer industrial scars than most cities its size, and perhaps this was because a large hot spring resort occupied the area nearest the station. But the ryokans all looked too expensive, so I searched the back streets and found a smaller place where a nervous woman with metal teeth did all my laundry for me while her two pet monkeys thumped their cage, and one reached out – as an old man had eighty-nine days earlier on a road near Osorezan – to peel a flake of sunburned skin from my nose.",

The mud around the garden tap dried to black, caked earth; and in the garden the sunflowers were indeed like emblematic whirls of colour. Even the tradesmen grew torpid. Maulana Worthwhile, who sold shawls, called to ask if I had any English shoe polish, the only thing, according to him, which was good for his ringworm. The regional court held new elections under the awning and we celebrated with cake and tea. Aziz daily dropped hints about Gulmarg. ‘When you going Gulmarg, sir?’ He wanted us to take him there, and it was only during these slack weeks that he could leave the hotel. But we put off Gulmarg from day to day, becalmed in the summer stillness of the lake.",

He was supervising three young athletes as they took turns sprinting down a runway with a long pole and then crashing with their heads and shoulders into a horizontal bar about five feet off the ground. If knocking the hell out of a horizontal bar was a sport in Kansas, these guys could be state champions.

We circled the block and found the narrow road behind the hotel: a crowded lane of asphalt between towering concrete buildings. There were no sidewalks or curbs, just a wall of cars on each side parked directly against the buildings, and wherever there were no cars, there were mounds of garbage. The narrow strip between the parked cars and mounds of garbage was a busy thoroughfare for pedestrians, scooters, and a few cats. Of all the storefronts we passed, most were closed, shuttered behind rolling steel gates. The only shop open for business was a small bakery, its counters piled high with hundreds of loaves of aish baladi, a round flatbread commonly consumed for the daily iftar. The bakery was quiet then, but, in a few hours, a line would form down the street as hordes of women (and a few men) stopped by for bags of hot bread.",

All she had been and done before this morning, all she had felt and worried about, was gone. Each of her worries behaved as the image of Mellersh had behaved, and dissolved into colour and light. And she noticed things she had not noticed for years—when she was doing her hair in front of the glass she noticed it, and thought, \"Why, what pretty stuff.\" For years she had forgotten she had such a thing as hair, plaiting it in the evening and unplaiting it in the morning with the same hurry and indifference with which she laced and unlaced her shoes. Now she suddenly saw it, and she twisted it round her fingers before the glass, and was glad it was so pretty. Mellersh couldn't have seen it either, for he had never said a word about it. Well, when she got home she would draw his attention to it. \"Mellersh,\" she would say, \"look at my hair. Aren't you pleased you've got a wife with hair like curly honey?\"",

A rickety 114-foot-long runway had been erected to facilitate the launch, but whether that would be enough was anybody’s guess. No plane had ever taken off from a ship at sea, and Chamberlin himself thought his chances of success were only slightly better than even. Shortly before his takeoff someone asked him if he knew how to swim. Chamberlin grinned and admitted that he did not.",

A few young women followed us for a little way, good-naturedly trying to dissuade us from continuing, but they soon realised that the lunatic ferenghi was determined to go as far as she could. Slowly we crackled and sloshed through iced mud below a tremendous wall of serrated rock which threw back the roar of the river – now a rushing, leaping torrent, amidst a cataclysmic disarray of boulders. We had left the mid-valley concentration of hamlets behind and when next we lost the track there was no one to guide us and we had to learn by error that the steep path up which we struggled was only a goatish cul-de-sac. Returning to river level, I scouted among the boulders and eventually found traces of footprints. Hallam followed me with feline agility through a wilderness of uneven rocks, but when we came to the first of two deep, narrow gullies Rachel had to dismount while I led him up and down hellish gradients which caused the load to slip forward on to his neck. It then had to be removed and re-roped before we could go any further. Both gullies contained racing streams with beds of loose stones that were difficult for a ghora, though we humans crossed easily enough on stepping-stones only slightly immersed. Emerging from the second gully we could see the Hushe close by on our right – a foaming waterfall between giant, glittering rocks, its greenness vivid amidst the otherwise unrelieved white-grey-brown of snow and precipice.",

A small, sturdy, fresh-faced woman, she had thick chestnut hair, wide-set dark brown eyes, high cheekbones, good teeth. As she scrubbed and rinsed and wrung, I noticed her powerful arms. She looked not a day older than her twenty-nine years (she married at sixteen) and radiated a sort of contentment rare among urban mothers of one.",

It is never going to win any beauty contests, but it has some likable features—an old-fashioned little cinema called La Scala, a well-preserved market arcade, a large and adorably overembellished nineteenth-century sandstone castle on a hill, some splendid riverside walks. I was particularly taken with the dim-lit market arcade, an undercover thoroughfare apparently locked in a perpetual 1953. It had a barbershop with a revolving pole out front and pictures inside of people who looked like they had modeled their hairstyles on Thunderbirds characters. There was even a joke shop selling useful and interesting items that I hadn’t seen for years: sneezing powder and plastic vomit (very handy for saving seats on trains) and chewing gum that turns the teeth black. It was shut, but I made a mental note to return in the morning to stock up.",

He was coming to that, he was coming to that — and now, checked brutally, he had to answer by yes or no. He answered truthfully by a curt ‘Yes, I did’; and fair of face, big of frame, with young, gloomy eyes, he held his shoulders upright above the box while his soul writhed within him. He was made to answer another question so much to the point and so useless, then waited again. His mouth was tastelessly dry, as though he had been eating dust, then salt and bitter as after a drink of sea-water. He wiped his damp forehead, passed his tongue over parched lips, felt a shiver run down his back. The big assessor had dropped his eyelids, and drummed on without a sound, careless and mournful; the eyes of the other above the sunburnt, clasped fingers seemed to glow with kindliness; the magistrate had swayed forward; his pale face hovered near the flowers, and then dropping sideways over the arm of his chair, he rested his temple in the palm of his hand. The wind of the punkahs eddied down on the heads, on the dark-faced natives wound about in voluminous draperies, on the Europeans sitting together very hot and in drill suits that seemed to fit them as close as their skins, and holding their round pith hats on their knees; while gliding along the walls the court peons, buttoned tight in long white coats, flitted rapidly to and fro, running on bare toes, red-sashed, red turban on head, as noiseless as ghosts, and on the alert like so many retrievers.",
