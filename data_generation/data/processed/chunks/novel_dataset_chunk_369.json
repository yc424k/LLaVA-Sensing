For some time past Mr. Spragg had been rather continuously overworked, and the strain was beginning to tell on him. He had never quite regained, in New York, the financial security of his Apex days. Since he had changed his base of operations his affairs had followed an uncertain course, and Undine suspected that his breach with his old political ally, the Representative Rolliver who had seen him through the muddiest reaches of the Pure Water Move, was not unconnected with his failure to get a footing in Wall Street. But all this was vague and shadowy to her. Even had “business” been less of a mystery, she was too much absorbed in her own affairs to project herself into her father’s case; and she thought she was sacrificing enough to delicacy of feeling in sparing him the “bother” of Mrs. Spragg’s opposition.",

The takeoff spot, I noted, was directly off a big red graffito, PTAH LIVES. Bodkin, who was still sitting with Peewee, shouted my name, grinning widely. It was a grin that struck me as half wicked amusement at my safety-first route to the lineup, half congratulation that I was out there at all. Peewee simply nodded hello. Peewee’s blandness in the water was usually a blessing. His poker-faced virtuosity left psychological space for other surfers, which was something that many of them, I believed, appreciated. Sometimes, though—today, perhaps—I thought Peewee carried surf cool a bit far. Of course, he probably didn’t consider Outside VFW’s at this size a particularly scary place, and maybe didn’t realize that for me it was a stretch.",

Formerly fashionable emporiums were being restored by workmen balancing on wobbly scaffolding or demolishing interior walls with sledge-hammers – and without any of the protective gear mandatory in our wimpish world. Two stores had been reopened, on Cuba’s emergence from the Special Period, as government-run dollarshops selling a narrow though gradually widening range of expensive (for Cubans) but usually shoddy imported goods. Others remained boarded up or displayed only a few items of unappealing national-peso-priced stock in fly-blown windows.",

    "target_paragraph": "On 6 May Lear had his finest hour – actually eight hours, up to and down from the 7,300-foot Mbogo Pass on a track my map described as ‘non-motorable’. When I noticed it, while considering how to avoid returning to the Uyole junction, my pulse quickened. A Tanzanian route designated ‘non-motorable’ (which is how most people would describe most Tanzanian roads) is guaranteed to be just that. From Makumbako we had been on the main road and, though traffic is light on even the ‘mainest’ Tanzanian road, I craved the solitude of a mere track. This one – the old, history-haunted German road from Mbeya to Karonga – joined the main road near the Malawian border. Decades of disuse render even a German road indecipherable and it took some time to find its starting point in the large village of Mlowa, twelve miles from Mbeya along the road to Zambia. Once I went astray on wide, bright pastureland, silvery green in the rising sun and rippling under a cool breeze. This very beautiful mistake led to a shoddy collectivised dairy-farm where a small boy became hysterical with terror on seeing me. His father spoke no English and seemed almost equally scared, though in a more restrained way. Even the cows took fright and tried to break out of their filthy milking-shed.",

Folders had grown dog-eared, their edges limp with reverential handling; and to many were attached pink slips, equally faded, equally limp, marked URGENT, VERY URGENT, or IMMEDIATE. Between these mounds and columns and buttresses of paper, clerks were scattered about unimportantly, men and women, mild-featured, Indian-pallid, high-shouldered; paper was their perfect camouflage. An elderly bespectacled man sat at a desk in one corner, his face slightly puffy and dyspeptic. Tremulous control of the paper-filled room was his: at his disappearance the clerks might be altogether overwhelmed.",

But in the rusty wire fence, hung with ‘STOP!’ signs, I noticed two interesting weak sections. And there were no ‘MINE’ signs. And the site was not overlooked by the nearby settlement or the army post. Below lay Balata; I could gaze directly down at my squat’s roof. From this height there seemed to be no space for even a cat to slink between the camp’s tall, jerry-built houses. A small boy on a donkey was cautiously descending that steep, boulder-strewn slope. Anyone ascending at dawn would be through the fence before anyone else was likely to observe them. And even were one caught in the act, septuagenarians can suffer from Alzheimer’s and wander away from their minders.",

The repetition of Hewet’s name in short, dissevered syllables was to them the crack of a dry branch or the laughter of a bird. The grasses and breezes sounding and murmuring all round them, they never noticed that the swishing of the grasses grew louder and louder, and did not cease with the lapse of the breeze. A hand dropped abrupt as iron on Rachel’s shoulder; it might have been a bolt from Heaven. She fell beneath it, and the grass whipped across her eyes and filled her mouth and ears. Through the waving stems she saw a figure, large and shapeless against the sky. Helen was upon her. Rolled this way and that, now seeing only forests of green, and now the high blue heaven; she was speechless and almost without sense. At last she lay still, all the grasses shaken round her and before her by her panting. Over her loomed two great heads, the heads of a man and woman, of Terence and Helen.",

He was conscious of something rather protecting in their attitude, of his being to them a vague unidentified figure, merely “the old gentleman” who was friendly to them; but he didn’t mind. It was enough to sit and listen to their talk, to try and clear up a few of the countless puzzles which confronted them, to render them such fatherly services as he could, and in the interval to jot down notes of their faces—their inexhaustibly inspiring faces. Sometimes to talk with them was like being on the floor in George’s nursery, among the blocks and the tin soldiers; sometimes like walking with young archangels in a cool empty heaven; but wherever he was he always had the sense of being among his own, the sense he had never had since George’s death.",

Smith, a sedentary man by inclination, had himself succeeded in climbing the mountain in August 1851, abetted by a battalion of guides and an intemperate amount of alcohol (Smith’s liquid provisions for the expedition were: sixty bottles of vin ordinaire, six bottles of Bordeaux, ten bottles of St George, fifteen bottles of St Jean, three bottles of cognac, and two bottles of champagne). He broadcast his success across London on his return, and in March 1853 opened his show-hall account of the ascent to the public, replete with pretty female ushers in dirndls, a cut-out Swiss chalet (never mind that Mont Blanc was in France), dioramas of the mountain which were furled across the back of the stage, a shaggy St Bernard and – a final touch of Alpine verisimilitude – a brace of chamois that skittered about on the parquetry and shat at inconvenient times during the performance. A pit orchestra played the ‘Chamonix Polka’ and the ‘Mont Blanc Quadrille’, while Smith recited in his resonant voice the thrilling story of his climb.",

We did not fill our water-skins there when we set out next day for ?a?r Khubbaz, but rode on to ’Ain Za’zu’, where the water is drinkable, though far from sweet (Fig. 63). There are two other sulphurous springs, one a little to the north and one to the south, round each of which, as at ’Ain Za’zu’, the inhabitants of Kebeisah sow clover, the sole fodder of the oasis in rainless years like the spring of 1909; so said Fawwaz, the owner of the two camels on which we had placed our small packs. Fawwaz rode one of them and his nephew, Sfaga, the other, and they hung the dripping water-skins under the loads. We followed the course of a shallow valley westwards, and before we left it sighted a train of donkeys making to the north with an escort on foot?Arabs of the Deleim. They looked harmless enough, but I afterwards found that they had caused Fawwaz great uneasiness; indeed they kept him watchful all through the night, fearing that they might raid us while we slept. I was too busy observing the wide landscape to dwell on such matters. The desolate world stretched before us, lifting itself by shallow steps into long, bare ridges, on which the Arab rijm were visible for miles away. The first of these steps?it was not more than fifty feet high?was called the Jebel Muzahir, and when we had gained its summit we saw the castle of Khubbaz lying out upon the plain. To the north the ground falls away into a wadi, a shallow depression like all desert valleys, in which are traces of a large masonry tank that caught the trickle of the winter springs and held their water behind a massive dam (Fig. 64). The tank is now half full of soil and the dam leaks, so that as soon as the rains have ceased the water store vanishes. It had left behind it a scanty crop of grass and flowers, which seemed luxuriant to us in that dry season; we turned the mares and camels loose in what Fattu? called enthusiastically the rabi’ah (the herbage of spring), and pitched my light tent in the valley bottom, where my men could find shelter among the rocks against the chills of night. I left all these arrangements to Fattu?, and with ?ussein and Fawwaz to hold the metre tape, measured and photographed the fort till the sun touched the western horizon.",

After lunch and a nose through Varanasi Handicrafts, we wandered downhill towards the public gardens that had a real playground and views over the valleys. It was evident why the British had used Matheran as a summer getaway. It was now mid-February and there were no western tourists, only Indian families and young couples hand in hand.",

The vaulted chancel is the oldest part, and there is an altarpiece put there by the Swedish Field-Marshal Wrangel, who in the seventeenth century lived in a turreted Schloss near by that I had seen from the hills. A closed-in seat high up on the side of the chancel was where he sat; it has latticed windows and curiously-painted panels, with his arms in the middle panel and those of Prince Putbus, to whom the Schloss now belongs, on either side. The parson took me up into the gallery and showed me a picture of John the Baptist's head, just off, with Herodias trying to pull out its tongue. I said I thought it nasty, and he told me it had been moved up there because the lady downstairs over whose head it used to hang was made ill by it every Sunday. Had the parishioners up in the gallery thicker skins, I asked? But there was no question of skins, because the congregation never overflowed into the galleries. There is another picture up there, the Supper at Emmaus, with the Scripture account written underneath in Latin. The parson read this aloud, and his eyes, otherwise so mild, woke into gleams of enthusiasm. It sounded very dignified and compressed to ears accustomed to Luther's lengthy rendering of the same thing. I remarked how beautiful it was, and with a pleased smile he at once read it again, and then translated it into Greek, lingering lovingly over each of the beautiful words. I sat listening in the cool of the dusty little gallery, gazing out at the summer fields and the glistening water of the Bodden through the open door. His gentle voice made a soft droning in the emptiness. A swallow came in and skimmed about anxiously, trying to get out again.",

Get the dogs!” And it seemed to the boy too that it would take them forever to decide what to do—the old men in whom the blood ran cold and slow, in whom during the intervening years between them and himself the blood had become a different and colder substance from that which ran in him and even in Boon and Walter.",

Bundled up in his warmest clothes, he walked out onto the ice alone and stared up at the blazing moon, awestruck and homesick: “It is difficult to describe an Arctic moonlight night,” he wrote in his journal. “But the beauty holds one entranced … and the same moon will in its own time shine on the dear ones at home. What message could it convey to us if it could? What news of friends and the world at large? It is at such times that one realizes what it means to be this cut off.”",

    "target_paragraph": "Newly arrived from Siberia, I saw that St. Petersburg is not a European city but an Asiatic city with European architecture. Its physical structures imitate Europe’s, but its enormous sky is Asia’s. St. Petersburg is a stop, or a station like those wacky modernist railroad stations on the BAM line beyond the middle of nowhere. Arrivals and departures are its point. It’s a caravanserai, like those cities (Tobolsk, Kyakhta) sprung up in the Asiatic emptiness where tea and silk caravans from China traveled, or like the sprawling tent cities the Mongols improvised on the steppes using felt from their animals and white linen they had plundered somewhere. Though far away, Siberia is an unavoidable part of this place. When Ivan Borisovich Pestel (father of the Decembrist) was governor-general of Siberia, he directed the affairs of his immense and distant province while comfortably ensconced in St. Petersburg. The joke about Governor Pestel went that one day when he and Count Rostopchin were dining with the tsar, the tsar looked out the window and asked, “What’s that on the church, the black thing on the cross?” Count Rostopchin replied that he couldn’t make it out, and then added, “You must ask Ivan Borisovich, he has wonderful eyes, for he can see from here what is being done in Siberia.” The story speaks to a psychological truth: with the huge sky and long-distance vistas in this city, it almost seems as if he could have.",
