Though the customs of Elizabeth and James, now going out of fashion in England, had begun to prevail among the gentry, he still wore the great cloak of the native Irish; and the sensitive outlines of his face and the greatness of his indolent body had a commingling of pride and strength which belonged to a simpler age. His eyes wandered from the sunset to where the long white road lost itself over the south-western horizon and to a horseman who toiled slowly up the hill. A few more minutes and the horseman was near enough for his little and shapeless body, his long Irish cloak, and the dilapidated bagpipes hanging from his shoulders, and the rough-haired garron under him, to be seen distinctly in the grey dusk. So soon as he had come within earshot, he began crying: 'Is it sleeping you are, Tumaus Costello, when better men break their hearts on the great white roads? Get up out of that, proud Tumaus, for I have news! Get up out of that, you great omadhaun! Shake yourself out of the earth, you great weed of a man!'",

Combined with extravagant hand gestures that Marcel Marceau might have considered overwrought and some intermediate Spanish verbs on my part, we’d settled into a fairly effective mode of communication. Bernard was the sort of Frenchman whose charms were difficult to resist?funny and handsome, with a fondness for American popular culture. He sang snippets of Harry Belafonte songs as we walked.",

I unlocked the truck, and Romeo climbed in and went into the sleeper. We exchanged a few functional words, but said nothing about the previous night’s events. Several minutes before eight the morning mechanic arrived and set to work on the front trailer’s glad-hand bracket. An hour later the mechanic finished, and I took a copy of the work order with my genuine signature and the correct time and tucked it in my bookbag. Then with a suitably repaired truck I drove all the way back to Fort Worth, making a couple of routine stops, but not seeing hide nor hair of Romeo on the ten hour run.",

In Novosibirsk, however, more serious engine problems arose. After a night in the hotel, Sergei woke up and told me, “Today we go to auto shop.” Then he disappeared with Volodya out the door. Later, as I was sitting on a lawn near the hotel building and sketching, I saw the van go by behind a tow truck. An hour passed, then two, then three. I sat on the bed in my room and wrote letters. In the early afternoon, still with no sign of the guys, I decided to wash some laundry in the sink in the communal bathroom. After rinsing and wringing out the clothes, I draped them on the railing of the porch outside the TV room to dry. But I had forgotten the wind, which in just a few minutes had blown the clothes off the rail, whence they had fallen six stories onto the roof of the building’s entryway.",

As in the Hindu villages, these Kham-pas take no chances with the local demons, and have decked out their stupa as a cairn to Masta. They are hospitable people, eager to be of help, and Tukten obtains some shelled wild walnuts, green buckwheat flour, and potatoes, while I wash in the sun and take my tea, and, led by the children of this village, stroll out happily onto the eastern ridge. In the warm sunset, there is a view of the Dhaulagiris that we never had while skirting those massifs, and when Tukten comes, he points with pride to Churen Himal and Great Dhaulagiri, the mountaineers’ Dhaulagiri One, to which he once accompanied an expedition. A north wind streams across these peaks, carrying off great clouds of powdered snow, as if the spires had gone up in fire. From Kalibon one can almost see the region of Jang La—how long ago, in another life, those days now seem!",

The poplars he planted still line the irrigation ditch between the orchard and the sage. He was the oldest of eleven children, a boy of precise loyalties and a sense of fair play. He chafed under the straitjacket of Mormonism (and smelled corruption there). He dreamed of being a cowboy and, in dime novels, read the ongoing saga of Jessie James.",

I gave him $10 to buy one of the chickens roaming the campsite, so our valedictory dinner was pasta with soy chunks and stringy poultry that brought to mind the storks Bingham had survived on in Venezuela. As we ate, John pulled out photocopies of pages from Antisuyo, a book written by American explorer Gene Savoy after his expeditions to Peru in the 1960s. (Juvenal’s father and brothers had been Savoy’s guides.) Savoy’s work here had helped to start the unraveling of Bingham’s reputation, years after the Yale man had died. John was more interested in a story Savoy had told of an old Machiguenga Indian?a subset of the Campas?a woman spurned by her son the chief, who in return for some food had told the explorer:  that if we went to a high, cold place, to a mountain peak (known to us) and to a certain lake that had been guarded by Machiguengas for centuries, we would find great ruins. But she warned us to be careful of the enchantment. Every person that has gone to these two places has coughed blood and died.",

The Murphy bed lent itself to lots of sight gags in forties movies, but no one doubted its usefulness. Imagine a mad genius enlarging and going haywire with the concept of a Murphy bed and you get some idea of Milanese “environments.” In bright primary colors, the compact plastic units (none bigger than an average-sized walk-in closet) were composed of several parts, each of which became something else as need dictated: With the flick of a button a bed became a table; a stove doubled as a desk; a commode doubled as a reading chair, from which a light sprouted; refrigerators were nestled under bureaus, which also served as bookcases . . . and ooh! and ah! everybody said, how clever! “I hope I die before the world turns into that,” said my young son. “It's all right if you want to live in an airplane cockpit,” said my younger daughter. Some things you couldn't imagine in these sterile environments were: clutter; a baby; a flower pot; a cat. They are still much praised in Milan as prototypes. (But prototypes for what?) While Rome, devoted to spectacle, may in its least successful aspects be regarded as subject matter for Mel Brooks, Milan might be more appropriate subject matter for Woody Allen.",

She said to herself, \"He won't know which of us it is.\"\n* * * * *\nRowcliffe was washing his hands in the surgery when the card was brought to him. He frowned at the card.\n\"But—You've brought this before,\" he said. \"I've seen the lady.\"\n\"No, sir. It's another lady.\"\n\"Another? Are you certain?\"\n\"Yes, sir. Quite certain.\"\n\"Did she come on a bicycle?\"\n\"No, sir, that was the lady you've seen. I think this'll be her sister.\"\nRowcliffe was still frowning as he dried his hands with fastidious care.\n\"She's different, sir. Taller like.\"\n\"Taller?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nRowcliffe turned to the table and picked up a probe and a lancet and dropped them into a sterilising solution.\nThe maid waited. Rowcliffe's absorption was complete.\n\"Shall I ask her to call again, sir?\"\n\"No. I'll see her. Where is she?\"\n\"In the dining-room, sir.\"\n\"Show her into the study.\"\n* * * * *\nNothing could have been more distant and reserved than Rowcliffe's dining-room. But, to a young woman who had made up her mind that she didn't want to know anything about him, Rowcliffe's study said too much. It told her that he was a ferocious and solitary reader; for in the long rows of book shelves the books leaned slantwise across the gaps where his hands had rummaged and ransacked. It told her that his gods were masculine and many—Darwin and Spencer and Haeckel, Pasteur, Curie and Lord Lister, Thomas Hardy, Walt Whitman and Bernard Shaw. Their photogravure portraits hung above the bookcase. He was indifferent to mere visible luxury, or how could he have endured the shabby drugget, the cheap, country wall-paper with its design of dreadful roses on a white watered ground? But the fire in the grate and the deep arm-chair drawn close to it showed that he loved warmth and comfort. That his tastes made him solitary she gathered from the chair's comparatively unused and unworn companion, lurking and sulking in the corner where it had been thrust aside.\nThe one window of this room looked to the west upon a little orchard, gray trunks of apple trees and plum trees against green grass, green branches against gray stone, gray that was softened in the liquid autumn air, green that was subtle, exquisite, charmingly austere.\nHe could see his little orchard as he sat by his fire. She thought she rather liked him for keeping his window so wide open.\nShe was standing by it looking at the orchard as he came in.\n* * * * *\nHe was so quiet in his coming that she did not see or hear him till he stood before her.\nAnd in his eyes, intensely quiet, there was a look of wonder and of incredulity, almost of concern.\nGreetings and introductions over, the unused arm-chair was brought out from its lair in the corner. Rowcliffe, in his own arm-chair, sat in shadow, facing her. What light there was fell full on her.\n\"I'm sorry you should have had to come to me,\" he said, \"your sister was here a minute or two ago.\"\n\"My sister?\"\n\"I think it must have been your sister. She said it was her sister\nI was to go and see.\"",

Most people are asleep, lying on sofas or mats in their shophouses, and the few who are awake look as though they wish they weren’t. When a youth had served me a Beerlao at my favourite eat-drink shop, near the Mekong, he lay within the room and immediately slept. The street was deserted and still. Then a goose and gander wandered past, looking self-important as is their wont and making aggressive noises for no particular reason, causing two cats dozing on a shop step to raise their heads. I watched a half-feathered pullet fly on to the cook’s pavement table and help herself to raw noodles from a basin beside the simmering cauldron of chicken soup to which noodles are added when ordered. Two minutes earlier the same pullet had been sipping daintily from the green-scummed water in the drainage channel, her naked bum pointed skywards – giving the morbid impression that she had already been plucked to go in the cauldron. But of course those noodles would be sterilized by the boiling soup. Oddly, on the hot Mekong plain people seemed less aware of ‘food hygiene’ than in the cool highlands. When I remarked on this later, Marie said it was an often observed fact, explained by the Pathet Lao’s health education campaign in the liberated zone.",

The authorities studied the map, smoked a few pipes over it, and unanimously voted to give it the status of the summer's field work the boys had put in. Perhaps this really definite triumph went to my head a little. Perhaps the summer of walking alone under the Michigan sun had sweated out of me my hard-won humility. Anyway, that autumn, the beginning of my final years, I was in a mood to fight my great, all-out battle with the Geology Club.",

Some winters more people perish in the mountains of Scotland than on the roads surrounding them. When Mallory climbed Everest, it was the last bastion of unconquerable earth, the ‘Third Pole’.

Its slopes are studded with modern corpses: most lie within what has become popularly known as the Death Zone, the altitude bracket within which the human body enters a gradual but unstoppable process of degeneration.",

Ridiculously and tragically, in August 1944, in the middle of the night, 1,100 of them staged a suicidal mass breakout, bursting from their barracks with a banzai cry and charging en masse at the guard tower clutching baseball bats, chair legs, and whatever other weapons they could contrive. The startled guards poured bullets into the mass but were quickly overwhelmed. Within minutes, 378 prisoners had escaped into the countryside. Quite what they expected to do out there is anyone’s guess. It took nine days to round them all up. The farthest any of them had gotten was fifteen miles. The Japanese casualties were 231 killed and 112 wounded. The Australians suffered three killed that night, and a fourth during the hunt afterward.",

Russell is the home town of Bob Dole, who was at this time running for the Republican nomination for President. I stopped and got a room for the night, figuring that if Dole were elected President, I could tell my children that I had once spent the night in his home town and perhaps thereby deepen their respect for me. Also, every time Russell was shown on TV over the next four years I could say, ‘Hey, I was there!’ and make everybody in the room stop talking while I pointed out things I had seen. In the event, Dole dropped out of the race two days later, primarily because nobody could stand him, apart from his family and some other people around Russell, and the town, alas, lost its chance at fame.",

Behind some of the groups rock-cut chambers have been hollowed out in a later age, their doorways breaking through the figures of the reliefs, and the stream eddies round the feet of winged beasts and bearded men, walking in procession, cut upon huge boulders which have been dislodged from the face of the hill.[161] When I had seen these wonders I wandered up the valley to a point where the cliff bends round and holds the river in the curve of its arm. Here lay a deep still pool, the banks of which were starred with daisies and poppies and the rocks with campanulas and orchids. The water, dyed to a ruddy brown by recent rains, was like a disk of polished bronze in a setting of green and white and scarlet enamel.

And Fanny turned and walked along Gerrard Street and wished that she had read books. Nick never read books, never talked of Ireland, or the House of Lords; and as for his finger-nails! She would learn Latin and read Virgil. She had been a great reader. She had read Scott; she had read Dumas. At the Slade no one read. But no one knew Fanny at the Slade, or guessed how empty it seemed to her; the passion for ear-rings, for dances, for Tonks and Steer*—when it was only the French who could paint, Jacob said. For the moderns were futile; painting the least respectable of the arts; and why read anything but Marlowe and Shakespeare, Jacob said, and Fielding if you must read novels?",

The Colonel’s wife was at that time in Madeira; the religious she now avoided. Her visitor’s book had seven hundred names in it; there was not a soul that she could speak to.

It falls on the toe of your boot, it gives your face a red rim—I think it is the firelight and not your face; I think those are books against the wall, and that a curtain, and that perhaps an armchair.
