I wouldn't have had time to look up old friends even if there had been any. One morning, I started for a luncheon appointment a long way out of Tokyo, down the peninsula past Yokohama, by car. There were two Japanese with me, besides the driver. Countryside motoring in Japan is no longer the ordeal it used to be, for splendid new roads were built for the Olympics. Our chauffeur was a steady character, not addicted to sounding his horn in the old, tempestuous way. In short, there was nothing to remind me of prewar days, and I didn't give them a thought until, unexpectedly, something rose up ahead of us—mountain and island in one, close to the shore. Its sides were circled by paths and staircases. Houses and shops balanced on the slopes. Up and down the stairs and along the paths went people, the children carrying pails and spades and other seaside gear. It was decidedly a holiday scene, and I recognized it.",

The previous evening, when warned about an AWB demo, they had contacted the SAP and vainly expressed concern for their own safety. The TV cameras recorded a shocking sight: 630 armed police officers passively watching as a Viper armoured vehicle, with ET riding on the back, smashed through the plate-glass frontage and was followed by a howling armed mob of between two and three hundred, all khaki-clad. These went swarming through the building – accompanied by an AWB band, defiantly drumming – and assaulted negotiators while yelling insults. Television cameras were encouraged to film their activities: good publicity, by the skewed standards of the right wing, if an organization doesn’t have to worry about incriminating evidence. Having beaten up any delegate who couldn’t hide in time, including women, the mob withdrew in triumph, their quasi-swastika flags held high. On the way out they paused to slash thirty tyres in the delegates’ car park, under the eyes of that ‘protective’ ring of 630 police. Then off they marched, behind their kettle-drummers and buglers. Today’s newspapers carry outraged reports of their next move. On a nearby grassy patch the conquering heroes celebrated, having brought braaivlei grills, picnic hampers and six-packs. Police were photographed chatting and laughing with them.",

At Meiji-Jingu Stadium in Tokyo, the stalls sold “Hot Man Dogs” and “Guten Burgers” (no pun, I think, intended); ivy-covered, double-decker Korakuen, home of the mighty Giants, was ringed by an amusement park, complete with batting cages, baseball video games and a sock-hop pop group in pink-Cadillac suits singing “Route 66.” The Giants had two pom-pom girls in every row, and a scoreboard that told the fans when to clap by flashing an image of mechanically clapping hands. Supporters of the Taiyo Whales struck up the Notre Dame fight song, greeted a Hispanic star with a jaunty rendition of “La Cucaracha” and serenaded another favorite—almost too perfectly, I thought—with the Mouseketeer chant. Fans of the Seibu Lions traveled to every home game en masse, in a specially decorated train (a show of unity encouraged by the stadium’s policy of providing no parking places). Whenever an opposing pitcher was yanked from the game, Tiger fanatics cried out “Sayonara, sayonara,” and then launched into a remorselessly poignant version of “Auld Lang Syne.”",

Hoover was vacationing in the redwood forests of Northern California when the news broke and was as puzzled as everyone else by Coolidge’s diction. “The word ‘choose’ has various connotations in its New England usage,” he reflected later. “I determined at once to say nothing until I could have a talk with the President.” According to Hoover’s memoirs of 1952, he waited till both he and Coolidge were back in Washington in September, though other sources say they met sooner. When at last they caught up, Hoover, looking for clarity and perhaps even a kind of blessing, asked if Coolidge thought he should run. To which all Coolidge would say was “Why not?”",

It was in August 1920 and Babe Ruth was present when it happened. Late in the afternoon in poor light, Yankees pitcher Carl Mays, who was known for being aggressive and was disliked by nearly everyone, including his own teammates, threw an inside pitch to Indians shortstop Ray Chapman that Chapman never saw at all. Since balls were seldom replaced during a game they tended to grow dull and scuffed as the day wore on, a fact that pitchers often exploited to their advantage in fading light. Mays moreover had a submarine style delivery, which made his pitches even harder to pick up. In any case, Chapman never saw it. The ball struck him on the side of the head at the temple with a sickening thud and with such force that it bounced straight back to Mays, who fielded it and threw it to first, thinking it had come off Chapman’s bat. Then everyone realized the full horror of what had just happened. Chapman, obviously gravely injured, dropped his bat, and began walking in a dazed manner toward second base, evidently making for the clubhouse in center field. After a few steps, his legs gave way and he collapsed. He was taken to St. Lawrence Hospital and died the next day. He never regained consciousness.",

Everything at a terminal, every trailer, building and light post could look so soulless and lonely. Every imperfection stood out: the rusty panels on an empty, old trailer; the carcass of a dead bird on the pavement with its joyously bright plumage still blowing in the breeze over its rotting flesh; in unswept asphalt corners of buildings, the debris of metal bits, paper scraps and nameless grit swirling in the wind.

This movement contains an element of withdrawal; the people go of their own volition back to their traditional lifestyle and traditional lands, where they are able to enact traditional ceremonies, teach their children traditional skills and knowledge, but at the same time take what they see as important from Western culture, if they so desire. It is a lifestyle which maximizes identity and pride, and minimizes the problems of cultural conflict. The typical outstation ranges from a camp with no Western artefacts at all, not even a gun, to a camp supplemented with services chosen by the occupants. These may include airstrip, water bore, wireless, and caravans containing teaching and medical facilities with perhaps one to several whites teaching in these. This outstation movement seems to be gaining momentum throughout tribal Australia where it is politically possible.",

In Siberia he was traveling far from home, in the cold, bugs chewing on him, misery all around. Americans believe in democracy and they like to fix things. There had to be a happy ending in here somewhere, some grounds for hope, a fair repayment for all the suffering he saw. Then in the middle of Siberia he met the idealistic young exiles; and Katarina Breshkovskaya said to him, “Mr. Kennan, we may die in exile, and our children may die in exile, and our children’s children may die in exile, but something will come of it at last.” Hearing that, of course anyone would say, “Yes!” And if at that moment you knew that Katarina Breshkovskaya had also smuggled bombs across the country, you might mentally push the fact to one side.",

In the trailer were five drums of aviation gas, a drum of diesel fuel, three spare tires, a pump, a tent, shovels, axes, two high-lift jacks, ropes, and tarps. Driving our tired old Land Cruiser and worn-out trailer, their homemade bodies patched and repatched with scrap steel, we inched our way up Africa. None of the rusty blue trunks of supplies gave a clue to the dreams and the hopes that were packed inside.\nDuring one portion of our journey through Zimbabwe, we were a hundred miles directly east of the Kalahari. Low, dark clouds stretched endlessly across the sky to the west, and we thought that perhaps rain was falling on the desert. Maybe the long drought had ended; maybe Happy, Sage, and Stormy would at last get a taste of water. On June 2, 1986, we crossed the Zambezi River, and headed north toward another season.",

Above it was fixed a small cabinet with a mirror in the door, and in it he examined the black spot on his cheek, touching it again with his fingers, then examining his hand. Yes, it might still come off.…… But be damned if he would; be damned to a man who didn’t know his own mind. And Will Falls, too; Will Falls, hale and sane and sound as a dollar; Will Falls who, as he himself had said, was too old to have any reason for injuring anyone. He flung his cigar away and quitted the room and tramped through the lobby toward the door where his chair sat. But before he reached the door he turned about and came up to the cashier’s window, behind which the cashier sat in a green eyeshade.",

Its sides were mangy with the scars of logging, and the lower slopes were pitted with slate and marble quarries. Big, ramshackle sheds and sawhouses poked into every view. All that healed and grew over, but then in the 1960s, with the enthusiastic support of state officials in Boston, plans were drawn up to turn Greylock into a ski resort, with an aerial tram, a network of chairlifts, and a summit complex consisting of a hotel, shops, and restaurants (all in soaring 1960s Jetsons-style architecture) but luckily nothing ever came of it. Today Greylock sits on 11,600 acres of preserved land. It’s a beauty.",

While he was calling me I was engaged in making my escape through a little gate leading out upon a stretch of newly cleared ground. No; I couldn’t face them yet. I walked hastily with lowered head along a trodden path. The ground rose gently, the few big trees had been felled, the undergrowth had been cut down and the grass fired. He had a mind to try a coffee-plantation there. The big hill, rearing its double summit coal-black in the clear yellow glow of the rising moon, seemed to cast its shadow upon the ground prepared for that experiment. He was going to try ever so many experiments; I had admired his energy, his enterprise, and his shrewdness. Nothing on earth seemed less real now than his plans, his energy, and his enthusiasm; and raising my eyes, I saw part of the moon glittering through the bushes at the bottom of the chasm. For a moment it looked as though the smooth disc, falling from its place in the sky upon the earth, had rolled to the bottom of that precipice: its ascending movement was like a leisurely rebound; it disengaged itself from the tangle of twigs; the bare contorted limb of some tree, growing on the slope, made a black crack right across its face. It threw its level rays afar as if from a cavern, and in this mournful eclipse-like light the stumps of felled trees uprose very dark, the heavy shadows fell at my feet on all sides, my own moving shadow, and across my path the shadow of the solitary grave perpetually garlanded with flowers. In the darkened moonlight the interlaced blossoms took on shapes foreign to one’s memory and colours indefinable to the eye, as though they had been special flowers gathered by no man, grown not in this world, and destined for the use of the dead alone. Their powerful scent hung in the warm air, making it thick and heavy like the fumes of incense. The lumps of white coral shone round the dark mound like a chaplet of bleached skulls, and everything around was so quiet that when I stood still all sound and all movement in the world seemed to come to an end.",

Rabbi Dror Moshe Shaul obviously pities me but tells me that there is only a finite number of Jewish people and all are sparks of the souls who were present when God gave the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai. As his child snorts snot all over me, the rabbi tells me that the spirit of Moses returns to earth in a Jewish body time and time again to save the world from sin. I’m shocked at his beliefs. I didn’t think Jews believed in reincarnation, but it seems this group does, if only just for Jews. The rabbi points to the current Moses—a hairy, decrepit, bent old man who peers down from posters all around the room. His name is Lubavitcher Rebbe. I ask where he is.",

The population, though ten times greater than a century ago, must still exist on a reservation no bigger now than it was then.

In other words the land available to the Navajos not only failed to expand in proportion to their growing numbers; it has actually diminished in productive capacity.",
