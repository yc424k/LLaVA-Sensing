The Yakutsk Willkie visited was a frontier city, as the Elwood of his youth was a frontier town. Both were lively settlements far from their country’s center (though the one, obviously, much farther than the other). Observers before and after Willkie noted the many similarities between the Siberian and the Western American frontiers—from the hogs running loose in the villages, to the smallpox epidemics that hit the natives, to the rumors of tribes descended from the ancient Hebrews somewhere out in the wilds, to the environmental problems of overplowing and dust storms that came with development, and so on. Willkie’s trip also took him to Cairo, Baghdad, Moscow, and Peking; he stopped in Yakutsk partly because he was going that general direction anyway, and of all the cities he saw, this raw metropolis in the dark of the forest no doubt did look more like someplace in America.",

The sounds continued; unmistakably he heard a door, and a voice which with a slight effort of concentration he knew he could name; and best of all, knew that now he could rise and go where they were gathered about a crackling fire where light was, and warmth. And he lay, at ease at last, intending to rise the next moment and go to them, putting it off a little longer while his blood beat slowly through his body and his heart was quieted. Buddy breathed steadily beside him, and his own breath was untroubled now as Buddy’s while the human sounds came murmurously into the cold room with grave and homely reassurance.

We aren’t an organised body of men, and the only thing that holds us together is just the name for that kind of decency. Such an affair destroys one’s confidence.

They are drifters on the Camino. And then there’s the whole subject of who is a pilgrim. If you stay at paradores (expensive hotels), are you a pilgrim? Are you one if you bike or ride a horse? In the past, people were sentenced to walk the Camino, to get them out of town. There’s a whole history of people telling war stories about their walks.”",

By the time we got out, there were only a few other passengers in our car. Cairo University station was above ground, on a causeway with an open-air platform, so we stopped to get our bearings. Teresa thought she could see the pyramids in the distance, but it was just a layer of smog. A staircase carried us down to the street where we expected to find the university. Teresa hoped to find a bookstore or café where we could read and relax for a long while, but if there were a bookstore or café, we never found it. Instead, we found a security wall that encircled the campus like a Supermax prison. The gate was guarded by a police officer who he took his job very seriously. He blocked our path and scolded us, in Arabic, for a long list of crimes including, I presume, trespass and bad posture. Three men sat at a table nearby. I don’t know who they were, but, when the police officer raised his voice to us, one of the men rushed to our defense. He tried to calm the officer, but the officer shook him off. Teresa held up our Lonely Planet Egypt to prove our innocence.",

Shyly, I undressed, my feet squishing in the cold wet grass. This was the first time I’d gotten naked in front of mixed company. Even in a locker room or with a girlfriend, I tended to wrap myself in a towel. It felt like everyone was watching me, but when I turned to enter the pool, they were all just floating serenely, no one paying the least attention to my nudity.",

For the most part, their boats are safe and comfortable. They have a lifetime of sailing skills. For half of these adventurers the dream dies within the first year. Remove this upper middle class gentry from the normal routine of two strangers with separate lives meeting briefly to exchange pleasantries in a 3000 square foot house and place them side by side day in, day out with no escape and their compatibility is tested. It is far beyond my ability to understand compatibility. But if you and your spouse can live on a boat for one year without giving up on the relationship, you have something special. Wendy and I have a compatible relationship that defies logic. On most days we are argumentative, bull-headed, loud and highly demonstrative. This is before lunch and just a warm-up for the afternoon. To the consternation of most innocent bystanders our storms arise and blow over like quick squalls with perfect weather to follow. More importantly, before and after the storms, we always remain each others unqualified best friend.",

The industrial revolution had left these regions untouched and the rhythm of life had remained many decades behind the pace of the West – a hundred years, perhaps, when stays in the country were as long and as leisurely as they are in English and Russian novels of the time; and, in this lost province, where the hospitable Hungarians felt cut off from life, visitors from the West were greeted with embraces. I hoped it was so, for the next three months of leisurely sojourns across the marches and the southern parts of Transylvania turned that spring and early summer into a complete exception to the rest of these travels.

Later, Blossom was appalled: the neighbours would think her too mean to heat my washing water. In vain I protested that at home I always wash in cold water – that I prefer it. Obviously Blossom and my minders didn’t believe me and anyway that wasn’t the point. Blossom’s reputation as a hostess had been blemished. (Even in hot regions of black Africa, I then recalled, one’s village hostess insists on providing a basin of steaming washing water.) Moreover, I had been insubordinate, I had left the shack on my own. Meekly I apologized for both offences and promised not to repeat them.",

This and their dried fruits keep them from actually dying of hunger.

If you ride down fast and pedal on the downhill, you can make it to the crest of the next hill and do it again – for many iterations. In Hornby we have lunch (in the rain).

She was excited and eager – she saw at once how abundantly she could feed this ravenous hunger for knowledge, experience, wisdom. And he knew suddenly the joy of obedience: the wild ignorant groping, the blind hunt, the desperate baffled desire was now to be ruddered, guided, controlled. The way through the passage to India, that he had never been able to find, would now be charted for him.

    "target_paragraph": "The Forest Fire Service has indices that show when the woods are least and most vulnerable to fire. There may be fires almost any day of the spring, summer, and fall, but when the indices are high the fires tend to be big. First, there is something called the buildup index, which takes into account the ground moisture and also whether the vegetation is cured, transitional, or green. When wind velocities, barometric readings, and fuel-moisture levels are added in, the result is the burning index. The scale of the burning index goes from zero to two hundred. On April 20, 1963, the day of the worst forest fire in the recorded history of the Pine Barrens, the burning index shot past two hundred into the indeterminable beyond. It was not a particularly hot day, but the vegetation was still in the cured stage, winds were blowing at about fifty miles an hour, and there was a drought. Once a fire got started, there was not much chance that it could be controlled. Actually, twelve non-contiguous major fires started on that day. The big one began after a man who was burning brush about seven miles west of Mt. Misery left his fire because he thought it was out. It was brought under control about thirty miles to the east at midnight on April 23rd, and it was finally pronounced out on May 1st. Smoke from this fire palled the air and deeply reddened the sun as far away as Princeton. The men who fought the fire made stand after stand—first at a state highway and later at county roads, sand roads, and plowed lines—only to have the flames burst over them and force them to regroup farther east. Embers went into the upper winds and advanced as much as two miles at a jump, starting new fires where they landed. Several crown fires were spread out over a six-mile front, and rolling white heat was trailed by streaks of orange flame. The fire was so hot that it caused the surfaces of macadam roads to form bubbles. Overhead, white piles of smoke went up hundreds of feet, and against this white background, now and again, appeared black twisters of smoke from pitch. Multiple airdrops were made but did not significantly help. Finally, the crews were forced back all the way to the Garden State Parkway, where, forming long lines and working with shovels and back tanks, they made a last try to control the fire. They held it there, but it had only a few miles to go anyway before it would have reached the sea. One man died. As in the Chatsworth Fire, the damage to buildings was relatively light, but only because there were so few buildings to damage. The fire crossed the Pine Barrens from one side to the other, and burned seventy-five thousand nine hundred and twenty-five acres.",

The early British travelers were made of hardy stuff, traversing great distances on foot and occasionally even sleeping under the stars. Many were cautioned to move about only with armed escorts to protect them from the legendary brigands for which Calabria was infamous, but the great majority of these intrepid globe-trotters refused such assistance, managing to explore even the most notorious areas without any criminal encounters whatsoever. Under normal circumstances, contemporary travelers won’t run into any outlaws, either; however, evidence of their activity will be all around them, such as in the illegal construction, unfinished expressways and a very high unemployment rate. Notwithstanding, the tourist will also encounter guest accommodations, for instance, as conventional as in any other Italian location for comparably rated properties.",

It had been blown flat by a cyclone a few years before. Rebuilding was proceeding slowly. The town was allegedly on the coast, but all we could find was mud and scrub and poisonous-looking shallows. It was hot, flat, plug-ugly. There was an airport, though, with cheap weekly flights to Denpasar. We sold the car for two hundred dollars to a bunch of Yugoslavian bauxite miners. By some miracle, it started when they came to inspect it. We changed campgrounds, not certain that the miners fully grasped the meaning of “as is.”",

After a century’s increase, seabird numbers had begun to dip, and in some places, populations were close to collapse. Sustained over-fishing was affecting the numbers of sand-eels, the silver fish that are the staple of many seabirds. The warming of the seas brought about by climate change was also driving the sand-eels further and further north. The sand-eel scarcity was beginning to have a serious impact on the colonies. Chicks were dying or being left by the thousand, as the adult birds - guillemots and razorbills in particular - were obliged to push further north in search of dwindling food stocks. On cliffs along the coasts, nests were being abandoned, and homes left empty.",

He could also have picked out the chapel and the private theatre and the tiled roof under which Haydn had lived and composed for thirty years. A few miles further on, this giant would have pin-pointed the dairy-farm where Liszt was born – his father was a steward in the same music-loving family. A group of local noblemen subscribed for the young composer to study in Paris. Later on, they presented him with a sword of honour to cut a dash with in the courts of the West. It was just a thousand years since their pagan ancestors, who could only count up to seven, had drawn rein here. I liked to think of those country dynasts, with their theatres and their sword of honour and their passion for music. The memory of the two great composers hallowed the region and seemed to scatter the southern skyline with notes.",
