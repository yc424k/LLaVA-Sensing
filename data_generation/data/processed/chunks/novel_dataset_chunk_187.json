Vanlife means new experiences every day, and I love that. We have no idea what the future holds, but this trip has taught me that a simpler life can be far richer than our traditional lives before this. So whether it’s in a van, or on bicycles, or putting down roots in a new community in the US, we’ll be trying to embrace that simplicity wherever we are.",

He couldn't afford to neglect any means of\nstrengthening his position in his wife's family. When it came to\nacknowledging Jimmy his wife's family was divided. Portions of it,\nstrange cousins whom I never met till after my marriage, refused to\nacknowledge him at all. At Lancaster Gate he was received coldly in\naccordance with the discreet policy by which the Thesigers had avoided\nthe appearances of scandal. Down at Canterbury there were degrees and\nshades of recognition. Norah openly loved him. The Canon had what he\ncalled \"a morbid liking for the fellow.\" Mildred and Victoria tolerated\nhim. Millicent endured him as an infliction. Mrs. Thesiger concealed\nunder the most beautiful manners and the most Christian charity an\ninveterate repugnance.",

She had very thick black hair, straight and oily, and very black eyes, giving a heavy sensuousness to her face. Her thick forearms were fleeced with light down. She was not fat, but she corsetted tightly, her powerful arms and heavy shoulders bulging through the cool white of her shirtwaists. In warm weather she perspired abundantly: her waists were-stained below the arm-pits with big spreading blots of sweat; in the winter, as she warmed herself by the fire, she had about her the exciting odour of chalk, and the strong good smell of a healthy animal. Eugene, passing down the wind-swept back porch one day in winter, looked in on her room just as her tiny niece opened the door to come out. She sat before a dancing coal-fire, after her bath, drawing on her stockings. Fascinated, he stared at her broad red shoulders, her big body steaming cleanly like a beast.",

In the early afternoon, I discovered that I had lost my backpack raincover (which, may I just say here, was a completely useless, ill-designed piece of crap anyway, for which I had paid $25) and that nearly everything in my pack now ranged from disagreeably damp to completely sodden. I had, fortunately, taken to wrapping my sleeping bag in a double thickness of trash bags (cost: 35 cents), so it at least was dry. Twenty minutes later, as I sheltered under a bough waiting for Katz, he arrived and immediately said, “Hey, where’s your stick?” I had lost my beloved walking stick—I suddenly remembered propping it against a tree when I had stopped to tie a lace—and was filled with despair. That stick had seen me through six and a half weeks of mountains, had become all but part of me. It was a link with my children, whom I missed more than I can tell you. I felt like weeping. I told Katz where I thought I’d left it, at a place called Elkwallow Gap, about four miles back.",

We came first upon a solitary \"blowing cone,\" beyond which there was a group of three or four, but it is not from these that the smoke proceeds, but from the_ extensive area beyond them, covered with smoke and steam cracks, and smoking banks, which are probably formed of sulphur deposits. I visited only the solitary cone, for the footing was so precarious, the sight so fearful, and the ebullitions of gases so dangerous, that I did not dare to go near the others, and do not wish ever to look upon their like again.",

John Clare was fond of footpaths because they were ‘rich & joyful to the mind’: ways of walking that were also ways of thinking. To William Wordsworth, long-used paths were routes to adventure, leading into ‘the recesses of the country’. William Hazlitt walked radically, making marches from chapel to chapel to hear Unitarian ministers preach, and acclaiming footpaths as ‘lines of communication…by which the flame of civil and religious liberty is kept alive’.",

In one, I find a dormant geranium, which I take downstairs and water. Immediately, Disney-style, it leafs and breaks into wild bloom. In house after house (my best friend’s in high school, my childhood home, my father’s childhood home), I open a door and there is more than I knew. All the lights are on in the New York house. I am walking by, seeing the life in every window. I never dream of the boxy apartment I lived in at Princeton. Nor do I dream of my flat I am so fond of in San Francisco—but perhaps that is because I can hear from my bed before I fall asleep foghorns out on the bay. Those deep voices displace dreams, calling from spirit to spirit, to some underlying voice we all have but don’t know how to use.",

Her touch shot through him like a train of fire: as he put his arm around her shoulders and drew her over to him, his fingers touched the live firm cup of her breast. He jerked his hand away, as if he had been stung, muttering an apology. Whenever she touched him, his flesh got numb and weak. She was a virgin, crisp like celery – his heart shrank away from the pollution of his touch upon her. It seemed to him that he was much the older, although he was sixteen, and she twenty-one. He felt the age of his loneliness and his dark perception. He felt the grey wisdom of sin – a waste desert, but seen and known. When he held her hand, he felt as if he had already seduced her. She lifted her lovely face to him, pert and ugly as a boy’s; it was inhabited by a true and steadfast decency, and his eyes were wet. All the young beauty in the world dwelt for him in that face that had kept wonder, that had kept innocency, that had lived in such immortal blindness to the terror and foulness of the world. He came to her, like a creature who had travelled its life through dark space, for a moment of peace and conviction on some lonely planet, where now he stood, in the vast enchanted plain of moonlight, with moonlight falling on the moonflower of her face. For if a man should dream of heaven and, waking, find within his hand a flower as token that he had really been there – what then, what then?",

Black night had come when they had reached the mountains. The stars were out, and around them the great bulk of the hills was barren, bleak, and wintry-looking, and there was the distant roaring of demented winds upon the hills, the lonely preludes of grim winter among the barren trees. Already, it seemed, the same landscape which only a day or two before had flamed with all the blazing colours of October, and with the enchantment which his hope and joy had given it, had been sorrowfully transformed by the mournful desolation of coming winter. The earth was no longer beautiful and friendly: it had become a waste, a desert, and a prison bleak and bare.",

Its David and Goliath aspect gives the Anglo-Boer conflict an unusual human interest.

The water was jumping with fish, making me wish again that I’d brought a rod. The lakes were nestled in a small valley, surrounded by gigantic peaks. Most prominent was Painted Lady—a rival to the great pyramid, its slopes glowing rosy pink in the warm sun. Also amazing was Fin Dome, a tall triangle jutting up above the lakes like a giant shark’s fin. We were high up again, well over ten thousand feet, and the air was crisp and pleasant with a flavor like seagrass.",

    "target_paragraph": "Reinmund was a handsome young opportunist, with a fairly good education. Originally a man of some character, he was being daily forced by his anomalous position into devious ways of acting and thinking. He was a bad man now, as men go. At thirty he had none of the virtues which either gentile Americans or Jews are taught to think admirable. But he got his pictures out in time, and by manifesting an almost homosexual fixation on Stahr, seemed to have dulled Stahr’s usual acuteness. Stahr liked him – considered him a good all-round man.",

It inhabits its meaning as it sits on your tongue when you speak it, onomatopoeia made flesh. “Dirt” never came out of Caesar’s mouth; it can’t be declined in a lyrical list. There is nothing fancy or trilling about the sound of dirt. It’s not dressed up like “excrement” or “detritus,” unlike “organic matter” or even “humus.” From Old Norse, it made its way into Middle English as drit—the filth that collected on the soles of Chaucer’s travelers’ shoes. Dirt stands alone, underneath everything, hidden in the creases of our skin, blowing in the air. It’s solid and unglamorous. Old.",

Seen close up, That Chomsi is in itself disappointing: too obviously recently restored. But the resonances on that spot are unforgettable. Luang Prabang’s rivers and wats and sacred sites, and its patina of myths innumerable, are intimately interconnected in mysterious ways that elude Western comprehension. Yet occasionally, in special places at special times, even a Westerner can fleetingly contact the essence of what has formed the Laotian way of being. Phousi Hill, at sunrise, is one such place.",

The two drivers shouted back and forth through their open windows, but they were driving too fast to understand each other. I heard Mr. Fish yell something about Steigenberger, but the other driver just shrugged and shouted some more. A moment later, Mr. Fish and the other driver slowed to a stop – in the middle of the highway. Traffic flew by at full speed while Mr. Fish and the taxi driver chatted. Cars honked. Buses honked. Trucks honked. Teresa cried. I yelled. Nothing worked. So we watched and listened as the other taxi driver waved his hands and pointed in the air like a mad magician. I don’t know what he said, but it seemed to make sense to Mr. Fish. The other taxi driver honked his horn and sped away. “We just missed the turn. I have to go around,” Mr. Fish said.",

Sad but scary, for example, is the spectacle of an Anglicized young Chinese financier in his cups, talking in London upper-class slang, speaking of old times in England, of racehorses at Newmarket, balls at Oxford, but now and then, if crossed in argument, allowing his face to reset in the stylized convention of malice that we recognize from Chinese villains in old movies – or from photographs of the Cultural Revolution. And disconcerting can be the contrast, still often experienced, between westernized appearance and oriental reality.",

Built around the blue lake from which it takes its name, it is a college town of 8,000 people. Maybe it was the time of year, the mild spring air, the fresh breeze, I don’t know, but it seemed just perfect. The little downtown was solid and unpretentious, full of old brick buildings and family-owned stores. Beyond it a whole series of broad, leafy streets, all of them lined with fine Victorian homes, ran down to the lakefront where a park stood along the water’s edge. I stopped and parked and walked around. There were lots of churches. The whole town was spotless. Across the street, a boy on a bike slung newspapers on to front porches and I would almost swear that in the distance I saw two guys in 1940s suits cross the street without breaking stride. And somewhere at an open window, Deanna Durbin sang.",

Nurpu is now a Protector of the Dharma, and his image on flags such as this one is often placed on bridges and the cairns in the high passes, as an aid to travelers.

Then out of the blackness the gusts come harder and faster than before. If only I knew what was up there to windward in the blackness! The Snark is making heavy weather of it, and her lee-rail is buried oftener than not. More shrieks and snorts of wind. Now, if ever, is the time to call the men. I WILL call them, I resolve. Then there is a burst of rain, a slackening of the wind, and I do not call. But it is rather lonely, there at the wheel, steering a little world through howling blackness. It is quite a responsibility to be all alone on the surface of a little world in time of stress, doing the thinking for its sleeping inhabitants. I recoil from the responsibility as more gusts begin to strike and as a sea licks along the weather rail and splashes over into the cockpit. The salt water seems strangely warm to my body and is shot through with ghostly nodules of phosphorescent light. I shall surely call all hands to shorten sail. Why should they sleep? I am a fool to have any compunctions in the matter. My intellect is arrayed against my heart. It was my heart that said, \"Let them sleep.\" Yes, but it was my intellect that backed up my heart in that judgment. Let my intellect then reverse the judgment; and, while I am speculating as to what particular entity issued that command to my intellect, the gusts die away. Solicitude for mere bodily comfort has no place in practical seamanship, I conclude sagely; but study the feel of the next series of gusts and do not call the men. After all, it IS my intellect, behind everything, procrastinating, measuring its knowledge of what the Snark can endure against the blows being struck at her, and waiting the call of all hands against the striking of still severer blows.",

    "target_paragraph": "At Tayshet, once a transit-camp for Gulag prisoners, the Trans-Siberian Railway branches south-east, and the long, lonely and disastrously expensive Baikal–Amur Railway drives on two thousand miles to the Pacific. Conceived grandiosely as an artery for opening up eastern Siberia, and running far north of the exposed route along the Chinese border, the BAM’s single track traversed a region increasingly impoverished, and it never lived up to hopes.\nBut after Potalovo, I travelled it forgivingly. Its bunks overflowed with passengers’ cheap merchandise, and its grimy windows were bolted shut. But I was on the move again. Whenever we crested a rise, the forested hills unravelled beneath us, until the red-gold flare of birch against pine seemed the natural state of half the earth. Once or twice some mammoth industry intruded, and at noon the Bratsk High Dam–once a showpiece of Socialist achievement–rumbled grandly beneath us: on one side a sprawl of lake and factories, on the other the gorge of the Angara river. But always the taiga closed in enormously again, its birch leaves drifting in silence through the massed dark of the conifers.\nThe only disturbance on the train was caused by me. I felt something move in my hair, and as I ruffled it, three or four squat black spiders dropped out. I had read that the Ixodes tick, which carries encephalitis, fades from the taiga in June, but I was wrong. ‘Dangerous! Dangerous!’ cried the woman opposite me. She drilled the fingernails of one hand into her forearm. ‘They dig themselves in. They murder you!’ I gaped at them appalled. These ticks, I knew, could kill or cripple you for life, paralysing your neck and limbs. You are racked by atrocious headaches. But the woman was laughing–everybody in our compartment was laughing–as we trampled on them casually while they dispersed over the floor.\nI thought back. I had just flown south from the grim nickel town of Norilsk, and near Krasnoyarsk, early that morning, I had walked innocently into broad-leaved forest. There, I knew, the ticks drop from the trees on to anything warm-blooded (even an Englishman) and might burrow fatally beneath the skin. Up to midsummer Russians only walk the taiga dressed in double layers of clothing.\nFor the moment, eased by the laughter around me, I gave up thinking about it. But that night I wondered how many more ticks were nestling in the creases of my clothing or body. Lying on my bunk, I began to feel them all over me, needling and burrowing. I imagined them wherever I itched. It was cold, but I started to sweat. The ticks dropped into my dreams. At every station the engine sighed to an unnerving silence, and I woke up. Then night passengers would come barging in under gargantuan packages, gasping and dragging things.\nAt last I locked myself in the lavatory and dampened my hair from a water-bottle. Then I scrutinised my scalp in a shaving-mirror, hunting for the tail of a buried tick. It would look like a protruding sunflower seed. After half an hour I transferred the inspection to my neck and shoulders. If I glimpsed a quivering tail, I had read, paraffin or salt was the answer. But by now people were battering on the lavatory door; I found nothing; and two hours later dawn was breaking over a new land.\nA wash of cloud and stunted pines, their roots twisted about the scree, distilled the view to a Japanese painting, where a faint moon was printed on the sky. Grey rock had broken loose from the forest, and lifted to snow-lit peaks. Soon we were easing downhill. All across the horizon, a curtain of fanged mountains–brilliant and irregular–was glittering above the deepest lake on earth.",

Hall loved being a guide, and it pained him that some celebrated climbers—including but not limited to Sir Edmund Hillary—didn’t appreciate how difficult guiding was, or give the profession the respect he felt it deserved.",

The Noh stage of the living room has seen numerous performances, including one where Eiji and Omo’s youngest daughter dressed up in old puppet costumes and performed a samurai story for the villagers. Another time, Shokichi’s wife, Setsuko, who is now one of Japan’s leading buto dance artists, performed an ecstatic dance which began on the black floorboards inside the house and ended outside in the snow. A photographer lived in Chiiori for six months and later produced a book of photographs capturing Tsurui life. A pair of British anthropologists spent a summer there. In this way, Iya has continued to be a refuge.",

I followed the road out of town around the edge of the precipice, past the tail of the gorge. To one side stood an orchard, its trees heavy with hard, cold apples. There I left the road and clambered down a steep track. It corkscrewed sharply downwards along the face of the cliff, curling around the jagged contours of the precipice in a series of dizzy hairpin bends. Halfway down I found three woodcutters smoking cigarettes on a treetrunk by the side of the road; pointing down the valley towards the sea they gave me directions to the old patriarchate. It lay four miles down the gorge, they said. All I had to do was to follow the river along the bottom of the valley; sooner or later it would lead me to my destination.",

Then he went around to face the nose and it was all right; he could see the slant of the cowl and the Aldis slanting a little since he was taller than most, a little high still. But then he could raise himself on his toes and he intended to put his arms over his face anyway in case there was something left of whatever it was they had loaded the cartridges with last night by the time it had travelled twenty feet, though he never had actually seen any of them strike, bounce off the two-seater, and he had been right on top of it for the five or six seconds Bridesman had talked about. And the airscrew was already in open position so the constantinesco would be working or not working or whatever it was doing when it let bullets pass. So all he had to do was line up the tube of the Aldis on Bridesman’s head behind the wind screen, except that Bridesman was leaning out around the screen, talking again: ‘You promised.’",

The Ottomans added and subtracted bits and pieces – nothing of much consequence, certainly nothing to rival the marquetry minbar (pulpit) created for the Ascalan mosque in 1091 and exactly a century later moved to Hebron on Saladin’s instructions. During all my visits I found myself repeatedly drawn back to the minbar. Over the past 900-plus years it must occasionally have been restored yet it allows one to feel close to the master craftsmen who created it.",

Both were quite long letters, signed with a flourish, and on John Murray’s headed paper they looked impressive. The chief gazed at them silently, passed them to his son – and for the first time seemed unsure of himself. During the next lengthy discussion I tried not to hope – this was such a very long shot! Then the chief turned to me, pointed to my rucksack, pointed towards Luang Prabang, indicated that I could proceed. With difficulty, I refrained from hugging him. But what about my armed guard? No, they need not accompany me; I had a strong hunch that the chief trusted them no more than I did. Joyously I loaded up, said my goodbyes and thank-yous and went on my way blessing John Murray.",
