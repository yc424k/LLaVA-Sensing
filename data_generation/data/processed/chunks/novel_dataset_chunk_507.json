It is the air of almost everything in Rome. The left-hand stairs have a hundred and twenty-four steps and are not quite in line with the façade at the top, the bare brown one, stuck on like a middle-western store front, of the church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli. This is the highest point, the arx, where Juno sat, facing the other way however, and the stairs have a good holy look of an impossible proposition, though in fact there is an easy way into the church in back. The others, more lenient and not spiritual at all, bring you to the Campidoglio.",

The congregation consisted almost entirely of old women. Then we met Volodya back at the van and retraced our route to the previous night’s camping place at Berezovyi Yar. When we arrived there, Sergei and Volodya could hardly wait to finish putting up the tents and eating supper before taking off for the village. This time I didn’t pay their absence any mind. For one thing, the wind had died down and the mosquitoes of Berezovyi Yar exceeded all the Siberian swarms we had seen before. Mainly I kept moving, trying to create a slipstream effect that made it harder for the fiends to land. In the evening I did a sketch of the Tobol River, hopping and bobbing and feinting all the while. Then I noticed that the river’s surface was alive with little circles made by rising fish. Setting up my fly rod, I cast a tiny minnow imitation to a few of the rises and immediately caught several pike, none of them longer than five inches. As I was fishing, a Tatar family drove their car down to the shore and two of the men took out a seine net of monofilament woven into a very fine mesh. Casting the net, they began to haul in load after load of baby pike and then empty the pike into big plastic paint buckets. In Russia, people will catch and eat fish no larger than a little finger.",

But on the landing he was overtaken by a sober-faced maid who, in tones discreetly lowered, begged him to be so kind as to step, for a moment, into the Marquise's sitting-room. Somewhat disconcerted by the summons, he followed its bearer to the door at which, a couple of hours earlier, he had taken leave of Mrs. Leath. It opened to admit him to a large lamp-lit room which he immediately perceived to be empty; and the fact gave him time to note, even through his disturbance of mind, the interesting degree to which Madame de Chantelle's apartment \"dated\" and completed her. Its looped and corded curtains, its purple satin upholstery, the Sevres jardinieres, the rosewood fire-screen, the little velvet tables edged with lace and crowded with silver knick-knacks and simpering miniatures, reconstituted an almost perfect setting for the blonde beauty of the 'sixties. Darrow wondered that Fraser Leath's filial respect should have prevailed over his aesthetic scruples to the extent of permitting such an anachronism among the eighteenth century graces of Givré; but a moment's reflection made it clear that, to its late owner, the attitude would have seemed exactly in the traditions of the place.",

Her summers, as she looked back on them, seemed to typify all that was dreariest and most exasperating in her life. The earliest had been spent in the yellow “frame” cottage where she had hung on the fence, kicking her toes against the broken palings and exchanging moist chewing-gum and half-eaten apples with Indiana Frusk. Later on, she had returned from her boarding-school to the comparative gentility of summer vacations at the Mealey House, whither her parents, forsaking their squalid suburb, had moved in the first flush of their rising fortunes. The tessellated floors, the plush parlours and organ-like radiators of the Mealey House had, aside from their intrinsic elegance, the immense advantage of lifting the Spraggs high above the Frusks, and making it possible for Undine, when she met Indiana in the street or at school, to chill her advances by a careless allusion to the splendours of hotel life. But even in such a setting, and in spite of the social superiority it implied, the long months of the middle western summer, fly-blown, torrid, exhaling stale odours, soon became as insufferable as they had been in the little yellow house.",

Mother and son. Who are you? Why do you walk down the street? Where to-night will you sleep, and then, to-morrow? Oh, how it whirls and surges—floats me afresh! I start after them. People drive this way and that. The white light splutters and pours. Plate-glass windows. Carnations; chrysanthemums. Ivy in dark gardens. Milk carts at the door. Wherever I go, mysterious figures, I see you, turning the corner, mothers and sons; you, you, you. I hasten, I follow. This, I fancy, must be the sea. Grey is the landscape; dim as ashes; the water murmurs and moves. If I fall on my knees, if I go through the ritual, the ancient antics, it's you, unknown figures, you I adore; if I open my arms, it's you I embrace, you I draw to me—adorable world!",

The natives look like Caribbean blacks and are dressed in the odd scraps which are apparently the lot of poor black people who live anywhere near whites. But the scrappily dressed blacks have an agreeable air of going nowhere in particular at their own time and enjoying it; they seem eccentric and free. They are also very pleasant, unlike African Americans who have plenty of reason to be surly and usually are. These Africans are after all at home, and bosses in their own house, and though it looks a very cheesy house to me, hereabouts, still no one with a white skin can push them around just because of having a white skin.",

One of the things we bought was a big stalk of bananas, still all green. The vendor lady assured us that if we hung them somewhere in the rigging they would last for at least two weeks because they would ripen from the bottom first, starting in a few days, and the last to ripen would be the ones on the very top. There must have been a hundred small bananas in the stalk. That shopping trip was the last order of business before we set sail.

    "target_paragraph": "Now that Gramsci is published and studied around the world, the look in history of the tyrant and bully who killed him, as he did so many others who couldn’t toe or sideslip the cynical line of the time, is of course no more ironic than that of Gramsci’s own cause. At his death he was still in some vague sense a leader of the Communist Party, a party that could scarcely be said to exist under the circumstances; he was appointed to the top leadership by the Comintern in Moscow, which he was visiting as a delegate, in 1923, after the arrest of all the Executive Committee in Italy, less than a year after Mussolini’s March on Rome. A warrant was out for his arrest too, but the next year he was elected a communist deputy, one of nineteen, and took the risk of returning to Italy with “parliamentary immunity”—a safeguard blown up within a few weeks by the murder of the socialist deputy Matteotti. In the ensuing government and national crisis, Gramsci seriously misjudged the strength of fascism and its chances of riding out the storm; on the question of tactics for what was left of their own party, he seems to have been right in his disagreement with his old co-worker and future successor Palmiro Togliatti, who would twist and turn with the rest of the world’s pro-Soviet leaders later on but just then was holding out against all political alliances, maintaining that fascism must be succeeded at once by the Proletarian Workers’ State—a comic-opera script for that place and time, if the tragedies were overlooked. Gramsci had disagreed with Lenin earlier in a similar conflict, and although he went along with the upshot, he called the “schism of Livorno,” whereby the Italian Communist Party was formed in a break from the socialists in 1921, “the greatest triumph of reaction.” His own hopes had centered around that time in the factory occupations by workers in Turin, where he had spent his university years and all his early political life, but that movement had been easily squashed. Later he would comment on the lack of “jacobinism” in the Risorgimento, something Mazzini would have been proud to agree with; dealing with the complications of that legacy would be a job done among the further, and for that time nearly overpowering, complications arising from the mystique of the Russian Revolution.",

We stopped for a bowl of chicha in the little pueblo of San Marcos, also at present celebrating its fiesta with bunting and masked bands everywhere and dozens of drunks lying around at 11 a.m. Sitting imbibing on a dozenstep, we attracted a group of friendly schoolgirls who had the usual heated argument about whether I’m a man or a woman. (The sartorial evidence and my deep voice both support the former theory.) Leaving the town, we saw one particularly gruesome fight. A pisco-maddened young man – we could smell the fumes – had badly beaten up his elderly opponent whose lower lip was split open to the chin-bone and pouring blood. As we passed, the older man’s legs buckled and he sank into the ditch. Whereupon the young victor laughed and swaggered away, wiping his bloody fists on his trousers. A moment later a terrified campesino woman – wife of the vanquished – emerged from behind a dry stone wall and tried to stop the flow of blood. When we approached, intending to offer some disinfectant, she made it plain that she wished for no gringo interference.",

There were speeches, congratulations, promotions; Colonel Luca was made a general and Captain Perenze a colonel; many husbands, officials, men of property generally could breathe easier, almost as if a whole threatening army or philosophical principle had been routed.

In another shop near the Porto Sant’Agostino, Antonio of the dark intent gaze is framing botanical prints. I step in to look and spot a lovely old mirror on his shelf. “Posso?” May I, I ask before I touch it. When I lift it, the top of the frame comes loose in my hand and the fragile, silver-backed antique mirror crashes to the floor. I want to dissolve. But his main concern is my seven years of bad luck. I insist on paying for the mirror, over his protests. He will make a couple of small mirrors with the old foxed shards and he will repair my frame and put in a new mirror. As I leave, I see him carefully picking up the pieces.",

He studies maps with Merfyn, tries to show Helen how to take a bearing on his prismatic compass; she cries. They’re sharp and bickery, then they quarrel openly, then she cries again, and then they are tender together. On the morning of his departure, the snow around the cottage is frozen iron-hard, with the footprints of birds set into it like hieroglyphs. Thomas gives Helen a book into which he has copied out all his poems. ‘Remember that, whatever happens, all is well between us for ever and ever,’ he tells her. A freezing mist hangs in the air.",

There they sit, plainly illuminated, dressed like ladies and gentlemen, in bamboo chairs. The widows of business men prove laboriously that they are related to judges. The wives of coal merchants instantly retort that their fathers kept coachmen. A servant brings coffee, and the crochet basket has to be moved. And so on again into the dark, passing a girl here for sale, or there an old woman with only matches to offer, passing the crowd from the Tube station, the women with veiled hair, passing at length no one but shut doors, carved doorposts, and a solitary policeman, Jacob, with Florinda on his arm, reached his room and, lighting the lamp, said nothing at all.",

Even the light on the hill had now been extinguished; but still she worked on. When the temperature of the night without had fallen so low as to make her chilly she opened a large blue umbrella to ward off the draught from the door. The two sovereigns confronted her from the looking-glass in such a manner as to suggest a pair of jaundiced eyes on the watch for an opportunity. Whenever she sighed for weariness she lifted her gaze towards them, but withdrew it quickly, stroking her tresses for a moment as if to convince herself that they were still secure. When the clock struck three she arose, and tied up the spars she had last made in a bundle resembling those that lay against the wall.",

They were never, ever to visit their old home, their neighborhood or birthplace. They would never walk down the back lane to their best friend’s home or wander the jebels they hung out in as teens. Departure was fully final and irrevocable. Nowadays, the Kingdom is more open, and company-sponsored reunions are held there every few years. With the recent addition of tourist visas, this should facilitate occasional visits. I wonder how many annuitants will take advantage of this without personal invitations and company support, because it’s the people who made the experience, not solely the place.",

Moments later the fleas became apparent; several fleas, simultaneously settling down to their evening meal. I resigned myself to those, too. Given their way, fleas soon become replete and desist; to interrupt them merely wastes energy and prolongs the agony. And anyway the mosquitoes were going to give me an itchy night. Then something else made itself felt, something unfamiliar and dreadfully numerous. Switching on the light, I found the bed swarming with mites – creatures much too small to be lice, so minuscule that one could see them only because they were moving. I looked at my naked body; they were swarming on it, too. Then another movement caught my eye: truly this room was an insect game-park. Down the wall from the wooden ceiling scores of red-brown bedbugs, the size and shape of a little fingernail, had been marching – until the light went on. Bedbugs are allergic to light and now they were in disarray, scuttling to and fro instead of proceeding in an orderly fashion to their destination. Experienced travellers maintain that bedbugs and fleas cannot coexist; this fallacy I am now in a position to disprove. Having rid myself of the mites (that took time) I slept in the bath with the light on. Only the mosquitoes followed me.",

With the movement of his body, the excitement, the romance and the richness of life crowded into his brain. He shouted out a line of poetry, but the words escaped him, and he stumbled among lines and fragments of lines which had no meaning at all except for the beauty of the words. He shut the gate, and ran swinging from side to side down the hill, shouting any nonsense that came into his head. ‘Here am I,’ he cried rhythmically, as his feet pounded to the left and to the right, ‘plunging along, like an elephant in the jungle, stripping the branches as I go’ (he snatched at the twigs of a bush at the roadside), ‘roaring innumerable words, lovely words about innumerable things, running downhill and talking nonsense aloud to myself about roads and leaves and lights and women coming out into the darkness—about women—about Rachel, about Rachel.’ He stopped and drew a deep breath. The night seemed immense and hospitable, and although so dark there seemed to be things moving down there in the harbour and movement out at sea. He gazed until the darkness numbed him, and then he walked on quickly, still murmuring to himself. ‘And I ought to be in bed, snoring and dreaming, dreaming, dreaming. Dreams and realities, dreams and realities, dreams and realities,’* he repeated all the way up the avenue, scarcely knowing what he said, until he reached the front door. Here he paused for a second, and collected himself before he opened the door.",

How – or so Dante said – he had had to watch the main henchman being tortured, as first his fingernails were removed, and then most of his teeth. How that same man was then shot in the head.

He was ‘the first scientist of his age, my husband says’. He was also ‘poor William—it makes me so unhappy, when I go to see him, to find nothing nice in his house—no one to arrange the flowers’. So they were sent for walks together, and she was told, with that faint touch of irony that made Mrs Ramsay slip through one’s fingers, that she had a scientific mind; she liked flowers; she was so exact. What was this mania of hers for marriage? Lily wondered, stepping to and fro from her easel.",

On Sunday mornings, I often went early to the Temple of the Dawn, and spent several noiseless hours there, surrounded by Buddhas and gazing at the gilded temples that lay across the river like slumberous lions; the minute I grew hungry, however, I could jump into a ten-cent local bus and savor a delectable lunch of watermelon juice and spicy chicken while watching Eurhythmics videos in a spotless air-conditioned café. In the evenings, I would sip Twining’s tea from porcelain cups in an exquisite teak-tabled restaurant, soothed by the sound of George Winston, then saunter outside to find the wind blowing around the sleeping canals and three-wheel tuk-tuks puttering through the tropical night.",

Half a dozen sturdy ponies graze nearby, the steeds on which stock thieves are pursued through the many passes leading into Lesotho. In this area – Danie explained, as we sat drinking wine in the kitchen while Nellie cooked supper – thefts are mostly black from black. Many cattle fall over precipices while being driven fast by night up treacherous paths; they die slowly, while scores of vultures gather. Sometimes a police helicopter is summoned by radio and on one such occasion, a few months ago, an armed Sotho was shot dead and two others were arrested. When both received ‘ridiculously short sentences’ the enraged Loteni Zulus abused Danie for not having shot them, also. ‘They couldn’t understand our reasoning. The unarmed thieves weren’t threatening to kill us. Sometimes we can feel very discouraged. Seems we can’t ever get it right, operating between two worlds – white and black, with such different mindsets.’",

Women of her age don’t usually climb masts for a living. I watch her in awe, hoping that one day, I’ll be half as courageous as she is.\n\nShe’s crossed the Pacific before and she’s been to the places we’re going. When we tell her our plans, she lets out an enthusiastic yip, telling us how magical it will be, how many life-changing experiences we have ahead.",
