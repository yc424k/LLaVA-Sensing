He explained that one day he would like to live in England and run his own hospitality business. I asked him why he wanted to leave India just as it was reaching a turning point.",

A carpet of moss is on the ground and white blossoms shine in scarce patches of sunlight. We go in I don’t know what direction, only knowing that we are getting further and further from safety. We walk for ten minutes, twenty, I’m not sure. Whiffs of scent slam into me, choking me, before they fade, replaced by others, sweeter, thicker, heavier. It hurts to breathe. To think.

According to the label, you can identify a funnel web by “the mating organ on the male palp, deeply curved fovea, shiny carapace and lower labium studded with short blunt spines.” Alternatively, of course, you can just let it sting you. I carefully copied all this down before it occurred to me that if I were to awake to find any large, furry creature advancing crablike across the sheets, I was unlikely to note any of its anatomical features, however singular and telling. So I put away my notebook and went off to look at minerals, which aren’t so exciting but do have the compensating virtue that almost never will they attack you.",

The first few times, I wasn’t sure where to look. Was it rude to glance at the breasts they pressed against the glass, or rude not to? In time, though, I came to recognise those who worked the morning shift, and they me.

After the group had moved in, I spotted a row of arrows painted on the floor that directed passengers into an orderly queue.

Apparently, I’d twisted several. Then they had me put it back on.\n\nThey showed me how to cinch up the shoulder straps first, then tighten the hip belt while sucking in my gut. The pack sat comfortably on my hips again. Next, they had me loosen up the shoulder straps until they were comfortable, but now the pack was dangling backward like before.",

Such was the nightly ceremony of the cigar and the glass of port, which were placed on the right hand and on the left hand of Mr Hilbery, and simultaneously Mrs Hilbery and Katharine left the room. All the years they had lived together they had never seen Mr Hilbery smoke his cigar or drink his port, and they would have felt it unseemly if, by chance, they had surprised him as he sat there. These short, but clearly marked, periods of separation between the sexes were always used for an intimate postscript to what had been said at dinner, the sense of being women together coming out most strongly when the male sex was, as if by some religious rite, secluded from the female. Katharine knew by heart the sort of mood that possessed her as she walked upstairs to the drawing-room, her mother’s arm in hers; and she could anticipate the pleasure with which, when she had turned on the lights, they both regarded the drawing-room, fresh swept and set in order for the last section of the day, with the red parrots swinging on the chintz curtains, and the armchairs warming in the blaze. Mrs Hilbery stood over the fire, with one foot on the fender, and her skirts slightly raised.",

Participants go back and forth on the flat streets parallel to the sea. Wandering away from the waterfront area, the walker faces a rather steep hill, thus the construction of the aforementioned tapis roulant to take pedestrians up and down at the city’s core. On more than one occasion my young students cited this moving walkway as an example of the modernity of their city. Surprised at first, I realized that by Italian standards Reggio was quite modern in the physical sense and they wouldn’t have even needed to include this people mover to make their point. The city’s face has changed many times over the centuries. Traditions such as the passeggiata and getting together in the town square, however, predate many an earthquake, and for the average citizen provide a more tangible connection to the past than the exposed Greek boulders on Via Marina.",

Across another field they dwindled eastward to the horizon and forever. I had seen some lonesome roads, but this one outdid them all.

On the tram, as it rattled and shook his pencil and my notebook, he scribbled down his name, Laszlo, and the names of some Facebook pages for Hungarian genealogy, which translate Hungarian into English. I joined, shared my top ten photos of that day, and brought questions to that group, which they patiently commented on. I was joining more and more groups, and learning more all the time.

There was not a policeman in sight, but – as usual at such booze-soaked events in the Netherlands – the atmosphere was entirely peaceful. Empty plastic beer cups cobbled the floor. In the lee of the clock tower, a fat Batman was wrestling with a very drunk Super Mario, to the delight of the cheering teenagers looking on. A single fancy restaurant remained immune from the festivities, an island of decency amid the carnage. Behind the large front windows, a grey-haired couple sat hunched over plates of pasta looking bemused, like a goldfish in a bowl at a student party.",

The figure did not move: it was sunk deep in the chair, with bowed head and folded arms, and she saw that it was Mr. Royall who sat there. He had not undressed, but had taken the blanket from the foot of the bed and laid it across his knees.

After a couple of beers he got in his car and went for a drive. Five miles north of town he stopped his car under the shade of the big cottonwood at the outlet of Courthouse Wash. The sheepherder’s trailer stood with its screen door sagging open. Flies drifted in and out and a white butterfly with wilted wings rested on the dust of the doorstep. There seemed to be nobody home. Mr. Graham knocked on the trailer wall. Nobody answered but he thought he heard the sound of laughing children in the distance. He walked slowly up the canyon through the stifling heat, keeping to the shady side. At the first turn he halted. Through a screen of willows he looked at the two little girls splashing in the water, and at Mrs. Husk, half undressed, sitting at the edge of the pool. Her long straight yellow hair, wet now, hung before her eyes; indolently, with languid grace, she was combing it. Mr. Graham watched for a few moments then backed off quietly, returned to the trailer and waited there.",

We went through the dark inner place, which was apparently the windowless bit left over, inside, when the haphazard rooms were made round about, and thence into a large, bare, darkish pebbled room with a white table and inverted soup-plates.

(Without even looking at the screen you could tell which were the swimming-trunks scenes because of the avidity with which my mother would begin to suck her lemon drops.) If a Jeff Chandler movie wasn’t available—and amazingly sometimes whole weeks passed in which he didn’t produce a picture—we would have to see something else.",

He was an insurance salesman, a little scrap of a man who was wasting away with some horrible joint disease. He was so feeble that he could not walk save by tottering along on a cane, and his great staring eyes and sunken face and large head, that seemed too heavy for the scrawny neck and body that supported it, went waggling, goggling, jerking about from side to side with every step he took, and his legs made sudden and convulsive movements as if they were going to fly away beneath him as he walked. Yet this ruin of a man had gotten nine children, and was getting new ones all the time. Monk had talked about this with the other boys in lowered voices, and with a feeling of horror and curiosity, for he wondered if his physical collapse had not come somehow from all the children he had got, if some criminal excess in nature had not sapped and gutted him and made his limbs fly out below him with these movements of convulsive disintegration; and he felt a terrible fascination and revulsion of the spirit because of the seminal mystery of nature that could draw forth life in swarming hordes from the withered loins of a walking dead man such as this.",

Two young actors from the Community Guild Theatre escorted the Misses Hattie Warren and Bessie Lane, both of them grey-haired spinsters who were directors of the theatre. And, in addition to the more gifted and distinguished people, there were a number of the lesser fry, too. There was a young girl who was understudy to a dancer at one of the repertory theatres, and another woman who was the seamstress and wardrobe mistress there, and still another who had once been Mrs. Jack's assistant in her own work. For, as success and fame had come to Mrs. Jack, she had not forgotten her old friends. Though she was now a celebrity herself, she had thus escaped the banal and stereotyped existence that so many celebrities achieve. She loved life too well to cut herself off from the common run of warm humanity. In her own youth she had known sorrow, insecurity, hardship, heartbreak, and disillusion, and she had never forgotten it. Nor had she forgotten any of the people her life had ever touched. She had a rare talent for loyal and abiding friendships, and most of the people who were here to-night, even the most famous ones, were friends who she had known for many years, some of them since childhood.",

Are we all here? Is everyone well? Did someone say something?’ – he looked round inquiringly, then, with a disappointed air, continued: ‘No? I thought someone spoke. Well, then, come in, Mr Upshaw. Thank you, I will. Won’t you sit down? Yes, indeed!’ He seated himself. ‘Will you have a drink? I should be delighted’ – here he took the bottle, poured a stiff shot of whisky into a glass, and drank it at one gulp. When he had finished, he looked round more quietly until his gaze rested with a kind of evil temperance on his wife: ‘Hello, Martha,’ he said casually and quietly. ‘How are you?’ She did not answer and in a minute he repeated, still with his evil calm but with a more vicious intensity of tone, ‘Listen, you God-damned bitch! … When I ask you a question, you answer.

A half-moon hung in the clouds, illuminating the spreading branches of a ceiba tree that rose over the landing. Shadows flickered on the water. The roots spread like serpents along the shore, pale in the moonlight. Xandra sat quietly on the bank. Juan photographed her silhouette. As Diana and I took a short walk along the water’s edge, bats darted in and out of the shadows, sweeping insects from the air just above our heads.",

Partly it was the heat. Maine, that most moderate of states, was having a killer heat wave. In the blistering sun, the shadeless granite pavements of Moxie Bald radiated an ovenlike heat, but even in the woods the air was oppressive and close, as if the trees and foliage were breathing on us with a hot, vegetative breath. We sweated helplessly, copiously, and drank unusual quantities of water, but could never stop being thirsty. Water was sometimes plentiful but more often nonexistent for long stretches so that we were never sure how much we could prudently swallow without leaving ourselves short later on. Even fully stocked, we were short now thanks to Katz’s dumping a bottle. Finally, there were the relentless insects, the unsettling sense of isolation, and the ever-taxing terrain.",

This was his office: it was really a very narrow slice cut off from the larger room, and in it there was barely space for one large dirty window, an ancient dilapidated desk and swivel chair, a very small battered safe buried under stacks of yellowed newspapers, and a small bookcase with glass doors and two small shelves on which there were a few worn volumes. An inspection of these books would have revealed four or five tattered and musty law books in their ponderous calf-skin bindings – one on Contracts, one on Real Property, one on Titles – a two-volume edition of the poems of Matthew Arnold, very dog-eared and thumbed over; a copy of Sartor Resartus, also much used; a volume of the essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson; the Iliad in Greek with minute yellowed notations in the margins; a volume of the World Almanac several years old; and a very worn volume of the Holy Bible, greatly used and annotated in Bascom’s small, stiffly laborious, and meticulous hand.",

You have to make them in the cold because the sinful cream, sugar, and pecan fondant balls are dipped by toothpick into chocolate and held up to set before being placed on the chilled wax-papered tray. The chocolate dip, of course, constantly turns hard and must be taken into the kitchen and heated. My mother made Jetties endlessly because her friends expected them.

He asked me if the mirrors were alright, which I thought was a strange question, but, just in case, I reached up and adjusted his rearview mirror for him.

At last, however, he was aware of huge objects in commotion over him; and, unstrung as he was by the experiences of the past hour, he hid himself, trembling, behind a screen. The voices ceased. A door shut. For one instant he paused, bewildered, unstrung. Then with a pounce as of clawed tigers memory fell upon him. He felt himself alone – deserted. He rushed to the door. It was shut. He pawed, he listened. He heard footsteps descending. He knew them for the familiar footsteps of his mistress. They stopped. But no – on they went, down they went. Miss Mitford was slowly, was heavily, was reluctantly descending the stairs. And as she went, as he heard her footsteps fade, panic seized upon him. Door after door shut in his face as Miss Mitford went downstairs; they shut on freedom; on fields; on hares; on grass; on his adored, his venerated mistress – on the dear old woman who had washed him and beaten him and fed him from her own plate when she had none too much to eat herself – on all he had known of happiness and love and human goodness! There! The front door slammed. He was alone. She had deserted him.",

Secretly, she was a little shaken by the evidence which the morning had supplied of her immense capacity for—what could one call it?—rambling over an infinite variety of thoughts that were too foolish to be named. She was, for example, walking down a road in Northumberland in the August sunset; at the inn she left her companion, who was Ralph Denham, and was transported, not so much by her own feet as by some invisible means, to the top of a high hill. Here the scents, the sounds among the dry heather-roots, the grass-blades pressed upon the palm of her hand, were all so perceptible that she could experience each one separately. After this her mind made excursions into the dark of the air, or settled upon the surface of the sea, which could be discovered over there, or with equal unreason it returned to its couch of bracken beneath the stars of midnight, and visited the snow valleys of the moon. These fancies would have been in no way strange, since the walls of every mind are decorated with some such tracery, but she found herself suddenly pursuing such thoughts with an extreme ardour, which became a desire to change her actual condition for something matching the conditions of her dream. Then she started; then she awoke to the fact that Cassandra was looking at her in amazement.",

I think all this in the second it takes for Wayra to cross the cage. Then she’s licking. Actually licking Jane. And Jane’s face is transcendent.

So many people used to disappear in Nome that the FBI was called in a decade ago to investigate the possibility of a serial killer. The truth was sadder. People were coming to the Sin City of the North, getting blitzed, and wandering off into the waves or the cold. (In early January, when the sun doesn’t rise in Nome so much as it appears for a few hours around lunchtime and rolls across the horizon like a pinball, overnight temperatures can plummet below minus forty degrees.) Late-night safety patrols had since all but eliminated the problem but had not completely ended speculation about another possible cause, alien abduction.",

This liquid, though cold, had a warming, slightly stinging effect and wondrously reduced both the swelling and the pain. My hostess also produced three large meals: sticky rice and omelette, sticky rice and boiled chicken, sticky rice and grilled fish. Since this was the Foot’s rest-day my Beerlao intake had to be limited: the communal loo was some 200 yards away, down a pathway running between the neighbours’ back gardens. (The key hung on a nail in the restaurant when the last user remembered to put it back there.) Beside a smell-free long-drop stood a bucket of wood ash, to be shovelled over one’s deposit, and another bucket received loo paper made in Vietnam. In less sophisticated and more ecologically sound settlements, the rural Lao use large leaves.",

If ever a picturesque seashore on a warm, sunny June day could be said to be spooky, Cannon Beach might be the one. Dark sand stretched off for miles in both directions, littered with deadwood. School was out and tourism season had begun. With the aid of binoculars, I spotted eight people in an hour. Sea traffic consisted of one cruise ship in the distance and a girl kicking back and forth in the shallows on an inflatable raft. Jack Endicott had predicted decent wave conditions, but there wasn’t a surfer in sight. To the north, snowcapped Mount St. Elias rose symmetrically from sea level like the Great Pyramid over the desert. “It is the most superb mountain I have ever seen, Mont Blanc and all the others are pygmies compared to it,” artist Frederick Dellenbaugh wrote in his diary, and I had to agree.",

But in Phonsavanh I met a Vietnamese doctor who drily commented that nets are valued simply as decorative furnishings and rarely used effectively.) In the dining-room corner my host ate alone: steamed rice, fish soup and greens, cooked on an outside fire. His wife stood silently behind him, serving more rice and soup on demand. I had been half-heartedly offered supper but the relief was obvious when I displayed my own food supply – by now dwindled to a fistful of nuts and half a bar of Mint Cake. There were no children or elders in residence but two truck drivers arrived after dark – so this was the ban’s guesthouse.",

She insistently beckoned us to follow her into a compound where she put her jar down beside an ancient hand-loom that was leaning against the dry stone wall. Then she took my arm, with a smile of welcome that needed no words, and led us into the living-room. A few embers smouldered in a stone-lined depression in the centre of the earth floor under a square hole in the roof, and we sat on a mud platform built around the fire. Tea was made for us in an enormous dechi, which meant the squandering of several fistfuls of precious donkey-dung fuel. I then saw that our wrinkled hostess could not be as elderly as she looked; she was still feeding a two-year-old boy, the youngest of her nine living children.
