    "target_paragraph": "The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys. All were shouting and the prefects urged them on with strong cries. The evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and thud of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy bird through the grey light. He kept on the fringe of his line, out of sight of his prefect, out of the reach of the rude feet, feigning to run now and then. He felt his body small and weak amid the throng of players and his eyes were weak and watery. Rody Kickham was not like that: he would be captain of the third line all the fellows said.\nRody Kickham was a decent fellow but Nasty Roche was a stink. Rody Kickham had greaves in his number and a hamper in the refectory. Nasty Roche had big hands. He called the Friday pudding dog-in-the-blanket. And one day he had asked:\n —What is your name?\nStephen had answered:\n —Stephen Dedalus.\nThen Nasty Roche had said:\n —What kind of a name is that?\nAnd when Stephen had not been able to answer Nasty Roche had asked:\n —What is your father?\nStephen had answered:\n —A gentleman.\nThen Nasty Roche had asked:\n —Is he a magistrate?\nHe crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line, making little runs now and then. But his hands were bluish with cold. He kept his hands in the sidepockets of his belted grey suit. That was a belt round his jacket. And belt was also to give a fellow a belt. One day a fellow had said to Cantwell:\n —I’d give you such a belt in a second.\nCantwell had answered:\n —Go and fight your match. Give Cecil Thunder a belt. I’d like to see you. He’d give you a toe in the rump for yourself.\nThat was not a nice expression. His mother had told him not to speak with the rough boys in the college. Nice mother! The first day in the hall of the castle when she had said goodbye she had put up her veil double to her nose to kiss him: and her nose and eyes were red. But he had pretended not to see that she was going to cry. She was a nice mother but she was not so nice when she cried. And his father had given him two fiveshilling pieces for pocket money. And his father had told him if he wanted anything to write home to him and, whatever he did, never to peach on a fellow. Then at the door of the castle the rector had shaken hands with his father and mother, his soutane fluttering in the breeze, and the car had driven off with his father and mother on it. They had cried to him from the car, waving their hands:\n —Goodbye, Stephen, goodbye!\n —Goodbye, Stephen, goodbye!\nHe was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and, fearful of the flashing eyes and muddy boots, bent down to look through the legs. The fellows were struggling and groaning and their legs were rubbing and kicking and stamping. Then Jack Lawton’s yellow boots dodged out the ball and all the other boots and legs ran after. He ran after them a little way and then stopped. It was useless to run on. Soon they would be going home for the holidays. After supper in the studyhall he would change the number pasted up inside his desk from seventyseven to seventysix. \nIt would be better to be in the studyhall than out there in the cold. The sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the castle. He wondered from which window Hamilton Rowan had thrown his hat on the haha  and had there been flowerbeds at that time under the windows. One day when he had been called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the soldiers’ slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and warm to see the lights in the castle. It was like something in a book. Perhaps Leicester Abbey was like that. And there were nice sentences in Doctor Cornwell’s Spelling Book. They were like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling from.\nWolsey died in Leicester Abbey\nWhere the abbots buried him.\nCanker is a disease of plants,\nCancer one of animals.",

I thought how graceful he looked in his white muslin clothes, the sleeves of his loose vest widening out at the wrist, the long streamers of his turban floating behind him. The breeze puffed at his dhoti as he approached, moulding the soft stuff to the shape of his thigh; then as he turned a bend in the path another gentle gust took the garment from behind and blew it aside, momentarily baring a slim brown leg. I took his hand and led him into my tent, and he told me that His Highness had invited him to return to the New Bakhri, but that he feared to do so lest he should be treated with disrespect, and anyway it did not matter much because he liked being with me.",

My head rested in the lap tying me to this land, lulled by everything around. The entire universe drifted rhythmically by, obeying the impulses of my inner voice. Suddenly, a stronger gust of wind brought a different sea voice and I lifted my head in surprise, yet it seemed to be nothing, a false alarm. I lay back, returning once again in my dreams to the caressing lap. And then, for the last time, I heard the ocean’s warning. Its vast and jarring rhythm hammered at the fortress within me and threatened its imposing serenity.",

Strong southwest winds were separating the pack and creating an opening to the north, toward the open sea. It was the bolder course—and diverged from the western Arctic tradition of shore hugging—but after consulting with Stefansson and getting his agreement, Bartlett took his shot. “We steamed along through open water and because the ice near the shore was closely packed, we were driven farther offshore than I would have liked.” They steamed north, deliberately away from land, weaving between ice cakes and sometimes ramming violently into them. Watching nervously as they moved away from the shoreline, Hadley offered his opinion: “It may be safe,” he said. “But I don’t think so.”",

It also manipulates the exchange rate for the Hong Kong dollar, pegging it to the US dollar. Nevertheless the essence of its economic policy is a determination to try anything once, coupled with the resolve to leave well alone, and the rigidly controlled economy of Singapore, Hong Kong’s rival to the south, is held up as an example of how not to do it. Taxation is very low, there are no restrictions on the movement of currency, and as Hong Kong remains a free port only a handful of commodities (tobacco, alcohol, soft drinks, gasoline, cosmetics) are subject to duty. The energies of the market are left unshackled.",

An oscillating fan cooled the room, and the stacks of paper fluttered in the breeze. There were no other chairs, no watercooler, no magazines, and no escape. The officer, an older gentleman with a crisp white uniform and neatly trimmed beard, held Mr. Fish’s license with one hand and scribbled in a carbon-copy notebook with the other. While he wrote, the officer lectured Mr. Fish for several minutes. All the while, Mr. Fish stared straight ahead and stood at full attention with his shoulders tucked back like a schoolboy called in to meet the principal. The officer consulted a set of books filled with rules and regulations (I imagine) while he slowly completed a series of forms. Mr. Fish paid the fine, and the officer returned his license along with a copy of his incident report. Then he admonished Mr. Fish for several more minutes, about what I could only guess. I wanted to speak up, to defend Mr. Fish against the tyranny, like Bruce defended the Turks against the Arabs on their crossing, but Bruce was a wealthy diplomat who carried letters of transit from Cairo. I was a lowly writer, with no letters at all, so I bit my tongue.",

No, her \"reason\", whatever it was, could, in this case, be nothing but a pretext; unless he leaned to the less flattering alternative that any reason seemed good enough for postponing him! Certainly, if her welcome had meant what he imagined, she could not, for the second time within a few weeks, have submitted so tamely to the disarrangement of their plans; a disarrangement which—his official duties considered—might, for all she knew, result in his not being able to go to her for months.",

Only much later, when I got home, did I find that the letter was in fact addressed to the State Department, and the kindly old man a would-be defector.",

I’d love to meet her. Tenzin Palmo’s Australian assistant, Monica, agrees to let me visit and I take a teeth-chattering, bone-bashing taxi ride down the mountain, past the Buddhist temples, prayer flags and stupas or shrines, past an abandoned tank and some army barracks, across a small waterfall and into another valley to her nunnery. When Tenzin Palmo met the Dalai Lama she bluntly told him of the difficulties of being a nun in the Tibetan tradition and made him cry; he then supported her work in setting up the nunnery here at Tashi Jong.",

The houses in the village had no yards to speak of but sat hard by their fences along the road. The houses’ construction seemed to have been a cumulative process, with afterthoughts of small side structures stuck onto and obscuring their original frames, and the whole business sealed in place from above by its lavish and drooping cap of snow. As I came closer, I saw that there were indeed lights in some of the windows, barely more than peepholes in little angles of wall; also, that parsimonious breaths of smoke rose from two or three of the chimneys.",

We snorkeled on all the reefs in the vicinity of the pass, the part of the lagoon with the clearest water and the most fish and marine life. Every time we rolled out of the dingy with our snorkel gear clouds of fish surrounded us. There were massive schools of snapper of every species imaginable. Grouper and coral trout peeked their heads from under almost every ledge. Giant black trevally swam in the pass from the ocean to feed on the clouds of small fry before heading back out to the outer reef. There were octopi, manta rays, sharks, turtles and dolphins. We saw lionfish clinging to the underside of a coral ledge in the pass at slack water. The beautiful but highly venomous fish were clumped together in a group of five, their long, plume-like arrangement of fins waving in the current like blades of grass in a gentle breeze. Everywhere we turned was a virtual wonderland of marine life unlike anything we have ever seen, before or since.",

Where the mountains recede from the left bank of the Indus, to leave an oval of hilly but cultivable land, groups of houses and orchards of fruit-trees are scattered over an area some three miles by two. It was 5.30 when we arrived but not yet very cold. The wind had dropped at sunset – luckily, because we had a forty-five minute wait, standing outside the Rest House, before the chowkidar could be unearthed. ‘I suppose he’s hibernating,’ said Rachel resignedly as dusk faded to dark and our fascinated entourage expanded rapidly. She has become completely adjusted to the oriental way of life and no longer expects anything to happen promptly. The crowd around us was a friendly one, but so unaccustomed to foreigners that our every move provoked excited comment and much laughter. I was just beginning to doubt the chowkidar’s existence when a tall, broad-shouldered, elderly man loomed out of the darkness behind a lantern and asked for my chit. When it had been laboriously read to him by a younger man he again vanished, in quest of the key, and did not reappear for twenty minutes – by which time it was freezing hard and we were shivering miserably, though our devoted admirers evidently felt no discomfort. Apart from mislaying the key, this pleasant chowkidar seems quite efficient. But then we are no great test, being independent where food, fuel, bedding and illumination are concerned. All we need is a roof over our heads and a bucket of water.",

Through an open window I felt the first drops of rain blowing into the carriage.

She moved with extraordinary stateliness. All her limbs seemed to bend and flow in the lilt and the curve of the music; which became louder and clearer as she danced to it. She circled in and out among the chairs and tables and then, as the music stopped, ‘There!’ she exclaimed. Her body seemed to fold and close itself together as she sighed ‘There!’ and sank all in one movement on the edge of the bed.",

Apart from having an incredibly charismatic presence, Robert has striking, ice-blue eyes, the result of his walking through a hole in the ozone layer during his trek to the South Pole many years ago, which permanently changed his eyes from dark to light blue. Robert is deeply passionate about adventure and about protecting the integrity of Antarctica and, in fact, when I met him, he was just getting ready to ski with Barney and his team to the South Pole using only renewable energy, to promote the development and use of clean-energy solutions.",

The room she led him into was more sombre than the other, partly because the wistaria had stretched a long drapery across one of the windows, partly because the walls were dark and had tall heavy bookcases against them. In a bow window stood a table with a velvet table cover trailing its faded folds and moth-eaten fringes on the floor. It bore a monumental inkstand, a bronze lamp with a globe of engraved glass, a work basket, and two or three books. But what startled Vance, and made him, in his surprise, forget everything else, was the fact that one of the books lay open, and that across the page was a small pair of oddly shaped spectacles in a thin gold mounting. It looked as if someone had been reading there a few minutes before, and, disturbed by the sound of steps, had dropped the book and spectacles and glided out of sight. Vance remembered Laura Lou’s fear of ghosts, and glanced about him half apprehensively, as if the reader of that book, the wearer of those spectacles, might be peering at them from some shadowy corner of the room.",

    "target_paragraph": "Three crates arrived about a week ago, and Cook was here waiting for them, having travelled up the frozen river with his dog team to fetch them. While he waited, breakup came. It was early, and took him by surprise. He had intended to collect the bees and mush back down the Yukon to Donna and the cabin well before the ice would run. But then, one Sunday afternoon, the silent river began to move. Bank to bank fifteen hundred feet, the ice subdivided itself without particular spectacle, and, like an ore in motion on a giant belt, departed for the Bering Sea. The Yukon is a practical thoroughfare in summer and in winter, but during its times of transition it becomes almost unapproachably inimical. Great floes coming on from upriver roll, heave, compile; sound and surface like whales. Many hundreds of millions of tons of ice, riding a water discharge of two hundred thousand cubic feet per second, go by Eagle at a speed approaching ten miles an hour. Looking at the river, you cannot help but recoil. In water that cold, a human being couldn’t live much more than a few minutes—a benevolent brevity, the struggle being hopeless anyway against the current and the ice. The river’s edges are lined with ice that is stationary—“shelf ice,” “shore ice,” the first to freeze at the start of winter and the last to go in spring. It is four feet thick, but will break apart under a stamping foot, shattering into columnar palisades, untapered icicles known as “needle ice” or “candle ice.” The shore ice rests on rock and gravel, while only a step or two away is the riverborne ice, big masses pounding into one another with a sound like faraway thunder, or, often, like faraway surf. These are muted sounds. For all its weight and speed, the ice moves softly much of the time, fizzing like ginger ale.",

He was vague, charming, lost, and a little drunk. He sat in the Grand bar drinking whisky and bitters and talking about the Nazis and the war; he began as a pacifist but after his third drink he was ready to serve again at any moment; his face was scarred from the last war. He hadn’t any idea of how to get boys for the journey, though he agreed that it wouldn’t be wise to take any of those who stood all day at the entrance to the hotel offering their services. He didn’t know anybody who knew anything at all about the Republic. No one in Sierra Leone had ever crossed the border.",

Since then, I had thought that was the most brainless thing I had ever heard of architecturally.

Yet, a break in the work week like that meant a few hours respite to shower in my own home and get some brief, but solid sleep before returning for another couple of days of punishment. Because that’s what driving a big truck still felt like. Trucking didn’t seem all bad. Just moving down the road and going through the truck’s gears successfully did have a satisfying sense of accomplishment. Still, while driving, I felt a bittersweet combination of fun and fear. Driving was fun, but undeniably dangerous. Scary, but adventurous. A more determined part of me didn’t want to give in to fear. I decided privately that nothing would succeed at making me fail.",

Let me tell you something about him—something new and characteristic. Like many natives, he is scrupulously fair minded and honest. Now I can get on, at a pinch, even with an upright man. That is because I always try to discover the good side of my fellow-creatures. But other people cannot. Accordingly, being an incorruptible magistrate, he is liable to encounter hostility among a certain disreputable section of the populace. His conscientious methods expose him to the accusation of harsh dealing. This has happened more than once. It happened only two days ago, when he sentenced to prison a batch of Russian lunatics who were responsible, among other damage, for the death of three innocent school-children. I commend his action. He erred, if at all, on the side of leniency; for we really cannot have a pack of raving wolves at large here. It is different in Russia. You can go mad there—indeed that country, with its vast plains and trackless forests, seems to have been especially created for the purpose of running amok. But this island is really too small; there are so many glass windows and babies about—don't you think so, gentlemen?\"",

I gather words to scold Matthieu with my recently discovered notions of fair play, such as not sequestering the best services for yourself before you know whether you’ll even need them. Then he looks at both of us with those piercing blue eyes, and I’m under his spell before he even says, “Bernard, we’ll be there at 7:00 tomorrow morning. Meet us there so you can use their hoist to get under your car. If you get there ahead of us, just use my name.” The route book urges “Enjoy your day off !” Thanks to Matthieu, we have something that, given our circumstances, promises more potent miracles than a visit to the local holy sites. Dealerships. What a fine idea.",

Behind this was a deep green valley, with distinct hills on either side. On the slope of the right-hand hill white houses with brown roofs were settled, like nesting sea-birds, and at intervals cypresses striped the hill with black bars. Mountains whose sides were flushed with red, but whose crowns were bald, rose as a pinnacle, half-concealing another pinnacle behind it. The hour being still early, the whole view was exquisitely light and airy; the blues and greens of sky and tree were intense but not sultry. As they drew nearer and could distinguish details, the effect of the earth with its minute objects and colours and different forms of life was overwhelming after four weeks of the sea, and kept them silent.",

    "target_paragraph": "Before coming to the Black Wood, I had read as widely in tree lore as possible. As well as the many accounts I encountered of damage to trees and woodlands - of what in German is called Waldsterben, or ‘forest-death’ - I also met with and noted down stories of astonishment at woods and trees. Stories of how Chinese woodsmen of the T’ang and S’ung dynasties - in obedience to the Taoist philosophy of a continuity of nature between human and other species - would bow to the trees which they felled, and offer a promise that the trees would be used well, in buildings that would dignify the wood once it had become timber. The story of Xerxes, the Persian king who so loved sycamores that, when marching to war with the Greeks, he halted his army of many thousands of men in order that they might contemplate and admire one outstanding specimen. Thoreau’s story of how he felt so attached to the trees in the woods around his home-town of Concord, Massachusetts, that he would call regularly on them, gladly tramping ‘eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech-tree, or a yellow-birch, or an old acquaintance among the pines’. When Willa Cather moved to the prairies of Nebraska, she missed the wooded hills of her native Virginia. Pining for trees, she would sometimes travel south ‘to our German neighbours, to admire their catalpa grove, or to see the big elm tree that grew out of a crack in the earth. Trees were so rare in that country that we used to feel anxious about them, and visit them as if they were persons.’",

But the crowd of about four hundred well-wishers couldn’t care less. The hostages are gangplanked down the same ramp I fell down only weeks ago, and fed to the mob. The crowd surges and starts hugging them, touching their feet, shaking their hands, handing them flowers or looping leis of marigolds around their necks. The armed police, who are meant to be keeping control, are jumping up and down with excitement and giggling like goons. Some of the hostages collapse and faint, others cry and wail. Only the captain of the plane seems to be enjoying himself—he punches the air as he’s carried on the shoulders of a mob of men cheering “Hip Hip Hooray” and “Indeeaaa, Indeeaa.” A sadhu emerges wearing an orange robe, and I get close, hoping to hear a sensible comment. But he scolds the Indian government for saving his life.",

    "target_paragraph": "He was of a piece with the setting, the green grown dingy of the walls, the linoleum, the circles of dirt around door handles, the faded upholstery of cheap chairs, the stained wallpaper; the indications of the passage of numberless transients to whom these rooms had never been meant for the arranging of their things; the rim of soot below the windowsill, the smoked ceiling, the empty fireplace bearing the marks of a brief, ancient fire and suggesting a camping ground; the carpets smelly and torn. He was of a piece, yet he was alien. He belonged to unfenced backyards and lean-tos, where, pullover-less and shirtless, he might wander in the cool of the evening, about him the unfading bright green of Trinidad foliage, chickens settling down for the night, while in a neighbouring yard a coalpot sent up a thin line of blue smoke. Now, at a similar time of day, he sat choked in someone else’s pullover on a low bed, how often used, how little cleaned, in the dim light of a furnished room in Chelsea, the electric fire, its dull reflector seemingly spat upon and sanded, making little impression on the dampness and cold. His fellow voyagers had gone out. He was not bright, as they were; he cared little about dress; he could not support or share their high spirits.",

Never again, I thought sadly, would I dinghy up to Varuna after a morning of idyllic beauty to see her pivoting slowly at anchor on waters mirroring her elegant shape. From here on in, the Mediterranean ports would have to be pit stops, and besides, the marine life in that sea was reputedly choking from all the pollution. Once we had passed through the Suez Canal, an entire way of life would be overshadowed by the commercialism of Europe. Beyond the canal were the continent of Europe, my final passages and home.",
