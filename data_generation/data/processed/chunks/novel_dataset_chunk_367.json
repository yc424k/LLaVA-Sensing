There was an air of austerity in this departure, the scrunched gravel of the drive crying out under the slowly turning wheels, the horse’s lean thighs moving with ascetic deliberation away from the light into the obscurity of the open space bordered dimly by the pointed roofs and the feebly shining windows of the little alms-houses. The plaint of the gravel travelled slowly all round the drive. Between the lamps of the charitable gateway the slow cortege reappeared, lighted up for a moment, the short, thick man limping busily, with the horse’s head held aloft in his fist, the lank animal walking in stiff and forlorn dignity, the dark, low box on wheels rolling behind comically with an air of waddling. They turned to the left. There was a pub down the street, within fifty yards of the gate.",

There the Tibetans led undisturbed lives, in harmony with the rhythms of the dramatic landscape around them, and morally purified by the beauty and the thin air. There what Ruskin called ‘the storm cloud of the nineteenth century’ – the three-fold miasma of industry, atheism and rationalism – had not gathered. A British traveller to Tibet in 1903 likened one of its mountains to ‘a vast cathedral’, and when at about the same time a French explorer finally reached the Tibetan uplands he described feeling as though he had ascended ‘through layers of cloud, from hell to heaven, leaving behind and below me this scientifically technical world which has done so much to increase man’s misery’. What Switzerland had been to the eighteenth century, Tibet was to the nineteenth: an upland Arcadia, enchantingly antipodean to the grimy cityscapes of Europe, Britain and America.",

And how quickly the fight-or-flight response had kicked in for some. I also realized that my hands were cold and clammy, my neck was icy cold with sweat, and my heart was still racing. I suddenly thought about the water seeping in and decided to reach into my backpack that was lodged between my legs, pulled out my passport and slipped it into my pocket. I thought, ‘If I get out of here alive, I will at least have my passport!’ Despite the panic, I was relieved to discover that I was always the planner, no matter what.

Why must market forces intrude into that space where individuals should be at their most liberated – planning holidays or more extended journeys? Much of the happy excitement of travel is in the planning; normally intelligent people are quite capable of organizing their own treks in whatever region most appeals. This commercialization of trekking, camping, swimming, cycling (with a vehicle to carry luggage!) can only breed wimps. But then the consumer society needs wimps. It needs to discourage independent thought and action. While politicians stress the ‘rights of the individual’, and free marketeers glorify ‘freedom of choice’, the ‘want-makers’ are subliminally persuading us that an industry must cater for our travelling impulses.",

    "target_paragraph": "I’d long ago adopted the British aversion to being patronised, but I was surprisingly comforted by the paternalistic message. It was nice to be in a place where actively promoting such values was acceptable. I needed that kick up the backside sometimes.\nI stepped out onto the streets, where rocky hills protruded in the near distance. Jos was filled with people and okadas, despite my memories of its sparseness. Nigerian cities keep growing and growing, it appears. My surroundings conjured up vague fragments of memory, of Jos’s cool grey skies, a quiet restaurant serving delicious plantain in a museum, which my father said was the best in the country. Remembering little else about that visit, I headed straight to the museum to jog my memory.\nThe Jos Museum comprised several parts, including the main exhibition building and the Museum of Traditional Architecture. The latter was certainly the most original. It contained replicas of regional traditional architectural styles around Nigeria. The buildings were constructed in an open-air compound and, according to a sign at the entrance, were situated in geographical order: Igbo buildings in the south-east, Yoruba buildings in the south-west, Tive and Nupe in middle belt, and a replica of the Friday Mosque in Zaria in the north.\nThe Friday Mosque’s interior was beautiful, with arched adobe beams that met at the top to form a dome. Such elegant architecture made from simple materials was an arresting sight, even if the structure looked ripe for demolition. Sunlight streamed through a gaping hole in the mosque’s wooden roof, and birds sprang from their nests to swoop past my face. A man sat on an old wooden chair in the centre of the mosque reading a newspaper before tossing it on the floor and sauntering away.\nWas this replica the exact size of the original mosque? And when was the original mosque built? I had so many questions, but there were no answers. The museum didn’t provide any information. Still, many of the structures were impressive. There were adobe houses with thatched roofs, elegant grooves and cornicing on their walls and floor. The buildings’ ethnic origins could only be identified by geography but, with my poor sense of direction, I easily lost track of my compass bearings.\nEntering another mystery structure, I encountered a man – the only other visitor at the museum – investigating it too.\n‘Excuse me, do you know what this building is?’ I asked. The short stocky man responded by sarcastically impersonating a know-nothing museum guide.\n‘As you can see, this is a very, very old building,’ he deadpanned. ‘And this is the entrance,’ – he pointed at the door – ‘and this is a window.’\nBack outside, towards the entrance, a group of men sat under a tree, chatting. I was savvy enough by now to know they were probably museum staff. The silver-haired one stood up and introduced himself as the caretaker.\n‘Why are the buildings so run-down?’ I asked him.\n‘We renovate the place on a seasonal basis, between September and April because that is the dry season. But we couldn’t do it this year because the funds were not forthcoming.’\n‘Has this happened before?’\n‘Yes,’ he said matter-of-factly.\nGrass is always green, rain is always wet, and Nigerian ministry funding is always diverted and misused. The caretaker’s de facto job was to sit under a tree and watch the decaying roofs and crumbling buildings. Was there at least some information on these structures that I could look at?\n‘Some of them have information, but not all,’ he said.\nI gave up on the architectural exhibits and turned my thoughts to lunch. The museum restaurant was the only firm memory I’d retained from my childhood trip here. Housed in a traditional adobe building, it had served the best fried plantain I had ever eaten, intensifying my lifelong love affair with the food. I adore fried plantain’s juicy, firm, succulent slices. So far on my journey I’d successfully ordered it at least once every day, only going without if the restaurant had none in stock. My zealousness was worse when I was younger. One summer, staying at our Uncle Letam’s house, Zina, Tedum and I ate plantain three times a day every day for two weeks, dismissing our uncle’s pleas that we diversify our diet. Just keep it coming, we told him, and so he did. We never got bored of the stuff.\nThat legendary meal at the Jos Museum restaurant took my love of plantain to a new level. They cooked it just right: not too dry and not too soft; moist without losing its firmness. Twenty years on, I was eager for more of the same. But on reaching the restaurant, I was devastated to find that it was temporarily closed. A man directed me, hungry and despondent, to another restaurant inside one of the traditional huts in the middle of ‘Chief Ogbwa’s compound’. But instead of being a Nigerian eatery in keeping with the museum theme, I was surprised to find a Chinese restaurant with oriental decor and soulful 1980s saxophone music playing on the radio. I sat down at a red-and-white chequered table near two student types who were scrutinising the menu.\n‘They’re not serious,’ the boy muttered, aghast at the prices. The pair left without ordering. I found myself alone in the restaurant, eating sweet-and-sour chicken in a breeze that shook the Chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling beams, and made the paper fans flutter against the walls.",

Seen from a distance, the palace on its wooded hill looks like an English country-house. But it is really very small, its tilework is coarse, and it is planned with the incapacity to make convenient use of a given space usually found in Persian secular buildings. Its main peculiarity is that by some strange coincidence the windows are of a type which Ruskin transferred from Florentine Quattrocento palaces to the suburbs of Oxford. The two gardens are more romantic. Long stone waterways proceed through gently sloping meadows, negotiating each fall in level with a flat stone glissade in the Mogul style. Wherever this style originated, in Persia, India, or Oxiana, it is proper to a barren landscape only. Here, framed in grass and bracken, it becomes slightly excessive, as an Italian garden is in Ireland.",

But this wasn’t a competition in refrigeration, so we decided to tackle the situation and search for some twigs to make a small fire and to occupy our hands. The result was unsurprisingly pathetic. Between us we managed a handful of sticks, making a timid fire incapable of heating anything at all. The hunger was grating but the cold much more so, to the point where we could no longer lie there just watching the four embers of our fire. We had to pack up camp and walk on in the dark. At first, to get warm, we set a fast pace and in no time we were desperate for breath. Under my jacket I felt the sweat running off me, but my feet were numb with cold and the sharp wind cut our faces like a knife. After two hours we were exhausted and my watch said only 12:30 a.m. A hopeful estimate gave us at least five hours of night to go. Further debate and another shot at sleeping between our blankets. After five minutes we were on our way again. The night was still young when we saw headlights in the distance; it wasn’t something to get too excited about – the chances of getting a ride were bad – but at least the road was lit up. And that’s how it went, the truck passed us by, indifferent in the face of our frantic shouts, and its lights exposed a deserted wasteland; no trees, no houses. Then confusion descended, every minute was slower than the one before until eventually the minutes became hours. Two or three times a distant dog’s bark gave us some hope, but the pitch black night disclosed nothing and the dogs fell silent or moved off in other directions.",

That, we could see from the map, was an exaggeration, but we did buy a jerry can to carry extra gasoline, and a water bag, and a few extra hoses, and our car was undeniably unreliable. It overheated daily, and often wouldn’t start. We had taken to parking it only on inclines, however slight, for the jump starts it frequently needed. When we pulled into gas stations, radiator steaming and hissing, attendants usually wanted to check the temperature gauge. They’d stick their heads in the driver’s window. “She’ll be right” always got a laugh.",

    "target_paragraph": "​Yesterday was the biggest day of the year in most American households, but today is the big day for me. This is the day I’ve been working towards for the last three months. This is the day I’ve dreamed about and longed for. This is the day I sail my new boat to the tropics. I’m finally leaving the cold north and sailing to one of my favorite of all places, The Bahamas.\n​This morning there is no rush to leave early, because I want to catch the outgoing tide and high tide at the inlet is not until 7:35am. I make a big omelet with the last four eggs, a pot of coffee, and enjoy my last breakfast while tied to land. Today begins a long journey and there will be no omelets aboard Windflower in the tropics, since I have no refrigeration.\n​I take off the big blue mainsail cover and untie the sail ties. The staysail is bagged, so I free it of its bondage and run its green sheets through the cars to the cockpit.\n​The wind is very light this morning, which is good, since I will have very little room to maneuver when backing out of the slip. All of the docklines are doubled, so I untie the redundant lines first. I start the engine and switch on all the instruments at the panel: AIS, VHF, Radar, Sailing Instruments, Autopilot. I put on my Spinlock Deckvest PFD with its two harnesses. The temperature this morning is a pleasant 55 degrees, so much nicer than the frigid departure from Gloucester Point.\n​The couple from a boat anchored in the creek pull up in their dinghy.\n​“Would you like help casting off?”\n​“That would be great, thanks!”\n​“Where are you headed?”\n​“The Bahamas.”\n​“Oh, us too. We’re leaving for Spanish Wells this morning. We’re just going to get more coffee. I’m afraid of running out. We were going to leave yesterday, but we have an 11-year-old boy on board, and he was upset about leaving on Christmas day.”\n​“I’m headed for Spanish Wells too! I think today is a better day to leave, the Gulf Stream will be calmer today. What’s the name of your boat?”\n​“Traveller.”\n​“I’ll keep an eye out for you. I’m Windflower.”\n​It is 8:00am when I untie all but the short midship line and hand it to my new friend, who holds on until Windflower starts backing out. My vessel is 40 feet long, and the space between me and the boats behind looks like it’s about 41 feet. The sportfishers facing my stern probably have chairs that cost more than my boat.\n​Windflower doesn’t have much propwalk, but regardless, she also doesn’t steer worth a hoot in reverse. It takes moving forward and backwards, barely turning with each shift of gears, 10, maybe 15 times, to get Windflower to turn 90 degrees to port so I can motor out of the marina.\n​Finally I am able to clear the dock and we are underway! The Bahamas, here we come! This is the big moment I’ve been waiting so long for. I stand proud at the helm and steer past Traveller, under the power lines where a bridge used to be, past a fleet of fishing boats, around Pivers Island with its marine biological station, and past another marina full of shallow-draft motor vessels. I wave to a fisherman on the shore. He pauses as if wondering whether or not I am waving at him, then waves back without enthusiasm. It’s just another day to him, fishing at his usual spot, and I am just another boat passing by. But to me the day is momentous. I am chasing my dream, and I intend to find it in The Bahamas.\n​Looking at the buoys that mark the channel, I repeat to myself “red left on the way out,” my converse to “red right return,” so as not to make a terrible mistake while daydreaming about clear water, warm sun, colorful fish, and transparent waves. “Red left on the way out,” I repeat again, and I can almost taste the lobster.\n​The wind is just noticeable, but still too light for sailing as we exit the inlet and enter the Atlantic Ocean. The motor pushes us along at 6 knots. The sun is out and the air is warm and clear. It is so very much nicer out here than it was on the day I came in when it was cold and misty and windy.\n​At 9:50am, the wind is up to 6.5 knots, so I hoist the sails and shut off the engine. There is no rush this morning, and I want to start this passage under sail. Motoring is no fun at all, but sailing in a light breeze is always pleasant. We make 3 knots, a casual walking pace. Our movement across the water is silent and smooth and the warm sun shines on my smiling face. I take off the big yellow bibs, which requires first taking off the PFD and jacket, then I put the jacket and the PFD back on. This is starting out to be a very good day.",

    "target_paragraph": "The house, however, was surrounded by a garden, in which the Rector took considerable pride. The lawn, which fronted the drawing-room windows, was a rich and uniform green, unspotted by a single daisy, and on the other side of it two straight paths led past beds of tall, standing flowers to a charming grassy walk, where the Rev. Wyndham Datchet would pace up and down at the same hour every morning, with a sundial to measure the time for him. As often as not, he carried a book in his hand, into which he would glance, then shut it up, and repeat the rest of the ode from memory. He had most of Horace by heart, and had got into the habit of connecting this particular walk with certain odes which he repeated duly, at the same time noting the condition of his flowers, and stooping now and again to pick any that were withered or overblown. On wet days, such was the power of habit over him, he rose from his chair at the same hour, and paced his study for the same length of time, pausing now and then to straighten some book in the bookcase, or alter the position of the two brass crucifixes standing upon cairns of serpentine stone upon the mantelpiece. His children had a great respect for him, credited him with far more learning than he actually possessed, and saw that his habits were not interfered with, if possible. Like most people who do things methodically, the Rector himself had more strength of purpose and power of self-sacrifice than of intellect or of originality. On cold and windy nights he rode off to visit sick people, who might need him, without a murmur; and by virtue of doing dull duties punctually, he was much employed upon committees and local boards and councils; and at this period of his life (he was sixty-eight) he was beginning to be commiserated by tender old ladies for the extreme leanness of his person, which, they said, was worn out upon the roads when it should have been resting before a comfortable fire. His elder daughter, Elizabeth, lived with him and managed the house, and already much resembled him in dry sincerity and methodical habit of mind; of the two sons one, Edward, was an estate agent, the other, Christopher, was reading for the Bar. At Christmas, naturally, they met together; and for a month past the arrangement of the Christmas week had been much in the mind of mistress and maid, who prided themselves every year more confidently upon the excellence of their equipment. The late Mrs Datchet had left an excellent cupboard of linen, to which Elizabeth had succeeded at the age of nineteen, when her mother died, and the charge of the family rested upon the shoulders of the eldest daughter. She kept a fine flock of yellow chickens, sketched a little, certain rose-trees in the garden were committed specially to her care; and what with the care of the house, the care of the chickens, and the care of the poor, she scarcely knew what it was to have an idle minute. An extreme rectitude of mind, rather than any gift, gave her weight in the family. When Mary wrote to say that she had asked Ralph Denham to stay with them, she added, out of deference to Elizabeth’s character, that he was very nice, though rather queer, and had been overworking himself in London. No doubt Elizabeth would conclude that Ralph was in love with her, but there could be no doubt either that not a word of this would be spoken by either of them, unless, indeed, some catastrophe made mention of it unavoidable.",

The most he could achieve was a distant view of the most notable skyscrapers, a gasp at Fifth Avenue and a dip into Broadway, before dashing to the Pennsylvania Station for the Jersey train. From that moment they were caught up in the baseball crowd, a crowd of which he had never seen the like. Life became a perspiring struggle, a struggle for air, for a foothold, for a sight of anything but the hot dripping napes and shoulder blades that hemmed them in. Finally, somehow, they had reached the field, got through the gates, found their places, discovered Bunty Hayes nearby with a crowd of congenial spirits, and settled down to the joys of spectatorship--or such glimpses of it as their seats permitted. It was a comfort to Vance to reflect that he had been right not to give his ticket to Laura Lou; such a frail creature could hardly have come alive out of the battle.",

The Englishman went up to her and said, “Will you marry me?” She looked up from Koran and said, “Of course I will marry you. But first you must give up your religion for mine.” The Englishman said, “Of course I will change my religion. I love you more than anything in the world.” So he changed his religion and they were married. They were very happy. They had four children. One became a colonel in the army, one became a contractor, and the girl married Sheikh Abdullah. The Englishman was very rich. Too much of money. He owned Nedou’s Hotel. You know Nedou’s Hotel? Best in Srinagar.’",

Beautiful shade trees decorated the sidewalk, but thoughtless drivers parked cars and scooters between the trees. We tried to walk between the cars and the trees, but then we spied piles of human excrement and pools of urine here, there, and just about everywhere. We covered our noses to the stench and turned back to the road just in time. An elderly man lifted his robe, crouched, and shat in the shade on the sidewalk between two parked cars.

Train number 29, the Bhopal Shatabdi Express, was due to depart just before 6 pm, so there was just enough time for a cup of tea and a samosa, which I munched in the station corridor, in front of a huge painting of Lakshmi Bai, the Rani of Jhansi. She was one of the leading figures to revolt against East India Company rule, in what the British called the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and Indians called the First War of Independence. She was depicted on the back of a mighty white steed, wielding a sword and carrying a shield, with her young son tied firmly to her back in a shawl. The Rani died defending her kingdom, allegedly taking a bullet from a British soldier.",

Increasingly they came to suffer the worst racial prejudices of both Indians and British: the Indians refused to mix with them; and despite their fierce and unwavering loyalty to the Union Jack, the English rigidly excluded them from their clubs and drawing-rooms. Behind their backs they were cruelly ridiculed as ‘cheechees’, ‘Blackie Whities’ or ‘Chutney Marys’. They were given the railways and the telegraphs to look after and achieved some modest prosperity, but they remained effectively ostracized by both rulers and ruled. As Independence approached, an idea was mooted for an Eurasian homeland—a kind of Anglo-Indian Israel—in the Chote Nagpur hills in southern Bihar; but the scheme never came to anything and MacLuskie Ganj, the putative Tel Aviv of the homeland, today lies desolate and impoverished, little more than a rundown and outsize old folks’ home.",

The revolutionary committee, he told me, would not allow him to go outside the palace grounds. Plastiras is a very good man I believe, he said, but frightfully difficult. I think he did right though shooting those chaps. If Kerensky had shot a few men things might have been altogether different. Of course the great thing in this sort of an affair is not to be shot oneself!\nIt was very jolly. We talked for a long time.

It had neither windows nor doors and a stage instead of an altar. Seeing rows of empty chairs at the back I slipped in, unnoticed by the congregation of one hundred and fifty or so – mostly whites, from babes-in-arms to great grannies. All the women wore hats and everybody was more expensively dressed than average (even allowing for ‘Sunday best’). From a distance rousing hymn tunes had been audible and a four-man band sat behind the handsome mulatto preacher who wore a thick red sweater and neatly creased black trousers. For some ten minutes he spoke slowly and clearly before suddenly speeding up to reach the climax of a homophobic sermon; one didn’t need fluent Spanish to get the message. Repeatedly he struck his left palm with his right fist and his eyes glistened strangely. I wondered – ‘Is this fear or hate or both?’",

Staying here has given me an inner sense of the construction. I see how the first floor walls bow near the floor, accommodating the large stones in the foundation. The house was built in a way not unlike the stone terraces, without mortar, stones stacked and wedged. From the depths of the doorways and windowsills, I see that the walls thin as they go up. The yard-thick walls on the first floor are maybe half that on the third. What holds the house together as it goes up? Can inserting a few modern I beams of steel in those openings do the job of stones I couldn’t even reach around?",

Although it was three miles away, he can even see her backing away before the flames and hear her bellowing. He began to run where he stood, carrying the broom. He ran blundering at the wall, the high small window through which he had seen the smoke, which he could not have passed through even if he could have taken the eighteen-foot drop to the earth, as a moth or a trapped bird might. Then the corridor door was facing him and without pausing he ran to it and through it, still carrying the broom, and on down the corridor toward the stairs, when Mrs Littlejohn emerged from a second bedroom and stopped him. “You, Isaac,” she said. “You, Isaac.” She did not raise her voice and she did not touch him, yet he stopped, moaning, the empty eyes striving at her, picking his feet up in turn like a cat standing on something hot. Then she put her hand out and took him by the shoulder and turned him and he went obediently back up the corridor and into the room again, moaning; he even made a stroke or two with the broom before he saw the smoke again through the window. This time he found the corridor door almost at once, though he did not approach it. Instead he stood for a moment, looking at the broom in his hands, whimpering, then at the bed, smooth and neat where he had just made it up, and he stopped whimpering and went to the bed and turned the covers back and put the broom into it, the straw end on the pillow like a face, and drew the covers up smooth again, tucking them about the broom with that paradoxical unco-ordinated skill and haste, and left the room.",

Its 206 bones are held together by sinews of braided seagrass, which, as they pass through the vertebrae, are knotted alternately left over right and right over left. Stitched onto the bones are patches of meat cut from a dead calf, which together form a rough over-body. At the time of their first sewing – when they had been recently preserved using a solution of formaldehyde and sodium fluoride, administered with a horse syringe and prepared according to a mix-ratio perfected by the members of a mid-1920s zoological expedition to the Amazon – the meat patches were still plumply muscular. They have dried out over time, though, and wizened, their fibres bunching and separating such that their texture is now that of well-used hawser. Set within the hollows of the skeleton are a gnarled heart, a liver, two dried eyes and a windpipe, all also retrieved from the same calf. The skeleton is bound by seagrass ropes, and its trussed hands are outstretched before it, as if in a gesture of prayer or supplication. From its skull flares a fright wig of horsehair, black and blonde, the strands dropping down to the scapulae.",
