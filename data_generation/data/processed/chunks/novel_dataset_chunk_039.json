It was not merely that he had confessed to her as he would have to no other soul in the world—To no other soul in the world,’ he had said!—his doubts, his misgivings and his fears: it was that every word he uttered and that came to her, during the lasting of that magic, had sung of passion. If he had uttered the word ‘Come’ she would have followed him to the bitter ends of the earth; if he had said, ‘There is no hope,’ she would have known the finality of despair. Having said neither, he said she knew: ‘This is our condition; so we must continue!’ And she knew, too, that he was telling her that he, like her, was … oh, say on the side of the angels. She was then, she knew, so nicely balanced that, had he said, ‘Will you to-night be my mistress?’ she would have said ‘Yes’; for it was as if they had been, really, at the end of the world.",

The earth is bleached to whiteness; only a green patch of vines or a flock of black and tawny goats relieves its arid solitude. Trees were planted along the immaculate tarmac road that brought me from Larnaca to Nicosia, casuarinas and cypresses. But the wind has defeated them, a furious hot blast which gets up off the sea every afternoon and turns the countless water-wheels. These gaunt iron skeletons stand in groves on the outskirts of the towns: their choral creaking is the island’s chief song. In the distance are always mountains. And over the whole scene hangs a peculiar light, a glaze of steel and lilac, which sharpens the contours and perspectives, and makes each vagrant goat, each isolated carob tree, stand out from the white earth as though seen through a stereoscope.",

I left the bar and began a frenzied circuit of the town centre, trying unsuccessfully to find a parking spot, with the occasional ominous blast from the ferry's horn spurring me on. Eventually, at the far side of the harbour, I spotted a street vendor moving a barrow of plantains from a pavement-side pitch, and as he vacated the space, I swerved the Suzuki into its place. I locked the door and set off running, with the shouted admonishments of market traders clearly indicating I was illegally parked. Kirsty had already been forced to embark and was leaning on the rail at the stern of the ferry watching my approach. Assuming I'd managed to locate Kevin, she was therefore somewhat surprised to see me carry on running past the boat.",

In her compact dark dress she looked more than usually straight and slim, and her face wore the pale glow it took on at any call on her energy: a kind of warrior brightness that made her small head, with its strong chin and close-bound hair, like that of an amazon in a frieze.",

Two of them were represented by two heaps of sticks, broken bamboos, rotten thatch, over which the four corner-posts of hardwood leaned sadly at different angles: the principal storeroom, however, stood yet, facing the agent’s house. It was an oblong hut, built of mud and clay; it had at one end a wide door of stout planking, which so far had not come off the hinges, and in one of the side walls there was a square aperture, a sort of window, with three wooden bars. Before descending the few steps the girl turned her face over her shoulder and said quickly, “You were to be set upon while you slept.” Jim tells me he experienced a sense of deception. It was the old story. He was weary of these attempts upon his life. He had had his fill of these alarms. He was sick of them. He assured me he was angry with the girl for deceiving him. He had followed her under the impression that it was she who wanted his help, and now he had half a mind to turn on his heel and go back in disgust. “Do you know,” he commented profoundly, “I rather think I was not quite myself for whole weeks on end about that time.” “Oh yes. You were though,” I couldn’t help contradicting.",

Walking, I would make myself dizzy watching the ground for snakes and at the same time watching the trees for leopards. Then, there was that mouth-drying crossing of ravines and creeks on slippery single-log bridges. At night, I dreamed about falling off those bridges, and when I woke I would lie in the dark wondering endlessly what the strange noises that fill a Congo night might signify. I was deeply ashamed of myself for being so feminine, and did my best to conceal the true state of affairs from everybody—from Stewart Cass, above all, for he had great contempt for any weakness. But I didn't want the Africans to know about it, either.",

With Volodya at the wheel, we drove to a meeting place on a highway along the Neva where Victor had come to see us off. We all got out and stood by the road and talked to him and his wife, Lena, for a while. Lena asked me in Russian if I was afraid. The optimism I had enjoyed on the airplane had vanished; I said I was, a bit. She asked the same question of Volodya and he replied, with a shrug, “Na rabote,” which means, approximately, “It’s a job.” Victor stood with Sergei and Volodya and me and shook our hands and wished us luck. He said he would see us again, “after your victory!” His eyes were shining, maybe with tears.",

On the day I visited, it was rainy, and I spent most of the afternoon wandering around the deserted colonnades and lazy balconies of a French colonial hotel I had entirely to myself. Yet, despite the rain, one could still make out the watercolor beauty of the area, billow-sailed junks outlined against jagged outcrops, kingfishers skimming low above the water. In the early light, fishermen casting nets glided silent across the silent water.",

I had never seen him without his turban, and asked him to take it off, which he did; but the result was disappointing and a little shocking, for he showed very large ears and a skull as undeveloped as his teeth, with a low narrow brow towards which his short coarse hairs pointed. I told him to put it on again.",
