On this occasion, however, his wife did not take up the joke, and he remained silent while their carriage climbed the long dusty hill to the Fontebranda gate.

After a long climb that left us huffing we stood at the lip of the crater. Not the empty pit of what I thought of as a typical volcano, El Junco’s crater was filled with rainwater that formed a clear mountain lake. Water from the lake is siphoned down the slope to the town of Baquerizo Moreno far below. It’s the only fresh water supply of any size on the island. The lake, in fact the whole setting, was beautiful and tranquil. The cool, moist air felt wonderful after months spent in tropical humidity at sea level.",

At that moment a train seemed a very good – in fact irresistible – idea. Then, miraculously, blond Bruce appeared on his Honda, bouncing down the street in a red penumbra of dust. He had passed me twice during the afternoon and each had wondered about the other. He was an expat with a difference, a Californian who for four years had been setting up windmill pumps in arid regions, always Honda-ing through the bush. Now he sat beside me and said, ‘You gotta be mad! In this neck o’ the woods you can’t cycle on motor-roads!’",

In fact, he wrote, it was overrun with surfers and other tourists. It was a place where one could “see topless and bottomless Europeans of both sexes,” “listen to the lies of surfers from all over the world,” “hire a board carrier and experience the dizzying thrill of colonialism,” and “tell people you’re from Cronulla when you’re really from Parramatta,” the latter being a less cool Sydney suburb than the former.",

For this, among other reasons, I find their company singularly congenial; being generally regarded as something next door to a corpse becomes tedious after a while. Acting on their cheerfully original assumption that I will eventually cross the Khyber Pass in one piece, they have advised me on which parts of Pakistan are most worth seeing and have given me a list of addresses of their friends and relatives all along my route. Colonel Jahan Zeb went to enormous trouble to plan an itinerary for me, which included a detour to the Tribal Territory of Gilgit, so now all is set fair for Pakistan and I’m assured I’ll have the Army behind me there – which is quite something in a country now run by the Army!",

On the day of the dedication of the temple to Tairi, vast offerings of fruit, dogs, and hogs were presented, and eleven human beings were immolated on the altar. These victims were taken from among captives, or those who had broken Tabu, or had rendered themselves obnoxious to the chiefs, and were often blind, maimed, or crippled persons. Sometimes they were dispatched at a distance with a stone or club, and their bodies were dragged along the narrow passage up which I walked shuddering; but oftener they were bound and taken alive into the heiau to be slain in the outer court. The priests, in slaying these sacrifices, were careful to mangle the bodies as little as possible. From two to twenty were offered at once. They were laid in a row with their faces downwards on the altar before the idol, to which they were presented in a kind of prayer by the priest, and, if offerings of hogs were presented at the same time, these were piled upon them, and the whole mass was left to putrefy.",

Noodle ladies doused your choice of rice, egg, or glass noodles with vinegar and soy sauce and served it in a Styrofoam box. There were duck egg ladies. Phallus-shaped fried bread ladies. My favorite was the pancake lady, who parked her cart just outside my compound. With a ladle, she spread her batter over a pizza-size griddle and cooked it like a crepe. Once it solidified, she expertly flipped it over with a spatula, added green onions, sauces, and spices, cracked an egg on top, and let it cook a few seconds more. Then she folded the whole thing into quarters, scooped it into a piece of brown paper, and handed it over, hot and delicious.",

Later, as the ruling pigs grow in greed and power, they add an addendum: all animals may be equal, but some animals are more equal than others. In Burma it is the ethnic Burmese who are more equal than others, and the Burmese government practises a policy of ‘Burmanization’ in ethnic areas. The Shans are the largest ethnic group in Burma after the Burmese themselves, but in Shan State the Shan language is no longer taught in schools and fewer and fewer Shan-language books are allowed to be published. Shan place names have been Burmanized, and a few years ago all Shan street signs were pulled down. In 1991 the regime destroyed a key symbol of Shan heritage, an old palace in a town called Kengtung, to make way for a government-run hotel. The palace was once the administrative home of the most powerful of the thirty-three sawbwa, or chieftains, who ruled Shan State until they were arrested or disappeared under Ne Win’s regime.",

The ship’s engines had been shut down for some time and were still being taken apart and overhauled by the engineers, in case of eventual use when the ice broke up in the summer and they were once again free. As a result, to keep everything from freezing completely solid and the cabins survivable, several coal stoves were kept burning continuously, and most were now smoking badly. Constant use resulted in soot buildup in the stovepipes, and that caused poor draft and smoke leaking into cabins, the galley, and the messroom. Because of the bends and turns in the pipes, members tried various innovative attempts to extricate the soot, to mixed and sometimes nearly catastrophic results.",

The expedition was a rescue mission dispatched by the U.S. government to hunt for survivors of the USS Jeannette. That vessel had set out for the Arctic two years earlier and was believed to have been trapped in pack ice. The Corwin party failed to find any survivors (most of the Jeannette’s crew perished in the cold), but details of the journey were assembled from Muir’s writings, after his death, into The Cruise of the Corwin. The travelogue is, among other things, a snapshot of the cultures of Bering Sea natives during a period of rapid disruption.",

Later, I must have been wandering along in a sort of trance, as by four o’clock I had no idea where I was, and whenever I stopped peasants and asked the way to Baron Schey’s at Kövecsespuszta, they gesticulated helplessly, saying ‘Magyar’ or ‘Slovenski’, and I realized the difficulty I was going to have about languages. I must learn some Hungarian! I was miles off my way, close to a little town called Senec and about as far from Kövecses as Kövecses is from Pressburg. A country postman speaking a little German said I should head for Samorin, about twenty kilometres off; so I set out along a dismal track over an absolutely flat plain with a few white farmhouses dotted about. Occasionally I came on an old bent woman gathering catkins and pussy-willows. (Next Sunday’s Palm Sunday.) They must be frightfully devout people. I’ve never seen anything like the reverence with which they knelt on the earth before wayside crucifixes, crossing themselves and laying sprigs of palm on the ledge. At last I came to a tributary of the Danube winding through water meadows and shaded by willows. It’s called the Kleine Donau, or in Magyar, Kish Duna. I walked till I came to a ferry, and shouted across. An old man showed up and got in the boat and pulled it over by tugging at a taut rope stretched shoulder-high. I was on the edge of that marshy country, full of rivers and brooks, that I looked down on from the castle before we went to Prague.",

I had a book in my hand, and began to read it by the firelight. Rising in a few minutes, I found the open page still legible by the pale glimmer of day. This sudden change of illumination had an odd effect upon me; it was so unexpected, for I had forgotten that dark had not yet fallen. And I saw in the queer little experience an intellectual symbol. The book was verse. Might not the warm rays from the fire exhibit the page as it appears to an imaginative and kindred mind, whilst that cold, dull light from the window showed it as it is beheld by eyes to which poetry has but a poor, literal meaning, or none at all?",

He and the future owners of the gamelan consult on the exact tuning desired. Since there is no standard concert pitch, and since the gamelan that is to be made will not (and indeed, cannot) be played with any other gamelan, the tuning need only be consistent within the orchestra. But the type of scale has to be determined, and Gabeleran will make suggestions, based upon how the gamelan is to be used. He fashions a set of bamboo sticks to serve as tuning forks. The workers match the tones of their bronze keys or pots with the barely audible tones of the sticks by striking the stick and the bronze together, listening and then filing some more. To raise the pitch of a key, they file a bit off each end. To lower the pitch, they remove material from the back. Keys for the matched pairs of gangsas or genders must be deliberately mistuned a tiny bit in order to produce the desired beat note vibrato.",

Again, the chaise lounges touted by guidebooks proved to be fictional. I inflated my mattress on the non-skid deck under the canopy and unrolled my sleeping bag. The Tustumena’s engines thrummed loudly, but heat lamps above kept the space warm and dry, conditions I appreciated acutely because Kyle had called to let me know that the storm we narrowly escaped in Ten Thousand Smokes had drenched the entire southern coast of Alaska for days. We’d probably still be trapped in that cabin atop Baked Mountain, eating powdered eggs and playing rock-paper-scissors. Two other unlucky souls joined me in the solarium: a snowboarder who had approximately five hundred pounds of gear in two wheeled trunks (he was moving to Kodiak Island “to find a real job”) and a scruffy recent college graduate in overalls, whose tiny knapsack of belongings could have fit in a bandanna tied to a stick. I propped my head against my backpack, checked the Internet for what would be the last time for a few days, and saw that the Crystal Serenity and its five-star amenities had just departed Nome for the Northwest Passage. Then I rolled over and fell asleep on the floor.",

Somewhere we passed a Negro driving three cows ahead of him, and they mooed as he scattered them to the side of the road. They were real cows, with warm, fresh, silky flanks, and the Negro grew gradually real out of the darkness with his big brown eyes staring at us close to the car, as Wylie gave him a quarter. He said ‘Thank you – thank you,’ and stood there, and the cows mooed again into the night as we drove off.",

He resolved to wait till the funeral was over ere he moved in the matter. The time having come he reflected. Disastrous as the result had been, it was obviously in no way foreseen or intended by the thoughtless crew who arranged the motley procession. The tempting prospect of putting to the blush people who stand at the head of affairs—that supreme and piquant enjoyment of those who writhe under the heel of the same—had alone animated them, so far as he could see; for he knew nothing of Jopp’s incitements. Other considerations were also involved. Lucetta had confessed everything to him before her death, and it was not altogether desirable to make much ado about her history, alike for her sake, for Henchard’s, and for his own. To regard the event as an untoward accident seemed, to Farfrae, truest consideration for the dead one’s memory, as well as best philosophy.",
