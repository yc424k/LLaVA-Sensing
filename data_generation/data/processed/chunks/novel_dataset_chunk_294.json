    "target_paragraph": "Justine Brent, in her earliest girlhood, had gone through one of those emotional experiences that are the infantile diseases of the heart. She had fancied herself beloved of a youth of her own age; had secretly returned his devotion, and had seen it reft from her by another. Such an incident, as inevitable as the measles, sometimes, like that mild malady, leaves traces out of all proportion to its actual virulence. The blow fell on Justine with tragic suddenness, and she reeled under it, thinking darkly of death, and renouncing all hopes of future happiness. Her ready pen often beguiled her into recording her impressions, and she now found an escape from despair in writing the history of a damsel similarly wronged. In her tale, the heroine killed herself; but the author, saved by this vicarious sacrifice, lived, and in time even smiled over her manuscript.",

Lovers were eating ice cream by the waterside, and children traded cards of movie stars. Whole families sat at tables on the sidewalk, eating elaborate meals by the flicker of oil lamps. Couples sat cradled by their bicycles, or in the hollows of large trees. The air smelled of mint and a festival spirit. And it was easy to feel that lamps were burning inside the people too.",

It makes for a more comfortable ride when the seas are this lumpy when you’ve got a bit of speed. They were well into the Yucatan Channel but the effects of the northward push of the Gulf Stream had yet to show up.

His dark hair sprang in two ridges from the parting. His short, high-bridged nose seemed to be looking at you, too, with its wide nostrils, alert. His face did all sorts of vivid, interesting things; you wondered every minute whether this time it would be straight and serious or crooked and gay, whether his eyes would stay as they were, black crystals, or move and show grey rings, green speckled.\nHe was alive, running over with life; no, not running over, vibrating with it, holding it in; he looked as if he expected something delightful to happen, and waited, excited, ready.\nHe began talking, about Hegel. \"'Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose.'\"\nShe heard herself saying something. Dan turned and looked at her with a sombre, thoughtful stare. Mamma smiled, and nodded her chin as much as to say \"Did you ever hear such nonsense?\" She knew that was the way to stop you.\nMr. Vickers's eyes were large and attentive. When you stopped his mouth gave such a sidelong leap of surprise and amusement that you laughed. Then he laughed.\nDan said, \"What's the joke?\" And Mr. Vickers replied that it wasn't a joke.\nIn the drawing-room Mamma said, \"I won't have any of those asides between you and Mr. Vickers, do you hear?\"\nMary thought that so funny that she laughed. She knew what Mamma was thinking, but she was too happy to care. Her intelligence had found its mate.\nYou played, and at the first sound of the piano he came in and stood by you and listened.\nYou had only to play and you could make him come to you. He would get up and leave Dan in the smoking-room; he would leave Mamma in the garden. When you played the soft Schubert Impromptu he would sit near you, very quiet; when you played the Appassionata he would get up and stand close beside you. When you played the loud, joyful Chopin Polonaise he would walk up and down; up and down the room.\nSaturday evening. Sunday evening. (He was going on Monday very early.)\nHe sang,\n\"'Es ist bestimmt in Gottes Rath\nDas man vom liebsten was man hat\nMuss scheiden.'\"",

He had taken to the girl from the first day, when he had driven over to the Flats to meet her, and she had smiled and waved to him from the train, crying out “You must be Ethan!” as she jumped down with her bundles, while he reflected, looking over her slight person: “She don’t look much on housework, but she ain’t a fretter, anyhow.” But it was not only that the coming to his house of a bit of hopeful young life was like the lighting of a fire on a cold hearth. The girl was more than the bright serviceable creature he had thought her. She had an eye to see and an ear to hear: he could show her things and tell her things, and taste the bliss of feeling that all he imparted left long reverberations and echoes he could wake at will.",

He left the scales on and said cooking would burn them away. While he built a fire in a pit in his yard, Lizaveta gave us a tour of the house and garden. The house was a combination of wood-frame and logs, and it had nooks, lofts, and additions. A broad window above a desk in the study looked out on a wild panorama of river and sky. The study’s built-in bookshelves held an extensive library; Lizaveta said she had a degree in geography from Irkutsk University. I noticed a many-volume set of Herman Melville in Russian, and Never Cry Wolf (Ne Kri Volki) by Farley Mowat. By my own unscientific reckoning, in Russia Farley Mowat is the most widely read recent English-language author. Everybody there seems to know Ne Kri Volki.",

The mama-san flitted from one to the other of us, congratulating us all on being so unusual; and when the Marauder and his manager left, two drunk old navy veterans came in and set about teaching me the marching song of the kamikaze pilots:",

Evelina, meanwhile, had been roaming about the room in search of an abiding place for the clock. A rosewood what-not with ornamental fretwork hung on the wall beside the devout young lady in dishabille, and after much weighing of alternatives the sisters decided to dethrone a broken china vase filled with dried grasses which had long stood on the top shelf, and to put the clock in its place; the vase, after farther consideration, being relegated to a small table covered with blue and white beadwork, which held a Bible and prayer book, and an illustrated copy of Longfellow’s poems given as a school prize to their father.",

He’d been a fool; and luckily it was all over. But he still averted his eyes from the house down the lane, where, only a few short months ago, he used to hang about after dark till she came out. On summer evenings they would go down to the maples by the river; there was a clump of bushes where you could lie hidden, breast to breast, and watch the moon and the white cloud reflections sail by, and the constellations march across the sky on their invisible bridges. . . .",

Leaving Rachel in our cramped room (no window, no candle, damp sheets), I set off into the twilit downpour in search of fodder. A sly-looking hotel-servant volunteered to accompany me as guide and an hour later we returned with four kilos of green oats purchased from four vendors, none of whom will sell me more in the morning. Rachel remarked that I looked gloomy; I always get uptight when Juana is underfed. From her point of view the puna, where she can graze all night, is far preferable to these cultivated valleys.",

And he described drolly how he had followed a barefoot, snaky-looking female, clad in a long batik gown, through seven Gothic chambers mystical with chimes and incense. And finally he told how he had been ushered into the presence of the great ecclesiastic who sat at the end of a cathedral-like room beneath windows of church glass, and how he was preceded all the time by Snaky Susie who swept low in obeisance as she approached, and said in a silky voice – ‘One is here to see you, Mahster’, and how she had been dismissed with Christ-like tone and movement of the hand – ‘Rise, Rose, and leave us now’. Professor Hatcher told this story with a quiet drollery that was irresistible, and was rewarded all along by their shouts of astounded laughter, and finally by their smiling and astonished faces, lifting disbelieving eyebrows at each other, saying, ‘Simply incredible! It doesn’t seem possible! … Marvellous!’",

The ugly yellow brick building had a false front, with meaningless little turrets at the corners of the roof, and a general air of spurious luxury about it. The rooms were rather small and cramped, and were made even more so by the heavy, over-stuffed Grand Rapids furniture. The walls of the living-room, painted a mottled, rusty cream, were bare except for a couple of sentimental coloured prints, while the place of honour over the mantel was reserved for an enlarged and garishly tinted photograph of Nebraska's little son at the age of two, looking straight and solemnly out at all comers from a gilded oval frame.",

Expatriates since the early 1930s have made thousands of similar trips to this same part of the world. Eight decades of history have happened since the inception of Aramco. Many employees have, in fact, spent entire lifetimes, sometimes spawning several generations of families and launching their progeny as world citizens from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. While those steps from an airliner to the tarmac were small, for me the entire experience was a quantum leap. Nowadays, quantum leap ideas are bandied around as if they are commonplace. The notion that humans can make great strides of faith, taking enormous jumps in consciousness and changing their reality through their thinking is run-of-the-mill. I do know that none of these ideas were top of my mind as I slowly navigated those stairs with our three-year-old daughter.",

    "target_paragraph": "Later, Viktor took me to his compartment to show me his new fur hat. He was very proud of it since it cost him nearly a week’s pay. Nina was also in the compartment, which was shared by Vassily and Anna—quite a crowd for a space no bigger than an average-sized clothes closet. Nina showed me her passport and the picture of her mother and, while this was going on, Viktor disappeared. I put my arm around Nina and with my free hand took off her white scullion’s cap. Her black hair fell to her shoulders. I held her tightly and kissed her, tasting the kitchen. The train was racing. But the compartment door was open, and Nina pulled away and said softly, “Nyet, nyet, nyet.”\nOn the day before Christmas, in the afternoon, we arrived at Sverdlovsk. The sky was leaden and it was very cold. I hopped out the door and watched the old man being taken down the stairs to the platform. While he was being moved, the blankets had slipped down to his chest, where his hands lay rigid, two gray claws, their color matching his face. The son went over and pulled the blankets high to cover his mouth. He knelt in the ice and packed a towel around the old man’s head.\nSeeing me standing nearby, the son said in German, “Sverdlovsk. This is where Europe begins and Asia ends. Here are the Urals.” He pointed towards the back of the train and said, “Asia,” and then towards the engine, “Europe.”\n“How is your father?” I asked, when the stretcher-bearers arrived and put on their harnesses. The stretcher was a hammock, slung between them.\n“I think he’s dead,” he said. “Das vedanya.”\nMy depression increased as we sped towards Perm in a whirling snowstorm. The logging camps and villages lay half-buried and behind them were birches a foot thick, the ice on their branches giving them the appearance of silver filigree. I could see children crossing a frozen river in the storm, moving so slowly in the direction of some huts, they broke my heart. I lay back on my berth and took my radio, its plastic cold from standing by the window, and tried to find a station. I put up the antenna—the zombie watched me from behind his clutter of uncovered food. A lot of static, then a French station, then “Jingle Bells.” The zombie smiled. I switched it off.\nLate on Christmas Eve I knocked on the door of the dining car and was admitted by Vassily. He told me, with gestures of shrugging, that the place was closed. I said, “It’s Christmas Eve.” He shrugged. I gave him five rubles. He let me in and got a bottle of champagne, and, as he shot off the cork, I looked around at the deserted car. In the best of times it was cold, but without the trickle of warmth from the stove and buffeted by the snowy wind, it was colder than usual—lighted by a single fluorescent tube and holding only the two of us. I could not imagine anything worse for watching Christmas approach. In the funereal chill Vassily drew up a chair and poured us both a drink. He tossed his back, as if the champagne were rotgut, screwing up his face and saying, “Yagh!”\nWe sat facing each other, drinking, not speaking, until Vassily lifted his glass and said, “U.S.A.!”\nBy then I was drunk enough to remember one of the Russian lessons Vladimir had given me. I touched Vassily’s glass with mine and said, “Soyuz Sovietski Sosialistichiski Respublik.”\n“Steppe!” hollered Vassily. He was singing. “Steppe! Steppe!”\nWe finished the bottle, got another, and Vassily continued to sing. Around midnight he broke into a military song that I recognized—the tune at least. I hummed along with him, and he said, “Da, da!” urging me to sing. I sang the only words I knew, Italian obscenities to his patriotic Russian verses:\nCompagna Polacca,\nHai fatto una cacca?\nSi, Vassili!\nHo fatto venti kili!\nIo ho fatto nelle grande steppe",

Just a short gash or x in the shell before they’re put in the pan and they open easily while still hot. Many cookbooks advise roasting chestnuts for up to an hour! In the fireplace, they’re ready quickly—15 minutes at the most, depending on how hot the coals are. Jiggle the pan often and remove them at the first sign of charring. Chestnuts taste good with all the flavorful winter meats, especially with guinea hens.",

He lay face up on his thin mattress and listened to the ugly sounds of snoring around him. He had proved himself to the other men by how well he did at training, how he scaled the obstacles and shimmied up the rough rope, but he had made no friend. He said very little. He did not want to know their stories. It was better to leave each man’s load unopened, undisturbed, in his own mind. He thought about the upcoming operation, about blowing up vandals with his ogbunigwe, about Professor Ekwenugo’s blown-up body. He imagined himself getting up in the moonlit quiet, leaping out, running until he got back to the yard in Umuahia and greeted Master and Olanna and hugged Baby. But he would not even try, he knew, because a part of him wanted to be here.",

They build two columns against the outside of the house for the stone sink we discovered in the dirt. It has rested these two years in the old kitchen. Primo calls to Ed to help move the monstrous stone. Two men “walk” it across the front terrace and up the three steps into the shady area where we are having lunch. Our guest, John, jumps up to help. Five men lift. “Novanta chili, forse cento,” Primo says. The sink weighs around two hundred pounds. After that, they load their cristi, their tools, and that’s it—the room is finished. Primo stays to make a few repairs. He takes a bucket of cement and patches minor cracks in the stone wall, then goes upstairs to secure a few loose floor tiles.",

He no longer went through the torment of the recess flight and pursuit. He was now in one of the upper grades of grammar school, he was one of the Big Boys. His hair had been cut when he was nine years old, after a bitter siege against Eliza’s obstinacy. He no longer suffered because of the curls. But he had grown like a weed, he already topped his mother by an inch or two; his body was big-boned but very thin and fragile, with no meat on it; his legs were absurdly long, thin, and straight, giving him a curious scissored look as he walked with long bounding strides.",

    "target_paragraph": "Giant plane trees often mark their issue; without them, neither the trees nor the surrounding houses would have sprung up, and the villagers sitting in the shade and the drinking mules would never have assembled. How miraculous, on the way down from baking watersheds, seems the green froth nourished by rock-borne springs! The water is husbanded in conduits, bean tendrils steal up flimsy obelisks of cane, medlar, lemon and orange trees form cool undercrofts. Pumpkins scatter the channelled soil, gourd stems climb the trunks and the branches to hang dappled green globes in the penumbra, goitrous with the damp. The wells that dive through the floors of lonely houses fill the cisterns with acoustics that capture the clank and splash of the bucket and send the rumour of the upper world booming about the vaulted dark. Sometimes thirst turns mediocre water into good: a gulp of cloudy liquid in the wilderness of the Deep Mani, for instance, or brackish draughts on a gasping Cretan shore. Round the mouths of some old wells, castles and monasteries fall to bits. Rope-grooves fret the coping and the roots of fig trees prise the steyning askew. After the lizards and kestrels and the Herculean mountains all round, it is hard, looking down, to focus the gloom of those cylinders. Small as a coin at the end of a tufted descending mile of cobwebs and as though seen through a telescope the wrong way, a disc of reflected sky looks back stamped with one’s own craning torso. After seconds of waiting a dropped pebble fractures this medallion with the report of a cork drawn in the Antipodes and the splashing echoes mount as faintly as the voices of the hamadryads calling to Hylas. Into these dark and plunging tunnels, in a score of fairy stories, are dropped the goblets and rings and swords whose recovery, after years of trouble, settles a princely identity, a claim to a kingdom or reconciles lovers long estranged or spell-bound.",

The problem with knowing only one verse, of course, is that it gets a trifle repetitive after a time. So you may conceive my satisfaction when I realized that if you changed “billy boiling” to “willy boiling” (and I should perhaps just note that a willy in Anglo-Australian argot is the part of a gentleman’s anatomy that he would be least likely to place in a boiling medium), it put an entirely new slant on things, and I was able to come up with approximately forty-seven new stanzas, which not only extend the song to a length suitable for long bus journeys but bring to it a dimension of coherence that it has lacked for almost a century.",
