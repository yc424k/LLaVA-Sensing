Diego and I spent a couple of days doing said deed in a hotel room that looked out across the lake in a different direction, at a different part of the Andes, and watched Chile’s rain and Argentina’s sun make international rainbows.

The new school at the far end of the village is not the standard red-brick model but single-storey, painted white and green. Here I tried my usual ‘research’ ruse, a request for drinking-water which normally leads to fraternization. But Kamberg’s taciturn principal, having provided water, brusquely sent me on my way. Is this unwelcoming atmosphere really linked to the current ‘cattle war’ or does it have deeper roots? When I questioned the amiable Afrikaner woman who booked me into my Kamberg National Park rondavel she was evasive, feigning surprise that I had sensed something amiss – it’s her job to make tourists feel secure.",

Though no tracker or Indian guide, I knew enough to recognise that they were fresh; they were soft and didn’t crumble. There had been a lot of jaguars on this shore. It seemed to serve as their meeting place, but I didn’t want to leave, and the truth is that I wasn’t really afraid. I just couldn’t believe that I would be eaten by jaguars in broad daylight. I felt safe.",

He looked down, and saw the policeman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on the doors of the silent houses. The crimson spot of a prowling hansom gleamed at the corner, and then vanished. A woman in a fluttering shawl was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she went. Now and then she stopped, and peered back. Once, she began to sing in a hoarse voice. The policeman strolled over and said something to her. She stumbled away, laughing. A bitter blast swept across the Square. The gas-lamps flickered, and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their black iron branches to and fro. He shivered, and went back, closing the window behind him.",

Charlie, and his cousin Foo, were both married to the daughters of respectable Mexican villagers. No one seemed to think that strange. Mexicans appear to have no race prejudices whatever.\nCaptain Adolfo, in a bright yellow khaki uniform and another sword, brought his bride, a faintly pretty brown girl with her hair in a bang, wearing chandelier lusters as earrings. Charlie banged down in front of each of us a quart bottle of aguardiente, and, sitting down at the table, flirted politely with Señora Melendez, while Foo served dinner, enlivened with gay social chatter in pidgin Mexican.",

Edwin was one of many regular commuters between Pune and Delhi, relieved by the launch of the Durontos, which made his life that little bit easier. Tickets were also cheaper than the regular Rajdhani trains that normally did the run. Edwin was assigned to the berth directly above us and did not mind sharing his seat with two others during the day, even if it meant putting up with Ed’s Europop and the pack of melted Twix bars he had brought over on request, now smeared into the seat.",

Housing was distributed according to grade codes and length of time served in Kingdom. The length of time served by old-timers or newbies was therefore visible in the type, size, and style of home. John spearheaded a new policy to design a different and perhaps fairer approach to pay scales at King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC).",

We detoured from our drive down the Andes to visit them just before Christmas and loved the area, but wanted to get to Patagonia for summer so moved on.

We had stood looking down at the village of Thiessow far below us, a cluster of picturesque roofs surrounded on three sides by sunlit water; had gazed across the vast plain to the distant hill and village of Gross Zickow; watched the shadows passing over meadows miles away; seen how the sea to the west had the calm colours of a pearl; how the sea beneath us through the parting stalks of scabious and harebells was quiet but very blue; and how behind us, over the beech-tops, there was the eastern sea where the wind was, as brilliant and busy and foam-flecked as before. It was all very wide, and open, and roomy. It was a place to bless God in and cease from vain words. And when the stars came out we went down into the plain, and wandered out across the dewy grass in the gathering night, our faces towards the red strip of sky where the sun had set.",

To cross the Line to the west of that point, if the southeast trades were well around to the southeast, would throw us so far to leeward of the Marquesas that a head-beat would be maddeningly impossible. Also, we had to remember the equatorial current, which moves west at a rate of anywhere from twelve to seventy-five miles a day. A pretty pickle, indeed, to be to leeward of our destination with such a current in our teeth. No; not a minute, nor a second, west of 130 degrees west longitude would we cross the Line. But since the southeast trades were to be expected five or six degrees north of the Line (which, if they were well around to the southeast or south- southeast, would necessitate our sliding off toward south- southwest), we should have to hold to the eastward, north of the Line, and north of the southeast trades, until we gained at least 128 degrees west longitude.",

I remember in particular one section of the main road from Florence to Bologna which is flanked for hundreds of yards by an immense parapet, like the great wall of China. The road at this point, which is between two and three thousand feet above the sea, cuts across the head of a deep and narrow valley, through which there sucks a perpetual draught. Even in summer, on halcyon days, you can hear as you pass under the lee of the wall, a melancholy wailing of the winds overhead. But on rough days in winter, in the spring and autumn, the air is full of fearful noises, as though the gates of hell had been opened and the lost souls were making holiday. What happened to travellers who passed that way before, some hundred years ago, a beneficent Grand-Ducal government built the wall, I shudder to think. They must often have been, quite literally, blown off the road.",

The Strait of Messina is a dangerous stretch for seafarers. As the legend goes, Scylla and Charybdis, two Greek, mythological sea monsters, live in the waters between Calabria and Sicily. Charybdis creates giant vortexes by swallowing and regurgitating water from his place on the Sicilian side, while Scylla tears apart men and ships from her location under the promontory in the Calabrian town that today bears her name. The Italian expression, “essere tra Scilla e Cariddi” (to be between Scylla and Charybdis) is a bit like the English saying, “To be between a rock and a hard place.” First told by Homer with versions by Ovid, Virgil and Dante, the myth is sometimes attributed to other geographical locations, although many firmly believe that the legend was created to explain the effects of the treacherous currents between the coasts of Calabria and Sicily.",

The flour breading dwarfed the chicken, and the roll, slathered in mayonnaise, dwarfed everything. The french fries were long, thin, and tasted like wet potato doused with salt. Just like our McDonald’s hamburgers in Cairo, there was an aftertaste that neither of us could place. It may have been a local spice or oil; it wasn’t bad, just different, and it lingered long after we finished our food. The Pepsi, delivered in ice-cold cans, was by far the best part of our meal. Within a few minutes, my stomach twisted around the sodium, sugar, oil, and caffeine, and my eyes throbbed from the spike in my blood pressure. Fast food is the secret weapon by which America will conquer the world: by killing everyone who touches it.",
