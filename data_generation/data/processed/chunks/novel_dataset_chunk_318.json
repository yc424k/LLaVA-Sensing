    "target_paragraph": "Mike Potts appears to be only mildly disgusted by all this. He came into the country for what is here; others have come for what is not. While he has been turning into a seasoned performer—relaxed in the pleasure of his chosen life—these others have been turning into hecklers. He shrugs them off and hits the trail. He is teaching his young brother-in-law Benny Juneby the skills of the woods, including the handling of dogs. (There are six dog teams in the Village, of which three belong to whites.) He divides his game with the Village. He has often shot a moose and ended up with the least of it. He is good at getting meat. Once, in the mountains, he shot three moose in a day. Two wolves were on the first moose, about to pull it down. Everywhere he looked he saw wolves, like shadows flying through the trees. When he fired, the wolves vanished. The moose staggered into the North Fork of the Fortymile. Potts was downstream, and the current delivered the meat. In the same area, a grizzly chased Oddball not long ago and was within ten feet of destroying him when Potts fired true enough to stop the chase. There is game, at times, much closer to the Village. The long tall bluff across the Yukon is a natural fence, and unfortunate is the animal that walks beside it. There is no good direction for escape. A black bear once came out of the woods between Potts’ cabin and the Village school, went down to the river, and swam across. Michael David, Potts, and Tony Paul crossed the river in Tony’s boat with a .44 handgun and a .30—’06. They were waiting onshore under the bluff when the bear came out of the water. Grizzlies have died the same way, and moose, and caribou. Caribou have been low in the country, have been all but gone in recent years, and Potts is restless to find them. He talks more and more of the Porcupine drainage, a hundred miles north, where the herds in the mountains move like rivers, thirty miles long.",

But the early onset of winter conditions during the first week of August concerned him. In consulting his logbooks and The American Coast Pilot*—the gold standard guide for navigating the northern waters since the late eighteenth century—the captain could find no records showing snow and ice and low temperatures such as they were encountering this early.

They dwell among mountains and downs where they find good pasture, for their occupation is cattle keeping.’ The only civilized inhabitants of ‘Turcomania’ were the surviving Christians, the Armenians and the Greeks who:",

Those Grand Tourists who follow what might be called the Hiltercontinental circuit, allowing themselves to be whisked from one air-conditioned coach to the next and transported from four-star Hyatt to five-star Hyatt, are likely to experience little of the foreign world they have allegedly come to observe; yet the low-budget traveler who would rather sleep on a bench and eat stale grass than pay 50 cents for the bourgeois comforts of an inn imposes on himself a different kind of tunnel vision. For my part, I tried to commute between the two worlds, slumming it in style as I moved between hovel and hotel. In Thailand, I spent a few nights at the $150-a-night Oriental Hotel, said to be the finest such palace in the world, and a few other nights on the floor of lightless huts in the animist villages of the north (though mostly I stayed in a modest $10-a-night apartment building somewhere between the two); in Tokyo, I sampled both a Holiday Inn and the cheapest minshuku in the city, an inn with cells so tiny that it was impossible for me to stand up inside my “room” and possible to enter only by crawling headfirst through a screen door. Likewise, taxi alternated with bullock cart, Amex café with filthy roadside stall. Burma I circumnavigated once by plane, and once by army truck, horse-drawn cart and third-class train. And nearly everywhere, I traveled alone, in order to give myself the space to think and the chance to meet strangers.",

They all admitted that they could only trim down if someone came to them and took it away. I was that someone, they were thankful too, and here was my village.",

It was lucky for her somewhat exaggerated sense of fairness that he overshot the mark by charging her with a coquetry of which she knew herself innocent, and laying on her the responsibility for any follies to which her rejection might drive him. Such threats, as a rule, no longer move the feminine imagination; yet Justine's pity for all forms of weakness made her recognize, in the very heat of her contempt for Wyant, that his reproaches were not the mere cry of wounded vanity but the appeal of a nature conscious of its lack of recuperative power. It seemed to her as though she had done him irreparable harm, and the feeling might have betrayed her into too great a show of compassion had she not been restrained by a salutary fear of the result.",

He turned a corner and followed a yet quieter street and turned presently from it into a lane between massed banks of honeysuckle higher than his head and sweet on the night air. The lane was dark and he increased his pace. On either hand the upper stories of houses rose above the honeysuckle, with now and then a lighted window among the dark trees. He kept close to the wall and went swiftly on, passing now between back premises. After a while another house loomed, and a serried row of cedars against the paler sky, and he stole beside a stone wall and so came opposite the garage. He stopped here and sought in the lush grass beneath the wall and stooped and picked up a pole, which he leaned against the wall. With the aid of the pole he mounted on to the wall and thence to the garage roof.",

Just beyond that, the bare sand stopped and tall vegetation sprang up suddenly. “Bears like to walk along the tree line,” David said, pacing the strip. “If you look just inside and outside the line, it often looks just like a manicured path from all the traffic.” He found a few old tracks and some ancient-looking scat, which meant we were probably safe.

He told me with some irritability that it was easy to shoot an elephant and there was no reason for Orwell to have messed up the shot. ‘The trick is to aim for the eye-ear line. It is a line that runs from the right eye to the left ear and the left eye to the right ear. You aim for the point where they cross, and that is where the elephant’s brain is,’ he explained. ‘If you hit the brain, the elephant will die instantly. If not—if you aim for the heart or the lungs—it will take hours to die.’ Orwell aimed his rifle several inches in front of the ear, where he thought the elephant’s brain was located. And when he fired his rifle the crowd behind him erupted in a ‘devilish roar of glee’. The elephant stayed still for a long moment, and then sagged to its knees. It was not until Orwell had fired a third shot that the elephant’s trunk-like hind legs collapsed beneath him. The elephant lay on the ground, still breathing, and Orwell emptied shots down its throat, but the laboured breathing continued. It took the elephant another half-hour to die, but by then the horrified policeman had fled the scene.",

Soldiers with their cartridges gone wandered aimlessly out of the chaparral, dragging their rifles, and plunged into the brush again on the other side of the railroad, black with powder, streaked with sweat, their eyes vacantly on the ground. The thin, subtle dust rose in lazy clouds at every footstep, and hung there, parching throat and eyes. A little company of horsemen jogged out of the thicket and drew up on the track, looking toward town. One man got down from his saddle and squatted beside us.",

This was the vacation period at the School for Utility Cultures, and George was devoting every minute of his time, day and, night, to a fury of new writing. Then one afternoon; a long passage completed and the almost illegible pages of his swift scrawl tossed in a careless heap upon the floor, he sat relaxed, looking out of his back window, and suddenly he thought of Katamoto again. He remembered that he had not seen him recently, and it seemed strange that he had not even heard the familiar thud of the little ball against the wall outside or the sound of his high, shrill laughter. This realisation, with its sense of loss, so troubled him that he went downstairs immediately and pressed Katamoto's bell.",

Taking opposite sides of the net, the men swung it in unison, heaving it out above the pool. The net unfurled, landing over scores of the birds, and they hauled it in, snagging thirty their first try. They spent much of the next day netting birds, bringing in 120. “The haul,” wrote McKinlay, “was not to be compared to an ugruk, or a walrus, or a bear, but it was such an unexpected windfall, and all achieved without the expenditure of a single cartridge.

A man had salvaged it with several other things from his boat after it had broken up on a Tuamotu reef. Buying it brought an end to all my electricity problems. The engine could fail as many times as it wanted, but there would always be those cells slurping up the sunlight and transforming the rays into electricity that would keep the batteries permanently charged. To protect the batteries, originally lodged in the bilge, from constant submersion, I brought them up to the cabin, wedged the pair beneath the companionway steps and fitted stoppers to secure them in place, in case Varuna took a knockdown or a rollover at sea.",

She had swaddled her galactic ass in pink spandex and stuffed her papaya-shaped breasts into a polka-dot halter top. A bouffant of Afro-mermaid hair spilled across her shoulders. The heavily syncopated beat of the batá had caught her in a temporary trance: She was slumped in a chair, eyes shut, body still. But as the rhythm sped up a notch or two, it called her feet to action. Her spiked heels began to pound the beat on the floor beneath her chair. The music worked its way through her tree-trunk thighs toward her massive belly, across her breasts, and finally to her head, which started swaying. Suddenly, the music commanded her to stand and, undulating every muscle of her full frame, she gyrated toward the dance floor. Then she began to rumba. Her energy was palpably feminine and undeniably sensual. She was like a Frida Kahlo painting of a fleshy melon bursting with ripeness. She was fertility. She was womanhood.",
