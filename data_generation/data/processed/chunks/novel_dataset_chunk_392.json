I wince, because the pain of her tongue is so sharp, but I don’t move. She’s making a soft grumble and I hope this is OK. If the grumble gets louder, then I should move away, give her space, but I find it almost impossible to tell the difference between a good grumble and a bad one. I’ve got it wrong so many times, and when I do, she snaps or snarls at me, often missing my hands by millimetres. Jane laughs when this happens, telling me that if Wayra wanted to hurt me, she would have done it already. And I have to prove that I trust her. But I don’t trust her, and I just can’t hear what Jane seems able to sense intuitively.",

Occasionally a small village with a stone chapel would appear, clinging to the ledges between us and the chasm, but as we rose these became more infrequent and increasingly primitive. It grew chilly, and before long we passed the snowline: at first just a soft dusting of snow caught in the shade of the ridges and the old cultivation terraces, then, as we climbed, a thicker covering burying the pavements and masking the slates on the roofs.

To stop the argument, which had begun to involve the whole staff of the hotel, I went off to Tak-i-Bostan for the morning. It thus became impossible for us to go further than Hamadan that day.",

It was a bust of José Barros, a native son of El Banco, who, along with Lucho Bermúdez, elevated cumbia from a rhythm of the streets to the soundtrack of a nation. Barros, Martín explained, wrote more than eight hundred songs, each a portrait of the simple life: the daily struggle of a fisherman, the dusty solitude of a cowboy, the frustrations and follies of an artisanal miner, a life he knew well from his time in the gold fields of Segovia. Not unlike Gabriel García Márquez, he discerned the heroic in the mundane, employing lyrics as a lens that alone could magnify, making all things seem more colorful and grand, revealing in the most basic of daily tasks all the qualities of an epic saga. Like Gabo, Barros wrote of what he saw, perceptions and experiences that in his imagination became bigger than life. He had a way of making the ordinary seem extraordinary, the local appear universal, even transcendent.",

If I took a detour to Delhi, I could stroll about Lodhi Gardens, breathe for a few days and take stock of the situation, instead of wandering around strapped between two rucksacks, weeping intermittently like a hormonal suicide bomber. Pulling myself together long enough to hail an auto, I returned to Chandigarh station and decided to roll the dice and leave it to fate, seeing as it was so keen to take control of my plans. Within the next two hours trains were due to both Ambala – from where I could connect to Amritsar – and Delhi. An express train to Ambala drew into the station first and I scoured the carriages as it flashed past. Bodies jammed in the doorways stayed where they were as waiting passengers piled forward and contorted themselves around the protrusions of elbows and knees. Feeling a bit down was one thing, but a death wish was yet to embrace me. Stepping back, I allowed the train to move on and squatted on the platform with a bag of murukkus and a three-legged cat. Scouring the departure board, I could see that the Kalka–New Delhi Shatabdi was not too far away.",

In the motel I dumped my bag and reflexively switched on the TV. It came up on the cricket, and I sat on the foot of the bed and watched it with unwonted absorption for some minutes. Needless to say, very little was happening on the field. An official in a white coat was chasing after a blown piece of paper, and several of the players were examining the ground by the stumps, evidently looking for something. I couldn’t think what, but then one of the commentators noted that England had just lost a wicket, so I supposed it was that. After a time a lanky young man in the out-field, who had been polishing a ball on his pant leg as if about to take a bite from it, broke into a loping run. At length he hurled the ball at the distant batter, who insouciantly lifted his bat an inch from the ground and putted it back to him. These motions were scrupulously replicated three times more, then the commentator said, “And so at the end of the four hundred and fifty-second over, as we break for afternoon nap, England have increased their total to 17. So still quite a lot of work for them to do if they’re going to catch Australia before fourth snack.”",

Yet more than anywhere else, Bangkok reminded me of L.A. Not just because its 900,000 cars were forever deadlocked, or because its balmy skies were perpetually smoggy and sullen with exhaust fumes. Not even because it was, both literally and metaphorically, spaced out and strung out, sprawling and recumbent and horizontal (where New York and Hong Kong, its true opposites, were thrustingly, busily, ambitiously vertical). Mostly, the “City of Angels” reminded me of Los Angeles because it was so laid-back (in topography and mood) as to seem a kind of dreamy suburban Elysium, abundantly supplied with flashy homes and smart-fronted boutiques, streamlined Jaguars and Mexican cafés, fancy patisseries and even a wood-and-fern vegetarian restaurant (complete with classical guitarist and James Bond on the video). Down every puddle-glutted lane in Bangkok lay pizzas, pizzazz and all the glitzy razzmatazz of the American Dream, California style: video rental stores, Pizza Hut and Robinson’s, pretty young things looking for sugar daddies and trendy watering holes with Redskins decals on the window and tapes of “This Week in the NFL” inside. In an inspired Freudian slip, one dingy hole-in-the-wall even promised “VDO.”",

This was completely irrational, as a drop of 2,000 feet is no more dangerous than one of 500, but I shuddered at the sight of the ground so very far below and at the extreme insecurity of this friable precipice; and Jock’s trembling appeared to justify my own jitters. Yet we couldn’t spend the rest of our days like carvings on a cliff-face so I set about regaining my nerve by gazing steadily down at the valley floor, in the hope that familiarity would breed sufficient contempt for me to be able to continue calmly. Then I moved forward, and Jock reluctantly followed. For the next forty slow minutes we were descending – with occasional ascents, necessitated by deep gullies or insurmountable outcrops of rock. Half the stones I trod on went hurtling into space: the loose clay crumbled at every step: a minor landslide started if I leant on my dula: the thorny scrub ‘came away in me ’and’ if I despairingly grabbed it. And all the time I was waiting for the worst to happen to Jock.",

We ate them with sesame rolls, and before we went to bed that night we placed the bowls outside the door. The next morning Madam Curd appeared at eight. The third morning she was outside our door just before six. There was a quiet knocking. Then a pause. Then came a louder knocking, and finally an hysterical shaking of the door. I got out of bed, shouted at Madam Curd, and foolishly bought some more yoghurt.",

Joshua lives here with his aging aunts—tiny gray Indian women wrapped in nylon saris—and his uncle who looks like a brown Woody Allen. Jonathan and I are invited inside for my third Shabbat. The aunts sing shyly through toothless gums and Joshua leads the prayers. Over a dinner of fish, coconut pancakes and curry, he tells us that his ancestors fled Israel after the destruction of the first temple in the fifth century or after the destruction of the second temple by the Romans—no one is really sure. What is known is that they sailed far and were shipwrecked two hundred and nine miles south of the Bombay Islands. Only seven couples survived. They obviously interbred with the locals but maintained their faith for centuries; refusing to work Saturdays, circumcising their sons on the eighth day after birth, eating meat and making a distinction between clean and unclean fish. When the British came to India most Bene Israeli moved to Bombay to take up jobs in the trade industry; after 1948 they moved again, to Israel en masse. Joshua’s parents are there, all his friends have gone and the school in Mumbai where his Auntie once taught doesn’t have a single Jewish student now. This soon-to-be-homeless family radiates a sense of loss. Their Shabbat is a bittersweet affair with none of the joy and carefree fun of Azriel’s in Dharamsala. I feel I’m at the table of Miss Haversham with her ghosts of better days. I ask the Aunties why they’ve stayed in lonely Mumbai. They look at each other and shyly shrug.",

The Government was haunted by problems of law and order – more than once the home of the Governor himself was burgled – and in 1845 Charles May, a London policeman, was brought out as Superintendent of Police to stiffen the colony’s constabulary (seventy-one Europeans, forty-six Indians and fifty-one Chinese, most of them corrupt, many habitually drunk and some too fond of boxing matches). Helplessly trying to clamp down on Chinese organized crime, the administration also issued a brave but totally ineffectual ordinance ‘to Suppress the Triads and other Secret Societies, which Associations have Objects in View which are incompatible with the Maintenance of Good Order and constituted Authority …’",

    "target_paragraph": "‘In the beginning, there was the nursery, with windows opening on to a garden, and beyond that the sea. I saw something brighten—no doubt the brass handle of a cupboard. Then Mrs Constable raised the sponge above her head, squeezed it, and out shot, right, left, all down the spine, arrows of sensation. And so, as long as we draw breath, for the rest of time, if we knock against a chair, a table, or a woman, we are pierced with arrows of sensation—if we walk in a garden, if we drink this wine. Sometimes indeed, when I pass a cottage with a light in the window where a child has been born, I could implore them not to squeeze the sponge over that new body. Then, there was the garden and the canopy of the currant leaves which seemed to enclose everything; flowers, burning like sparks upon the depths of green; a rat wreathing with maggots under a rhubarb leaf; the fly going buzz, buzz, buzz upon the nursery ceiling, and plates upon plates of innocent bread and butter. All these things happen in one second and last for ever. Faces loom. Dashing round the corner. “Hullo”, one says, “there’s Jinny. That’s Neville. That’s Louis in grey flannel with a snake belt. That’s Rhoda.” She had a basin in which she sailed petals of white flowers. It was Susan who cried, that day when I was in the tool-house with Neville; and I felt my indifference melt. Neville did not melt. “Therefore,” I said, “I am myself, not Neville”, a wonderful discovery. Susan cried and I followed her. Her wet pocket-handkerchief, and the sight of her little back heaving up and down like a pump-handle, sobbing for what was denied her, screwed my nerves up. “That is not to be borne”, I said, as I sat beside her on the roots that were hard as skeletons. I then first became aware of the presence of those enemies who change, but are always there; the forces we fight against. To let oneself be carried on passively is unthinkable. “That’s your course, world,” one says, “mine is this.” So, “Let’s explore”, I cried, and jumped up, and ran downhill with Susan and saw the stable-boy clattering about the yard in great boots. Down below, through the depths of the leaves, the gardeners swept the lawns with great brooms. The lady sat writing. Transfixed, stopped dead, I thought, “I cannot interfere with a single stroke of those brooms. They sweep and they sweep. Nor with the fixity of that woman writing.” It is strange that one cannot stop gardeners sweeping nor dislodge a woman. There they have remained all my life. It is as if one had woken in Stonehenge surrounded by a circle of great stones, these enemies, these presences. Then a wood-pigeon flew out of the trees. And being in love for the first time, I made a phrase—a poem about a wood-pigeon—a single phrase, for a hole had been knocked in my mind, one of those sudden transparencies through which one sees everything. Then more bread and butter and more flies droning round the nursery ceiling on which quivered islands of light, ruffled, opalescent, while the pointed fingers of the lustre dripped blue pools on the corner of the mantelpiece. Day after day as we sat at tea we observed these sights.",

    "target_paragraph": "Because of the violent wind-gusts, and the loudness of the Great Speaker’s voice, it took some time to persuade Juana to cross the modern bridge, a little way upstream from the Bridge of San Luis Rey. Abruptly she swung away from it and stood stiff-legged, her rump to the river, displaying every known symptom of equine apprehension. The conquistadores were perhaps fortunate that the Incas had burned the Huaca-Chaca, forcing the invaders to ford the Apurimac. As they crossed a month before us, at the driest time of year, the water only came up to their horses’ withers; yet this seems the most astounding of all their achievements, given the strength of the current and the slipperiness of the stone bed. Antonio de Herrera Tordesillas, King Philip III’s official historian of the Conquest, wrote: ‘It was remarkable that they crossed the rivers with their horses even though the Indians had dismantled the bridges, and although the rivers are so powerful. It was a feat that has never been seen since, particularly not with the Apurimac’. Our argument with Juana seemed to go on for ever and I had to exercise supreme self-control to prevent my impatience turning to anger – which would not have helped. Then at last she accepted the inevitable and, having once set hoof on the bridge, crossed it briskly but calmly. Half way across I suddenly laughed aloud at the absurdity of human impatience. From beneath my feet came the rhythmic raging of the Apurimac’s primeval music, which filled this gorge before men came and still will play when men have gone. Keeping one’s patience is really a question of remembering one’s place in the universe. But that’s easier said than done when one is heat-exhausted, fly-tormented and very hungry …",

I was then making for a Tibetan camp some twenty miles away, but when I realised that Malana lay so near the temptation to explore was too much for me.

In my self-imposed purdah I grow bored and brainless watching a lot of terrible TV, while Jonathan works twenty-hour days. Pakistan’s movies and song clips make Indian popular culture look raunchy. Goofy guys with beards, tight black jeans and Cuban heels skip clumsily between tall trees and morph into Mujahadeen fighters brandishing knives or guns. (Former Dictator General Zia banned dance, so there’s a lot of catching up to do before Pakistan can match the Indian disco moves.) Women dreadfully dressed in polyester suits and shoulder pads look on with downcast, adoring eyes but don’t even seem to touch the heroes. When an American movie gets too rude, a yellow censorship sign saying MOVIE MAGIC comes up over a pair of red curtains.",

And yet as I walked around the Potala, a young Tibetan came up to me and said quietly, “For view, beautiful”—I was looking out of one of the small windows to the city below—“but what for human rights?” As I wandered around the central market—rows of monks everywhere, rocking back and forth on the ground over their chants—the monks extended their hands, and when I declined to give them anything, sneered in a highly unmonastic way. Sitting by the reflecting pond that the Chinese had built outside the Potala, I found two little girls, no older than six or seven, clambering over my lap, running hands over my face, cooing, “Give me money. Give money.”",

By 1845 there was a shifting population of some 20,000 Chinese on the island, including not only merchants of substance, artisans and tradesmen of every kind, thousands of Tanka boat-people and Lamqua the well-known portraitist from Macao (whose sign proclaimed him Handsome Face Painter), but also, or so it sometimes seemed, half the riff-raff of Guangzhou.",

Recently I learned that Jolan not only survived the war, she lived until 1980, age eighty-four. This floored and delighted me. I was in Budapest in 1977. Andreas sent me a photo of her in 1976. I bet I walked right past her, or sat next to her on the tram. In fact, I felt sure of it. I wish I’d known. I wish I’d carried her groceries, made her tea.",

And as I think that, I recall the front office manager at Raffles who comes in on his day off to accompany a loyal guest—really, an old friend—on her 6.30am walk. He’s taken her to his mother’s grave, and after going all the way to the airport to see her off, he has tears in his eyes as he speaks of her. That guest, Madame Shoof, from Germany, has stayed in Raffles more than fifty times by now—she visits four times a year, for a month each time—and refers to the place where she has her own chair in the lobby as her “second home”, its staff her “second family”.",

Then she remembered his sudden pause when he had come close to the desk and had his first look at her. The sight had made him forget what he was going to say; she recalled the change in his face, and jumping up she ran over the bare boards to her wash-stand, found the matches, lit a candle, and lifted it to the square of looking-glass on the whitewashed wall. Her small face, usually so darkly pale, glowed like a rose in the faint orb of light, and under her rumpled hair her eyes seemed deeper and larger than by day. Perhaps after all it was a mistake to wish they were blue. A clumsy band and button fastened her unbleached night-gown about the throat. She undid it, freed her thin shoulders, and saw herself a bride in low-necked satin, walking down an aisle with Lucius Harney. He would kiss her as they left the church…. She put down the candle and covered her face with her hands as if to imprison the kiss. At that moment she heard Mr. Royall’s step as he came up the stairs to bed, and a fierce revulsion of feeling swept over her. Until then she had merely despised him; now deep hatred of him filled her heart. He became to her a horrible old man….",

The air is still loud with birds, but the cries are no longer the mystery’s choral strophe and antistrophe rising vertical among the leafed altars, but are earth-parallel, streaking the lateral air in prosaic busy accompanyment to the prosaic business of feeding. They dart in ceaseless arrowings, tinted and electric, among the pines whose shaggy crests murmur dry and incessant in the high day wind. Now he slacks the rope; from now until evening they will advance only as the day itself advances, no faster. They have the same destination: sunset. They pursue it as the sun itself does and within the compass of one single immutable horizon. They pace the ardent and unheeding sun, themselves unheeding and without ardor among the shadows of the soaring trunks which are the sun-geared ratchet-spokes which wheel the axled earth, powerful and without haste, up out of the caverns of darkness, through dawn and morning and mid-morning, and on toward and at last into the slowing neap of noon, the flood, the slack of peak and crown of light garlanding all within one single coronet the fallen and unregenerate seraphim. The sun is a yellow column, perpendicular. He bears it on his back as, stooping with that thick, reluctant unco-ordination of thigh and knee, he gathers first the armful of lush grass, then the flowers. They are the bright blatant wild daisies of flamboyant summer’s spendthrift beginning. At times his awkward and disobedient hand, instead of breaking the stem, merely shuts about the escaping stalk and strips the flower-head into a scatter of ravished petals. But before he reaches the windless noon-bound shade in which she stands, he has enough of them. He has more than enough; if he had only gathered two of them, there would have been too many: he lays the plucked grass before her, then out of the clumsy fumbling of the hands there emerges, already in dissolution, the abortive diadem. In the act of garlanding, it disintegrates, rains down the slant of brow and chewing head; fodder and flowers become one inexhaustible rumination. From the sideling rhythm of the jaws depends one final blossom.",

I chipped it off with the pick of my ice ax, then asked Andy to return the favor by turning off my regulator in order to conserve my gas until the Step cleared. He mistakenly opened the valve instead of closing it, however, and ten minutes later all my oxygen was gone. My cognitive functions, which had been marginal before, instantly went into a nosedive. I felt like I’d been slipped an overdose of a powerful sedative.",

In October 1987, Jaime Pardo Leal, head of the Unión Patriótica, was killed as he returned by road to Bogotá. By the time of his death, more than five hundred members of his party had been assassinated, a tally that would soar to more than three thousand and include another presidential candidate, José Antequera, killed in March 1989 in an attack at El Dorado airport that also injured a future president, Ernesto Samper. The most devastating loss was Luis Carlos Galán, whose vision of a new Colombia had electrified the nation, inspiring the young and leaving even those embittered by the years of violence indulging quiet dreams of a country at peace. A vocal opponent of Escobar and the cartels, Galán was ahead in the polls, almost certain to lead the Liberal Party to victory, when he was cut down by a spray of bullets as he addressed a campaign rally on August 18, 1989.",

Anyhow, I heard voices, a sob on the stair late at night. It is the end of their relationship. Thus we spin round us infinitely fine filaments and construct a system. Plato and Shakespeare are included, also quite obscure people, people of no importance whatsoever. I hate men who wear crucifixes on the left side of their waistcoats. I hate ceremonies and lamentations and the sad figure of Christ trembling beside another trembling and sad figure. Also the pomp and the indifference and the emphasis, always on the wrong place, of people holding forth under chandeliers in full evening dress, wearing stars and decorations. Some spray in a hedge, though, or a sunset over a flat winter field, or again the way some old woman sits, arms akimbo, in an omnibus with a basket—those we point at for the other to look at. It is so vast an alleviation to be able to point for another to look at. And then not to talk. To follow the dark paths of the mind and enter the past, to visit books, to brush aside their branches and break off some fruit. And you take it and marvel, as I take the careless movements of your body and marvel at its ease, its power—how you fling open windows and are dexterous with your hands. For alas! my mind is a little impeded, it soon tires; I fall damp, perhaps disgusting, at the goal.",

Tom Cline clumped greasily up the steps of his residence on Bartlett Street, swinging his tin pail; Ben returned to the paper office with Harry Tugman; and Eugene, in the back room on Woodson Street, waking suddenly to Gant’s powerful command from the foot of the stairs, turned his face full into a momentary vision of rose-flushed blue sky and tender blossoms that drifted slowly earthward.",
