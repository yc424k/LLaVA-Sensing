    "target_paragraph": "Suddenly the long, orderly lines began to splinter and circle; thousands of antelope were running from three trucks filled with waving, jeering men. Wheeling in tightening circles around the wildebeest, the driver of the five-ton Bedford bludgeoned his way through the herd, before turning to come back again. Several wildebeest hit on the first pass tried to hobble away. The driver turned sharply and, with clouds of dust boiling from the truck’s wheels, he ran down the wounded one by one.\nWhen they had struck down six wildebeest, the drivers slid the trucks to a stop and laughing tribesmen leaped out. Two men held each animal by its horns, and a third sawed through its throat with a knife.\nWith the sun rising higher and hotter, the survivors crossed a shimmering white salt pan and climbed a last barren ridge. Below them, not half a mile away, lay the blue waters of Lake Xau, pelicans and flamingos bobbing like flower petals on the surface.\nTo the north, more than 360 miles of river front and lake shores had once been available to the wildebeest during drought, as had a similar stretch of the Limpopo River, in the south. Now, fence lines and settlements had funneled a major portion of the entire Central Kalahari population into a tiny area, denying all but two or three miles of the riparian habitat to the 80,000 antelope who had come for water. The wildebeest had to drink here or die.\nSensing danger from the native huts on either side, the thirsty animals took a few tentative steps forward. The water was there. They could see it and smell it! They broke into a canter, heading for the lake. When they were about 200 yards away from it, bands of native men and boys with packs of dogs broke from cover near the kraals. The dogs were set upon the wildebeest and chased them in circles for long minutes. The dogs worked efficiently, holding exhausted animals by the hind legs, hamstringing and disemboweling them as they sank to the ground, the poachers rushing in with clubs and knives to finish them off.\nThousands of other wildebeest were prevented from going to the water by the disturbance. Some managed to reach the lake, where they collapsed into its coolness. But many were too weak to rise or even to drink, and their muzzles sank slowly into the shallow water and the mud.",

It was bang in the heart of the city’s busiest road, an artery for trade that connected Delhi to its main railway and metro station. Outside the hotel, stray dogs with long snouts and droopy nipples wove through human legs, as those human legs wove through a bitumen chaos of cattle-drawn carts, motor cycles and three-wheeled auto rickshaws. Teenage boys sat on the ledges of the main bridge of Desh Bandhu Gupta Road eating snacks, feet dangling over the edge, seemingly oblivious to the fatal drop. Men pissed into open-air urinals on the kerbside only to have their piss run back onto the footpath and road. Everything stank. It was an ever-evolving smell, usually consisting of petrol fumes, faeces, human urine and an exciting hint of fire. At night, even with the windows closed, the smell seeped inside. As I slept, I collected it in my lungs.",

She was talking “books” with Mr. Gouvernail and trying to draw from him his opinion upon current literary topics.",

From that top we could see the next two miles of track curving level around a complex of mountains, before rising for the short, severe climb to the true pass. Now only a few clouds remained, over the Khardung La, and the sun felt almost warm. A thousand feet below us the Shyok was looped like a green satin ribbon around the base of an isolated rock-mountain whose summit was lower than our track, and directly above us golden-brown crags glowed richly against a dark blue sky. Hallam moved cautiously through knee-deep snow, aware of black ice beneath the new fall, and I decided to picnic on the pass. For him the descent would be even more difficult than the ascent and best coped with after barley.",

He flipped a switch on the dashboard, and a thirteen-inch color television that hung from the ceiling over the windshield crackled to life. The DVD was a poor copy, even by bootleg standards, so the screen was blurry and lines crisscrossed over the screen for the first few minutes. Eventually, we realized it was a John Travolta film, From Paris with Love. The film was heavily edited, to about forty-five minutes, and only showed the action sequences: fight scenes, car chases, and a rocket explosion. The final scene showed a female suicide bomber at a political summit. She is shot and killed while trying to detonate her explosives. Following that scene, the DVD unceremoniously switched to a second film, also heavily edited to about forty-five minutes. That film, Body of Lies, featured Leonardo DiCaprio in a political action-thriller set in Iraq. Near the end of the film, DiCaprio’s character is dropped off in the middle of the desert, kidnapped, and tortured. During the dramatic torture scene, with DiCaprio tied to a chair and covered in blood, several people in the back of the bus cheered. The screen faded to black, and once again, the bus was quiet.",

    "target_paragraph": "Brussels is a seriously ugly place, full of wet litter, boulevards like freeways and muddy building sites. It is a city of grey offices and faceless office workers, the briefcase capital of Europe. It has fewer parks than any city I can think of, and almost no other features to commend it ? no castle on a hill, no mountainous cathedral, no street of singularly elegant shops, no backdrop of snowy peaks, no fairy-lighted seafront. It doesn’t even have a river. How can a city not at least have a river? They did once have some city walls, but all that remains is a crumbly fragment stuck next door to a bowling alley on the Rue des Alexiens. The best thing that can be said for Brussels is that it is only three hours from Paris. If I were in charge of the EEC, and frankly you could do worse, my first move would be to transfer the capital to Dublin or Glasgow or possibly Naples, where the jobs would be appreciated and where the people still have some pride in their city, because in Brussels, alas, they simply haven’t.",

The son of a bitch tricked me, he thought. He went out the back: and ran up the steps, stumbling heavily and recovering, and thundered down the hall to the kitchen door and saw, in the instant of passing it, the other standing beside the stove as he had left him, his hand again on the coffee pot.

The sun shone bright, and Bartlett enjoyed its warmth—he reckoned the temperature had risen to just about freezing—but the glare was such that he had to pull his visored hat down over his goggles to shield against the rays. The fresh dogs pulled hard, and by three o’clock in the afternoon, they came to Cape Serdze. In no time, word of their coming arrival having preceded them once more, they were greeted by a man named Wall, a Norwegian of about forty. Bartlett learned that Wall had lived in the United States and spoke perfect English. Bartlett briefly summarized his situation, explaining that he needed to get to East Cape, from where, he was confident, a contact could help convey him to Alaska. Wall said it was ninety miles to East Cape; then he grinned and laughed and said he knew just the man to take them there.",

We stopped for Matthew to photograph gaudy iron buildings with large dented domes and chipped plaster columns. Then the trees faded away and we entered a textbook desert landscape consisting of nothing except undulating smooth sand and throbbing air. We sweated, even with the wind rushing through the windows, and spent a lot of time refilling our water containers: however much we drank, it was never enough. A village appeared in the distance, a dark green, abruptly circumscribed oasis, and we stopped to drink juice freshly pressed from its citrus groves.",

I spent a night in each of them and only a few scattered fragments remain: a tower or two, a row of gargoyles, some bridges and pinnacles and buttresses and the perspective of an arcade dwindling into the shadows. There is a statue of Luther that can only belong to Worms; but there are cloisters as well and the blackletter pages of a Gutenberg Bible, a picture of St Boniface and a twirl of Jesuit columns. Lamplight shines through shields of crimson glass patterned with gold crescents and outlined in lead; but the arch that framed them has gone. And there are lost faces: a chimney sweep, a walrus moustache, a girl’s long fair hair under a tam o’shanter. It is like reconstructing a brontosaur from half an eye socket and a basket full of bones. The cloud lifts at last in the middle of the Ludwigshafen-Mannheim bridge.",

And now, a few weeks later, the clue to it came to him in Boylston’s new word. Preparedness! America, it appeared, had caught it up from east to west, in that sudden incalculable way she had of flinging herself on a new idea; from a little group of discerning spirits the contagion had spread like a prairie fire, sweeping away all the other catch words of the hour, devouring them in one great blaze of wrath and enthusiasm. America meant to be prepared! First had come the creation of the training camp at Plattsburg, for which, after long delays and much difficulty, permission had been wrung from a reluctant government; then, as candidates flocked to it, as the whole young manhood of the Eastern States rose to the call, other camps, rapidly planned, were springing up at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia, at Fort Sheridan in Illinois, at The Presidio in California; for the idea was spreading through the West, and the torch kindled beside the Atlantic seaboard already flashed its light on the Pacific.",

When she turns back to me, she hardens and becomes a vivid scathing jade, pupils shrunk to absolutely nothing. Did she come here, I think, when she was free? Did she chase butterflies? A troop of capuchin monkeys, which have been calling anxiously somewhere behind us, suddenly seem to disappear. And then the macaws I’ve been hearing, the toucans, the ants seething across the mulch in anticipation of a flash winter rain—they disappear too. The ticks, the caterpillars, the fungus. The whole jungle. The clouds go, the sky, the tan dirt under my knees. The world’s broken, Wayra. But this forest is yours. I look around at it, at the veins of trails full of hope.

Sport has a symbolic significance in relation to performance outcomes, success and celebrating achievement that does not seem to occur in other areas of economic and social activity. From when I was thirteen years old, I had been wearing Nike running shoes, my brand of choice. I never forgot the joy I felt when I got my very first pair of Nikes. I was so excited that I slept with them on my feet that night?a sign of things to come. It took several years and several career shifts for this dream to become a reality?but that is a story you will read more about in the succeeding chapters.",

The gale felt absolutely scorching, as if coming from an open furnace, and after about three hours I was suddenly overcome by headache, nausea and severe cramps in the leg muscles – the latter I believe due to salt deficiency, although I’ve eaten over three-quarters of a pound of solid salt in the last few days. Fortunately we were on the main Peshawar–Pindi road, where buses pass frequently, so I stopped one and was pulled on to it by a twinkling-eyed passenger who asked whether I was a mad dog or an Englishman? This immediately made me feel better, and I replied ‘neither – an Irishwoman’, and he said that that was obviously much the same thing. It was only five miles back to Pindi and after lying down in my air-conditioned room at the General’s house, and absorbing eight pints of mango-juice and sour milk heavily salted, I had recovered by 2 p.m. – as much as anyone could recover in this infernal region.",

Then the skies parted and the winds finally calmed, allowing Bartlett to get back up into the crow’s nest.* He took Mamen with him, and they could clearly see the tip of Point Barrow just five miles to the south. But the ice island in which they were lodged—which was about two or three miles square—was surrounded by open water on all sides, punctuated by young, unstable ice inshore. Bartlett concluded that it would be too dangerous to attempt either by dogsled or boat; their safest bet was to remain aboard the Karluk, where they still had food, shelter, and warmth.",

Collectively, fashionable Paris was already away, at the seashore or in the mountains, but not a few of its chief ornaments still lingered, as the procession through Campton’s studio had proved; and others had returned drawn back by doubts about the future, the desire to be nearer the source of news, the irresistible French craving for the forum and the market when messengers are foaming in. The public of the “Posada,” therefore, was still Parisian enough to flatter the new dancer; and on all the pleasure-tired faces, belonging to every type of money-getters and amusement-seekers, Campton saw only the old familiar music-hall: the look of a house with lights blazing and windows wide, but nobody and nothing within.",

This suburb was originally built as a gated estate for high-ranking military personnel. Behind massive wrought iron gates grand homes rise reminiscent of Dynasty gone dilapidated; mock Tudor or Georgian facades are faded or filthy, and because Indians build onto their houses as their wealth and families grow there’s quite a hodgepodge of styles within each house and each block. There are a number of small potholed parks complete with faded foliage clumsily cut into animal shapes. But these open spaces are difficult to access as they are surrounded by high fences and usually locked up to keep out the cows and commoners. The General has seen his suburb rapidly ringed by roads, suburbia and slums and watched former comrades die and move away to be replaced by foreigners and the new money set. But this doesn’t seem to upset him. More British than the British, at eighty he has vim and vigor and still follows a jolly good army routine. He’s up at oh-five hundred walking the neighborhood, upright but bandy-legged, swinging a small riding crop. At oh-six hundred he inspects his staff troops and then eats and reads papers until his afternoon bridge game.",

However, on the eve of my departure for Santa Clara (20 January) police were swarming throughout Havana, in twos and threes and fours, foot-patrolling the main streets, standing on every other corner, frequently checking ID cards. The explanation: a mega-demo, planned for 24 January to protest against Radio Marti, broadcast from Miami and relayed from the US Interests Section on the Malecón. Fidel would, at intervals, mingle with the million or so marchers. The logic of this explanation escaped me. How could those checks prevent an assassination attempt? Was it likely that the assassin would be strolling around Havana exposing himself to suspicion and arrest? But then, I know nothing of security measures. Better-informed people assured me that the authorities knew what they were doing.",

That is certainly a better way of appreciating the sandbar as a whole than to walk along it, where only the details are viewable; but it was the details that I liked most.",

(The ANC Women’s League were responsible for the crazy decision to move the rally indoors.) Then came a reinforcement of marshals, not before time. One mountainous man, tall and grossly fat, wielded a long iron-tipped stick with which he drove the youths out of the way of cars; his uncontrolled ferocity drew loud protests from the Women’s Leaguers in whose care I had been left. The SAP would be proud of him; his expression may fairly be described as ‘depraved’ and one could imagine him committing any sort of atrocity. Eventually he was checked by an elderly distinguished-looking man who had the authority to order moderation. Then things settled down, the élite arranged their chairs close to the improvised speakers’ platform – and I found myself upgraded and seated.",

On the other side of it we struck across a rising green plain, which brought us nearer to the great snow-peaks on the south-east, so that we could distinguish faces and clefts of bare rock among the snow. Out in the pasture, which consisted of that curious prickly clover whose flowers are like clover flowers, cream with pink tips, while the leaves are more like holly, stood occasional kibitkas, rush-built and untidy, around which grazed herds of horses and cattle. A yellow asphodel appeared, three or four feet high, singly at first, then in patches, at length transforming the whole prairie into a sea of deep daffodil yellow warmed by the golden blush of sunset.",

The Inner Alster is much the smaller of the two, but it is still large enough to present a great rectangular pool of silence and darkness in the midst of the city.

It was cause for celebration when someone got one and cause for repeat celebration every time you went out in one and returned home unscathed. Since the P2P, we’ve driven tens of thousands of miles more. Avis supplied us with a spunky white Isuzu in Patagonia. A borrowed Mahindra Jeep I called Sexy Beast took us from the southern tip of India to the foothills of the Himalayas. Our own Land Rover Defender, whom I named Brunhilde, because she’s fair and full of fortitude, squired us around a thousand hairpin turns climbing up to Peru’s altiplano and from there down to Bolivia’s deserts. She stood by us when we drove from Djibouti into and throughout Ethiopia and back, skirting the Somali border along the way. Brunhilde never flinched when tasked with conveying us 9,000 miles from Istanbul through Iran, more former Soviet ’stans than my passport had visa space for, onward through China, Tibet, Nepal, and finally India. Through it all, we’ve recaptured that euphoria that people used to feel a hundred years ago when they got in a car. They’d close the door, if there was one, sit back, and know that adventure awaited them. Now we do the same. I don’t even get carsick.",
