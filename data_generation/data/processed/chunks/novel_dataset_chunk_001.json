Because he cannot make one with her through the day’s morning and noon and evening. It is not that he must return to work. There is no work, no travail, no muscular and spiritual reluctance to overcome, constantly war against; yesterday was not, tomorrow is not, today is merely a placid and virginal astonishment at the creeping ridge of dust and trash in front of the broom, at sheets coming smooth and taut at certain remembered motions of the hands—a routine grooved, irkless; a firm gentle compelling hand, a voice to hold and control him through joy out of kindness as a dog is taught and held.",

Arriving at the compartment we were dismayed to find that a combination of the two had taken place. Dismayed, but inwardly thrilled. Over the last couple of weeks I had grown to enjoy a fleeting sense of Schadenfreude when someone else had taken my seat and I was compelled to ask them to move. Elderly or injured passengers and families with children were the exception, and I was happy to make allowances. But for the most part, culprits were young and able-bodied – their only afflictions being a combination of selective hearing and an inability to make eye contact. This game became all the more enjoyable when they refused to move until a ticket inspector arrived and threw them out.",

Going up we find the floors above to have a very irregular surface, rising to hillocks, sinking into valleys, ascending in slopes, and being uncarpeted the face of the boards is shown to be eaten into innumerable vermiculations.

It is not ecstasy …I am not out of myself, but in myself. I am. That is the final grace accorded from the mountain.’ This was her version of Descartes’s cogito: I walk therefore I am. She celebrated the metaphysical rhythm of the pedestrian, the iamb of the ‘I am’, the beat of the placed and lifted foot.",

Burnet himself is not immune to the magnificence of Rome’s broken temples, and the gilded, weeping saints who fill the niches in the churches. But there is something up here, in what he will later describe as ‘these sonic mountainous parts’, amid the gargantuan rubble of the Alps, which to Burnet is infinitely more suggestive and overwhelming than Rome’s ruins. Even though his age demands that he find them hostile and repulsive, Burnet is unaccountably affected by the mountains. ‘There is something august and stately in the Air of these things,’ he wrote after the Simplon crossing, ‘that inspires the mind with great thoughts and passions … as all things have that are too big for our comprehension, they fill and overbear the mind with their Excess, and cast it into a pleasing kind of stupor and imagination.’",

Before we’d boarded the flight it had been muggy, bright and noisy. We’d been pushed and barged by other passengers, ushered onto buses and shuffled around by ground staff. Mid-air, we’d been looked after by stewards in smart navy uniforms, plying us with miniatures and tiny cans of Schweppes. But here we are on our own, left standing on the frosty tarmac in the middle of nowhere. There are a few people around, of course, but we don’t know any of them and they’re all speaking a language we don’t understand. The whole place glistens like it’s made from soda crystals, and the air is so cold and thin that it catches in the back of my throat when I attempt to fill my lungs.\n‘What now?’ I start, but the sound is muffled by snow. My ears already hurt from the chill so I cover them with my hair in lieu of a hat. This is surprisingly effective, though now I can hear even less. Lego Man’s lips are moving but I can’t quite make out what he’s saying, so we resort to hand signals.\n‘This way?’ he mouths, pointing to the white building up ahead. I give him an 80s high school movie-style thumbs up: ‘OK.’\nA woman with a wheelie bag appears from behind us and moves decisively towards a small rectangle of light up ahead, so we follow, crunching compacted snow as we go. There’s no shuttle bus or covered walkway here – Vikings, it seems, make their own way.\nMy husband squeezes my near-frozen hand and I try to smile, but because my teeth are chattering so much now, it comes out as more of a grimace. I knew it would be cold here, but this is something else. We’ve been exposed to the Baltic air for all of 90 seconds and the chill is gnawing at my very bones. My nose threatens to drip but then the tickling sensation stops and I lose all feeling in the tip. Oh God, does even snot freeze in Denmark? I wonder. I’m relieved to get inside to passport control and my toes and fingers burn with relief at the relative warmth.\nWe pass a giant sign advertising the country’s most famous beer that reads: ‘Welcome to the world’s happiest nation!’\nHuh, I think, we’ll see.\nWe know no one, we don’t speak Danish, and we have nowhere to live. The whole take-a-punt, ‘new year, new you’ euphoria has now been replaced by a sense of: ‘Oh shit, this is real’. The two-day hangover from extended farewell celebrations and our boozy leaving lunch probably isn’t helping either.",

Also, the new starter problem ended up being minor; the only cable that hadn’t been changed in Djibouti had a rusty connection and needed cleaning. We made several tours of the harbor to check out the stuffing box and it remained in its place. The epoxy that we had used in Dijibouti had done its job well and Varuna once again had a working engine. Then Olivier climbed the mast to check the lights and found several strands on the forestay broken; we replaced the stay with a spare and stowed the frayed one as a reserve. He also fortified Akka’s rigging and spreaders to prepare for the ferocious winds, while I borrowed Penny’s sewing machine and patched up our sails with old scraps of sailcloth.",

After a long, hot and dusty journey on unspeakably bad cross-country roads to Los Angeles, a town on the Panamerican, I followed the tarmac gratefully south to Temuco, where I deposited Rocky IV at Hertz as arranged and checked into a cheap hotel next to the market, a sprawling, vaguely threatening market lined with pyramids of melons, hung with dripping carcasses and exuding exotically dubious smells against a background of high-energy noise. I lingered for the mild hit of the spice rows and later acquainted myself with Temuco, a colourful town where most activities appeared to take place in the streets rather than inside buildings. I imagined that its inhabitants didn’t have much time for events in Santiago. Neruda said, ‘Temuco is a pioneer town, one of those towns that have no past, though it does have hardware shops.’",

The tide and wind helped, and early one afternoon the big white boat under a ragged sail shouldered its way before the sea breeze into Patusan Reach, manned by fourteen assorted scarecrows glaring hungrily ahead, and fingering the breech-blocks of cheap rifles. Brown calculated upon the terrifying surprise of his appearance. They sailed in with the last of the flood; the Rajah’s stockade gave no sign; the first houses on both sides of the stream seemed deserted. A few canoes were seen up the reach in full flight. Brown was astonished at the size of the place. A profound silence reigned. The wind dropped between the houses; two oars were got out and the boat held on up-stream, the idea being to effect a lodgement in the centre of the town before the inhabitants could think of resistance.",

The hill rises steeply from the Indus and, failing at first to find a track, I battled my way up through the cultivation terraces, scrambling over ditches and dykes, brushing my way through the narrow strip-fields. The terraces contained thick plantations of maize, wheat, and marijuana. After a difficult climb of an hour I came across a track, a holloway sunk between two dry stone walls, perhaps the very ‘stony path cut by the hands of man’ used by the Macedonians. It was clearly very ancient: it was cobbled with massive slabs of limestone and these had been worn completely smooth with the passage of feet. The track led a winding course up the hill, past line upon line of neatly kept terraces, giving off to other less substantial goat trails. It was exhausting work. The chill of the previous day had gone and the temperature had risen. The midday sun beat down through the rarified air, and I could feel the weakening effects of altitude. After another hour I was parched. I left the main track and wandered along a trail to a mud-walled enclosure.",

More than two million migrating birds used the soft shores of Britain and Ireland as resting points each autumn and winter. Maps could be drawn - had been drawn - showing their flight-paths. They looked not unlike the maps showing the flyways of different airlines. But instead of linking city to city and runway to runway, the bird-migration maps linked wild place to wild place: connected the marshes, mudflats and inland lakes of Britain and Ireland outwards into a wider web of wild places - the boreal forests of Scandinavia, the wide tundra of Siberia. The migrating birds did not shun humans; they were happy to live round them. What they did assess when choosing where to land, though, was wildness: how far the water and the land would allow them to follow their own instincts and fulfil their own needs. Where they could not do this, they did not land.",

After dinner, always eager to flout whatever rules are most pertinent, the crew builds a contraband fire on the beach exposed by drought, and drinks beers, crunching the empties against their knees. The crew leader disappears, unnoticed. Minutes later, a flash down the beach makes the guys look. There’s Brook, standing on the widest strip of sand with his back to the crew, feet planted wide, head tipped skyward, fists in the air. He’s at the center of a fiery anarchy symbol, flames knee-high before they shrink to a smoldering ring. A can of saw gas sits just beyond the perimeter. The crew watches Brook stand unmoving in his pose until the fire’s out, smoke rising from the beach. He drops his arms and stands still in the dark. In the morning, the anarchy symbol is black and ragged in the sand, as if it were traced with a huge crayon by a maniac. Which in a way, it was.",

It happened, and that’s all I know.”\n\n“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”\n\n“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly. “I wasn’t even trying.”\n\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\n\n“Do you want to commit suicide?”",

It is a common amusement with strangers to slide their horses down the steep incline, which produces a sound like subterranean thunder, which terrifies unaccustomed animals.

That was their home when Hurricane Flora came crashing toward them in 1963. It was a powerful storm, one of the deadliest ever. By the time Zenaida heard the warnings on her little transistor radio, the wind and rain were almost on top of them. The clinic needed her, so she snatched the girls, not yet seven, from the wooden cuartería and brought them to a friend who lived in a sturdy masonry house near the clinic. The girls watched from the open front door as she inched her way up the wind-blown street toward the clinic, grabbing a bougainvillea fence to keep from being blown off her feet. Frightened that she might never come back, they tried to comfort each other through the long night. As the sky churned with gray clouds and the stars disappeared, Cary sang a song that Mr. Pedrozo, her fourth-grade teacher, had taught the children in chorus: Ask the stars if at night they see me cry.",

The battle between snow and thaw was continuing in mid-air: the trees dripped on the garden-plots, where no vegetables would grow for the dripping, though they were planted year after year with that curious mechanical regularity of country people in the face of hopelessness; the moss which covered the once broad gravel terrace was swamped; and Grace stood irresolute. Then she thought of poor Grammer, and her dreams of the doctor running after her scalpel in hand, and the possibility of a case so curiously similar to South’s ending in the same way; thereupon she stepped out into the drizzle.",

Once or twice a day it would snow ? fat, fluffy snowflakes, like the ones you see in a Perry Como Christmas special ? but the rest of the time the sky was clear. Everyone told me it was perfect Northern Lights weather. ‘You should have been here just before Christmas ? ah, fabulous,’ they would say and then assure me that tonight would almost certainly be the night. ‘About eleven o’clock you go out.

He loved to give parties, to which geisha and Kabuki actors came in great numbers. Bosai habitually walked around his home naked, even when guests were present, and he definitely did not get on well with feudal lords. Once he was called to the Shogun’s palace for an interview with the chief minister, Lord Matsudaira Sadanobu. But Bosai was in the habit of buying his clothes second-hand, so the crests on his upper kimono did not match his lower kimono. Sadanobu dismissed him in disgust, and that was the end of Bosai’s official career.",

Absently, I scratch an itch on my leg that Agustino says might be scabies. And I think back to the beginning, when my onion layers cleaved to my bones. I remember those layers falling away like old skin, as the seasons turned and the months passed, as the jungle rose and fell, expanded and contracted, lived and died. I turn on my side. She’s a swollen, distorted shape puffing in a coffee-brown sea. The surrounding forest is a fairy crown. I feel naked. The sky is pulling me under. When I lie in bed at night, I think about this look that Wayra gives me now. When I stand in front of her, she gazes up at me. It’s not like when she’s curled in a ball. She doesn’t look small. She has filled out her body. She looks around at her jungle, and then she looks back at me. And she sees me.",

From then on, he made a dead set for me – and I didn’t mind. From the moment we walked into the airport it had become plain that if we were stranded here we were stranded here together. (It wasn’t like the time I lost my boy – the time my boy played the piano with that girl Reina in a little New England farmhouse near Bennington, and I realised at last I wasn’t wanted. Guy Lombardo was on the air playing Top Hat and Cheek to Cheek, and she taught him the melodies. The keys falling like leaves and her hands splayed over his as she showed him a black chord. I was a freshman then.)",

Handsome, well-dressed women bounded in and out. They were all tanned and rich-looking. On one of the corners was a bookstore with a magazine stand. I went in and looked around. At the magazine stand I picked up a Playboy and browsed through it. As one does. I was distressed to see that Playboy is now printed on that awful glossy paper that makes the pages stick together like wet paper towels. You can’t flick through it any more. You have to prise each page apart, like peeling paper off a stick of butter. Eventually I peeled my way to the main photo spread. It was of a naked paraplegic. I swear to God. She was sprawled – perhaps not the best choice of words in the context – in various poses on beds and divans, looking pert and indisputably attractive, but with satiny material draped artfully over her presumably withered legs. Now is it me, or does that seem just a little bit strange?",

Flush, tossing in uneasy sleep, dreamt that they were couched together under ferns and leaves in the darkness, in a vast forest; then the leaves were parted and he woke. It was dark; but he saw Wilson come stealthily into the room, and take the box from beneath the bed and quietly carry it outside. This was on Friday night, the 18th of September. All Saturday morning he lay as one lies who knows that at any moment now a handkerchief may drop, a low whistle may sound and the signal will be given for death or for life. He watched Miss Barrett dress herself. At a quarter to four the door opened and Wilson came in. Then the signal was given – Miss Barrett lifted him in her arms. She rose and walked to the door. For a moment they stood looking round the room. There was the sofa and by it Mr Browning’s armchair. There were the busts and the tables. The sun filtered through the ivy leaves and the blind with peasants walking blew gently out. All was as usual. All seemed to expect a million more such movements to come to them; but to Miss Barrett and Flush this was the last. Very quietly Miss Barrett shut the door.",

That’s when she realized that the order probably was coming from Fidel himself. There was to be a huge rally at the end of the month to demand the release of Elián González, the five-year-old Cuban boy who had been found by American fishermen three miles off the coast of Fort Lauderdale after the raft carrying his mother and others had sunk. His photograph was going to be printed on T-shirts that would be given out at a rally in front of the former U.S. embassy. It was a photograph Cary knew well, as did most Cubans, and it frightened her. It showed Elián in a multicolor-striped pullover, his cheeks pink, his hair black, and his eyes dark marbles. She had been at Puntex long enough to understand that printing the boy’s image in all those colors would require several passes through the presses. Getting them right would take time. And only two or three presses in the country were capable of printing that many colors.",

Sadly, I have to report that almost none of this awaited me. The parks were very fetching, but instead of opulent casinos and handsome kursaals, they offered a small bandstand occupied on occasional Sundays by brass bands of mixed talent dressed like bus conductors, and small wooden erections—if you will excuse the term in the context of the Lower Pleasure Gardens—bedecked with colored glass pots with a candle inside, which I was assured were sometimes lit on calm summer evenings and thus were transformed into glowing depictions of butterflies, fairies, and other magical visions guaranteed to provide hours of healthy nocturnal enjoyment. I couldn’t say because I never saw them lit, and in any case, a shortage of funds and the unconscionable tendency of youths to yank the pots from their frames and smash them at each other’s feet for purposes of amusement meant that the structures were soon dismantled and taken away.",
