He drinks from a wellspring of bitterness, and this nectar nourishes his sense of superiority. Standing on the cafeteria line, he asks if I have read “a book, written by some Jew, I think it must have been written by some Jew, that's what I think, some Jew—In God's Name, that's what I think it's called, about the death of Pope John Paul the First. Says he was murdered.” (This last sentence he utters in a stage whisper.) I agree to send this book to him; I have no intention whatsoever of doing so. His bigotry not having yet exhausted itself, Father V. moves on to politics. (The only thing that keeps me from committing suicide by falling onto the steam table is that he is speaking in English.) “In my hometown they had two good Irish boys fighting each other for mayor, so it went to some black boy—oops! I can't say black boy anymore,” he booms, “colored man.”",

Even in March of 1936, toward the close of that ignoble bit of brigandage which Italian euphemists of the moment were calling the Conquest of Ethiopia, it was still less than commonplace to fly from Nairobi to London. There were airfields along the way, but the terrain between them – or much of it, at least – had the same remote quality, the same barely plausible appearance as the surface of the moon through lenses. It differed from the moon in that it was so ominously accessible, and was similar in that its aspect was equally forbidding.",

Without these pulsating hearts, the sun would stop—the daily sunrise is not to be taken for granted. The sun needs the mighty Aztec Empire, just as the empire needs the sun.

The first time they came, Sergei assembled them around him and gave them a short lecture about the shame of begging compared to the honorability of work. Sergei offered them, instead of a handout, a decent amount of rubles if they would wash our car. The kids loved this idea and went immediately and found a whole slew of cut-off bottle bottoms and other vessels among the ambient trash and filled them at a public tap. Then they washed the car, every inch. In our stuff, Sergei found some rags for them to use for polishing. They polished like demons, climbing all over the van. When they had finished, Sergei examined the work, paid them, and complimented them highly on their job. They ran off, and in fifteen minutes were back begging again.",

We drove on, with white saltdust, and later red bulldust, pouring in through the open back window. We wrapped bandanas around mouths and noses, and were thankful we’d filled the “esky”—a cheap styrofoam cooler—with Crown Lager in Penong. Distances between outback towns are sometimes measured in “tinnies”—how many cans of beer it takes to traverse them. It was at least a dozen tinnies to the main road north, also dirt, which we met in a village called Kingoonya, where a tumbledown roadhouse offered the world’s most welcome steak burgers, served by Australia’s most beautiful waitress.",

Logically, I should have been glad, for there was nothing now to keep me in England; I could pack and go and leave behind the things that had so distressed me—the black-smeared pavements, the foggy air, the unfriendly faces of strangers. Yet the more I thought about it, the less I liked the idea. It had been weeks since I'd noticed the pavements, and somehow people did not seem unfriendly anymore. I had evolved a life that included Miss Stuart and her milk bottle, Julia's tea hour, even the black chimney pots outside my window, and it suited me. I simply could not face leaving the Reading Room. For the first time, I felt sympathy for those permanent undergraduates who are to be found in American universities, taking degrees in one subject after another, frantically looking for new courses until they are tottering around the campus. Indeed, I resolved to behave like them, and look for a subject that would keep me busy a while longer at the British Museum, at least until I came to the end of my money. After considering various possibilities, I selected the Royal Society of London for Promoting Natural Knowledge, an august body that, since it had received its charter from Charles II soon after the Restoration, was sure to have plenty of history. I would have a lot of fun reading about the Royal Society, I told myself, and nobody need know—nobody would care—if I was doing it for a practical purpose or not. I started on it at once.",

In the course of its rantings, the Independent libeled a lawyer named Aaron Sapiro by claiming that he was part of “a band of Jew bankers, lawyers, advertising agencies and produce buyers” who had cheated American farmers as part of a conspiracy to take control of the American wheat market. Sapiro sued for defamation, demanding $1 million in damages. The case would cast a shadow over Ford for much of the first half of the year.",

We visited the harrowing Tuol Sleng genocide museum, site of a Khmer Rouge prison and torture centre, and the nearby Killing Fields museum at Choeung Ek. The latter is the site of one of many mass graves which have been identified throughout Cambodia, dating from the bloody revolution of 1975. The museum houses a Buddhist stupa containing five thousand human skulls found at the site, many clearly showing damage from blunt force blows which led to the victim's death. Wandering the lightly wooded former orchard with a guide, I noticed something lying in the scrubby grass and bent to retrieve it. Holding it up, I realised what it was.",

A broader view reveals that there are in fact no features on the entire landscape, nothing to be seen this side of the horizon in every direction, that does not show some sign of pre-Columbian occupation: the slight shadows in the ground of earthworks, house sites, and ancient fields, the potsherds and obsidian flakes readily found in the wake of virtually every footstep.",

The moon shot down a shaft that caught the bronze gilt on George’s harlequin head and made a sort of bronze gilt sort of upsticking clown’s cap of it. His head above her, wore, now she saw it, a sort of peaked pear-shaped cap like a Phrygian, like Paris and the apple. His hair taking on strange semblance made a clown of him, made a fool of him, made him Paris with the apple. The moon made one solid block of silver and she lifted a hand, surprised to see it quietly pass through this molten metal, this heavy gauze of silver that, it seemed, must give out ripping tearing noises as her hand passed through it. She lifted her hand again. The gauze permitted her hand to pass through it. Just above her wrist, above her hand the gauze looked heavier. She flung her arm suddenly at full length upward . . . zzzz . . . Oh God it’s something tearing.",

Coronation Street, I should perhaps explain, is a long-running TV soap opera, adored by anyone with any sense, that depicts life on a typical working-class street of brick terrace houses somewhere in greater Manchester. These streets used to exist in abundance, I’m told, but now you could walk miles without seeing a single brick terrace anywhere, thanks to the city’s tireless efforts at urban renewal. But that doesn’t matter because you can always go and see the real Coronation Street on the Granada Studios Tour, which was what I did now. Granada, one of the main independent television networks, borrowed the idea from Universal Studios in Hollywood of turning itself into a tourist attraction, and I had been wanting for years to see it because, frankly, it seemed a ridiculous notion.",

In the antechamber to his living room, after you’ve been checked by a Tibetan guard and then an Indian one, you sit under a certificate of Honorary Citizenship from Orange County, an award from the Rotary Club of Dharamsala, and a plaque commemorating an honorary professorship from Kalmyk State University. Ceremonial masks, Hindu deities, and pietàs shine down on you. On one wall is a huge, blown-up photo of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, showing that the palace where the Dalai Lama once lived is now ringed by discos, brothels, and a new Chinese prison, with high-rises dwarfing the old Tibetan houses.",

They are located in a quiet neighbourhood just off the south-eastern corner of the palace walls. The streets here are peaceful and pleasantly dusty. A few people on bicycles glide along beneath the shade of tamarind trees, and the occasional car or pick-up truck grinds its way over the bumpy tarmac. A handful of old British houses survive here, lived in by today’s government officials. The buildings are chunky structures made of cream-coloured cement and wooden beams, their lawns cluttered with banana trees and makeshift shacks. The Police Training School—a long row of airy red-brick buildings with whitewashed colonnades—is still used to house policemen. They overlook the old parade grounds, today busy with police fitness drills and impromptu football games. At the intersections of the grid-plan streets there are fresh-water wells, green with moss, where the policemen bathe with their longyi tied slick around their waists.",
