The climate repelled; the cold, the snow, the frozen rivers. I didn’t believe in a Russian summer. Obviously that dappled sunlight through birch trees, those butterflies were a figment of literary imagination. Summer in England is largely imaginary; Russia had to be ten times worse. I was quite content to know the Russia of their great writers and the impetuous broody characters in their books.",

This was an easy day’s walking, through tranquil beauty. Sometimes the track undulated between rustling bamboo – the tallest I had seen, rising to seventy or eighty feet. Then I was overlooking wide shallow valleys where small patches of paddy glowed golden amidst tangled subtropical vegetation. Hereabouts the butterflies seemed larger, more numerous and more gorgeously coloured than anywhere else in Laos – perhaps because of a particular local plant. During a long, gradual descent to a more arid area of low scrub and blue-bush I put up two pheasants. For the last hour I was crossing level paddyland – the peaks ahead familiar, surrounding Kasi.",

Jock and Jock would be lightning succeeding lightning in angular bright pattern. Jock must have leapt through the window. I told Mandy she should close it. The broom, it must be the broom, went thud and Jock the other side of the slammed-to screen door said ouch-ouch dramatically. Mandy shouldn’t hit Jock that way. It’s so insulting to him.",

The first were held on November 7, 1919?the second anniversary of the Russian Revolution?and mostly involved federal agents and police in twelve cities storming selected clubs and cafes, smashing furniture, and arresting everyone in sight. In New York, police raided the Union of Russian Workers, beating anyone who protested or even questioned what they were doing. The union was merely a social club, where members could go to play chess or take classes to improve their English; it had never had any connection to radical affairs. In Hartford, Connecticut, police arrested a large number of suspects?the exact number is uncertain?then arrested anyone who came to ask after them. In Detroit, an entire orchestra and all the patrons of a particular restaurant were among eight hundred detainees who were held for up to a week in a windowless corridor without adequate water, toilets, or space to lie down. Eventually all were released without charge.",

He shared his liking of granite with one of his heroes, Goethe, to whose writing he had been introduced when studying at Oxford in the mid-1930s under Walter Ettinghausen, who later went on to found the Israeli Foreign Service. As a young man, Goethe wrote an essay entitled ‘Über der Granit’: an essay on (über, ‘concerning’) the subject of granite, but also an essay about literally being on (über, ‘over’) granite. Granite – that igneous rock of upsurges and plugs – satisfied Goethe for its connection to the earth’s hot core. Shepherd valued granite for similar reasons. One October night she slept out on the granite of the plateau in air that was as ‘bland as silk’, and while half asleep felt herself become stone-like, ‘rooted …in …immobility’. On a hot summer day she lay down and sensed under her ‘the central core of fire from which was thrust this grumbling grinding mass of plutonic rock, over me blue air, and between the fire of the rock and the fire of the sun, scree, soil and water, moss, grass, flower and tree, insect, bird and beast, wind, rain and snow – the total mountain’.",

At first they did not know her in the dress of the sisterhood which she wore; but she smiled joyfully, almost gaily on seeing them, and though she hurried by with the sister who accompanied her, and did not stay to speak, they felt that the peace that passeth understanding had looked at them from her eyes.\n“Well, she is at rest, there can’t be any doubt of that,” he said as he glanced round at the drifting black robe which followed her free, nunlike walk.\n“Yes, now she can do all the good she likes,” sighed his wife. “I wonder—I wonder if she ever told his father about her talk with poor Conrad that day he was shot?”\n“I don’t know. I don’t care. In any event if would be right. She did nothing wrong. If she unwittingly sent him to his death, she sent him to die for God’s sake, for man’s sake.”\n“Yes—yes. But still ”\n“Well, we must trust that look of hers.”",

But he had revealed, through Aziz, that he shared Aziz’s disability; he too had been advised not to walk and he too required a pony for himself. Then he had sent word from the kitchen, through Aziz again, that he required a new pair of shoes for the journey. I couldn’t afford him. I decided, too, that the coolie was unnecessary; and the sweeper was to be replaced by a small spade.",

Just under the river’s surface, tall, freshwater grasses reached up toward the sun; they swayed gently in the current, like leaves on a tree. Gin Tonic continued his tour.

The Basilica of San Fidele, begun in 914, was much the more ancient, but the domed cathedral, 500 years younger, was larger and more splendid ? indeed, more splendid than any provincial church I had seen since Aachen. It was dark and I had to stand for a minute to adjust to the dimness for fear of walking into a pillar. Morning sunlight flowed through a lofty stained-glass window, but was swallowed almost immediately by the gloom among the high arches. The church was not only surprisingly large for its community, but richly endowed ? it was full of subtle tapestries and ancient paintings and some striking statuary, including a Christ figure that is said to weep. (They must show it a Jimmy Tarbuck video beforehand.) I spent an hour sitting out of the way, gazing at the interior and watching people lighting candles. Very restful. This done, I felt content to return to the station and climb aboard the first train to Switzerland.",

His planes were among the first in the world to use air-cooled engines, to enclose the cockpit (for aerodynamic purposes, not the comfort of the occupants), and to incorporate streamlining into every possible aspect of the plane’s exterior design. A strut on a Bellanca plane didn’t just hold up the wing; it added lift or, at the very least, minimized drag. In consequence, Bellanca’s plane was probably, for its size, the best in the world.",

This was Varuna’s most glorious point of sail; with the wind at her back, her jib poled out on one side and her main let all the way out on the other, she went her fastest and the motion was the most comfortable. Because this was the beginning of hurricane season, I began to steer a course that skirted south of their stomping grounds toward the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. The first night, I sat in the cockpit and watched the glimmer of Puerto Rico, St. John and St. Croix disappear under the inky horizon. With the sails and Monitor set, I stretched out under the stars and enjoyed our speed. We were making 6 knots, sometimes 10, as we surfed down the waves. In the first twenty-four hours, Varuna logged 129 miles into the 1,056 miles to go. “Wow,” I thought, “at this speed, I’ll be in Panama in no time flat.”",

Having seen no bohio since noon I walked too far, hoping to reach one, then had to make my bed across a precipitous path where the law of gravity precluded sound sleep. My own fault: stupidly I had climbed out of a ravine where I could have slept soundly on the stream’s level bank. Then the sun set and I dared not descend in darkness. However, the night noises almost made up for my perpetual motion. By day only bird calls break the silence, by night one becomes aware of a bustling population – croaks, hisses, grunts, wauls, squeaks, whines (some insect other than mosquitoes) and much rustling through the dead leaves. Of course nothing alarming: Cuba’s fauna is benign, the ants and mosquitoes merely tiresome.",

It ripened into a splendid joyous day, which redeemed the sweeping uplands of Hamakua from the dreariness which I had thought belonged to them. There was a fresh sea-breeze, and the sun, though unclouded, was not too hot.

It was a holiday settlement of unpainted wooden huts about a small green meadow set in the mountains some three thousand feet above the Valley. On one side the meadow fell away to the Valley through pine forests; on the other it was bounded by higher mountains in the interstices of which, even in August, snow lay in brown drifts. We arrived in rain. At the bungalow of the friends with whom we were going to stay Aziz was at once sent off to the servants’ quarters, and we saw him again only when the rain was over. He was walking back down the muddy road from such centre as the settlement had. His gait was made unusual by the weight of Mr Butt’s shoes. (Mr Butt later reported, almost with emotion, that Aziz had ruined his shoes on this visit.) His smile and greeting were of pure friendliness. ‘How you liking Gulmarg, sir?’",

    "target_paragraph": "The olives make scanty shade: they are too ferociously pruned hereabouts. The whole of the southern incline is planted with them wherever a little soil can be scraped together, and their oil is excellent - better, says Pliny, than that of Venafrum - probably because the inhabitants know the secret of preparing it. As soon as it is plucked, the fruit must be pressed in those picturesque rustic mills where, by the dim light of a lantern - the work is nearly always done at night - half-naked, Praxitelean shapes of men and boys may be discerned turning the heavy stone wheel which crushes the berry to a clammy pulp. Alas, these trees are now remorselessly uprooted wherever the soil will feed the more profitable grape; Capri has lost half its olives, Ischia all: a consummation to be deplored since the vine, however gladsome in its summer greenery, is bare for six months in the year when its straggling limbs have a peculiarly unkempt and disreputable appearance. Were the landscape alone to be considered, I could wish that some new scourge like phylloxera might be introduced, for there is enough wine in the country already. At this moment it is being sold for three francs a barrel (forty-four litres) on Ischia, whereas the oil-crop has failed altogether; there has been no rain, the grub has invaded the fruit, and the preceding winter was too mild (the olive likes a good shiver once a year). These trees are small in size, mere pigmies beside the writhing monsters of Spain and Greece and Apulia; their upper limbs are stretched in a nervous tension which is the despair of artists, but in those tumid roots there sits - to all appearances - a deep repose. Yet who can tell what passionate alchemy is astir in that subterranean laboratory, sustaining life and fashioning fruit through those scorching summer months, among stones that are often too hot to handle?",

Oh, what are you talk-ing about?’ – and he would stump away again, absorbed mysteriously with his own affairs. And sometimes, if he was the victim of conspiracy in the universe – if God had forsaken him and man had tricked and cheated him, he would roll upon the floor, hammer his heels against the wall, and howl his curses at oblivious heaven.",

Three of them stand outside the village, each surrounded by its fortress wall, which usually encloses one or two small living-rooms besides the church. They reminded me forcibly of the walled Coptic monasteries of Egypt, but the monastic buildings were smaller. Between them stretched fields of barley wherein the villagers, standing in line, were pulling up the crops to the strains of the bagpipes. The churches were oriented almost at haphazard, and provided with the smallest doors, and windows to correspond. The interiors were so dark that I abandoned all hope of photographing the ornaments upon the inner doors,[158] though I made a rapid sketch of the lintel over the sanctuary door of Mar Shim’un (Fig. 175). Above it was a slab bearing a floral Persian pattern incised upon the stone. Inside the town several of the churches had recently been repaired, or were in process of reparation. A young priest, Kas Yusef, showed me the work, and gloried in the replacing of old and ruined churches by new and brand-new edifices. New lamps for old, but it was the old lamp that could summon the genius, and I realized the sound moral of the fairy story as I watched the refurbishing of ancient walls at ?ara?osh; but I did not impart my impression to the Syrian priest, whose ardour it would have been unkind to damp. The Syrians have annexed most of the larger churches, so said the worthy Jacobite father who brought me the key of Mar Shim’un, and he told his tale not without a touch of bitterness. Yet it would have been folly to blink the fact that he was no match for Kas Yusef, who was young and eager, and had been trained in a French school at Mo?ul. Twenty minutes beyond ?ara?osh we came to the ruined church of Mar Yuhanna Deleimoyya (St. John the Deleimi), which no one has troubled to repair, though it had beautiful carved lintels and domes adorned with plasterwork. Thence we rode for an hour through cornlands to Bartalla, and saw Ba’ashika at the foot of the hills. They were real hills which lay before us, not the bare desert ridges which were all the heights we had seen since we crossed over Lebanon on the way to Aleppo. Here were the buttresses of mightier ranges than Lebanon, the alps of Kurdistan which end the land of the two rivers. As we climbed upwards, the corn grew greener, the grass deeper, the flowers more brilliant along the edge of trickling streams. But my companions paid no heed to these marvels. Jusef’s thoughts were busy with the great cities he had seen since he set forth on his travels, and especially with Mo?ul, last and therefore fairest in his memory. He rehearsed its advantages to the Mo?ul zaptieh, and ’Abdullah was well pleased to listen to such talk.",

Juliet’s patience and thoughtfulness were monumental. She tolerated the nauseating clouds of cigarette smoke with which I filled our little bedroom and the piles of reference books and sheaves of manuscript that wandered all over our cramped floor space, apparently of their own volition. She never interrupted when I was writing and I soon acquired the knack of not hearing her transistor. Inevitably I felt the strain of never being alone, yet by the end of our four months together Juliet and I had developed a sincere mutual affection.",

Computers are playing up or being fed the wrong diet. (Everyone is astonished to hear that the Irish run all their elections with flawless efficiency sans computers.) Ballot papers beyond reckoning have not been delivered to the 800 counting centres because their armed escorts failed to turn up. Accusations and denials of intimidation, muddle, rigging and conspiracy are flying in every direction. Here we wonder who secreted 900,000 ballot papers in a merchant’s warehouse near Cape Town’s airport on the 26th? On discovering the contents of the boxes the merchant called the police, then received an anonymous death-threat. Allegedly the boxes were moved to a security company’s store but no one knows what happened next. Does their fate explain the Khayelitsha crisis? A flustered IEC spokeswoman explained, ‘We are now reorganizing the distribution of ballot papers. Serious misplacement [sic] has taken place and we are asking the police to investigate.’",

Gradually, rooms are set up, still spare but basically furnished. I’ve brought over white bedspreads for the twin beds. We take a morning in Arezzo and buy a few lamps from a place that still makes the traditional majolica vases of the area into lamps. A fabulous feeling—things are shaping up, they’re done, it’s clean, we’ll be warm in winter—we’ve done it! This feels giddy and fuels us to keep going.",

She moved beautifully and seemed actually to enjoy her outing. Rachel is sure that she missed us when left alone all day in her big field – which may be true. Mules are half donkeys and sociable in proportion. Foro then announced that she should be ready for shoeing on the 25th and 150 soles bought us a set of shoes from our hotel proprietor; hot shoeing is unknown here.",

I was bringing him back from the miller’s with a ton of grain on his back and he’d already fallen ten times because he was stumble-footed, the dirty pig. . . . So I beat him over the head. . . .” “La Bona Famija,” The Good Family, maintains a breathless delicacy in describing a poor family’s usual evening meal, in a mood never quite of gaiety nor of resignation, nor of complaint. There are little street dramas, and charming anecdotes of the wonders of the world, in one of which a man tells of having heard about beavers for the first time, touching also on a basic matter of Roman pride: “If he’d called them masons, all right, but architects!. . .”",
