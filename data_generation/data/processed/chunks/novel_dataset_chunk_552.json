The wind rustled the leaves of the guava tree. Its bark fascinated Olanna, the way it was discolored and patchy, a light clay alternating with a darker slate, much like the skin of village children with the nlacha skin disease. Many of those children had stopped by to say “nno nu, welcome,” on the day they arrived from Nsukka, and their parents and uncles and aunts had come too, bearing good wishes, itching for gossip about the evacuation. Olanna had felt a fondness for them; their welcome made her feel protected. Her warmth had extended even to Odenigbo’s mother. She wondered now why she did not pull Baby away from the grandmother who had rejected her at birth and why she herself did not move away from Mama’s hug. But there was a haunting, half-finished quality to all that happened that day?cooking in the kitchen with Ugwu, the departure so hasty that she worried the oven was left on, the crowds on the road, the sound of shelling?so she took Mama’s hug in her stride, even hugged her back. Now they had gone back to being civil, Mama often came over to see Baby, through the wooden gate in the mud wall that separated her home from Odenigbo’s. Sometimes Baby went across to visit her and run after the goats that wandered in her courtyard. Olanna was never sure how clean were the pieces of dried fish or smoked meat Baby came back chewing, but she tried not to mind, just as she tried to stifle her resentment; Mama’s affection for Baby had always been half-baked, halfhearted, and it was too late for Olanna to feel anything but resentment.",

I was about to turn back when I noticed a sign pointing the way to something called the Meridianstøtten and decided to investigate. This took me down a lane on the seaward side of the headland. Here, wholly exposed to the pounding sea, the wind was even more ferocious. Twice it all but picked me up and carried me forward several yards. Only the toetips of my boots maintained contact with the ground. I discovered that by holding out my arms I could sail along on the flats of my feet, propelled entirely by the wind. It was the most wonderful fun. Irish windsurfing, I dubbed it. I had a great time until an unexpected burst whipped my feet from under me. I cracked my head on the ice so hard that I suddenly recalled where I put the coal-shed key the summer before. The pain of it, and the thought that another gust might heft me into the sea like the cardboard box I had seen earlier, made me abandon the sport, and I proceeded to the Meridianstøtten with prudence.",

No, of course, it wasn’t snow – it was birds. Gannets, thousands of white gannets and their white guano and their white feathers, on every ledge of every cliff, and the air above the boat filled with flying gannets: their stout nicotine-yellow necks, their stiff-winged glides. Between the gannets, fulmars and kittiwakes were cutting the sky up in arcs and curves, leaving – to my night eyes – trails of light like the traces on an overexposed photograph. I looked up at the sky of birds, feeling vertiginous, unstable. Lines from one of Ian’s poems came into my head: ‘Wheeling flights / would drag you sky-high / if your wide feet failed / to suck the deck.’",

He then telephoned to the stables for his hansom, and dressed to go out.

A face looked astonished at Her. “Then you’re—you’re—better!” “Oh, I’m all right.” A feeble voice came from a hollow but it left no runnels as of a red-hot iron on a hollow ice tube. There were no runnels where her throat was. “But don’t put your arm out of the blanket,” and someone was reading to Her, “So sorry not to see you. They wouldn’t let me come in. Lillian.” Then the voice explained disapprovingly that there was another card but it was too difficult to make out that scraggy writing and Her said “I must see it.”",

The air was softly cool, so that people who had been sitting talking in a crowd found it pleasant to walk a little before deciding to stop an omnibus or encounter light again in an underground railway. Sandys, who was a barrister with a philosophic tendency, took out his pipe, lit it, murmured ‘hum’ and ‘ha’, and was silent. The couple in front of them kept their distance accurately, and appeared, so far as Denham could judge by the way they turned towards each other, to be talking very constantly. He observed that when a pedestrian going the opposite way forced them to part they came together again directly afterwards. Without intending to watch them he never quite lost sight of the yellow scarf twisted round Katharine’s head, or the light overcoat which made Rodney look fashionable among the crowd. At the Strand* he supposed that they would separate, but instead they crossed the road, and took their way down one of the narrow passages which lead through ancient courts to the river. Among the crowd of people in the big thoroughfares Rodney seemed merely to be lending Katharine his escort, but now, when passengers were rare and the footsteps of the couple were distinctly heard in the silence, Denham could not help picturing to himself some change in their conversation. The effect of the light and shadow, which seemed to increase their height, was to make them mysterious and significant, so that Denham had no feeling of irritation with Katharine, but rather a half-dreamy acquiescence in the course of the world. Yes, she did very well to dream about—but Sandys had suddenly begun to talk. He was a solitary man who had made his friends at college and always addressed them as if they were still undergraduates arguing in his room, though many months or even years had passed in some cases between the last sentence and the present one. The method was a little singular, but very restful, for it seemed to ignore completely all accidents of human life, and to span very deep abysses with a few simple words.",

I feel a strong weakness.\nLenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.\nThe professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across Stephen’s and Mr O’Madden Burke’s loose ties.\n—Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.\n—Like fellows who had blown up the bastille, J. J. O’Molloy said in quiet mockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you? You look as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff.",

Yet light was coming; and when at daybreak we reached Beirut it was like arriving, after a magical journey, with all its attendant torment, in a fresh, glittering world. Rain had fallen; the tarmac was glazed and cool. Beyond it was a city which one knew to be a city, full of men as whole as these who, in airport dungarees, now wheeled gangways and drove up in electric lorries to unload luggage: labourers, menials, yet arrogant in their gait, their big bodies and their skills.

It's a shock to see a Benny Burger on the Viale di Trastevere; the Roman youngbloods on Vespas and on foot who frequent it look pleased with themselves and defiant (and Benny Burger as a consequence has a rakish, speakeasy air), which suggests that they are doing something naughty, as perhaps they are. . . . But no one is so beautiful, taking his ease, as a Roman; and at night, on the viale, it is lively and gay, and Rome is not “spoiled,” only minimally altered, immensely lovable, pleasing not in every part but steadfastly beautiful as a whole. It remains in its essentials unalterable.",

I don’t know what time it is, probably not much later than seven. The dorm holds three bunks, six beds in all, with just one tiny window at the back. There’s stuff everywhere: rucksacks, shoes, old boots, ropes between the beds acting as washing lines. Wet clothes draped along them, giving the impression of a mouldy, damp cave. I inspect an empty top bunk and find that the mattress is hay, hard and unforgiving, sheathed in plastic. Well, that’s not going to be sweaty at all, I think with a desperate laugh. There’s no sheet but there is a mosquito net that even with a cursory glance reveals rips and bloodstains. The implications of this are too horrific. I launch myself up fully clothed. Then, even though it’s too early and I’m so hot I could puke and I haven’t brushed my teeth, I just pull my sleeping bag over my head, close my eyes and pray that no one—and no thing—notices me.",

The membrane current showed pronounced fluctuations. It is agreed that this is among the most beautiful experiments in the field of optics.",

The revolutionary became a god and his message was thereby lost. He failed to communicate to India his way of direct looking. And strange: in twelve months I could find no one among his ordinary worshippers who could tell me exactly what he looked like. It was not a question to put to Indians, who have no descriptive gift, but the replies were astonishing. For some he was tiny; for one man in Madras he was six feet tall. For some he was dark; for some he was exceedingly fair. Yet all remembered him; many even had personal photographs. These did not help: the image was too familiar. So it is when legends are complete. Nothing can add to them or take away from them. The image is fixed, simplified, unalterable; witness is of no account. Nearly every word Gandhi spoke and wrote is recorded; the Gandhi bibliography is immense. But in India he has already receded; he might have lived in the days when scribes wrote on leaves and strips of brass and people travelled on foot.",

Progress was even slower than the time before, because my legs were exhausted and I weighed almost twice as much as I had before.

And then the impenetrable dust shut down and the fierce stabbing needle of the machine guns sewed the mighty jumble of sounds together. A glimpse through a rift in the cloud torn by a sudden hot gust of wind—we could see the first brown line of men reeling altogether like drunkards, and the machine guns over the wall spitting sharp, dull red in the sunshine. Then a man came running back out of it, the sweat streaming down his face, without a gun. He ran fast, half sliding, half falling, down into our ditch and up the other side. Other dim forms loomed up in the dust ahead.",

The fish is another of these phallic symbols that go back into hoariest antiquity; its Italian name has a very different colloquial signification–in this province only–from that which the piety of early Christians drew out of those mystic characters. And in the now removed flooring of the church at Positano was a large marble phallus–women knelt on it and maintained that prayers thus offered up were of peculiar efficacity. I might mention also the shape of amulets and, in certain localities, that of bread as baked at Easter-time, the procreative festival of spring; the “sexes” attributed to domestic objects like hinges, screws, bolts, mortars, hooks and eyes, etc.–indeed a volume could be written, though perhaps not published, on the subject.",

The shop windows were filled with a boggling array of plastic phalluses, vibrators, whips, video tapes, unguents, magazines, leatherwear and other exotica not to be found in your average Woolworth’s.
