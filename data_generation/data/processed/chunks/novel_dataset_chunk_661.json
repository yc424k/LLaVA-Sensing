Here he was standing one windy afternoon when Dumover church clock struck five. While the gusts were bringing the notes to his ears across the damp intervening flat a man passed behind him and greeted Henchard by name. Henchard turned slightly and saw that the comer was Jopp, his old foreman, now employed elsewhere, to whom, though he hated him, he had gone for lodgings because Jopp was the one man in Casterbridge whose observation and opinion the fallen corn-merchant despised to the point of indifference.",

She was taunting her friends, reminding them of the past they shared, the sublimation to expectations none of them could have escaped. “¡Ordene!” (At your command!) “Here, no one surrenders!”",

As yet the stadium was scarcely half-full. We sat low down, close to the ramp entrance through which the hearse would arrive, behind an enormous stage where frowning, shouting men were frantically struggling with miles of tangled electric flexes.

There was no question which island it was, because they could also now see Wrangel Island, more than ten times the size, looming up from the southern horizon. For the next few hours, Chafe and the two Eskimo men took turns scanning the rough, nearly vertical shoreline of Herald Island, trying to locate any sign of first mate Sandy Anderson and his lost advance shore party. “With the aid of our powerful glasses,” Chafe recorded in his journal, “we were able to see any little object on the land, but could see no moving objects or anything to indicate that the mate or any of his party were or had been on the island.” They strained their eyes but saw nothing: No sled, no piles of gear, no tent. No people.",

What was it like for those unsuspecting tourists, as they followed their guides through the ruins? What did they hear? I knew the answer; I had read the witness statements. They heard blood-curdling screams, crying, and gun shots. What did they see? They saw their friends, spouses, and children shot in the head; some were later beheaded, others slashed and disemboweled. There were pools of blood on the ground, and human flesh plastered the walls. If it happened again, during our visit, where would we run? The attackers approached from the ground level, and raced up the ramps to the upper terraces. I suppose it was instinct that encouraged most of the victims that day to run away from the attackers, toward the rear of the Middle Court. They found no exit there, and no refuge. I wanted to ask Mohamed about the attacks. I wondered if he were there that day. I wondered what he would have done if he were.",

    "target_paragraph": "THE READER WILL notice too that this book is patterned less like a conventional travel diary than a series of essays. Each chapter, moreover, is structured to reflect not a physical but a mental itinerary—it follows, that is, not the chronological sequence of my movements so much as the twists and turns of my thoughts as I tried to make sense of the places I saw. Occasionally, of course—as when I visited a country just once—the two coincide. But in most cases, I revisited a place in different seasons and different moods—sometimes as many as six times—and spaced out my trips in order to give both the countries and myself a chance to change. In addition to my experiences, I therefore include all the other factors that guide one’s feelings for a place—one’s expectations before arriving, one’s thoughts while leaving and, most important, one’s reflections in all those stray hours at home when a place comes back from afar and one tries and tries to puzzle it out. The final destination of any journey is not, after all, the last item on the agenda, but rather some understanding, however simple or provisional, of what one has seen.",

To prove it he pulled out his gun and said to Alberto: ‘Look, cheee, stand 20 meters away with a cigarette in your mouth and if I can’t light it with the first bullet, I’ll give you 50 soles.’ Alberto doesn’t like money that much and he wasn’t about to move from his chair, at least not for 50 soles. ‘Come on, cheee, I’ll make it 100.’ Alberto didn’t move a muscle.",

They work only in the dark, making their way to the very end of the jetty, where a strong north wind always blows. They fish with kites, crafted of plastic and small bits of wood, that rise in the wind and carry their long lines, rigged with perhaps a dozen hooks, along with plastic bottles as floats, far out into the darkness. Illuminated by the glow of their headlamps, they clamber over the rocks, working their lines, even as the waves crash upon the rocks, sending great cascades of spindrift and salt water across the jetty. Silhouetted against the night sky, they appear truly heroic—defiant, independent, and free.",

The horrible average ordinariness of it all, something utterly without flower or soul or transcendence, the horrible vigorous ordinariness, is too much.",

Clouds were passing slowly across the moon, and I waited for them to pass to see him more clearly. He never moved. And when the light did fall on him it fell on a well-clothed back with two shining buttons on it,—not the back of a burglar, and surely not the back of a ghost.

I remembered my grandfather telling me how, growing up in Switzerland, he had once managed to gain access to the mysterious Val de Susanfe, a sanctuary valley locked behind the Dents du Midi. Entry to the valley involved climbing to a high rocky ledge above a waterfall. The ledge appeared to terminate in thin air, but in fact led to another, broader ledge, and from there to the valley itself. ‘This secret way,’ he said, ‘was the door to a magical place,’ where edelweiss and aster grew in profusion.",

    "target_paragraph": "As he traveled up the Magdalena in 1801, Alexander von Humboldt described the complex choreography. With the depth and volume of water, it was rarely possible for the bogas to make contact with the actual bed of the river. Thus, the massive champanes, some capable of carrying 120 bales of cargo, each with a weight of 250 pounds, had to cling to the shores, allowing the men purchase and leverage for their poles: roots and tree trunks, gravel banks and mudflats. As a helmsman steered the flat-bottomed vessel from the stern, the pilot orchestrated the movement of the men. In the bow, beyond the protective awning, the six bogas, all naked save for loincloths, each wielded a two-pronged pole three times the height of a man. As three of them moved toward the awning, pressing their poles against their chests, the other three walked toward the front of the vessel, with arms uplifted, holding their poles horizontally above the heads of those engaged. Three of the bogas reached the bow precisely as the other half of the team came to the awning. At that instant, be it day or night, those at the bow dropped their poles into the water, while those at the awning swung theirs up in the air. The result was a continuous motion, a constant momentum such that the champán never had a chance to slip back downstream. The work demanded what Humboldt called “Herculean strength,” but muscle power alone was not enough. The bodies of the men, callused and scarred across the nipples and chest from the constant friction of the poles, had to move in rhythm, with the precision of a well-drilled military unit. Humboldt saw it as a form of dance, a perfect balance of power and grace.",

At intermission I was on a staircase and I happened to look down at the crowd milling in the second-floor lobby, and I noticed six or eight little girls here and there trying out ballet steps for one another and for small knots of grown-ups looking on. During the last act when the stage lights were bright and spilling out into the audience, I observed the audience’s faces and they all were pointed intently at the stage, each with the devout, rapt, out-of-body expression of somebody watching the enactment of a deeply remembered dream.",

There had been bear then. A man shot a doe or a fawn as quickly as he did a buck, and in the afternoons they shot wild turkey with pistols to test their stalking skill and marksmanship, feeding all but the breast to the dogs. But that time was gone now. Now they went in cars, driving faster and faster each year because the roads were better and they had farther and farther to drive, the territory in which game still existed drawing yearly inward as his life was drawing inward, until now he was the last of those who had once made the journey in wagons without feeling it and now those who accompanied him were the sons and even grandsons of the men who had ridden for twenty-four hours in the rain or sleet behind the steaming mules. They called him ‘Uncle Ike’ now, and he no longer told anyone how near eighty he actually was because he knew as well as they did that he no longer had any business making such expeditions, even by car.",

The narrow winding path, sometimes barely wide enough for a single vehicle to scrape along it, threaded its way through plots of tomatoes, across three fine old rough stone bridges, past village shops whose little windows were full of plastic model construction kits, and later, as it came down into the lower valleys, through a gorge of towering limestone cliffs that spread a canopy like dusk across it. There were limestone quarries in the outskirts of the small city of Niimi, and by the time I had emerged onto Highway 180 and trudged the last hour or so along it into the city, I found that I had covered forty-three kilometers – the longest single day of the trip.",

Harry screams “actiooon” and six actors dressed as cops begin to beat the star with floppy foam lathis, thin wooden bats similar to billy clubs. Over and over and over again. Shots are taken from every conceivable angle while Ajay grimaces, flinches and slowly twists to look resolutely, righteously and revengefully at the tracking camera. Like most Indian industries, it’s labor intensive. Four men lift the cameras, five push the shooter chair and three shoot. Two makeup artists apply pancake and redraw police mustaches, ten men move heavy smoking lights, eight sit up in the ceiling watching and four turn on the portable air-conditioners as soon as Harry says “cut” and off when he says “ready.” There’s one man who turns on the smoke machine, two who flap the steam across the set and about twenty who make chai. The only woman on the set takes notes for continuity. The black background screen is scratched with “I love Azma,” the lights are antique and an old-fashioned electronic box of sizzling sockets looks frayed and flammable. I retreat nervously outside, where I’m approached by a slimy man with bad acne scars.",

Already panting by the time we reach switchback number one, we briefly consider going back to the hotel, but the promise of a sunset view propels us forward. Whoever maintains the trail must know that we need motivational assistance, too, because the signs posted at the switchbacks each bear a different encouraging message, reminding us to “keep calm” or that “you can do it!” (Can we, though? I wonder.)",

I knew that there were feral camels aplenty in this country. They had been imported in the 1850s along with their Afghani and North Indian owners, to open up the inaccessible areas, to transport food, and to help build the telegraph system and railways that would eventually cause their economic demise. When this happened, the Afghans had let their camels go, heartbroken, and tried to find other work. They were specialists and it wasn’t easy. Their camels, however, had found easy street – it was perfect country for them and they grew and prospered, so that now there are approximately ten thousand roaming the free country and making a nuisance of themselves on cattle properties, getting shot at, and, according to some ecologists, endangering some plant species for which they have a particular fancy. Their only natural enemy is man, they are virtually free of disease, and Australian camels are now rated as some of the best in the world.",
