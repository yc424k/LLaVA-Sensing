She had set the lilies there herself, remarked that they still stood upright, a shoulder brushing might upset them. Those flat lotus-pod-shaped stemholders were better than the glass ones. Her eyes, too wide, opened, blurred over the impression. Like the first colour-impressionist she saw blobs, perceived matte colour as pure tone. The wood-lilies were thumbed in from a laden palette. Orange was put in, with a thumb, against Van Dyke brown of seasoned woodwork. Her let eyes refocus, saw things clearly, mid-Victorian “interior.” The mid-Victorian “interior” became again classic, Flemish, something out of a long gallery, “Flemish school” from those eternal volumes laid flat, with charts and diagrams, on a carpet, threadbare upstairs, downstairs with woolly fringes before an open fireplace. Every sort of school of painting must sustain Her. Twin candlesticks gave out another light, and one pewter platter with dents. The lilies made the place live. Did I stare too hard at Minnie?",

He likened Coronado’s expedition to Spain’s expulsion of the Moors, and to the country’s recent civil war, when “Spain shed the blood of her sons to defend our Christian world against a new menace from the Orient—the menace of Communism.” This seemed an expansive use of “Orient,” and put Coronado in league with the fascist dictator Francisco Franco.

    "target_paragraph": "‘The turn of the tide at high water comes on very quickly in that river, and the boat in mid-stream, nearly hidden in smoke, began to drift back stern foremost. Along both shores the smoke thickened also, lying below the roofs in a level streak as you may see a long cloud cutting the slope of a mountain. A tumult of war-cries, the vibrating clang of gongs, the deep snoring of drums, yells of rage, crashes of volley-firing, made an awful din, in which Brown sat confounded but steady at the tiller, working himself into a fury of hate and rage against those people who dared to defend themselves. Two of his men had been wounded, and he saw his retreat cut off below the town by some boats that had put off from Tunku Allang’s stockade. There were six of them, full of men. While he was thus beset he perceived the entrance of the narrow creek (the same which Jim had jumped at low water). It was then brim full. Steering the long-boat in, they landed, and, to make a long story short, they established themselves on a little knoll about 900 yards from the stockade, which, in fact, they commanded from that position. The slopes of the knoll were bare, but there were a few trees on the summit. They went to work cutting these down for a breastwork, and were fairly intrenched before dark; meantime the Rajah’s boats remained in the river with curious neutrality. When the sun set the glue of many brushwood blazes lighted on the river-front, and between the double line of houses on the land side threw into black relief the roofs, the groups of slender palms, the heavy clumps of fruit trees. Brown ordered the grass round his position to be fired; a low ring of thin flames under the slow ascending smoke wriggled rapidly down the slopes of the knoll; here and there a dry bush caught with a tall, vicious roar. The conflagration made a clear zone of fire for the rifles of the small party, and expired smouldering on the edge of the forests and along the muddy bank of the creek. A strip of jungle luxuriating in a damp hollow between the knoll and the Rajah’s stockade stopped it on that side with a great crackling and detonations of bursting bamboo stems. The sky was sombre, velvety, and swarming with stars. The blackened ground smoked quietly with low creeping wisps, till a little breeze came on and blew everything away. Brown expected an attack to be delivered as soon as the tide had flowed enough again to enable the war-boats which had cut off his retreat to enter the creek. At any rate he was sure there would be an attempt to carry off his long-boat, which lay below the hill, a dark high lump on the feeble sheen of a wet mudflat. But no move of any sort was made by the boats in the river. Over the stockade and the Rajah’s buildings Brown saw their lights on the water. They seemed to be anchored across the stream. Other lights afloat were moving in the reach, crossing and recrossing from side to side. There were also lights twinkling motionless upon the long walls of houses up the reach, as far as the bend, and more still beyond, others isolated inland. The loom of the big fires disclosed buildings, roofs, black piles as far as he could see. It was an immense place. The fourteen desperate invaders lying flat behind the felled trees raised their chins to look over at the stir of that town that seemed to extend up-river for miles and swarm with thousands of angry men. They did not speak to each other. Now and then they would hear a loud yell, or a single shot rang out, fired very far somewhere. But round their position everything was still, dark, silent. They seemed to be forgotten, as if the excitement keeping awake all the population had nothing to do with them, as if they had been dead already.’",

His aunty had told him about it. A cold barn, she had said, that kept food from going bad. He opened it and gasped as the cool air rushed into his face. Oranges, bread, beer, soft drinks: many things in packets and cans were arranged on different levels and, and on the topmost, a roasted shimmering chicken, whole but for a leg. Ugwu reached out and touched the chicken. The fridge breathed heavily in his ears. He touched the chicken again and licked his finger before he yanked the other leg off, eating it until he had only the cracked, sucked pieces of bones left in his hand. Next, he broke off some bread, a chunk that he would have been excited to share with his siblings if a relative had visited and brought it as a gift. He ate quickly, before Master could come in and change his mind. He had finished eating and was standing by the sink, trying to remember what his aunty had told him about opening it to have water gush out like a spring, when Master walked in. He had put on a print shirt and a pair of trousers. His toes, which peeked through leather slippers, seemed feminine, perhaps because they were so clean; they belonged to feet that always wore shoes.",

Still, why should she feel brisk? Had she not walked the day before the entire distance in the dust? Was it possible that she too, in spite of her poetic exterior, was really inwardly leathery? I have my ideals about women, and believe there is much of the poet concealed somewhere about me; and there is a moonlight intangibleness about this lady, an etherealism amounting at times almost to indistinctness, that made the application to her of such an adjective as leathery one from which I shrank. Yet if she were not, how could she—but I put these thoughts resolutely aside, and began to prepare for our departure, moving about mechanically as one in a bleak and chilly dream.",

The ghosts of pain and darkness sat in the empty chairs, the spirits of venom and sterility brooded over the desks: dry hatred and the poison of the brain were seated in the chairs of the instructors; fear trembled in their seats, it made a hateful cold around the heart, it made the bowels queasy, it made swallowing hard, it slithered at the edges of the desk, it fell and crawled and wobbled like a boneless thing. And the grey-faced Jew beside Eugene made the weary lights burn dim: he gave a tongue to weariness, a colour to despair.",

And even of those he knew precious little. A sixteenth-century sculptor, for example, knew something about Greek carving—or something, at any rate, about Roman copies of carvings belonging to a certain period of Greek art. But of the works which the sculptors of the Gothic past had produced, even in his own country, he knew very little; and what he knew, he was disposed to deride as being merely barbarous. There were no photographs then; there were even very few engravings. The Renaissance sculptor worked in an almost total ignorance of what had been done by other sculptors, at other periods or in countries other than his own. The result was that he was able to concentrate on the one convention that seemed to him good—the classical—and work away at it undisturbed, until he had developed all its potential resources.",

It is, of course, and it’s nothing but the nighttime side of the dissolution of self, the release from normal boundaries that flight induces. Indeed, it’s part of what moves us to take flights in the first place: to walk through that archway of lights and become a different person.

The neglect of the islanders is a result of both geography and the relative unimportance of the island to the government. Its isolation is daunting. The Republic of Kirabati is scattered across an expanse of ocean that includes all four of the world’s hemispheres and covers an area the size of the continental United States, but its thirty-three low-lying atolls have a combined landmass of only three hundred square miles, less than a quarter of Rhode Island’s acreage. Kanton lies about midway between the population centers of Tarawa, to the west, and Christmas Island, to the east, and is nearly a thousand miles from each. The closest inhabited foreign islands are Samoa and Tuvalu, both more than seven hundred miles distant. While there is an eight-thousand-foot abandoned runway in nearly pristine condition left over from the days of the American space program—a runway fully capable of handling large jets, at least in daylight hours—no aircraft of any kind had landed for many years. Kanton is about as far off the beaten path as it’s possible to get.",

I bathe with an inner joy; floating in clean water, my body is buoyant with the love of life. I lie on my back and enjoy the pain of a strong sun striking my eyes. My feet kick the water into a cascade of diamonds that splash my face. Salt sticks to my skin. There are silent mornings and days of doing nothing but gulping lungs full of fresh air and staring up at high endless bright blue. I walk through the pristine quiet of the suburban bush of my childhood as fluorescent orange streaks across the sky. There are kookaburras and boat sheds and picnics and sand and so much water so silver bright and the light I love. Gleaming cars zoom fast on empty, wide, clean roads. A couple bent double laughs with hysterical abandon at a café table. I delight to see such open joy and such easy lives, yet at times the luxury and space sit uneasily. My country and I want it all—to be part of a war but not to face its consequences, to be part of the global community but not a port for its refugees. The city rants religiously of real estate and fashion, of “in” restaurants and the latest stupid styles. I read about obsessions with Brazilian bikini waxes and Botox injections and throw away papers full of articles about fulfilling desires for sexual adventure. The worship of land ownership, the body beautiful, self-help and self-obsession for beings blinded by option overload is strangely unfamiliar.",

I have stuck to my idea of being in a country cottage with a silent listener, hearing between the gusts of the wind and amidst the noises of the distant sea, the story as it comes. And, when one discusses an affair—a long, sad affair—one goes back, one goes forward. One remembers points that one has forgotten and one explains them all the more minutely since one recognises that one has forgotten to mention them in their proper places and that one may have given, by omitting them, a false impression. I console myself with thinking that this is a real story and that, after all, real stories are probably told best in the way a person telling a story would tell them. They will then seem most real.",

Biffen regarded this spectacle with resentful scorn; at another time it would have moved him merely to mirth, but not even the sound of the breakers when he had wandered as far as possible from human contact could help him to think with resignation of the injustice which triumphs so flagrantly in the destinies of men. Towards Amy he had no shadow of unkindness; the sight of her in tears had impressed him as profoundly, in another way, as that of his friend's wasted features. She and Reardon were again one, and his love for them both was stronger than any emotion of tenderness he had ever known.\nIn the afternoon he again sat by the bedside. Every symptom of the sufferer's condition pointed to an approaching end: a face that had grown cadaverous, livid lips, breath drawn in hurrying gasps. Harold despaired of another look of recognition. But as he sat with his forehead resting on his hand Amy touched him; Reardon had turned his face in their direction, and with a conscious gaze.\n‘I shall never go with you to Greece,’ he said distinctly.\nThere was silence again. Biffen did not move his eyes from the deathly mask; in a minute or two he saw a smile soften its lineaments, and Reardon again spoke:\n‘How often you and I have quoted it! – “We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our –”’",

As I drove through the electric streets on my way back into town, I felt myself in a different country, a different century, from Beijing or Chengdu. On every side was a quickening pace, a flashing commotion, a boomtown dynamism and drive that could have put Bombay or Jakarta to shame. The boys who elsewhere rode bicycles were revving up scooters; the girls who elsewhere looked sadly miscast in ill-fitting costumes here struck worldly poses in their pretty dresses, nail polish and T-shirts that said “Superstar” or “Cute.” I saw what looked like Sears, and it turned out to be the local Friendship Store. A notice in English advertised a “Motorcar Fitting Company.” Signs, huge billboards, colored lights, pulsed through the brilliant streets. I could easily have believed that I was over the border in Hong Kong. Only one thing reminded me I was not: in the capital of capitalism, flashing neon is prohibited, while in the capital of southern China all the lights were winking furiously.",

This was a subtly tinted landscape of palm-filled hollows and goat-supporting hillocks, new-ploughed tobacco fields, coffee groves, orange orchards and paddy-fields. From these last rose swarms of daytime mosquitoes – and whoever said mosquitoes don’t go for moving objects was wrong. That day’s most durable memory is of a pearly grey sky above the navy blue Sierra Rosario above sloping expanses of orange ploughland.",

But Mrs. Welland had firmly reminded him that the round of family visits was not half over, and, when he hinted at advancing the date of the wedding, had raised reproachful eye-brows and sighed out: \"Twelve dozen of everything—hand-embroidered—\"",

After a mile or so I passed the carcass of a small goat. Its front half was perfectly preserved, but its back had been eaten away, perhaps by a dog or a large bird of prey. Blood stained the slush all around it. The valley was dark and damp and eerily quiet. The sheer cliff-faces loomed on either side. I quickened my pace.",

    "target_paragraph": "As my train eased westward out of Xian, following the vanished caravans along the Wei river, the brick and tile villages were misted in pear blossom and the high mauve flowering of the foxglove trees, or were circled by concentric lines of vegetables protected beneath plastic, so that half the fields looked under snow. All around us, the labyrinthine earth had been sculpted by the wind-blown sands of Mongolia, pouring southward over the ages. For hours we twisted and tunnelled through their plateaux. Terraces of wheat and rapeseed billowed into ravines, or overhung us in ledges of brilliant green.\nIt took us fifteen hours to cover 450 miles. In the ‘hard seat’ carriages of China’s poor, the farmers sat wedged together among stacked luggage, dozing on each other’s shoulders, munching picnics, sipping jars of green tea. Where years before the aisles had been rinks of ash-clogged spittle and prostrate bodies, they were now strewn only with rubbish and the trussed bags of peasants and travelling salesmen. The shouting, the spitting, the smoking, even staring at the foreigner, had subtly abated. Instead, among students and families on holiday, the plump babies of the One Child policy sat in majesty, gurgling and urinating into hand-held potties.\nBut as we veered north into the corridor of Gansu, curving toward Xinjiang, the emptiness of inner Asia filled the land with its premonition. The villages seemed to disintegrate as we approached them, their brick walls changed to mud. They looked near-deserted. Their dead lay under mounds in their fields. Everything seemed half constructed, or in decay. Slowly the fields thinned and the hills turned to unclothed dust. Their spurs crowded the canyons in compacted staircases, until we were winding among ziggurats. Sometimes cave-villages appeared, their terraces sown with early wheat above them, and a few trees stubbled the heights. Then everything–villages, canyons, fields–turned to the monochrome brown of the wind-borne loess. The earth was carved like soft cake. Beneath us the river was liquid loam, the colour of milk chocolate, roiling between cliffs split by rain into bitter gullies. Over this drama the dark descended suddenly, and our train became a snake glimmering through emptiness.",

By the 1950s, the atrocious impact of pesticides upon bird populations in Britain was becoming clear. In 1939 there had been 700 British peregrine pairs; a 1962 survey showed a decline to half this number, with only sixty-eight pairs appearing to have reared chicks successfully. Sparrowhawks, too, had almost disappeared. It would have seemed likely to Baker that both hawks and falcons would become extinct due to what he called ‘the filthy, insidious pollen of farm chemicals’. ‘I remember those winter days,’ he wrote of the pre-war years, ‘those frozen fields ablaze with warring hawks . . . It is sad that it should be so no longer. The ancient eyries are dying.’",

Soon after Hamas’s election win, George Bush warned Abbas that were he to hold unity talks with the ‘terrorists’, Fatah would lose all its US funding. Saudi Arabia then intervened and in March 2007, in Mecca, King Abdullah witnessed the Fatah and Hamas leaders agreeing to form a coalition government. As Mark Perry, Director of the Conflicts Forum has recorded, Bush then ‘directed’ the CIA to remove coalition-inclined Hamas leaders from Gaza. Millions were spent on arming and training Fatah’s security forces and encouraging them to attack Hamas throughout the Strip. Observing manoeuvrings, Hamas moved first. This ‘Hamas coup’ was widely used, as Leila bitterly recalled, to ‘prove’ that extremist Islamists had overthrown moderate Fatah to gain total control of the Strip.",

The lighthouse is yet another of the Stevenson family constructions and a monument to their skill. The stone was hauled over from the Isle of Mull in the mid 1800’s. Looking at the lighthouse, it takes a while to twig that stones are usually quarried square or rectangular. Lighthouses are round. Thus after finding stone and getting it on site, every piece of stone needed to be manually shaped to achieve that asymmetrical roundness. Then raised to dizzying heights, thirty-six metres high at Ardnamurchan. These constructions are sturdy. Today, I can lease the lighthouse keeper’s lodging for £468 a week, although why you would want a holiday cottage in a desolate, windblown, tourist attraction escapes me.",

Sequoia sempervirens, the giant redwood, can grow to over three hundred feet high. Most of the height of an adult redwood is near-branchless trunk; then comes a vast and complex crown. The redwood researchers have developed exceptional techniques of ascent. They use a bow and arrow to fire a pulling line up over a firm branch in the crown. By means of this line they then raise and secure a climbing rope. Once in the crown, their rope-skills are so refined that they can move about safely and almost freely, like latter-day spidermen. Up there, in that aerial world, they have discovered a lost kingdom: a remarkable and previously uninvestigated ecosystem.",

The tune marched; and Miss Allan advanced with skirts extended and bowed profoundly to the engaged pair. Once their feet fell in with the rhythm they showed a complete lack of self-consciousness. From Mozart Rachel passed without stopping to old English hunting songs, carols, and hymn tunes, for, as she had observed, any good tune, with a little management, became a tune one could dance to. By degrees every person in the room was tripping and turning in pairs or alone. Mr Pepper executed an ingenious pointed step derived from figure-skating, for which he once held some local championship; while Mrs Thornbury tried to recall an old country dance which she had seen danced by her father’s tenants in Dorsetshire in the old days. As for Mr and Mrs Elliot, they gallopaded round and round the room with such impetuosity that the other dancers shivered at their approach. Some people were heard to criticize the performance as a romp; to others it was the most enjoyable part of the evening.",

The day boat pulled into a cove and the captain slowly idled toward the rocky shore, taking us so close that with a running start we could’ve leaped to dry land. (Well, one of us could have.) A deckhand dropped an aluminum ladder from the bow, David and I climbed down, and with help from the boat’s crew we unloaded our gear, bucket brigade style: packs, tents, bear cans, and finally the kayak. The whole process took less than five minutes. Our fellow passengers with whom we’d been chatting all day crowded to the edge of the top deck and watched us. The boat backed away. A little girl waved. And then we were alone in the wilderness.",

The apse, the juxtaposition of straight and round, the double walks, the complicated bunching of small units around large ones, are motifs that recur continually; and the way the last little apse is stuck on, or stuck in, is typical too. You will see everywhere such flowerings out of minor themes, self-contained but held tight to the larger one, and the central ones too are only outgrowths from one another. Almost nothing stands separate; nothing ends; and there is something young and joyous simply in the creation of such a continuity, the sheer skill and tirelessness of it. There is a certain sense of fearfulness in it too, a suggestion of a dread of exposure, which you feel more later but there is enough of it in this little barnacle affair, clever but after all rather freakish, as though designed by a man who would not sit with his back exposed in a restaurant.",

As though to hammer home Jennifer’s dissatisfaction with the status quo of housing, she spends the first night on a mattress that has been dragged outside. Gardens and outdoor spaces recur throughout Elizabeth von Arnim’s most famous work – few readers could forget, for instance, the descriptions of the paradisiacal Italian landscape in The Enchanted April. During her lifetime, Elizabeth von Arnim’s books were published as ‘By the author of Elizabeth and Her German Garden’ and she was synonymous with this character who said ‘the garden is the place I go to for refuge and shelter, not the house’. Jennifer’s longing for the rural, for the anti-London, is what motivates her fleeing – but when she gets to her new home, the house is as important as the garden. Perhaps putting the mattress in the garden is a way of showing her power over the space – no longer tied to spatial dichotomies put in place by other people.",

To them, his exploits seemed straight from the chivalric romance Amadis de Gaula, one of the most popular books of the sixteenth century (and a favorite of Don Quixote’s). Amadis is a wandering knight who beds maidens, slays monsters, finds enchanted isles, and kills 100,000 foes single-handed. Cortés, likewise a man who took many mistresses, outdid Amadis: he brought down a heathen empire that practiced human sacrifice, and he looted gold on a scale that made him one of the wealthiest men in the New World.",

As soon as you come to the trees there is no more. So they say. For many miles the landscape is moorland and down-like, with no trees. But wait for the trees.

Here and there they passed a battered negro cabin, its oldest white-haired inhabitant smoking a corncob pipe beside the door, and half a dozen scantily clothed pickaninnies parading tattered dolls on the wild-grown grass in front. Farther out were lazy cotton-fields where even the workers seemed intangible shadows lent by the sun to the earth, not for toil, but to while away some age-old tradition in the golden September fields.

One is a Buddha of past ages (the light-giver, Dipankara), another the historical Buddha (Sakyamuni), the third the Buddha-to-come (Maitreya, who exists at present as a Bodhisattva but will be reborn as the Buddha in a future age).",

She was vexed at her foolishness, since the ground she had covered, if in a straight line, must inevitably have taken her out of the wood to some remote village or other; but she had wasted her forces in countermarches; and now in much alarm wondered if she would have to pass the night here. She stood still to meditate, and fancied that between the soughing of the wind she heard shuffling footsteps on the leaves heavier than those of rabbits or other startled “beasts of beating heart” who lived there. Though fearing at first to meet anybody on the chance of his being a friend she decided that her fellow-noctambulist, even if a poacher, would not injure her, and that he might possibly be someone sent to search for her. She accordingly shouted a rather timid “Hoi!”",

That venerable blunder: to think that in changing the form of government you change the heart of man. And in other respects, too, these dreamers are at sea. For surely we should aim at simplification of machinery. Conceive, now, the state of affairs where everybody is more or less employed by the community—the community, that comfortable word!—in some patriotic business or other. Everybody an official, all controlling each other! It would be worse than the Spanish Inquisition. A man could live at Toledo by subscribing to certain fixed opinions; he could be assured of a reasonable degree of privacy. Nothing could save him, under socialism. An insupportable world!

High fences are thrown up, as if to stop even curious eyes. I think again of The City and the City, feel my focus switch to the Turkish signs, the minaret. I drink a coffee, then cross back. Legally speaking, of course, I have never left: the existence of the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus is recognized by no country other than Turkey.",
