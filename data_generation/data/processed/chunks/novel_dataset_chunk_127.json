For the next five hours three TV sets, hung high on a long wall, showed children’s cartoons interspersed with documentaries about soil erosion and dengue fever. There were no fans. There was no bar. My companions were few and various; as no one had the least idea when the service might depart people wandered in, sat around hopefully for a time, then strolled away.",

The statue, still thought to be of Constantine, stood in front of the half-ruined Lateran at the time, and when Cola, having bathed for mystical purposes in the font where Constantine was baptized, had himself knighted in the basilica on the old pagan festival of August 1st (Christianized) the people celebrated with a huge banquet outside and the horse, instead of announcing the end of the world, was made to pour wine and water from its nostrils, while Cola conferred the blessing of Rome on the universe. The Roman people, the old SPQR as you can read it on all the sewer lids and urinals now, were going to run the world again, though at the moment their monuments were fortresses, the roofs of most of their churches had fallen in, the Pope was in Avignon and the city of Florence among others had no intention of being run by them. Nevertheless they cheered while he had himself crowned with six mystical wreaths, then pointing a sword in three directions in the air cried three times, “This is mine!”",

That part of the rabble he was pursuing seemed to think of making a stand under the house; a volley fired by his followers from behind an aloe hedge made the rascals fly. In a gap chopped out for the rails of the harbour branch line Nostromo appeared, mounted on his silver-grey mare. He shouted, sent after them one shot from his revolver, and galloped up to the café window. He had an idea that old Giorgio would choose that part of the house for a refuge.",

I tied the blades down with a short piece of line so that it couldn’t rotate. The generator was designed with an automatic brake to slow the rotation of the blades if the wind grew too strong. It normally worked quite well. A sustained 30 knot wind gusting to 35 knots was just too much for the brake.",

She wore a blue blouse with white stitching and carried a pair of yellow gardening gloves. Marina Tabakova told me that she used to teach elementary school but had recently retired. She and her husband had come out to work on BAM in the 1970s and had raised their children here, and now their children were grown and she had two grandchildren—a girl, seventeen, and a boy, twenty. Her husband, who still worked part-time for BAM, was the handyman for the garden. She said she loved showing people the garden.

She looked little and frail in the faint light, and the returning heat brought out on her cheekbones those scarlet spots which made the hollows underneath so wan.

The matter with you is, you’re hungry,” he tried to jolly her; but she shook her head, and the smile on her gaunt little face turned into a grimace of weariness. “I guess I’m just tired--” Always the same wistful refrain! “She’s sick,” Vance thought with sudden terror. Aloud he said: “Wait till I heat the milk up; then maybe it’ll tempt you.” He thought with a shiver of the cold bed upstairs, their fireless room, the time it would take to warm the house--and where on earth could he find a brick to heat and put at her feet when he got her undressed? He warmed the milk, pressed it to her lips again--but she pushed it away with feverish hands, and the eyes she lifted were dark with a sort of animal fright. “Vanny--I’m so tired. Darling, carry me upstairs!” She wound her arms about his neck, and her cheek burned on his. . . . Halfway up she clutched him closer, and he felt her whisper in his ear. “It wasn’t a woman who telegraphed you, Vanny?” “Woman? Hell no! The idea!” he lied back, stumbling up the steps, pressing her tight, and shrinking from the touch of her tears. . . .",

I was met at the gates of the palace by a raven-robed flunkey and led up, past the long black cathedral Cadillac (emblazoned on its back window with a colour sticker of the Metropolitan’s coat of arms) to a first-floor reception room.

On the far end of the hall, where I went to change my dollars, a sign informed me gravely, PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOUR DRAWERS ARE LOCKED PROPERLY. Looking down to make sure that all was as it should be with my underwear, I stepped out into the gloom, and found myself inside a wheezing knockoff of an ancient Morris Oxford. A “Free Left Turn” was to the right of us, and a “Passenger Alighting Point” to the left.

She walked as delicately as if she had been bred in town, and as firmly as if she had been bred in the country; she seemed one who dimly knew her appearance to be attractive, but who retained some of the charm of ignorance by forgetting self in a general pensiveness. She approached the gate. To let such a creature touch it even with the tip of her glove was to Fitzpiers almost like letting her proceed to tragical self-destruction. He jumped up and looked for his hat; but was unable to find the right one; glancing again out of the window he saw that his assistance was unnecessary. Having come up she looked at the gate, picked up a little stick, and using it as a bayonet pushed open the obstacle without touching it at all.",

Outside his uncle’s dirty window he could see the edge of Faneuil Hall, and hear the swarming and abundant activity of the markets. The deep roar of the markets reached them across the singing and lyrical air, and he drank into his lungs a thousand proud, potent, and mysterious odours which came to him like the breath of certainty, like the proof of magic, and like the revelation that all confusion had been banished – the world that he longed for won, the word that he sought for spoken, the hunger that devoured him fed and ended. And the markets, swarming with richness, joy, and abundance, thronged below him like a living evidence of fulfilment. For it seemed to him that nowhere more than here was the passionate enigma of New England felt: New England, with its harsh and stony soil, and its tragic and lonely beauty; its desolate rocky coasts and its swarming fisheries, the white, piled, frozen bleakness of its winters with the magnificent jewellery of stars, the dark firwoods, and the warm little white houses at which it is impossible to look without thinking of groaning bins, hung bacon, hard cider, succulent bastings and love’s warm, white and opulent flesh.",

The instrument panel had just ten fairly rudimentary gauges?eleven if you counted the clock. One conspicuous absence was a fuel gauge. Lindbergh didn’t feel such gauges were reliable enough. He would compute his fuel use manually, though that was essentially an academic exercise: either he would have enough fuel or he wouldn’t. The plane also had no brakes. Planes in 1927 almost never did. That would not matter in most circumstances, but it would prove an unnerving absence when, later, crowds streamed onto runways wherever Lindbergh landed.",

Eugene, in fact, was only less drunk than his companion, but fortified by that sense of pride and duty which a trust imposed by two lovely women can give a young man, he hung on, keeping pace with Starwick, drink for drink, until the whole night fused into a drunken blur, a rout of evil faces, the whole to be remembered later as jags of splintered light upon a chain of darkness, as flying images, fixed, instant, and intolerably bright, in the great blank of memory. And out of all these blazing pictures of the night and the wild reel of their debauch, one would remain for ever after to haunt his vision mournfully. It was the memory – or rather the consciousness – of the two women, Ann and Elinor, waiting in the dark, following the blind weave of their drunken path, all through the mad kaleidoscope of night, never approaching them, but always there. He had not seemed to look at them, to notice them, and yet later he had always known that they were there. And the memory fused to one final mournful image that was to return a thousand times to haunt him in the years to come. He and Starwick had come out of one of the bars that broke the darkness of the long steep hill, and were reeling down past shuttered stores and old dark houses towards the invitation of another blaze of light.",

It was on Lily’s lips to exclaim: ‘You poor soul, don’t double and turn – come straight back to me, and we’ll find a way out!’ But the words died under the impenetrable insolence of Bertha’s smile.

Below the Capitoline cliff the originally decadent Portico of the Counsel of the Gods is brought forward for its decorative obtuse angle and the fine plastic contrast it makes with the massive masonry, anteceding it by several hundred years, of the Tabularium. The lighting fixtures are particularly thick here, and are turned on the cubicles of the portico in such a way you think the twelve gods must still be there but coming closer you find their places empty like a row of unused locker rooms.",

They shouted that there was no room, that we should sink the boat, they implored the captain not to let us on board, they were scared, for most of them had never been at sea before and the previous evening they had run on a rock and narrowly escaped off Sinoe.

The avenue below it was deserted; not a carriage or motor turned the corner around which he expected Undine to appear, and he looked idly in the opposite direction. There too the perspective was nearly empty, so empty that he singled out, a dozen blocks away, the blazing lamps of a large touring-car that was bearing furiously down the avenue from Morningside. As it drew nearer its speed slackened, and he saw it hug the curb and stop at his door. By the light of the street lamp he recognized his wife as she sprang out and detected a familiar silhouette in her companion’s fur-coated figure. Then the motor flew on and Undine ran up the steps.",
