But I was rather fed up with the whole affair, which was eating up more and more of the lesson hours, and told him he’d have to manage the rest by himself. But I was not to get out of it so easily. On the 13th I learnt, to my distress, that the very thing I had been trying to avoid was happening; Narayan was to be moved from the Guest House to make way for Abdul.",

    "target_paragraph": "Unfortunately, that cold, overcast, windy day in December wasn’t conducive to sightseeing, either, but we set out for Gerace all the same, arriving at the castle just as the first drops began to fall. From the former stronghold at the town’s high point, we were able to survey the whole valley below. Only a tower and some of the wall remained of the Norman structure, built around 1050, complete with a drawbridge, an armory and a canalled system of rainwater collection. Earthquakes had destroyed the castle and innumerable churches that, according to legend, once numbered as many as 128. I would return on nicer days to have a better view of Gerace’s charming medieval center with old stone buildings and historic churches of which only seventeen survive in various states of preservation. Edward Lear, British artist and writer, visiting the town in August 1847, remarked on the disreputable state of repair of many of Gerace’s buildings due to the earthquake damage. Notwithstanding, he was also delighted with the town’s visual impact, observing, “... each rock, shrine and building at Gerace seems arranged and coloured on purpose for artists, and the union of lines formed by nature and art is perfectly delicious.”1",

Many photos are taken of us arm in arm on the steps and leaning over the balcony. Susan’s cousin brings out champagne he has brought from France. After drinks with bruschette and dry olives, we start with cool fennel soup. I’ve made a rustic casserole of chicken, white beans, sausage, tomatoes, and onions. There are tiny green beans, baskets of bread, and a salad of arugula, radicchio, and chicory. Everyone tells wedding stories. Mark was to have married a Colorado girl who ran away on the wedding day and married someone else in a week. Karen was a bridesmaid on a boat wedding and the bride’s mother, in teal chiffon, tipped into the drink. When I married at twenty-two, I wanted a midnight wedding with everyone wearing robes and carrying candles. The minister said absolutely not, that midnight was a “furtive hour.” Nine was as late as he’d go. And instead of a robe, I wore my sister’s wedding dress and carried a leatherbound Keats down the aisle. My mother pulled my skirt and I leaned over for her words of wisdom. She whispered, “It won’t last six months.” But she was wrong.",

As she led the way westward past a long line of areas which, through the distortion of their paintless rails, revealed with increasing candour the disjecta membra of bygone dinners, Lily felt that Rosedale was taking contemptuous note of the neighbourhood; and before the doorstep at which she finally paused he looked up with an air of incredulous disgust.",

    "target_paragraph": "He walked on upon the impetus of this last mood of almost supernatural exaltation until he reached a narrow street, at this hour empty of traffic and passengers. Here, whether it was the shops with their shuttered windows, the smooth and silvered curve of the wood pavement, or a natural ebb of feeling, his exaltation slowly oozed and deserted him. He was now conscious of the loss that follows any revelation; he had lost something in speaking to Katharine, for, after all, was the Katharine whom he loved the same as the real Katharine? She had transcended her entirely at moments; her skirt had blown, her feather waved, her voice spoken; yes, but how terrible sometimes the pause between the voice of one’s dreams and the voice that comes from the object of one’s dreams! He felt a mixture of disgust and pity at the figure cut by human beings when they try to carry out, in practice, what they have the power to conceive. How small both he and Katharine had appeared when they issued from the cloud of thought that enveloped them! He recalled the small, inexpressive, commonplace words in which they had tried to communicate with each other; he repeated them over to himself. By repeating Katharine’s words, he came in a few moments to such a sense of her presence that he worshipped her more than ever. But she was engaged to be married, he remembered with a start. The strength of his feeling was revealed to him instantly, and he gave himself up to an irresistible rage and sense of frustration. The image of Rodney came before him with every circumstance of folly and indignity. That little pink-cheeked dancing-master to marry Katharine? that gibbering ass with the face of a monkey on an organ? that posing, vain, fantastical fop? with his tragedies and his comedies, his innumerable spites and prides and pettinesses? Lord! marry Rodney! She must be as great a fool as he was. His bitterness took possession of him, and as he sat in the corner of the underground carriage, he looked as stark an image of unapproachable severity as could be imagined. Directly he reached home he sat down at his table, and began to write Katharine a long, wild, mad letter, begging her for both their sakes to break with Rodney, imploring her not to do what would destroy for ever the one beauty, the one truth, the one hope; not to be a traitor, not to be a deserter, for if she were—and he wound up with a quiet and brief assertion that, whatever she did or left undone, he would believe to be the best, and accept from her with gratitude. He covered sheet after sheet, and heard the early carts starting for London before he went to bed.",

If she had appeared to be catching a train, he might have inferred that he had come on her in the act of transition between one and another of the country-houses which disputed her presence after the close of the Newport season; but her desultory air perplexed him. She stood apart from the crowd, letting it drift by her to the platform or the street, and wearing an air of irresolution which might, as he surmised, be the mask of a very definite purpose. It struck him at once that she was waiting for someone, but he hardly knew why the idea arrested him. There was nothing new about Lily Bart, yet he could never see her without a faint movement of interest: it was characteristic of her that she always roused speculation, that her simplest acts seemed the result of far-reaching intentions.",

Now they had to swim for their lives with their loads half under water, sometimes downstream of a bridge, sometimes far above it, whilst Badar Khan and Abdul Ghiyas shouted encouragement from the bank. But not Shir Muhammad; his little grey mare was the only one the other horses would follow, so that it was she who had to swim while her master sat with his feet tucked up on the saddle. Why his was the most spirited horse no one ever discovered. Not only did he allow it to wander on without giving it any help or encouragement but by sheer neglect it became horribly galled under the saddle. It was only the last bridge made from two parallel tree-trunks with rocks in the space between them (the trunks were crooked) that they were able to cross at all, at the rest they were made to flounder miserably in the river.",

Bathsheba sat here till it began to rain, and the light vanished, when she withdrew to lie restlessly in her bed and re-enact in a worn mind the lurid scene of yesternight. Almost before the first faint sign of dawn appeared she arose again and opened the window to obtain a full breathing of the new morning air, the panes being now wet with trembling tears left by the night rain, each one rounded with a pale lustre caught from primrose-hued slashes through a cloud low down in the awakening sky. From the trees came the sound of steady dripping upon the horny leaves under them, and from the direction of the church she could hear another noise – peculiar, and not intermittent like the rest – the purl of water falling into a pool.",

He could remember a woman’s voice and laughter in a leafy street at home, heard twenty years ago, in darkness and the silence of an unrecorded night; the face of a woman passing in another train, an atom hurled through time somewhere upon the inland immensity of the nation; the veins that stood out on an old man’s hands; the falling of a single drop of water in a dank, dark, gloomy hall; the passing of cloud shadows on a certain day across the massed green of the hills at home; the creaking of a bough in winter wind; a corner light that cast its livid glare upon the grey, grimed front of a dismal little house.

Our final campsite was on the edge of an exposed gravel beach, open to all that river, ice, and sky. It was prefall crisp. Dinner was a hodgepodge of leftovers and stashed treasure—no need to hoard Snickers or bacon—and Mitch built his long-promised waxed-box fire, an integral part of any rafter’s camp arsenal. Opening the top and bottom flaps of a produce box (emptied of the fruit eaten on the trip), he created a combustible chimney that channeled an orange flame twenty feet into the air. It was incredibly impressive. We danced around the fire, barefoot and whooping in the gritty sand.",

The noise and colour of this holiday vision seemed to transform Nettleton into a metropolis.

It was so far beyond where we stood that we didn’t think it could possibly be for us, but then it jerked into reverse and came at us, half on the shoulder and half off, moving very fast and a little wildly. I stood transfixed. The day before, we had been told by a pair of seasoned hikers that sometimes in the South drivers will swerve at AT hitchhikers, or run over their packs, for purposes of hilarity, and I supposed this was one of those moments. I was about to fly for cover, and even Katz was halfway to his feet, when it stopped just before us, with a rock and another cloud of dust, and a youthful female head popped out the passenger side window.",

To be sure, these rooms were practically empty, because of Chimpo's bad effect on the landlady's furniture. Chimpo had grown bigger, and was developing a mind of her own. Stewart had kept a bed and a dresser for me in a back room, the door of which could be locked, but there was nothing else in the apartment except his trunk, a mattress on the floor, and one gigantic wardrobe with handles strong enough to hold the chimpanzee when she was chained to them, as she often was. In fact, the chain padlocked around her neck was a regular part of Chimpo, because Stewart found it the only means by which he could catch or otherwise manage her. Most of the time, it merely dragged along behind her. On occasion, she would gather it up as a lady gathers her train, carrying it as she ran away from some retribution or other, but even then it slowed her down.",

Unless one’s very pretty people don’t listen to what you say … And that is what I like,’ she added energetically, as if the memory were very happy. ‘I like walking in Richmond Park and singing to myself and knowing it doesn’t matter a damn to anybody. I like seeing things go on—as we saw you that night when you didn’t see us—I love the freedom of it—it’s like being the wind or the sea.’ She turned with a curious fling of her hands and looked at the sea. It was still very blue, dancing away as far as the eye could reach, but the light on it was yellower, and the clouds were turning flamingo red.",

    "target_paragraph": "I have said little about Honolulu, except of its tropical beauty. It does not look as if it had \"seen better days.\" Its wharves are well cared for, and its streets and roads are very clean. The retail stores are generally to be found in two long streets which run inland, and in a splay street which crosses both. The upper storekeepers, with a few exceptions, are Americans, but one street is nearly given up to Chinamen's stores, and one of the wealthiest and most honourable merchants in the town is a Chinaman. There is an ice factory, and icecream is included in the daily bill of fare here, and iced water is supplied without limit, but lately the machinery has only worked in spasms, and the absence of ice is regarded as a local calamity, though the water supplied from the water-works is both cool and pure. There are two good photographers and two booksellers. I don't think that plate glass fronts are yet to be seen. Many of the storekeepers employ native \"assistants;\" but the natives show little aptitude for mercantile affairs, or indeed for the \"splendid science\" of money-making generally, and in this respect contrast with the Chinamen, who, having come here as coolies, have contrived to secure a large share of the small traffic of the islands. Most things are expensive, but they are good. I have seen little of such decided rubbish as is to be found in the cheap stores of London and Edinburgh, except in tawdry artificial flowers. Good black silks are to be bought, and are as essential to the equipment of a lady as at home. Saddles are to be had at most of the stores, from the elaborate Mexican and Californian saddle, worth from 30 to 50 dollars, to a worthless imitation of the English saddle, dear at five. Boots and shoes, perhaps because in this climate they are a mere luxury, are frightfully dear, and so are books, writing paper, and stationery generally; a sheet of Bristol board, which we buy at home for 6d., being half a dollar here. But it is quite a pleasure to make purchases in the stores. There is so much cordiality and courtesy that, as at this hotel, the bill recedes into the background, and the purchaser feels the indebted party.",

Then her thoughts passed on to their walk home from the hospital—she recalled his sober yet unsparing summary of the situation at Westmore, and the note of insight with which he touched on the hardships of the workers.... Then, word by word, their talk about Dillon came back...Amherst's indignation and pity...his shudder of revolt at the man's doom.",

I shall not hear the sudden sigh in the night and feel through the dark someone coming. There will be no reflections in window-panes in dark tunnels. I shall look into faces, and I shall see them seek some other face.

It is a white frame blockish structure, taller than wide or deep, with a pagoda roof, and a firebell cupola up against the sky. The windmill standing beside it has a long history of lassitude, a record expressible in revolutions per month. March 26, 1951: “Tank very low but today some wind arrived allowing an extra halffoot of water to be collected.” November 26, 1917: “No wind during past month and tank dry.” In present times, the windmill sings castrato. A Jacuzzi submersible pump, hidden in the well house, tops up the twenty-thousand-gallon cedar tank. Water comes out of a hose and nozzle of the type used for pumping gasoline. Firefighting equipment is piled up in the well house, and so are kerosene pots for mercy flights (for spacing around the airfield to light emergency landings). The outer door opens out, and shuts like a book with an inner door that opens in. After these two comes a small foyer, then another door, which leads to the water. All this to keep back the cold. The deep cold comes in waves, spells, snaps—and really long ones are rare. From late in December, 1917, until early in February, 1918, the air was never warmer than forty-six below. If you want to be very sure of encountering someone, know his habits and meet him at the well house. A prominent citizen of Eagle (the description will not reveal him, because in Eagle there is no other kind) recently did just that, with intent to take advantage of the complex doors. A’s wife was in B’s cabin. B kept a 12-gauge shotgun, loaded with rock salt, leaning by the door. A knew about the salted shotgun. He studied B’s habits, and when B went to the well house A locked him in with three doors. Then A, picking B’s cabin lock, recaptured his wife,",

The chief’s kindness made them for a few minutes gloriously happy, and when almost immediately they suffered from walking with heavy loads on a full stomach, they didn’t connect their suffering with their pleasure. They simply felt with minds clouded with indigestion that somebody was treating them badly. It was always the same throughout the four weeks of marching; whenever they had a breakfast they worked badly, grumbled and made palavers; when food became scarce they worked well and were happy. On one occasion they spent nearly forty-eight hours without food and at the end of that time they were fresher than they had ever been.",

    "target_paragraph": "Whether made by man, or for some reason preserved by nature, there was a wide pathway striking through the forest at right angles to the river. It resembled a drive in an English forest, save that tropical bushes with their swordlike leaves grew at the side, and the ground was covered with an unmarked springy moss instead of grass, starred with little yellow flowers. As they passed into the depths of the forest the light grew dimmer, and the noises of the ordinary world were replaced by those creaking and sighing sounds which suggest to the traveller in a forest that he is walking at the bottom of the sea. The path narrowed and turned; it was hedged in by dense creepers which knotted tree to tree, and burst here and there into star-shaped crimson blossoms. The sighing and creaking up above were broken every now and then by the jarring cry of some startled animal. The atmosphere was close and the air came at them in languid puffs of scent. The vast green light was broken here and there by a round of pure yellow sunlight which fell through some gap in the immense umbrella of green above, and in these yellow spaces crimson and black butterflies were circling and settling. Terence and Rachel hardly spoke.",

    "target_paragraph": "In every house into which my paternal (Calabrian) grandparents and their children moved, the cellar or basement was immediately transformed into heart and pulsing center; and this was true of every Italian family I knew (one didn't, at that time, say southern or northern Italian; all immigrants were, or were assumed to be, from the South). I did not think of this then, nor do I now, as a disinclination for sunlight. . . . The sunlight that filtered through the leaves of the mulberry bush into the slivers of windows was warming and prismatic. The hatch doors that opened onto steps that led to the cellar had a quotidian magic; they ushered one into a world inside the world. In Grandma Rosie's basement there was a stove on which the Sunday “gravy” (the tomato sauce) simmered, and taralli danced in bubbling oil (these ring-shaped cakes appear in Italy's version of “Red Riding Hood” the Jordan River has a weakness for them and enjoys twirling them in his whirlpools). There was a Victrola: “Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree with Anyone Else but Me,” the Andrews Sisters sang; “ap-pa-la tree,” Grandma echoed. There were fat wicker chairs and a round oak table; the floor was stone. On the round oak table there was a lamp with panels of blue glass, yellow glass, and rose-colored glass; on each panel was etched a boy in a rowboat, fishing—fishing, according to which panel one concentrated one's gaze on, at sunrise, sunset, noonday. This lamp still lights my memory; by thinking of it, I recall the past. One day at that table Grandma's next-door neighbor spoke of her husband. “Mr. Smith . . .” she said, as someone might say in a book; no one in my family ever called her husband Mister. No one in Mr. Smith's family had a basement like ours. (This taught me that there were all kinds of magic.) Best of all was the room behind the door that led to the subbasement. Grandma stored overnight the fresh cheese she made there weekly—we called it Thursday cheese—and the buckets of blood for blood sausage, blood pudding. That room smelled musty, sweet. Old school-books were piled high here (“Pasqualina, her book”), and sheet music and old magazines, yellow and brittle, that no one—I found this kindness to inanimate objects reassuring—could bear to throw out. I went here for comfort, the comfort of confronting a manageable world alone; for fantasy.",

Here, also, dozens of naked children, manure-smeared buffalo-calves, congenitally mangy puppies and grubby chicks are to be seen tumbling around together in filth-blocked gutters, half-filled with inky, glutinous liquid. Most of the higher-caste Nepalese avoid this street – not through any fastidiousness, for their own home area could well be equally unsavoury, but simply because the proximity of pigs would make them ritually unclean. Yet the inhabitants do not seem to be in the least cowed by their inferior social status; they are now used to seeing me passing by, and today quite a few of them leaned from their first-floor windows and shouted greetings, which gave me a warm ‘accepted’ feeling.",

He dropped the sled and hurried to help. Chafe and Breddy were outside, securing their own tent, and the gale wreaked havoc across the camp: cooking pots and tins flew through the air, skittering across the beach; flaming driftwood blew a conflagration, chunks of coals and embers trailing into the sky. Everyone was running around, yelling, calling out directions, and after rolling enough logs and stones on the windward sides of the tents, they managed to get them all righted and standing again.",

In any case, shortly after Ruess carved his mark into the sandstone, he departed Davis Gulch and mysteriously disappeared, apparently by design. An extensive search shed no light on his whereabouts. He was simply gone, swallowed whole by the desert. Sixty years later we still know next to nothing about what became of him.",

My practice sessions at home resulted in a near-flawless ability to do so correctly, but that was months ago. The muscle memory I developed to do this task correctly seems to be suffering from early dementia. Each morning, I stand outside our tent, chewing my lip, rehearsing in my mind the sequence of moves to follow, like a high-diver about to execute a triple twist, jackknife, somersault from the fifty-meter platform. More often than not, the support poles rebel. I wind up in a pitched battle, my arms and legs contorted like a Chinese acrobat, holding multiple sections of the writhing tent in place as I try to subdue it. On the first try the tent always wins, ultimately evading my grasp and popping into the air, to settle smugly on the ground some feet from where we’d first set it up.",

If there is one thing farmers sure do love it is to drive into town and spend half a day (a whole day in winter) sitting at a counter with a bunch of other farmers drinking coffee and teasing the waitress in a half-assed sort of way. I had thought that this was the busiest time of their year, but they didn’t seem to be in any rush. Every once in a while one of them would put a quarter on the counter, get up with the air of a man who has just loaded six gallons of coffee into his belly, tell Tammy not to do anything he wouldn’t do, and depart. A moment later we would hear the grip of his pickup truck’s wheels on the gravel drive, someone would say something candid about him, provoking appreciative laughter, and the conversation would drift lazily back to hogs, state politics, Big Eight football and – when Tammy was out of earshot – sexual predilections, not least Tammy’s.",

To get to and from school, pupils must use an exposed stairway of twenty unsteady stone steps, attached to the gable wall of the last house on Shuhada Street. Then comes an equally exposed five-minute walk along the ledge. Raouf’s niece, disoriented by stone-throwers, fell off those steps, breaking an arm. After a few more such accidents, the authorities were persuaded to provide a railing. They also tiled the narrow path which can become very slippy. Those tiles must be guarded at night; eleven times they have been dug up and smashed.",

In this case, Orlando’s love began her flight towards him with her white face turned, and her smooth and lovely body outwards. Nearer and nearer she came wafting before her airs of pure delight. All of a sudden (at the sight of the Archduchess presumably) she wheeled about, turned the other way round; showed herself black, hairy, brutish; and it was Lust the vulture, not Love, the Bird of Paradise, that flopped, foully and disgustingly, upon his shoulders. Hence he ran; hence he fetched the footman.",
