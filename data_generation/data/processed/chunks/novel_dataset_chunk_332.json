Miss Stepney was not sufficiently familiar with the classic drama to have recalled in advance how bearers of bad tidings are proverbially received but she now had a rapid vision of forfeited dinners and a reduced wardrobe as the possible consequence of her disinterestedness. To the honour of her sex, however, hatred of Lily prevailed over more personal considerations. Mrs Peniston had chosen the wrong moment to boast of her niece’s charms.",

She says riding a de Paso is like ‘travelling in an armchair’. These extraordinary horses are now much in demand on the US market and fetch thousands of dollars at Lima sales. We looked this afternoon at one superb light chestnut mule whose dam was a de Paso. He is a family pet with a knowing look and at once we fell in love with him; but after a long suspenseful search for his owner our hopes were blitzed – £600 sterling and no haggling. Our limit is £150. A pony would be cheaper but an unwise choice given the terrain between here and Cuzco, plus drought conditions. Mules are incomparably more sure-footed and have more stamina and smaller appetites.",

Rawng and Wright and his manuscript, whose fate now hangs in the precarious scales of hair-line fortune, and may be made—or ruined—by a sneeze! He hopes and prays and sweats and fears and holds his breath and counts his steps, in order somehow, even if he cannot influence, at least not to disturb, the processes of destiny.",

In his old age he marched to and fro, viciously putting down rebellions, trying to impose his harsh regime on his unwilling subjects. On his death in 1707 the empire fragmented. Yet the Mughal line never quite died out.\n\n‘It was all great-grandfather Aurangzeb’s fault,’ said Pakeezah Sultan Begum, rearranging her cardigan. ‘If it wasn’t for him we’d still have the empire.’",

The departing mechanics locked the doors and no trailer tires could be inspected or replaced by onsite personnel. If a driver detected a problem with a tire, he would have had to call his boss to authorize a repair truck from a fleet servicing company to come out and do any work. Most drivers wouldn’t want such a delay. However, many simply didn’t check their own tires. Yet, the company runs a 24 hour a day operation. Trucks and trailers with little or no in-depth inspection by drivers, including myself, left the grounds of every facility all through the night and day on a regular basis. With a lick and a promise hundreds of drivers head out each day, system wide, never quite sure if one of the trailer tires might unpeel a long strip of metal-reinforced rubber onto the roadway in front of motorists or other truckers while they zoom along.",

    "target_paragraph": "Arriving in Winfield was always thrilling. Dad would turn off Highway 78 and bounce us down a rough gravel road at far too high a speed, throwing up clouds of white dust, and then to my mother’s unfailing alarm would drive with evident insanity towards some railroad tracks on a blind bend in the road, remarking gravely, ‘I hope there’s not a train coming.’ My mother didn’t discover until years later that there were only two trains a day along those tracks, both in the dead of night. Beyond the tracks, standing alone in a neglected field, was a Victorian mansion like the one in the Charles Addams cartoons in the New Yorker. No-one had lived in it for decades, but it was still full of furniture, under dank sheets. My sister and brother and I used to climb in through a broken window and look through trunks of musty clothes and old Collier’s magazines and photographs of strangely worried-looking people. Upstairs was a bedroom in which, according to my brother, lay the shrivelled body of the last occupant, a woman who had died of heartbreak after being abandoned at the altar. We never went in there, though once, when I was about four, my brother peered through the keyhole, let out a howl, cried ‘She’s coming!’ and ran headlong down the stairs. Whimpering, I followed, squirting urine at every step. Beyond the mansion was a wide field, full of black and white cows, and beyond that was my grandparents’ house, pretty and white beneath a canopy of trees, with a big red barn and acres of lawn. My grandparents were always waiting at the gate. I don’t know whether they could see us coming and raced to their positions or whether they just waited there hour after hour. Quite possibly the latter because, let’s face it, they didn’t have a whole lot else to do. And then it would be four or five days of fun. My grandfather had a Model T Ford, which he let us kids drive around the yard, to the distress of his chickens and the older women. In the winter he would attach a sleigh to the back and take us for long cold rides down snowy roads. In the evenings we would all play cards around the kitchen table and stay up late. It was always Christmas at my grandparents’ house, or Thanksgiving, or the Fourth of July, or somebody’s birthday. There was always happiness there.",

In the park surrounding the canals by my compound, septuagenarians gathered beneath the willow trees to practice tai chi as though rehearsing for a yogi’s ballet. Opera fans reenacted their favorite scenes inside a pagoda. Bearded men rolled metallic balls in their palms beneath magnolia trees, focusing intensely on unfixed points in space. Old men in Mao jackets aired out their finches by hanging their bamboo cages from tree branches. Fathers and sons played xiang qi—Chinese chess—atop tree stumps. Power walkers charged down the dirt trail forward one lap and backward the next. Friends played badminton with no nets. Couples ballroom-danced with no music. Loners threw themselves against the trees the way the babushki did with birch branches back in Russia, only in reverse.",

They had been on the shelf as the tide was rapidly running off it and into the Pacific. The speed of the tide, when added to the speed of the wind, made for a waterfall effect, and they had been right in the middle of it. It was a terrifying experience, and Point Bad certainly lived up to its reputation. He couldn’t believe that there was no mention of it, let alone a warning in the cruising guide. They were lucky. Had the tide been rushing into the Gulf with the wind opposing, the seas would have been just as steep, and they would have been in it for hours. He shuddered at the thought.",

Water lilies poked their noses through the surface, where tiny insects skated by. Whip-thin birches sprung with unlikely fervor from their gravel beds, silk-skinned and shining and bearing tiny buds of sweet new leaves. We pressed between the birches, along a narrow footpath, to emerge at the base of the bing proper, and found its vast red flanks rising ahead of us, contours and crannies picked out dramatically in vegetation, and striated with tracks.",

The thick air seemed suffocating and our only consolation was the disappearance of the fruit flies, which had stayed on the fertile side of the river.

Anthony Pollett now asked her to dance, and as she danced she looked at them, over her shoulder, standing at the table, drinking together.",

I did try a brief walk, weak-kneed and dizzy, and soon also to be nauseated by so many blood-soaked butchers’ stalls, and fragments of old fish everywhere, all held close in a thick, humid cloud under a low, stuffy roof. I’d have to learn the hard way that alcohol is not the answer to jetlag. Still, in the original journals, my first impressions are ecstatic.",

McKinlay knelt, repulsed by what he witnessed. Breddy’s right eye was gone, blown apart, “powder burned and blackened” where the bullet had entered.

Stoplight parrotfish scrape the rocks and coral, a lone barracuda makes a slightly menacing appearance. The invasive exotic lionfish are here, sitting still under a ledge, extending their long poisonous spines when feeling threatened. A sea cucumber sits on the bottom like a living blob mimicking a terrestrial vegetable. There is so much life here that I am nearly overwhelmed.
