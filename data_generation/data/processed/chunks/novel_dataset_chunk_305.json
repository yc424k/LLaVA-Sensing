Granted, a current of anti-white feeling is now running through the townships but traditionally, in South Africa, anti-white-ism has been strictly political – not racist. Since the ANC was founded in 1912 it has been consistently non-racist, apart from a half-hearted flirtation with Garveyism in the 1920s. This is its greatest moral (and now political) strength. Consistently, ANC leaders have stressed the crucial difference between black Africa, comparatively recently colonized, and South Africa where the White Tribe took root in 1652. Zimbabwe, for instance, was colonized a mere twenty years before the founding of the ANC.",

Sweeping and swerving, accurately, punctually, noiselessly, there, precisely at the right instant, the motor car stopped at the door. The girl, silk-stockinged, feathered, evanescent, but not to him particularly attractive (for he had had his fling), alighted. Admirable butlers, tawny chow dogs, halls laid in black and white lozenges with white blinds blowing, Peter saw through the opened door and approved of. A splendid achievement in its own way, after all, London; the season; civilization. Coming as he did from a respectable Anglo-Indian family which for at least three generations had administered the affairs of a continent (it’s strange, he thought, what a sentiment I have about that, disliking India, and empire, and army as he did), there were moments when civilization, even of this sort, seemed dear to him as a personal possession; moments of pride in England; in butlers; chow dogs; girls in their security. Ridiculous enough, still there it is, he thought. And the doctors and men of business and capable women all going about their business, punctual, alert, robust, seemed to him wholly admirable, good fellows, to whom one would entrust one’s life, companions in the art of living, who would see one through. What with one thing and another, the show was really very tolerable; and he would sit down in the shade and smoke.",

But Archer had seen, on his last visit to Paris, the delicious play of Labiche, \"Le Voyage de M. Perrichon,\" and he remembered M. Perrichon's dogged and undiscouraged attachment to the young man whom he had pulled out of the glacier. The van der Luydens had rescued Madame Olenska from a doom almost as icy; and though there were many other reasons for being attracted to her, Archer knew that beneath them all lay the gentle and obstinate determination to go on rescuing her.",

What sticks in my mind most of all, however, is when Diane said, ‘You know, Westerners with their full-blown personalities are infinite in interest as human beings. But Western culture is so limited in depth. The Japanese, on the other hand, so restricted by their society, are limited as human beings. But their culture is infinitely deep.’",

In March 2002 the commander of an IDF paratroop brigade brought ridicule upon himself (in certain circles) by announcing on TV ‘Balata has surrendered!’ The camp’s defenders were untrained in combat, armed only with home-made hand-grenades and AK47s. No wonder they surrendered to a brigade of the world’s fourth strongest army. However, the commander’s audience were no doubt comforted to hear that their daring paratroopers had vanquished hordes of vicious terrorists.",

The mountain ranges of the Lesser Antilles block the easterly trades, forcing them through the gaps between islands, accelerating wind speeds, sometimes dramatically. The winds were light on this day so we only got a nice sailing breeze out of the deal, not the powerful gusts that are more common. Sails were hoisted, the engine killed and the self-steering vane set up. We sailed away in engine-free silence on a course for the northwest corner of St. Vincent, the green peaks of St. Lucia already shrinking in our wake.",

Their dreary and unpeopled desolation had burned its acid print upon his memory. Bare and deserted by ten o'clock at night, those streets had been an aching monotony, a weariness of hard lights and empty pavements, a frozen torpor broken only occasionally by the footfalls of some prowler--some desperate, famished, lonely man who hoped past hope and past belief for some haven of comfort, warmth, and love there in the wilderness, for the sudden opening of a magic door into some secret, rich, and more abundant life. There had been many such, but they had never found what they were searching for. They had been dying in the darkness--without a goal, a certain purpose, or a door.",

He parks in front of that gorgeous fountain with the bodacious naked nymphs cavorting so pornographically with their phallic flock of stiff-necked giant swans. This fountain was built fairly recently, by Roman standards. According to my guidebook, the women who modeled for the nymphs were a pair of sisters, two popular burlesque dancers of their day. They gained a fair bit of notoriety when the fountain was completed; the church tried for months to prevent the thing from being unveiled because it was too sexy. The sisters lived well into old age, and even as late as the 1920s these two dignified old ladies could be seen walking together every day into the piazza to have a look at “their” fountain. And every year, once a year, for as long as he lived, the French sculptor who had captured them in marble during their prime would come to Rome and take the sisters out to lunch, where they would reminisce together about the days when they were all so young and beautiful and wild.",

The Party loosened its media reins when Deng Xiaoping, Mao’s successor, introduced market-oriented economic reforms in the late 1970s, and the press have endured brief periods of guarded openness followed by hard-line restrictions ever since. Some fairly hard-nosed investigative journals have even emerged, like Guangzhou’s Southern Weekend. English-language media are more conservative than their Chinese counterparts, though—perhaps because, as a colleague put it, “you can tell your own people about certain problems in your country, but not foreigners. We have to save face.”",

From the beginning, this leopard-eyed saint has outworked and outwalked us all; not once have I seen him downhearted or tired, nor has he responded with sullenness or rudeness to my own evil temper of these recent days. On the steepest slopes, pausing to rest, he talks to whoever is at hand, his soft deep voice as soothing and pervasive as this southern wind. All animals and wayfarers are Tukten’s friends, and listen to him carefully, yet he rarely speaks except when spoken to, and never seems to speak too much; without obtruding, he becomes the center of each situation, so naturally does he belong where the moment finds him.",

Or maybe they’ll even still keep the Air Force since a lot of people came into it out of the cradle before they had time to learn to do anything else but fly, and even in peace these ones will still have to eat at least now and then——’ still backing away because Bridesman was still waving him back, still keeping the Aldis aligned; ‘—out here three years, and nothing, then one night he sits in a locked hangar with a pen knife and a lap-full of wooden blocks and does what Ball nor McCudden nor Mannock nor Bishop nor none of them ever did: brought down a whole German general: and get the barnacle at Buckingham palace his next leave—except that there wont be any, there’s nothing now to be on leave from, and even if there was, what decoration will they give for that, Bridesman?—All right,’ he said, ‘all right, I’ll cover my face too——’",

He used to carry around a stack of clipboards and notepads. He’d take copious notes, creating a complete record of everything he did during the course of each day. I remember running into him once in downtown Fairbanks. As I walked up, he got out a clipboard, logged in the time he saw me and recorded what our conversation was about—which wasn’t much at all. His notes on our meeting were three or four pages down, behind all the other stuff he’d already scribbled that day. Somewhere he must have had piles and piles and piles of notes like that, which I’m sure would have made sense to no one except John.”",

I had to explain to him twice why my friends and I couldn’t stay for longer than this quick stop. Meanwhile, I was calculating: I could stay that night in Ulan-Ude in a hotel—clearly I couldn’t stay in his apartment, with the invalid parent there, and Sasha himself in the hospital—and Sergei and Volodya could camp somewhere outside the city, as Sergei would no doubt want to do, and then tomorrow evening they could come back in and pick me up . . .

However as she got closer she discovered there was a scorpion in the path and the Saudi fellow was seeking to protect her dog from danger. How easy it was to jump to conclusions, pigeonholing each other on the basis of previous encounters. A conversation ensued and a British fellow on the way past in a golf cart grabbed a club and took care of the scorpion while the Saudi couple petted and cooed over Lani’s dog.",

Up the road at the aptly named Modern Bazaar, cows and beggars graze around McDonald’s and Pizza Hut, and shoeshine boys sit on the steps of a delicatessen that sells Australian meat and Italian cheese. The ubiquitous fast-food duo were here when we arrived but they are fast facing competition. Every week a new shop opens and by the end of summer there’re Benetton, Nike, Adidas, Levi’s, Pepe Jeans, and an American-style bar called Thank God It’s Friday where staff wear baseball caps, name tags and rows of badges on elastic suspenders. But the hottest hangout of all is the brand-new Barista coffee shop, part of a chain leading a lust for lattes in this traditional chai town. Each café is contemporary cool combined with eighties nostalgia—teenagers sit in jeans and T-shirts and strum guitars while singing along to Billy Joel and John Denver songs. Karaoke is also catching on, with Western songs regularly massacred. The hot favorite is “Hotel California”—almost unrecognizable when screeched in a strong Hindi accent at double decibels.",

Coming across a small pool I threw myself down and without taking any precautions began to drink the water in mighty gulps. The results were awful. It turned out that this was one of those pools in which water-buffaloes are accustomed to wallow in the hot weather, and which contain more mire than water.

Somewhere, with punctual developing monotony, a single drop of water was falling into the wet black basin of a sink. He paused in the wide corridor of the first floor to control the nervous thudding of his heart. Then he walked half-way down and entered the waiting-room of Dr J. H. Coker. It was vacant. Frowning, he sniffed the air. The whole building was sharp with the clean nervous odour of antiseptics. A litter of magazines – Life, Judge, The Literary Digest, and The American – on the black mission table told its story of weary and distressed fumbling. The inner door opened and the doctor’s assistant, Miss Ray, came out. She had on her hat. She was ready to depart.",

Where, above all, is the chocolate fudge frosting?’ This was just meat and potatoes, just natural unenhanced flavour. ‘No wonder it’s never caught on over here,’ I grumbled and pushed it back into the bag.",

We met three buses coming up the Malakand Pass on the wrong side, their roofs piled with a singing, waving overflow of passengers and their wheels inches from lethal drops as they swung around hairpin bends. Our driver seemed to keep his right hand permanently out of the window, in order to squeeze his bulbous rubber horn; no doubt he reckoned that negotiating such bends without a horn would be even more dangerous than steering with one hand.",

All our things were drenched, the tea leaves stewing among my socks and T-shirts. There was no heating, so wrapped in towels and bed sheets we made our way up to the restaurant, where a fire burned in a corner and wooden tables were lined with diners hunched over steaming bowls of chilli noodles. A bowl of meaty thukpa and a frisbee-sized piece of sweet, deep-fried Tibetan bread brought the pulse back into my veins before we slid mournfully back into wet trousers and made our way down to the town to buy some dry clothes.",

I slipped into fantasy and was particularly tormented by one dream: a cheese-and-onion omelette in the old-folks’ home in La Paz. I couldn’t get that sizzling skillet out of my mind, and my empty belly howled for food.",

I try to do both things at once, which short-circuits all thinking, and I succeed at neither. A sleepwalking auto-pilot gets me where I am going, and the whole procedure is eery and uncomfortable. In that sense, I am not a good traveller. If you told me I had to move every night and sleep somewhere new each time, I’d probably cry. I don’t like travelling. I like emigrating. I like getting where I’m going, and then setting up shop.",

    "target_paragraph": "Fortuyn’s critics often lumped him together with other far-right politicians such as Jean-Marie Le Pen, but Fortuyn himself strongly rejected the comparison. He held no truck with anti-Semitism and urged the Dutch to support ‘enlightened’ Israel over its fundamentalist enemies. His trick was to present intolerance of Muslims as a means of safeguarding Dutch tolerance. When a Dutch imam famously said that homosexuals were pigs, Fortuyn said that the imam had a right to voice that opinion – but that Fortuyn himself also had a right to say that the imam’s religion was achterlijk, ‘backward’ or ‘retarded’. Only by kicking out intolerant foreigners could the Netherlands preserve its peace and prosperity, he maintained. In his personal life Fortuyn behaved in ways unlikely to endear himself to the far right, giving interviews in which he discussed not only his hatred of radical Islam but also his opinions on what semen tasted like. ‘I don’t hate Arab men – I even sleep with them,’ he said. A local legend in Rotterdam told of Fortuyn bumping into a colleague when visiting a gay bar, and spending the evening discussing local tax policy while completely naked except for a pair of shoes.",

The fountain in the Square pulsed with a cold breezeless jet, and behind the greasy windows of a luncheon room he could see a man in a dim light seated on a stool and drinking coffee, and the swart muscular Greek leaned over the counter, his furrowed inch of brow painfully bent upon the columns of a newspaper.",
