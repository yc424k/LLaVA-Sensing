We ended up at the Von Putnamers’ ranch, they’re friends of Jorge’s, particularly one who’s a Peronist, always drunk, and the best of the three. I was able to diagnose a tumor in the occipital zone that was probably of hydatic origin. We’ll have to wait and see what happens. We will leave for Bariloche in two or three days and intend to travel at a leisurely pace. Send me a letter poste restante if it can arrive by February 10 or 12.

He moved right up the center of the street, shooting cleanly from left to right as he went. Halfway up the hill, the second-story window of a negro tenement flew open. An old negro man, the janitor of an office building in the Square, stuck out his ancient head of cotton wool. Dick swiveled and shot casually from his hip. The shot tore the top of the old negro’s head off.",

Bobcats—admittedly much smaller creatures than mountain lions—are known to exist in considerable numbers and yet are so shy and furtive that you would never guess their existence. Many forest rangers go whole careers without seeing one. And there is certainly ample room in the eastern woods for large cats to roam undisturbed. Massachusetts alone has 250,000 acres of woodland, 100,000 of it in the comely Berkshires. From where I was now, I could, given the will and a more or less infinite supply of noodles, walk all the way to Cape Chidley in northern Quebec, 1,800 miles away on the icy Labrador Sea, and scarcely ever have to leave the cover of trees. Even so, it is unlikely that a large cat could survive in sufficient numbers to breed not just in one area but evidently all over New England and escape notice for nine decades. Still, there was that scat. Whatever it was, it excreted like a mountain lion.",

He knew it would be against them before nightfall, but he didn’t know by how much. Keep that one to yourself, he thought. By early afternoon the tide had changed, and their speed dropped to under four knots. He checked their position and knew they wouldn’t make it to Colonial Beach before nightfall – and, if memory served him, there were no places to anchor along this part of the river – too shallow and too narrow.

Mitchell-Innes was sacked for alleged irregularities in his handling of Treasury accounts (though he went on to be an inspector of prisons in England). And in 1938 there arrived in the colony, as Director of Air Raid Precautions, Wing-Commander A. H. S. Steele-Perkins, a highly regarded expert in civil defence. Almost at once the colony corrupted him, and he became all too friendly with Miss Mimi Lau, secretary of the Chinese company that supplied pre-cast concrete blocks for his air-raid shelters. Unfortunately the blocks, though suspiciously expensive, were undoubtedly sub-standard. In the course of consequent inquiries into the conduct of Steele-Perkins’ department, revealing all manner of peculation, its chief architect shot himself, one of its executive engineers tried to commit suicide, witnesses vanished and documents disappeared. Steele-Perkins himself was never charged, but his defective materials went for a time into the Hong Kong vernacular as ‘Mimi Lau blocks’.",

The cousin dropped me at a turning off the Panamerican and continued his journey alone; I picked up a colectivo into town and checked into a hotel. My room had a kind of quilted wallpaper, spongy carpet and no windows, creating the effect of a padded cell. Curicó itself, I discovered when I ventured outside, was old-fashioned and provincial: shopkeepers wore white coats and fetched goods from deep wooden drawers and polished shelves, and a pharmacy where I bought a tube of toothpaste had rows of tall glass jars filled with bright liquids and white powders in its cabinets. It was a world away from Santiago.",

I’ve had my bellyful of it.… I’m fed up all the way to here!’ he whispered, and he struck himself fiercely at the base of the throat. He coughed suddenly, briefly, terribly, and with a swift impatient movement of his hot corded fingers he snatched a towel from the rack beside the water-basin, pressed his lowered face into it and then stared for a moment with an expression of intent and fascinated disgust into its folds, then he flung the bloodied rag away impatiently.",

It had been a five-year remission – five great years he thought with his dad, but now that was over, the cancer had returned, and this time, it was going to get him.

Signs were interchanged, when, as if to fulfil some scheme arranged already, now a summit dwindled, now a whole block of pyramidal size which had kept its station inalterably advanced into the midst or gravely led the procession to fresh anchorage. Fixed though they seemed at their posts, at rest in perfect unanimity, nothing could be fresher, freer, more sensitive superficially than the snow-white or gold-kindled surface; to change, to go, to dismantle the solemn assemblage was immediately possible; and in spite of the grave fixity, the accumulated robustness and solidity, now they struck light to the earth, now darkness.",

Something of an unknown kind would decide both the coming year and the coming hour. Now and again, in his vigil, he sought the light in the long windows, or glanced at the ray which gilded a few leaves and a few blades of grass in the little garden. For a long time the light burnt without changing. He had just reached the limit of his beat and was turning, when the front door opened, and the aspect of the house was entirely changed. A black figure came down the little pathway and paused at the gate. Denham understood instantly that it was Rodney. Without hesitation, and conscious only of a great friendliness for anyone coming from that lighted room, he walked straight up to him and stopped him. In the flurry of the wind Rodney was taken aback, and for the moment tried to press on, muttering something, as if he suspected a demand upon his charity.",

It was dotty to leave Tukuyu at 5.50 a.m. in rainy darkness – ‘But so what?’ I said to myself, pushing Lear up a steep main street pitted with craterous pot-holes. I was too impatient for my first glimpse of Lake Nyasa to be detained by the sort of steady cold rain not unknown in Ireland. Then the first light glimmered over the Kipengere Range – sulphurous streaks amidst heavy clouds lying along the summits. Free-wheeling down from the ridgetop, I thought of the runner who left Tukuyu (then Neu Langenburg) on 15 August 1914, bearing an urgent message from Herr Stier, the German Imperial Administrator of the district, to his friend Mr Webb, the British Resident at Karonga, sixty miles away. Poor Herr Stier had heard rumours of war but his anxious pleas for information from Mbeya had been ignored, or not received. So he wrote to Mr Webb: ‘I am not clear whether England is at war with Germany or not.’ Courteously Mr Webb replied, clarifying the situation; and that, one supposes, put an end to a beautiful friendship.",

To all intents and purposes there was no state, and everything, for better or worse, was left to the initiative of the individual. In this respect nothing has changed; indeed it looks as if any semblance of central government control has now broken down completely.",

People remember where they were when they heard that a supertanker had run aground. By morning, when word began to spread, ten million gallons of crude oil had poured through its breached hull and into Prince William Sound. The Valdez’s crew was slow to report the incident, and essential spill-response equipment was in dry dock, buried under snow. The gravity of the situation was slow to sink in. Kristin Carpenter’s husband, Danny, was watching the spill unfold on TV with some fellow fishermen; one of them wondered aloud if they’d be able to get back to work the next week. Hundreds of newspeople swarmed into the town of twenty-five hundred, including my father, who was working as a cameraman for the CBS Evening News. (His chief memory was getting up at 5:00 A.M. to take a shower, because that’s when the hotel ran out of hot water.) Images of dead birds, sea otters coated in crude, and people wiping down oil-slicked rocks with paper towels were all over the national news and remained there for months.",

A smell of disinfectants hung in the cold air, and once, through a half-open door, a sickening odour came: he remembered it at Châlons, and Fortin’s murmured: “Gangrene—ah, if only we could get them sooner!”",

It seemed as if hardly any time had passed when she heard the household moving briskly about, and breakfast preparing downstairs; though on rousing herself to robe and descend she found that the sun was throwing his rays completely over the tree-tops, a progress in the world’s diurnal turn denoting that at least three hours had elapsed since she last looked out of the window.",

To my eye, the rugged textures and the strong color contrasts of the typical Tuscan house create the most welcoming rooms of any architectural style I know. Fresh and serene in summer, they look secure and cozy in winter. Tropical houses with bamboo ceilings and shuttered walls that open to catch every breeze, and the adobe houses of the Southwest, with their banquettes and fireplaces that are rounded like the curves of the human body, impart the same connected sense: I could live here. The architecture seems natural, as if these houses grew out of the land and were easily shaped by the human hand. In Italian, a coat of paint or wax is a mano, a hand of that substance. Before the plastering started, I noticed Fabio’s initials scratched in a patch of wet cement. The Poles, I remembered, wrote POLONIA at the base of the stone wall. I wonder if archaeologists find many reminders of the anonymous hands behind enduring work. On the wall of the prehistoric Pech Merle cave in France, I was stunned to see handprints, like ones children make in kindergarten, above the spotted horses. The actual “signature” of the preliterate artist outlined in blood, soot, ashes! When the great tombs of Egypt were opened, the footprints of the last person out before the entrances were sealed remained in the sand: the last work finished, a day’s work over.",

Teresa consulted our guidebook. “It’s the Mosque of Amr ibn al-‘As,” she read aloud. After hours of walking across Cairo, we had finally found a historic site: the oldest mosque in Africa. The original mosque was constructed in AD 642, of palm trunks, mud bricks, and thatched fronds, not long after Amr led his invasion across Egypt. That structure was razed and remodeled several times, and it was completely destroyed, in 1169, when Shawar, Egypt’s vizier, ordered all of Cairo burned to the ground to prevent its capture during the Crusades. The current mosque reportedly straddles the original building’s foundation, but with all the renovations and reconstruction and periods of desuetude, I questioned whether it’s fair to call this the oldest mosque in Africa. Teresa scowled. “The mosque is the congregation, not the building itself,” she argued. The mosque is open to the public, but we each felt underdressed for a proper visit. We settled instead on a peek through the gates before moving on.",

For thousands of years, the islands of the Alexander Archipelago had been primarily the territory of the Tlingit. (A third group, the Haida, arrived from the south in the eighteenth century.) The Annette Island end of the Alaska panhandle is at roughly the same latitude as Edinburgh. The warm Kuroshio Current flows north from Japan and east across the Pacific Ocean, bringing moderate temperatures and biblical amounts of precipitation. Most of the Inside Passage is temperate rainforest. Tlingit culture developed in concert with such a rich environment. Sturdy spruce, hemlock, and cedar were used to build longhouses, carve totem poles, and craft dugout canoes. The sea provided an inexhaustible source of protein, especially salmon. Fishing rights to specific areas were carefully managed by individual families.",

According to the morning paper, Hancock’s daughter had filed a lawsuit alleging that the widow Rose and the late Mr. Hancock had “lavishly and improperly spent money that was not their own.” Helpfully the article provided a sidebar in which Mrs. Hancock’s principal assets were listed. These included a A$35-million house in a Perth suburb called Mosman Park, complete with the address. It was apparently the grandest residence in the city; the chandeliers alone had cost A$3 million. Looking at my map of the city, I realized that Mosman Park was at the far end of a clutch of famously well heeled suburbs running all the way to Fremantle, and as it was a fine day and I was feeling perky, I decided to walk out.",

It was just outside his window, bigger, more shabby; when he and the officer passed beneath it to enter, with no wind to cause it it had set up a sudden frenzied clashing as though they had startled it, and twice more during the night while he stood, shifting his hands from time to time as that portion of the bars which they clasped grew warm and began to sweat on his palms, it clashed again in that brief sudden inexplicable flurry. Then the tide began to fall in the river and he could smell that too—the sour smell of salt flats where oyster shells and the heads of shrimp rotted, and hemp and old piling. Then dawn began (he had been hearing the shrimp boats putting out for some time) and he could see the draw bridge on which the railroad to New Orleans crossed standing suddenly against the paling sky and he heard the train from New Orleans and watched the approaching smoke then the train itself crawling across the bridge, high and toylike and pink like something bizarre to decorate a cake with, in the flat sun that was already hot. Then the train was gone, the pink smoke. The palm beyond the window began to murmur, dry and steady, and he felt the cool morning breeze from the sea, steady and filled with salt, clean and iodinic in the cell above the smell of creosote and tobacco-spit and old vomit; the sour smell of the flats went away and now there would be a glitter on the tidechopped water, the gars roiling sluggishly up and then down again among the floating garbage. Then he heard feet on the stairs and the jailor entered with a tin mug of coffee and a piece of factory-made coffee cake. “You want anything else?” he said. “Any meat?”",
