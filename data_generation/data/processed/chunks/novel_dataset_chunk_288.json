There are the patisseries offering delicious baguettes and strong French coffee; there are the neon-lit boats, scarlet and white, that cruise along the Saigon River after dark, scattering a magic swirl of colors. In the early afternoon, a siesta sleepiness falls over the place, as the beauty-parlor girls recline on their chairs. And at night, you can go for drinks at the rooftop bar of the Rex Hotel, once a U.S. bachelor officers’ quarters and still a decidedly zany place, with Saigon beauties smiling at every available male, and statues of nude figures and prancing elephants around the bonsai trees. On hot afternoons, I often stopped off in a garden café and sipped citrons pressés to the sound of “Me and You and a Dog Named Boo” or some husky latter-day Piaf, as the day’s heat began to lift and the local sparks to show off their latest acquisitions.",

Metlakatla is the only one of Alaska’s 229 Native communities that is also an Indian reservation, and while everyone was perfectly friendly, I couldn’t escape the feeling, as I watched the performance, that I’d invaded a private gathering. I scanned the audience for any other out-of-place faces until I found one, belonging to U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski. No one seemed to find this at all unusual; indeed, several people told me later that in Alaska, even people in remote villages expect their national elected officials to come through town regularly. As I watched Murkowski politely clap along to the beat, a fellow came up alongside and asked if my name was Mark.",

A short while later, we found a serpentine ramp that twisted down the high riverbank, toward the water. At its end, we stood on a lonely dock and waited for the ferry that would bring us to our next hotel: the Mövenpick Resort Aswan, on Elephantine Island, in the heart of the Nile. The resort is a large complex with a tower, barracks, and villas surrounded by lush, green grass, delicate trees, and the gentle blue river. But, from our perch on the dock, we could barely discern the hotel from the sandy hills behind it. The sun’s rays blurred colors and shapes, and I had trouble seeing more than a concrete box across the way. The island itself was a green strip on the near horizon, floating in the river, but the hotel was a mystery. What lay over there, across that blue water?",

He loved her dearly, though perhaps rather ideally than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for him. He had entertained no notion, when doomed as he had thought to an unintellectual bucolic life, that such charms as he beheld in this idyllic creature would be found behind the scenes. Unsophistication was a thing to talk of; but he had not known how it really struck one until he came here. But he was very far from seeing his future track clearly, and it might be a year or two before he would be able to consider himself fairly started in life. The secret lay in the tinge of recklessness imparted to his career and character by the sense that he had been made to miss his true destiny through the prejudices of his family.",

The little boy had instantly guessed that something was wrong when his mother, instead of exclaiming: “Why, there’s Grandpa!” had abruptly remembered that, good gracious, she’d never ordered the yeast from Sproul’s Bakery, and had jerked Vance back there without seeming to notice Mr. Scrimser.

    "target_paragraph": "To the delight and pride of his parents, Huggins qualified as a lawyer in 1902; to their dismay, he then declined to practice. Instead he took up professional baseball, which in 1902 was only about two steps up from working in a brothel, or so at least it must have seemed to his parents. For the next dozen years Huggins performed competently if not outstandingly as an infielder for the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinals before eventually becoming a player-manager and then just manager of the latter. When invited to take over the Yankees in 1917, he was skeptical and reluctant. The Yankees were a mediocre team, and he viewed the move as a demotion. But he won pennants in 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1926, and by midsummer of 1927 was clearly headed for another. Though not loved by his players, particularly Ruth, who fought with him endlessly and called him “the Flea,” Huggins treated them well and trusted them to make the right decisions on the field, unlike John McGraw of the Giants, who considered his players “incapable of thought.” With Ruth, his forbearance was at times close to saintly.",

The Cerro de la Pila, with its murderous concealed artillery, lay perfectly quiet, except that up one side of it, so clear was the air, we could make out a little knot of figures dragging what looked like a cannon. Just outside of the nearest houses some horsemen were riding around; we immediately struck north, making a wide detour, carefully on the watch, for this intermediate ground was overrun by pickets and scouting parties. About a mile beyond, almost along the foot of the hill, ran the high road from the north to Lerdo.\nWe reconnoitered this carefully from the brush. A peasant passed whistling, driving a flock of goats. On the very edge of this road, under a bush, was an earthen jar full of milk. Without the least hesitation the first soldier drew his revolver and shot. The jar split into a hundred pieces—milk spurting everywhere.",

Jain, for example, my constant guide in Burma, informed me that he had befriended a girl from Seattle on her first seven-day trip around his closed country; he had traveled with her, chastely, when she returned for another visit, and had listened, in surprise, as she told him on the eve of her departure that she loved him; and, after she had turned around in Bangkok and flown back for a third seven-day stay, he had taken her to be his wife in the drafty old Anglican church in Rangoon. They had enjoyed a six-day honeymoon around Burma; then she had returned to Washington, and he to working outside the Strand Hotel in order to save up for his ticket—though she had offered to pay, he said, he did not wish her to feel used. And though his mother was grieving that she might never see him again, he had tried to convince her that his was truly an affair of the heart. “My wife is not beautiful,” he said quietly, “but I can really say I love her. And look at me. I have no job. I am not handsome. I have no degree. I am just a driver. I think she must love me for myself.”",

My cell-like room, at the end of this corridor, had a balcony overlooking a garbage dump; beyond rose a once-gracious mansion converted to flats. A bulky TV set dominated the cell; Abd apologised because at present the power was cut off, but within an hour or so some of my 80 shekels might have enabled it to be restored. The nearby cupboard-like WC was W-less. Abd pulled the antique chain to confirm this fact, then said ‘Tomorrow’ with unconvincing confidence. My door had no key, bolt or hasp but that didn’t matter; dereliction doesn’t necessarily engender bad vibes.",

Nearly all the leaflets were depressingly illiterate, particularly with regard to punctuation—I sometimes think that if I see one more tourist leaflet that says “Englands Best” or “Britains Largest,” I will go and torch the place—and they all seemed so pathetically modest in what they had to offer. Nearly all of them padded out their lists of featured attractions with things like “Free Car Park,” “Gift Shop and Tearoom,” and the inevitable “Adventure Playground” (and then were witless enough to show you in the photograph that it was just a climbing frame and a couple of plastic animals on springs).

We saw Chuqui in the distance, like an eruption in the desert. It was as if we were approaching a pollution factory. When we got there, the streets were empty, their identical houses built in close rows and numbered like prisoners. We walked around for a while. Besides the plant and the houses there wasn’t much, except a Seventh Day Adventist church designed to resemble one sail of the Sydney Opera House, some semi-detached managerial houses and, in the middle, an army barracks guarded by soldiers who looked at us as if we had just murdered their children. Chuqui’s colourless, austere buildings and joyless streets where the odd dog pursued a plastic wrapper caught by the breeze reminded me of the outskirts of Warsaw. A man passed us on a bicycle, pedalling in the direction of the obese chimneys which cast a yellow pall over the houses.",

The hill is flattened at the top to form a plateau, and is appended, like the full-stop in an exclamation mark, to a long rocky ridge which rises in a gradual incline to the south. There are two houses on the plateau, one big and one small, and I was set down in front of the latter. This was to be my abode for some months, so as soon as I arrived I made a tour of inspection. It did not take long. I found an oblong, one-storeyed building, with thick walls whitewashed inside and out. There were two communicating rooms, two verandahs, one in front and the other behind, and an outhouse bathroom in a corner of the back porch, from which stone steps led down to a small walled courtyard at the foot of the stony ridge. There were no windows, but five doorways, one from each room to each verandah, and one between the two rooms. The house was simply furnished. Canvas carpets, striped blue and red, covered both the floors, and across the thresholds of the open doorways long linen curtains of a rose pattern floated in the breeze. A round table and three chairs completed the sitting-room; in the other was a gigantic iron bedstead and a small table with a mirror on it. The outhouse contained a bath-tub on a wooden platform, some large earthenware water-vessels, a po, a close-stool, and a washstand. The washstand contained a little water and a drowned mouse.",

Then the spout of the tea-kettle puffed steam at her and she moved it away. The wind was rattling the windows in the back room; it was bending the little bushes; they still had no leaves on them. It was what a man said under a fig tree, on a hill, she thought. And then another man wrote it down. But suppose that what that man says is just as false as what this man – she touched the press cuttings with her spoon – says about Digby? And here am I, she thought, looking at the china in the Dutch cabinet, in this drawing-room, getting a little spark from what someone said all those years ago – here it comes (the china was changing from blue to livid) skipping over all those mountains, all those seas.

After six years in the force his nerve broke – ‘everyone wants to kill you’ – and he joined the ANC and moved to Khayelitsha as an ‘organizer’. Joining the ANC was for him, I gathered, an ‘insurance-policy’ move rather than a conversion. However, it is no protection against the PAC, who particularly dislike black policemen (or even ex-policemen) so Phineas confines himself to MK-controlled sections. He advised me to do the same. ‘The PAC keep away from this side, here is safe. Khayelitsha is a very big place – so big! But without amenities, very bad for children. Toilet dirt comes onto the roads, in summer you can smell it from the N2 and people say we live like animals. How would they live, without amenities?’",
