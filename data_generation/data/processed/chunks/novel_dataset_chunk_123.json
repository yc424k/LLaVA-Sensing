Then she saw it, the booksatchel, and lifted it from the floor and turned again. He heard the door again. So she hasn’t told him yet, he thought. He knew the brother too. He would not have waited to take her home first, he would have come in at once, vindicated at last after five years of violent and unsupported conviction. That would be something, anyway. It would not be penetration, true enough, but it would be the same flesh, the same warm living flesh in which the same blood ran, under impact at least—a paroxysm, an orgasm of sorts, a katharsis, anyway—something. So he got up and went to his desk and sat down and squared the clock-face (it sat at an oblique angle, so he could see it from the point before the recitation bench where he usually stood) toward him. He knew the distance between the school and the Varner home and he had ridden that horse back and forth to the University enough to calculate time in horse-distance. He will gallop back too, he thought. So he measured the distance the minute hand would have to traverse and sat watching it as it crept toward the mark. Then he looked up at the only comparatively open space in the room, which still had the stove in it, not to speak of the recitation bench. The stove could not be moved, but the bench could. But even then.… Maybe he had better meet the brother out doors, or someone might get hurt. Then he thought that that was exactly what he wanted: for somebody to get hurt, and then he asked himself quietly, Who? and answered himself: I dont know. I dont care. So he looked back at the clock-face. Yet even when a full hour had passed he still could not admit to himself that the final disaster had befallen him. He is lying in ambush for me with the pistol, he thought. But where? What ambush? What ambush could he want better than here? already seeing her entering the room again tomorrow morning, tranquil, untroubled, not even remembering, carrying the cold potato which at recess she would sit on the sunny steps and eat like one of the unchaste and perhaps even anonymously pregnant immortals eating bread of Paradise on a sunwise slope of Olympus.",

She told me to take the medicine four times a day and eight tablets a day for a week. No one would commit themselves to naming either remedy, but I paid my 4/– and bore them away, hoping for the best. The tablets were obviously of the sulpha group, the medicine could have been anything. I was astonished when my cough dwindled after the first dose and almost stopped after the second.",

In an odd way the very things that had made Aberdeen seem so dull and predictable the night before now made it feel comfortable and homey.

The second night after Vance’s return there was a belated snowfall, and the next morning when he opened the shutters he looked out on a world of white ablaze under a spring sun. It was a Saturday, thank heaven, and there could be no question of going to the office. For forty-eight hours he and Laura Lou could range as they willed through this new world. The winter, so far, had been harsh but almost snowless; now, in early March, with the smell of buds in the air, Vance was seeing for the first time the magic of a snowstorm on the Hudson. If only they could climb to Thundertop! Was it possible, he wondered? The snow was not so deep, after all; it would be melting soon, under such a sun. What did Laura Lou think? She thought as he did: anything that seemed possible to him always seemed so to her. She had never before regarded a snowstorm as something to be admired, but merely as an opportunity for fun; staying away from school, sleighing, snowballing, and coasting. But now that he pointed out its beauties he could see she was ashamed of having looked upon them as created for her own amusement--as if she had stripped the hangings from a sanctuary to dress herself up in. Vance was touched by her compliance, her passionate eagerness to see what he saw, hear what he heard--and then, in spite of himself, irritated by her inability to be more than his echo. But today the glory was so searching and miraculous that he was sure she must feel it. “Come, wrap up warm and we’ll take some hot coffee and sandwiches, and see how high we can scramble up the mountain.” Mrs. Tracy had gone off to spend a night with Upton, and they had the freedom of the little house, and felt like lovers honeymooning again. Laura Lou filled the thermos with boiling coffee, made some sandwiches with the cold meat Mrs. Tracy had left for dinner, and got into her rubber boots and her thickest coat. Vance wanted to hire their neighbour’s cutter; but Laura Lou was frightened lest her mother should hear of this extravagance, so they set out on foot, laughing and swinging their joined hands like schoolchildren. The snow was soft--too soft for easy walking. But Vance’s feet were winged, as they had been when he first saw the sea; and Laura Lou sprang on after him, exulting and admiring. “Oh, Vanny--do look! Isn’t it just like powdered sugar? Or one of those lovely Christmas cards with the stuff that sparkles?” Luckily he hardly heard her, saw only the radiant oval of her face under the shaggy knitted cap pulled down over crimson ear-tips.",

The lagoon is at the end of one of Wayra’s shortest trails, less than a few minutes’ walk from her cage. It’s milky brown, kidney-shaped, with shrubs and tall, thin trees huddling around the edges. The beach is sandy dirt, the colour of caramel. It angles sharply downwards, and another runner rope—not long, perhaps four metres—stretches parallel to the bank. Wayra stays here for hours. Soft green curtains of creepers trail into the water, which glistens as if made of glass. It smells of vegetation, rich, almost spicy. The ground is peppered with red and black seeds, the kind that are made into necklaces and waved at every tourist. I have a bracelet myself, buried in my backpack, which makes me feel strange when I think about it, like the person who bought that bracelet was another person entirely.",

He cursed the sounds from the bottom of his heart. They reminded him of that infamous apparition, of all he most ardently desired to forget. His laughter died down. Wanly he looked at his mirthful pagans, the embodiment of joys. Yes; these were his distractions, his playmates, his elixir of life, his antidote against the only disease, the only sin, crime, vice which he recognized on earth—a vice none the less, because it happened to be the inevitable—the vice of old age. And all the time that pallid swarm came crowding on: messengers from the inexorable spectre. He felt them creeping about with ghostly tread, blighting the radiance of his life, tainting the very air he breathed. Hateful intruders! They wailed among his lilies. The garden was full of their horrid footsteps.",

I dragged the wooden picnic table close to the fireplace and this became my office and dining room. Next I built a ramada or sunshelter over both. The ramada is a simple affair: four upright posts about ten feet tall tied and braced with crosspoles and supporting a thatched roof of juniper branches, which keeps out the sunlight but lets smoke and heat filter up through. There are of course no walls to this structure. The floor is sandstone, swept clean by the winds, with a couple of wild shrubs – cliffrose and blackbush – growing in one corner. The windbells and the red bandana, my private flag, hang from the projecting end of one of the crosspoles. Finally I set up a cot near the ramada – not under it – and my home without walls was complete. I can sleep at night with nothing but space between me and the stars, comforted in the knowledge that I am not likely to miss anything important up there.",

West with the Night was published in America in 1942 and though it earned critical praise, that was the low ebb year of World War Two and people’s minds were not free to revel in a golden Africa. In 1943, when West with the Night came out in England, paper rationing buried a book after one small edition and curtailed newspapers had little space for book reviews. But in 1937, when the English-reading world thought itself still at peace, Karen Blixen’s Out of Africa appeared and had years to grow and spread and has become an accepted classic, the best known portrait of that Africa. I have re-read Out of Africa now for the first time since reading it soon after its publication; re-read and compared. I think West with the Night deserves a place as companion piece to Out of Africa.",

On the far end of the platform, most of the men wore djellabas, and many women wore dark-colored abayas. Nearer to us, a family sat on a bench. The father, olive-skinned and pudgy, wore dark-grey slacks and a striped polo shirt. The mother wore black slacks and a loose blouse; her hair was in a bun, bare of any hijab. Their children, two boys and a teenage girl, wore jeans and T-shirts. After a few minutes, I realized the platform was segregated by passenger class. The men and women dressed in traditional garb would be in second class; they waited at the far end of the platform. The first-class cars would be directly behind the engine, at the front of the train, where we waited, along with a few other passengers. By their dress, I presumed they were Coptic. I wondered whether it was a firm class division, but I decided not to ask the question; it seemed to beg for trouble.",

It was intensely cold and soon the snow had turned to sleet-cum-hail-cum-rain. We marched on miserably, unable to see far, while the wind whined steadily through the stiff ichu grass. Everywhere the ground was impossibly water-logged – and anyway it would have been lunatic to unpack (unless forced to by darkness) in such dire weather. I hoped desperately that we might come upon a tambo shack, but humanity has made no mark on these desolate heights. Then at last our path rose still higher, taking us onto the shoulder of a cloud-wrapped mountain where we found a wide ledge, with abundant grazing. As the light faded the sleet eased off and the wind dropped; so by working as quickly as numbed fingers permitted, and using unwonted ingenuity, we contrived to keep our night-gear dry. We then huddled close in the tent, thawing each other while eating an unhelpful supper of bread buns, frankfurters that had frozen in their tin and water that was already iced. ‘I think if we ever come back to the Andes we should bring a stove’, said Rachel.",

As a rule, I am not terribly comfortable with any map that doesn’t have a You Are Here arrow on it somewhere, but the Ordnance Survey maps are in a league of their own. Coming from a country where mapmakers tend to exclude any landscape feature smaller than, say, Pikes Peak, I am constantly impressed by the richness of detail on the OS 1:25,000 series maps. They include every wrinkle and divot on the landscape, every barn, milestone, wind pump, and tumulus. They distinguish between sand pits and gravel pits and between power lines strung from pylons and power lines strung from poles. This one even included the stone seat on which I sat now. It astounds me to be able to look at a map and know to the square meter where my buttocks are deployed.",

Of course we knew from experience about the dubious piloting skills of some Chinese fishing boat navigators, so this wasn’t really a shock, and it’s not exactly like there have never been any shipwrecks on the atoll before. Much of Kanton’s history, like that of many low-lying atolls and reefs that are spread across the Pacific, was written by ships that have come to grief on its shores.",

When she got the rheumatism so bad she couldn’t move around she used to sit up there and watch the road by the hour; and one year, when they was six months mending the Bettsbridge pike3 after the floods, and Harmon Gow had to bring his stage round this way, she picked up so that she used to get down to the gate most days to see him. But after the trains begun running nobody ever come by here to speak of, and mother never could get it through her head what had happened, and it preyed on her right along till she died.”",

But Shiva, the oldest living God in the world, was still worshipped; Sanskrit—a language which predates any other living tongue by millennia—was still read, still spoken. Moreover, the sadhus and rishis— familiar figures from the Mahabharata—remained today, still following the rigorous laws of India’s most ancient vocation: giving up everything to wander the face of the earth in search of enlightenment; renouncing the profane in the hope of a brief glimpse of the sacred. In these wet and dishevelled figures sitting cross-legged under the neem and banyan trees of the river bank lay what must certainly be the most remarkable Delhi survival of all.",

    "target_paragraph": "Intramural romances spring up and prosper in places of learning, but some exotic psychological fluke directed my glance beyond the walls and, once more, out of bounds. It was a time when one falls in love hard and often, and my aesthetic notions, entirely formed by Andrew Lang’s Coloured Fairy Books, had settled years before on the long-necked, wide-eyed pre-Raphaelite girls in Henry Ford’s illustrations, interchangeably kings’ daughters, ice-maidens, goose-girls and water spirits, and my latest wanderings had led me, at the end of a green and sweet-smelling cave set dimly with flowers and multicoloured fruit and vegetation – a greengrocer’s shop, that is, which she tended for her father – to the vision of just such a being. The effect was instantaneous. She was twenty-four, a ravishing and sonnet-begetting beauty and I can see her now and still hear that melting and deep Kent accent. This sudden incongruous worship may have been a bore but she was too good-natured to show it, and perhaps she was puzzled by the verse which came showering in. I knew that such an association in the town, however innocent, broke a number of taboos too deep-rooted and well-understood to need any explicit veto; nevertheless I headed for the shop beyond the Cattle Market the moment I could escape. But the black clothes we wore, those stiff wing-collars and the wide and speckled straw boaters with their blue and white silk ribands were as conspicuous as broad-arrows. My footsteps were discreetly dogged, my devices known and after a week, I was caught red-handed – holding Nellie’s hand, that is to say, which is about as far as this suit was ever pressed; we were sitting in the back-shop on upturned apple-baskets – and my schooldays were over.",

Afterward he remembered the harpy effect that her old kimono gave her, and the cracked hollowness of her voice as she spoke:\n“You Princeton boys?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well, there’s one of you killed here, and two others about dead.”\n“My God!”\n“Look!” She pointed and they gazed in horror. Under the full light of a roadside arc-light lay a form, face downward in a widening circle of blood.\nThey sprang from the car. Amory thought of the back of that head—that hair—that hair . . . and then they turned the form over.\n“It’s Dick—Dick Humbird!”\n“Oh, Christ!”\n“Feel his heart!”\nThen the insistent voice of the old crone in a sort of croaking triumph:\n“He’s quite dead, all right. The car turned over. Two of the men that weren’t hurt just carried the others in, but this one’s no use.”\nAmory rushed into the house and the rest followed with a limp mass that they laid on the sofa in the shoddy little front parlor. Sloane, with his shoulder punctured, was on another lounge. He was half delirious, and kept calling something about a chemistry lecture at 8:10.\n“I don’t know what happened,” said Ferrenby in a strained voice. “Dick was driving and he wouldn’t give up the wheel; we told him he’d been drinking too much—then there was this damn curve—oh, my God! . . .” He threw himself face downward on the floor and broke into dry sobs.\nThe doctor had arrived, and Amory went over to the couch, where someone handed him a sheet to put over the body. With a sudden hardness, he raised one of the hands and let it fall back inertly. The brow was cold but the face not expressionless. He looked at the shoe-laces—Dick had tied them that morning. He had tied them—and now he was this heavy white mass. All that remained of the charm and personality of the Dick Humbird he had known—oh, it was all so horrible and unaristocratic and close to the earth. All tragedy has that strain of the grotesque and squalid—so useless, futile . . . the way animals die. . . . Amory was reminded of a cat that had lain horribly mangled in some alley of his childhood.\n“Someone go to Princeton with Ferrenby.”\nAmory stepped outside the door and shivered slightly at the late night wind—a wind that stirred a broken fender on the mass of bent metal to a plaintive, tinny sound.",
