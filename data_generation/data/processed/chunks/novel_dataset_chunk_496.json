The headless black woman is a carven agony beyond the fading placidity of the ungirdled maiden, and as the shadows and echoes blend the chained women raise their voices anew, lamenting thinly. (They were accosted. Whispers from every doorway, hands unchaste and importunate and rife in the tense wild darkness. Fairchild wavered beside him, and Gordon stopped again. “I’m going in here,” he said. “Give me some money.” The Semitic man gave him a nameless bill.) The wind rushes on, becoming filled with leaping figures antic as flames, and a sound of pipes fiery cold carves the world darkly out of space. The centaurs hooves clash, storming; shrill voices ride the storm like gusty birds, wild and passionate and sad. (A door opened in the wall. Gordon entered and before the door closed again they saw him in a narrow passageway lift a woman from the shadow and raise her against the mad stars, smothering her squeal against his tall kiss.) Then voices and sounds, shadows and echoes change form swirling, becoming the headless, armless, legless torso of a girl, motionless and virginal and passionately eternal before the shadows and echoes whirl away.",

I walked back and forth along the road for a while, and made a short detour down into the woods, just to see what it was like. There I had my first taste of Siberian mosquitoes, or vice versa. Alyosha took out a vehicle manual and pored over it. At one end of the road, a pale full moon rose. Then he removed the engine cover, laid his tools on the car seat, and went to work. The rest of us sat in the vehicle or on the road and talked. As the twilight imperceptibly darkened, the ratcheting of his wrenches and the murmur of our conversations were the only sounds.",

It was now also listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Beneath the stained-glass windows, swooping arcs and shitting pigeons we scoured the signs for the train to Parel, from where it was a short walk to the mall. Lower Parel was on a different line, but chopping and changing was a little ambitious for the moment. A driver who had stepped down from his engine to stretch and scratch flashed a smile and pointed to his train to tell us to board.",

Once or twice as I walked in the bazaars I looked through gateways into the courts of splendid khans, where the walls were decorated with contrasted patterns in limestone and basalt, and stripes of black and white masonry are used in many of the houses and mosques. The final history of Amida must wait upon a much more careful investigation of the town than any which has yet been undertaken.",

Born in a one-bedroom bungalow with no air-conditioning and six people to share it with, she was raised on beans, rice, and Catholicism. As the youngest daughter in a first-generation Mexican family, she was expected to stay home and take care of her parents in their aging years. So she caused quite an escándalo when at twenty-one she fell in love with a thirty-year-old white musician she met at a jazz club and married him three months later.

The picture of flashing field, of wood, and hill, stayed in his heart forever: lost in the dark land, he lay the night-long through within his berth, watching the shadowy and phantom South flash by, sleeping at length, and waking suddenly, to see cool lakes in Florida at dawn, standing quietly as if they had waited from eternity for this meeting; or hearing, as the train in the dark hours of morning slid into Savannah, the strange quiet voices of the men upon the platform, the boding faint echoes of the station, or seeing, in pale dawn, the phantom woods, a rutted lane, a cow, a boy, a drab, dull-eyed against a cottage door, glimpsed, at this moment of rushing time, for which all life had been a plot, to flash upon the window and be gone.",

This is because no matter how loving the parents, no matter how much the child would like, deep down, to trust them, there is always the thought that they will quietly lock the door at the top of the stairs and move to Florida. No, basements are deeply and inescapably scary—that’s why they always feature in spooky movies, usually with a shadow of Joan Crawford carrying an axe thrown on the far wall. That may be why even dads don’t go down there very often.",

    "target_paragraph": "Atlantic City. Amory paced the board walk at day’s end, lulled by the everlasting surge of changing waves, smelling the half-mournful odor of the salt breeze. The sea, he thought, had treasured its memories deeper than the faithless land. It seemed still to whisper of Norse galleys ploughing the water world under raven-figured flags, of the British dreadnoughts, gray bulwarks of civilization steaming up through the fog of one dark July into the North Sea.\n“Well—Amory Blaine!”\nAmory looked down into the street below. A low racing car had drawn to a stop and a familiar cheerful face protruded from the driver’s seat.\n“Come on down, goopher!” cried Alec.\nAmory called a greeting and descending a flight of wooden steps approached the car. He and Alec had been meeting intermittently, but the barrier of Rosalind lay always between them. He was sorry for this; he hated to lose Alec.\n“Mr. Blaine, this is Miss Waterson, Miss Wayne, and Mr. Tully.”\n“How d’y do?”\n“Amory,” said Alec exuberantly, “if you’ll jump in we’ll take you to some secluded nook and give you a wee jolt of Bourbon.”\nAmory considered.\n“That’s an idea.”\n“Step in—move over, Jill, and Amory will smile very handsomely at you.”\nAmory squeezed into the back seat beside a gaudy, vermilion-lipped blonde.\n“Hello, Doug Fairbanks,” she said flippantly. “Walking for exercise or hunting for company?”\n“I was counting the waves,” replied Amory gravely. “I’m going in for statistics.”\n“Don’t kid me, Doug.”\nWhen they reached an unfrequented side street Alec stopped the car among deep shadows.\n“What you doing down here these cold days, Amory?” he demanded, as he produced a quart of Bourbon from under the fur rug.\nAmory avoided the question. Indeed, he had had no definite reason for coming to the coast.\n“Do you remember that party of ours, sophomore year?” he asked instead.\n“Do I? When we slept in the pavilions up in Asbury Park—”\n“Lord, Alec! It’s hard to think that Jesse and Dick and Kerry are all three dead.”\nAlec shivered.\n“Don’t talk about it. These dreary fall days depress me enough.”\nJill seemed to agree.\n“Doug here is sorta gloomy anyways,” she commented. “Tell him to drink deep—it’s good and scarce these days.”\n“What I really want to ask you, Amory, is where you are—”\n“Why, New York, I suppose—”\n“I mean tonight, because if you haven’t got a room yet you’d better help me out.”\n“Glad to.”\n“You see, Tully and I have two rooms with bath between at the Ranier, and he’s got to go back to New York. I don’t want to have to move. Question is, will you occupy one of the rooms?”\nAmory was willing, if he could get in right away.\n“You’ll find the key in the office; the rooms are in my name.”\nDeclining further locomotion or further stimulation, Amory left the car and sauntered back along the board walk to the hotel.\nHe was in an eddy again, a deep, lethargic gulf, without desire to work or write, love or dissipate. For the first time in his life he rather longed for death to roll over his generation, obliterating their petty fevers and struggles and exultations. His youth seemed never so vanished as now in the contrast between the utter loneliness of this visit and that riotous, joyful party of four years before. Things that had been the merest commonplaces of his life then, deep sleep, the sense of beauty around him, all desire, had flown away and the gaps they left were filled only with the great listlessness of his disillusion.\n“To hold a man a woman has to appeal to the worst in him.” This sentence was the thesis of most of his bad nights, of which he felt this was to be one. His mind had already started to play variations on the subject. Tireless passion, fierce jealousy, longing to possess and crush—these alone were left of all his love for Rosalind; these remained to him as payment for the loss of his youth—bitter calomel under the thin sugar of love’s exaltation.\nIn his room he undressed and wrapping himself in blankets to keep out the chill October air drowsed in an armchair by the open window.\nHe remembered a poem he had read months before:",

Goodwill, however, is powerless against sheer need, especially in a country as broken as Cambodia: when a foreign company comes in and wants to build a hotel larger than four stories, all it needs to do is place a few coins in the right palm, and suddenly the rules are forgotten.",

I chat with one CalMac crewman on this trip and observe that he takes his life in his hands every day. I am expecting a response of “stupid tourist drivers.” But, no.

Two requests, two trips; two guests, two trips—his logic, though limited, is impeccable; his appearance is not. His hair stands up like a brush. Either his slightly soiled white jacket or his slightly soiled white shirt is buttoned askew. He seems to take a kind of pleasure in this, as he takes a saturnine pleasure in all minor misfortunes accruing to him: Sporting an egg-splotched ascot, he stops at the threshold of the roof garden and croaks that he has a sore throat; this saves him the work of walking five feet to carry our drinks to us, and it also allows him to luxuriate in self-pity (“What is life for a poor thing like me?”). But just when you think this fellow is altogether dark and withdrawn—when you think that he hates his life and you, too—he displays an almost feminine curiosity, his gloomy uncommunicativeness dissipates. He hovers over your easy chair and examines your purchases with the soft pleasure of a child.",

One sang under the bedroom window; another on the topmost twig of the lilac bush; another on the edge of the wall. Each sang stridently, with passion, with vehemence, as if to let the song burst out of it, no matter if it shattered the song of another bird with harsh discord. Their round eyes bulged with brightness; their claws gripped the twig or rail. They sang, exposed without shelter, to the air and the sun, beautiful in their new plumage, shell-veined or brightly mailed, here barred with soft blues, here splashed with gold, or striped with one bright feather. They sang as if the song were urged out of them by the pressure of the morning. They sang as if the edge of being were sharpened and must cut, must split the softness of the blue-green light, the dampness of the wet earth; the fumes and steams of the greasy kitchen vapour; the hot breath of mutton and beef; the richness of pastry and fruit; the damp shreds and peelings thrown from the kitchen bucket, from which a slow steam oozed on the rubbish heap. On all the sodden, the damp-spotted, the curled with wetness, they descended, dry-beaked, ruthless, abrupt. They swooped suddenly from the lilac bough or the fence. They spied a snail and tapped the shell against a stone. They tapped furiously, methodically, until the shell broke and something slimy oozed from the crack. They swept and soared sharply in flights high into the air, twittering short, sharp notes, and perched in the upper branches of some tree, and looked down upon leaves and spires beneath, and the country white with blossom, flowing with grass, and the sea which beat like a drum that raises a regiment of plumed and turbaned soldiers. Now and again their songs ran together in swift scales like the interlacings of a mountain stream whose waters, meeting, foam and then mix, and hasten quicker and quicker down the same channel, brushing the same broad leaves. But there is a rock; they sever.",

He had straight abundant hair, heavily greyed, which he kept smartly brushed and flattened at the sides. His clothing was loose and well cut: he wore a dark coat above baggy grey flannels, silk shirts rayed with broad stripes, a collar to match, and a generous loosely knotted tie. His waistcoats were of a ruddy-brown cheque-red pattern. He had an appearance of great distinction.",

It was an ordinary August afternoon in north London. A man with dark curly hair, toasted skin and only one front tooth laid his towel next to mine, and after a few minutes he asked me if the water was as cold as usual. Later, the novel still unopened, I learnt that he was Chilean, and that he had left not in the political upheavals of the 1970s when everyone else had left, but in 1990; he had felt compelled to stay during the dictatorship, to do what he could, but once it was over he wanted space to breathe. He came from the Azapa valley, one of the hottest places on earth, yet he said he felt a bond as strong as iron with every Chilean he had ever met, even those from the brutally cold settlements around the Beagle Channel over 2500 miles to the south.",

The first large swells of the season actually did arrive in November, though, often before the sandbars were ready to turn them into ridable surf. Winter was when the waves were best. In December and January, the combination of huge winter storm swells and local beach and weather conditions was frequently exquisite.",

For a moment the great dog stood stock-still with an eloquence of stunned surprise and bewildered consternation that was more than human; then a savage roar burst out upon the quiet air, filling the street with its gigantic anger. The mastiff swung his great head savagely, the little bull went flying through the air but hung on with embedded teeth; great drops of the bright arterial blood went flying everywhere across the pavement, and still the bull held on. The end came like a lightning stroke. The great head flashed over through the air and down: the bull, no longer dog now—just a wad of black—smacked to the pavement with a sickening crunch.",

The ferryman steered; August stood at his horses' heads talking to them soothingly; the two boys came and sat on some coiled ropes close to me, leaned their elbows on their knees and their chins on their hands, and fixing their blue fisher-boy eyes on my face kept them there with an unwinking interest during the entire crossing. Oh, it was lovely sitting up there in the sun, safe so far, in the delicious quiet of sailing. The tawny sail, darned and patched in divers shades of brown and red and orange, towered above us against the sky. The huge mast seemed to brush along across the very surface of the little white clouds. Above the rippling of the water we could hear the distant larks on either shore. August had put on his scarlet stable-jacket for the work of lifting the carriage in, and made a beautiful bit of colour among the browns of the old boat at the stern. The eyes of the ferryman lost all the alertness they had had on shore, and he stood at the rudder gazing dreamily out at the afternoon light on the Rügen meadows. How perfect it was after the train, after the clattering along the dusty road, and the heat and terror of getting on board. For one exquisite quarter of an hour we were softly lapped across in the sun, and for all that beauty we were only asked to pay three marks, which included the horses and carriage and the labour of getting us in and out. For a further small sum the ferryman became enthusiastic and begged me to be sure to come back that way. There was a single house on the Rügen shore where he lived, he said, and from which he would watch for us. A little dog came down to welcome us, but we saw no other living creature. The carriage conducted itself far more like a lamb on this side, and I drove away well pleased to have got over the chief difficulty of the tour, the soft-voiced ferryman wishing us Godspeed, and the two boys unwinking to the last.",

Its slopes are very regular, varying from eight to ten degrees. Its lava-beds differ from those of Kauai and Oahu in being lighter in colour, less cellular, and more impervious to water. The windward side of the mountain is gashed and slashed by streams, which in their violence have excavated large pot-holes, which serve as reservoirs, and it is covered to a height of over 2000 feet by a luxuriant growth of timber. On the leeward side, several black and very fresh looking streams of lava run into the sea, and the whole coast for some height above the shore shows most vigorous volcanic action. Elsewhere the rock is red and broken, and lateral cones abound near the base.",

Deer grazed in picturesque herds in a clearing below and early morning strollers began to dot the long avenue framed by my splayed feet. I watched planes taking off from Heathrow and found on the horizon the faint but recognizable shapes of Battersea Power Station and the Post Office Tower. I can remember being very excited to discover that I could see London from way out here. It is, I believe, the only spot this far out where you can see central London. Henry VIII rode to this summit to hear the cannons from the Tower announce the execution of Anne Boleyn, though now all I could hear was the drone of airliners banking to land, and the startling yap of a large shaggy dog that appeared suddenly at my elbow—its owners following up a side hill—and offered me a large saliva specimen, which I declined.",

He spies me and comes down before the Emergency Room is involved. I am unclear that this even is a pub. It might be the Scottish equivalent of God-botherers. He offers tea and provides a menu, a dead giveaway I am not the target of religious recruitment. He proudly tells me the Masons built the pub in 1802, but it isn’t a Masonic house anymore.

    "target_paragraph": "“Oh Qanta, he told me! He was ecstatic. He called me at home and then he called my parents to congratulate them. He heard from the program director in Toronto that I matched. I am so excited, I cannot tell you. This is a dream come true for me. It's hard to believe it is actually happening.” She released a gale of laughter which I couldn't help sharing. We giggled for a while, clutching our telephones.\nStill holding the phone, I slipped my feet into slippers and started to open the windows in the apartment, hoping for the evening breeze to sweep through the musty apartment. Reem was rattling off more news, without pausing even for breath. As I listened to her animated voice, I poured myself some water. The day had been unusually hot and, as the top apartment of the block, my apartment took hours for the superheated ceilings to cool down. Outside, the Maghreb (evening) Azaan sounded. A scraggly flock of pigeons rose into the air, startled by a stray cat.\n“When do you leave, Reem?” I asked, thinking already how much I would miss my lovely friend and colleague. In the past months we had solved so many clinical problems together. I had discovered she was a brilliant clinician and she often helped me turn over difficult problems in the patients we shared.\n“Well, Qanta the fellowship starts in July, like all programs over there.” I already knew this but still waited to hear her plans. “But I need permission from my father first. You know I can't travel without his consent and it's going to be difficult for my family…” she trailed off. I detected the first tones of uncertainty.\n“But Reem,” I caught myself defending her, already adopting sides of an invisible argument, “you have lived away from them for years in Riyadh. You live alone here. They know how seriously you take your career. Of course it will be terrible in the beginning. All the homesickness in Canada, the horrible winters. But I have confidence you, and they will get over it. I am sure they will and of course, two years are going to fly by so fast, you won't even know you are gone before it's time to come back!” I ended on a triumphant note; what was there to discuss? She had to go. Anything else was clearly out of the question.\nReem responded slowly, carefully, “My father is a conservative man, Qanta.”",

    "target_paragraph": "On the Via del Portico d'Ottavia there are many houseware shops—casalinghi. Julia goes quite mad when she sees these shops. Julia's husband, Massimo, is bored; that is what Julia says. Italy is a perpetual Mother's Day, she says, all Italian men want to live with both their wives and their mothers and the wife tries to become both and soon she is a nonerotic object; and on and on Julia goes. She is going to remove herself from Rome, she is going to make herself perpetually tantalizing and perpetually unavailable, let him play his man game, she will play her woman game, and they will see. This sounds exhausting to me. Julia's life, she says, is a nightmare of washing floors with Windex and newspapers, and all she can think of at St. Peter's is who washes the marble floors—“nuns,” she says bitterly; “at least they're married to someone they like.” Julia has an American friend she wants to introduce me to, she is “truly crazy, she has had thirteen Italian lovers and twenty-two abortions.” I don't want to meet her. “Don't judge her,” Julia says, “you must have a love affair with an Italian to understand Italy.” “I don't undertake affairs scientifically,” I say. Today Julia decides to end her marriage; but that doesn't stop her from shopping for tortellini.",
