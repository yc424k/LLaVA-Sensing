He grabbed his ordered coffee and headed back to Lone Eagle and sat in the cockpit, and started taking stock. He looked at his watch and saw that it was early west coast time and dialed Gillian’s number. She answered on the second ring. She couldn’t believe Lesley had jumped ship. They both agreed that her rowing experience hadn’t given her any night running much less night landing experience, and she just freaked - out. Gillian said she had lots of banked vacation time and would go to her boss and see if she could get a few days off to help him take Lone Eagle down to Tudi’s place in North Carolina. She was magic, he thought. I can’t believe she would do this to help me. Within a couple of hours, she called back and told him that her boss had given her the time off and that she would book her flight and call him and tell him when she would be arriving in Norfolk, Virginia – the nearest airport.",

Brown served twenty-five years, and saw two appeals fail, before his conviction was finally overturned in 2002. When he was released, one of the first things he did was to go to the shore of Loch Lomond and sit on a boulder on the loch’s southern shore in sunlight, to feel, as he put it, ‘the wind on my face, and to see the waves and the mountains’. Brown had been out on the loch shore the day before he was arrested. The recollection of the space, that place, which he had not seen for a quarter of a century, had nourished him during his imprisonment. He had kept the memory of it, he recalled afterwards, ‘in a secret compartment’ in his head.",

As for the scent of the forest, he who has been in it early after a dewy night knows that, and the effect it has on the spirits of him who smells it; so I need not explain how happy I was and how invigorated as I climbed up a long hill where the wood was thick and cool, and coming out at the top found I had reached a place of turf and sunshine, with tables in the shade at the farther side, and in the middle, coffee-pot in hand, a waiter.",

To aid the imagination, I got out my copies of the Fraser letters and diaries that I had brought with me.",

I listened to the faint susurration of the leaves as they waltzed with the breeze. The wood was dry and cozy. It hadn’t rained there.\n\n“No. I haven’t,” I answered, getting back to my feet.",

At the turnpike scene, where Bess and Turpin are hotly pursued at midnight by the officers, and the half-awake gate-keeper in his tasselled nightcap denies that any horseman has passed, Coggan uttered a broad-chested ‘Well done!’ which could be heard all over the fair above the bleating, and Poorgrass smiled delightedly with a nice sense of dramatic contrast between our hero who coolly leaps the gate and halting justice in the form of his enemies who must needs pull up cumbersomely and wait to be let through. At the death of Tom King he could not refrain from seizing Coggan by the hand and whispering with excitement, ‘Of course he’s not really shot Jan – only seemingly!’ And when the last sad scene came on and the body of gallant and faithful Bess had to be carried out on a shutter by twelve volunteers from among the spectators, nothing could restrain Poorgrass from lending a hand, exclaiming, as he asked Jan to join him ‘ ’Twill be something to tell of at Warren’s in future years Jan, and hand down to our children.’ For many a year in Weatherbury Joseph told with the air of a man who had had experiences in his time that he touched with his own hands the hoof of Bess as she lay upon the board upon his shoulder. If, as some thinkers hold, immortality consists in being enshrined in others’ memories, then did Black Bess become immortal that day if she never had done so before.",

Writing about this death, Edward Hoagland observed that Alaska is “not the best site in the world for eremitic experiments or peace-love theatrics.”",

I’m not a morning person, more owl than lark. 6.30am Kenya time is 5.30am in France, where my normal getting-up time is about 8.30am.\nKenyans have their own way of telling the time. Sitting on the equator, Kenya’s day and night are two equal periods of twelve hours. Sunrise begins at what in Western time is known as 7.00am, but which Kenyans refer to as hour one of the day – ‘saa moja asubuhi’. Night falls at 7.00pm in Western time, which is ‘saa moja usiku’, hour one of the night. It is then repeated through the night, until the following morning arrives. Please learn these facts as I’ll be testing you on them later.\nA glass bowl of fragrant fresh roses stood on the writing desk in our elegant, spacious room, and the huge bed beckoned. My eyes were burning and I had the beginning of a tiredness headache, but even with the threat of the ‘12th hour of the night’ getting-up time hanging over us, after Terry had turned off the lights I drew back the curtains and stood by the window for long while, looking out at the silhouettes of high-rise buildings, construction cranes and blinking telecommunication masts on Nairobi’s nearby skyline.",

It seemed to him that he must draw each breath of that soft grey air with heavy weary effort, and that every mile of his journey would be a ghastly struggle through some viscous and material substance, that weighted down his steps and filled his heart with desolation.",

The middle of the street was full of irregular depressions, well adapted to retain the long swirls of dust and straw and twisted paper that the wind drove up and down its sad untended length; and toward the end of the day, when traffic had been active, the fissured pavement formed a mosaic of coloured handbills, lids of tomato cans, old shoes, cigar stumps and banana skins, cemented together by a layer of mud, or veiled in a powdering of dust, as the state of the weather determined.",

In one hand he held a rolled-up poster in a cylinder, and in the other, a smaller hand belonging to a miniature version of himself. Monesh and his son Ksheetij were also pilgrims from Ayyappa, now taking the train to Mangalore to visit the Mangaladevi temple. It was a boys-only trip. The Ayyappa temple, although one of the few Hindu temples open to all castes, creeds and faiths, does not permit women of a menstruating age, so Monesh’s wife and daughter had stayed at home. He pointed to where two elderly men sat watching our exchange, their ear hair twitching with interest.",

Sometimes the wagons followed so close upon one another that the ribbon seemed motionless. But at the entrance to the mill, you could see that it almost never stopped.",

Broad swathes of patuju, young ones that are as light as cut grass, and adults, dark emerald, twice my height, stretch for as far as I can see. Cacao trees twist up out of the plants like black waves on an ocean. Most of the ancient forest was cut down decades ago, Harry tells me with disgust. They were replanted with these cacaos, although the plantation inevitably failed. This is what enabled the parque to buy the land. The chocolate forest remains, intermingled with the rest of the jungle, a ghost of failed economic development. There are still a few of the old trees left, though, trees that survived the cut, that would have been around before the road was conceived of, before even my great-grandparents were conceived of.",

Each footfall sent puffs of pumice powder into the air. The easy tread allowed me to gaze up at the redheaded mountain while I walked. For some unknown reason, I had always felt a powerful spiritual connection to South Sister deep in my soul. If I could, I would never leave this spot, so as to spend my life in adoration of this one mountain. Unlike Mazama?whose eruption gave us Crater Lake?South Sister’s power seemed benevolent.

It, like the rest of the temple, is made of a hard, white, coral limestone. On each side of this gate is a statue of Ganesha, one hand on his head, a favorite Hindu god, the remover of obstacles. Whenever some undertaking is considered, Ganesha's aid is sought in removing hindrances, especially in literary and educational matters. He has come to symbolize wisdom. Traditionally Ganesha had one broken tusk, and his vehicle was a rat. Such gate-guarding statues are common in Bali and are called dwarapala. On each side of this gate is a wall with windows made of pierced, decorated coral blocks. One ascends a few steps through the gate and then descends again to the middle courtyard, an area about 40 meters long and 10 meters wide. It is paved in places near the southwest end with white stone blocks, but part of the floor is just the natural limestone outcrop. This courtyard is entirely surrounded by stepped, undecorated walls. In the middle of the northwest wall a small gate leads to a spot that offers a nice view of the cliffs and sea to the northwest.",

Lone Eagle then dropped back on course but the gusts were happening too frequently. He waited as long as he could. It was now 0500. There was just enough light for him to go topside and put a reef in without the need of a headlamp. He slid the companionway hatch open a few inches. “Gillian, wake up, baby.

One can’t help liking this odd little town, though today it was at its least attractive with sheets of ice, mud and diesel oil on its street, and a piercing, gusty wind raising clouds of fine dust, and the stony mountains frowning down on its barren valley.",

He was a Christian gentleman; more, he was the only one of the party who could cook. Were we, then, to be thrown for future sustenance entirely on Jellaby’s porridge?",

In Jimbaran the season lasts about half a year, and in that period performances are put on every 15 days. The Jimbaran Barong is of the type known as barong ket, a shaggy-coated beast with a mask somewhat like a Chinese lion. The Barong is sacred, and the character's mask is kept in a special shrine in a small temple in our village. Rangda, also tenget, full of magic, is toothy and horrific, with long, tangled hair. She speaks in Kawi, the whiney — and in this case sinister-sounding — ancient Javanese tongue. Both Barong and Rangda have attendants, whose clash warms up to the appearance of Rangda. The outcome of the battle is a draw — neither side wins or loses.",
