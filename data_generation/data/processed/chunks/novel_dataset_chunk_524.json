Each villa was self-serviced, so the kitchen housed a kettle and a basket of Nescafé sachets. At the prospect of pure coffee to keep himself awake, Passepartout rubbed his hands with glee. He was leaning over the kettle awaiting the rumble of boiling water when our taxi beeped from downstairs. We had decided to leave our neighbouring revellers and have lunch among the Russians and swearing, tattooed people who wandered Candolim’s streets in their swimwear. He reached for the cold tap above the basin, opening it briefly to cool his cup and took a sip. The scene unfolded in slow motion and I watched with the sinking feeling that his motions would now be anything but slow.",

Then they walked away together across the great quadrangle of the Louvre. A haze of bluish mist, soft, smoky as a veil, hung in the air across the vista’d sweep of the Tuileries and the Place de la Concorde. The little taxis drilled across the great space between the vast wings of the Louvre and through the arches, filling the air with wasp-like drone and menace, the shrill excitement of their tootling horns. And through that veil of bluish haze the vast mysterious voice of Paris reached their ears: it was a sound immense and murmurous as time, fused of the strident clamours of its four million subjects, and yet, strangely muted, seductive, sensuous, cruel and thrilling, filled with life and death. The mysterious fragrance of that life filled Eugene with the potent intoxication of its magic. He drew the pungent smoky air into his lungs, and it seemed freighted with the subtle incense of the great city’s hope and secret promise, with grief and joy and terror, with a wild and nameless hunger, with intolerable desire. It numbed his entrails and his loins with sensual prescience, and it made his heart beat hard and fast; his breath came quickly: it was mixed into the pulses of his blood and gave to grief and joy and sorrow the wild mixed anguish beating in his heart, its single magic, its impalpable desire.",

Many onlookers excitedly stepped into the road to try to get a better view, forcing the motorcycles to swerve dangerously. Several cars in the motorcade were involved in minor accidents, some repeatedly, often with each other, and the head of the motorcycle squadron, Sergeant William Cassidy, was thrown from his bike and into the side of the car carrying Ruth Snyder, causing her to shriek, but he suffered only minor injuries. Alderman Murtha’s car overheated and failed to make it out of the city, to the presumed disappointment of his wife and children. At length, Snyder and Gray arrived at Sing Sing, where they vanished through the gates and off the nation’s front pages.

On the wall of the narthex someone had spray-painted in Russian I STILL BELIEVE IN GOD. DO YOU? The church’s nave, which was high and narrow and ascended into the central tower, had been stripped of most of its frescoes. I recognized the stripping method that had been employed, because I had used it myself to expose the brick of an industrial loft where I lived in Manhattan years ago. Whoever had done the stripping here had used a broad-bladed chisel and a hammer and had chipped away the fresco plaster with blow after blow, leaving an array of chisel-blade lines on the brick.",

Nobody knew anything about the country there except that there was no road. By \"road\" he meant the single foot track, about six inches wide, that connected the villages in the forest; such a road was as important to the Congolese as the New Jersey Turnpike is to drivers in New Jersey. When the chief had protested for a while, Sabani, who was there also, interrupted to put in his own argument. To the east, the forest was unpleasantly wet and swampy, he declared, and for years no man had tried to go through it. The only roads to be found were elephant tracks, and they might lead anywhere. Warming up, he painted a dismal picture of what might happen even if we did get to the other side. The people over there weren't of the same tribe as our villagers, and they might refuse to sell us meat. Worse, there might not be any game at all, so there would be no meat to sell. Porters expected a meat ration every day, and sulked when they didn't get it. They might even run away and leave me helpless with all my boxes heaped up somewhere in the middle of the forest.",

It was about noon, and I was even hungrier than I may have looked, so I gratefully accepted his offer, which was a considerable one. There are two or three small general stores in the pines, but for anything as fragile as a fresh pork chop it is necessary to make a round trip from Fred’s place of about fifty miles. Fred went into the kitchen and dropped a chop into a frying pan that was crackling with hot grease. He has a fairly new four burner stove that uses bottled gas. He keeps water in a large bowl on a table in the kitchen and ladles some when he wants it. While he cooked the meat, he looked out a window through a stand of pitch pines and into the cranberry bog. “I saw a big buck out here last night with velvet on his horns,” he said. “Them horns is soft when they’re in velvet.” On a nail high on one wall of the room that Bill and I were sitting in was a large meat cleaver. Next to it was a billy club. The wall itself was papered in a flower pattern, and the wallpaper continued out across the ceiling and down the three other walls, lending the room something of the appearance of the inside of a gift box. In some parts of the ceiling, the paper had come loose. “I didn’t paper this year,” Fred said. “For the last couple months, I’ve had sinus.” The floor was covered with old rugs. They had been put down in random pieces, and in some places as many as six layers were stacked up. In winter, when the temperature approaches zero, the worst cold comes through the floor. The only source of heat in the house is a wood-burning stove in the main room. There were seven calendars on the walls, all current and none with pictures of nudes. Fading into pastel on one wall was a rotogravure photograph of President and Mrs. Eisenhower. A framed poem read:",

The day was cooler--it would have been a good day for New York--and the green air under the willows trembled with a delicious freshness. Vance sat down on the doorstep. From where he sat he could get a glimpse of the gate through the shimmering branches, and watch the shadows of the trees wheel slowly across the lawn. The air was rich with the smell of syringas, that smell which is so like the sound of bees on a thundery day. Vance leaned his head back against a pillar of the porch and waited. . . .",

After a night of heavy rain the cold air was rich with the aromas of refreshed herbs and earth unaccustomed to moisture. Here for the first time since leaving Jo’burg was mountainous country – mildly mountainous – and the slow pastel dawn revealed a surprising landscape: Scottish moors in midwinter rather than African semi-desert. As the light strengthened, a strange blueness suffused this ‘moorland’; grey-blue brakbos blankets miles of shallow valleys between long low ridges. Where the terrain becomes more broken – the valleys deeper, the hills steeper – huge holes mark the spots where impatient diamond-seekers, on their way to what was not yet Kimberley, paused to dig hopefully. A few miles away is the river bank on which those children found such pretty playthings in 1867.",

But Justine was unwilling that this fruitless sense of oppression should be the final outcome of their talk; and when they reached the upper terrace she paused and turned impulsively to Amherst. As she did so, the light from an uncurtained window fell on her face, which glowed with the inner brightness kindled in it by moments of strong feeling.",

Soon I didn’t even have to place an order: I only needed to catch his eye. He would nod at me authoritatively and bellow to the kitchen staff, ‘Paw kya t’kwet! Peh palata t’pwe!’ Within minutes, warm palata and a cup of strong, not-too-sweet tea would be sitting on the table in front of me.",

    "target_paragraph": "Thus professionally spoke Don Pépé, the fighter, with pendent moustaches, a nut-brown, lean face, and a clean run of a cast-iron jaw, suggesting the type of a cattle-herd horseman from the great Llanos of the South. “If you will listen to an old officer of Paez, señores,” was the exordium of all his speeches in the Aristocratic Club of Sulaco, where he was admitted on account of his past services to the extinct cause of Federation. The club, dating from the days of the proclamation of Costaguana’s independence, boasted many names of liberators amongst its first founders. Suppressed arbitrarily innumerable times by various Governments, with memories of proscriptions and of at least one wholesale massacre of its members, sadly assembled for a banquet by the order of a zealous military commandante (their bodies were afterwards stripped naked and flung into the plaza out of the windows by the lowest scum of the populace), it was again flourishing, at that period, peacefully. It extended to strangers the large hospitality of the cool, big rooms of its historic quarters in the front part of a house, once the residence of a high official of the Holy Office. The two wings, shut up, crumbled behind the nailed doors, and what may be described as a grove of young orange trees grown in the unpaved patio concealed the utter ruin of the back part facing the gate. You turned in from the street, as if entering a secluded orchard, where you came upon the foot of a disjointed staircase, guarded by a moss-stained effigy of some saintly bishop, mitred and staffed, and bearing the indignity of a broken nose meekly, with his fine stone hands crossed on his breast. The chocolate-coloured faces of servants with mops of black hair peeped at you from above; the click of billiard balls came to your ears, and ascending the steps, you would perhaps see in the first sala, very stiff upon a straight-backed chair, in a good light, Don Pépé moving his long moustaches as he spelt his way, at arm’s length, through an old Sta. Marta newspaper. His horse—a stony-hearted but persevering black brute with a hammer head—you would have seen in the street dozing motionless under an immense saddle, with its nose almost touching the curbstone of the sidewalk.",

The day I visited her the house was shuttered up against the cool weather. When I tapped on the front door it was opened almost immediately by an elegant woman wearing a lavishly embroidered tamein and a white-lace top. Her black hair was tied into a severe bun at the nape of her neck. I introduced myself and told her the name of a mutual friend who had suggested I drop in on her during my visit to Katha. She shook my hand with a gracious, almost regal, manner, and told me she would talk to me as long as I promised never ever to mention her name.",

    "target_paragraph": "It is considered by many people the most moving war memorial in Europe; perhaps it is; it also represents a small part of the price of the Via dell’Impero and all the Augustan revival, though not as movingly as the Matteotti Bridge. The great sorrow and meaning of this event refuse to be pressed into such generalities. One of the men buried here, named finzi, had been a high fascist functionary, partly responsible along with others for the murder of Matteotti and helpful in covering up the crime afterwards; one might say this had been expiated by such a death; it would be hard to know. Many of the men with whom he is now linked in one symbol to the end of time had probably had some notion of the dignity of the human being and risked their lives for it from the beginning; for others it may have been largely a matter of accident, although presumably there was some reason to suspect them all of hostility to the Germans. They may or may not have sympathized with the act of blowing up the truck. In any case, the specific occasion for the monument is just an enemy atrocity; you are meant to be appalled; it is rather debilitating, and so something of a crime against whatever true dignity and will were shuffled in with the pack. This was the more serious German crime; to have left heroism all over Europe mixed up with self-pity, and courage of mind with emotional excess. The answer under these conditions keeps slipping into what it answered; these caves and graves are not likely to put anyone in a particularly “democratic” frame of mind.",

On the contrary, there ran through his nature an opposing current: a strong vein of kindliness and consideration for others which alone can explain many of the enigmas, as they are called, of his life. He was capable both of feeling, and of inspiring in others, deep attachment. He might even be called an idealist in the sense that he seems to have expected more of the world than he found it could, or would, perform; and, as such, his sufferings at the blows of fortune were proportionately the more intense. For the calculating individual changes little during life; from the cradle to the grave he pursues the even and not always lovely tenor of his way: the man of heart, as we say, has only to live long enough in order to become something of a cynic. And Tiberius lived to the age of seventy-eight.",

No need now to be ashamed of his figure, and to make jokes about it so as to forestall other people's and show he didn't mind it; no need now to be ashamed of getting hot going up hills, or to torment himself with pictures of how he probably appeared to beautiful young women—how middle-aged, how absurd in his inability to keep away from them.

For forty miles in every direction stones and thorns prevailed. Anyway I felt incapable of moving.
