It’s good enough to drink, so don’t pour the dirty water back in.” Veronica told us she washed their laundry in buckets right there beside the cistern and draped it over low bushes to dry in the sun and breeze. It seemed like a very good system. A copse of swaying coconut palms surrounded the clearing. It was the loveliest laundry we had ever seen. We would no doubt soon have a load or two to wash now that we were once again obliged to wear clothes.",

She stood there on the white stone steps of the little red brick house, with her bony, square dull head with its thin, tanned, toughened skin and its sparse and kinky grizzled hair, and her strong, squat figure a little over made on the right side, clothed in her blue striped cotton dress, all clean and always washed but rough and harsh to see—and she stayed there on the steps till Anna brought her in, blubbering, her apron to her face, and making queer guttural broken moans.",

By the rules of the game, one stone, the same stone, must be kicked to the goal. Say a gate, or a tree. He played it alone. The gate was a goal; to be reached in ten.

Events commence at about 3: 30 in Pura Pererepan, with the sekan barong and the gong outside on the street. The pemangkus are inside the temple, and they lead a crowd of people in prayer. The barong mask sits on an elevated platform facing west and the worshipers. After the offerings have been made, Sopir, assisted by other members of the Seka, attaches the mask to the rest of the elaborate headdress with stout cord. The old peraksok hair that was removed from the barong costume when it was refurbished is gathered, packaged, and taken in procession to Kahyangan, the Pura Dalem, Barong's \"home,\" where it is buried in a special little plot just to the north of the main shrine.",

And then when he saw once more, after years of absence it seemed, grass, flowers and trees, the old hunting cry of the fields hallooed in his ears and he dashed forward to run as he had run in the fields at home. But now a heavy weight jerked at his throat; he was thrown back on his haunches. Were there not trees and grass? he asked. Were these not the signals of freedom? Had he not always leapt forward directly Miss Mitford started on her walk? Why was he a prisoner here? He paused. Here, he observed, the flowers were massed far more thickly than at home; they stood, plant by plant, rigidly in narrow plots. The plots were intersected by hard black paths. Men in shiny top-hats marched ominously up and down the paths. At the sight of them he shuddered closer to the chair. He gladly accepted the protection of the chain. Thus before many of these walks were over a new conception had entered his brain. Setting one thing beside another, he had arrived at a conclusion. Where there are flower-beds there are asphalt paths; where there are flower-beds and asphalt paths, there are men in shiny top-hats; where there are flower-beds and asphalt paths and men in shiny top-hats, dogs must be led on chains. Without being able to decipher a word of the placard at the Gate, he had learnt his lesson – in Regent’s Park dogs must be led on chains.",

Then I bathed and took a cold shower. I take it so cold that it sends tingles all up and down my spine.” And, indeed, her face always had that glowing freshness as if she had just come from a cold shower. “I dressed and had my breakfast, talked to Cook, told her what to order, and how many were coming to the house tonight. I talked to Barney—he’s our driver—and told him where to come for me this afternoon. Then I read the mail and paid some bills and wrote some letters. I talked to Roberta on the phone about this new show I’m doing for the League. I saw Fritz for a moment, as he was leaving for the office. I looked in and talked to Edith for a moment in her room. And I was out of the house and on my way downtown before nine o’clock. Then I was at work at Stein and Rosen’s for an hour—then to Heck’s for costume fittings until twelve—then to the wig maker’s on 47th Street at twelve-fifteen—” she laughed: “The strangest thing happened! You know where the wig maker’s is—it’s in what used to be an old brownstone house, and you go up a flight of steps and there is a big front window on the first floor with wigs and hats in it. Well!” she exclaimed with accented and excited finality. “What do you suppose I did? I went up the stairs and thought that I was right, and saw a door and opened it, and just walked in. And what do you suppose I found? I walked right in upon a bar. It seemed to run the whole way back, and a whole lot of men were standing at the bar drinking, and there was a man behind the bar mixing drinks. Well!” she cried again, “I was so surprised! Honestly, it was the strangest thing. I couldn’t believe my eyes! I just stood there with my mouth wide open staring at them. And they were all so jolly. The man behind the bar called out: ‘Come right on in, lady. There’s always room for one more.’ Well, I was so confused—I just didn’t know what to say, and at last I said, ‘I thought this was the wig maker’s!’ Well, you should have heard them laugh! The bartender said, ‘No, lady, this ain’t the wig maker’s, but we’ve got some hair tonic here that’ll grow hair better than a wig!’ And another man said, ‘You’re in the wrong place. This ain’t the wig maker’s, it’s the Novelty Shop’—and then they all laughed again; I guess, because the place had a kind of fake window with some dirty old Christmas bells, and a few strips of red crêpe paper in it, and a sign that said, ‘United Novelties Supply Company,’ I guess as a kind of dodge—and that was the reason they laughed. They seemed awfully jolly. The bartender came out from behind the bar and took me to the door, and showed me where the wig maker’s was, which was just next door, and the reason I had got confused was that there are two flights of steps and I was in a hurry and wasn’t looking, and so I got mixed up—but isn’t New York wonderful!”",

Victor Boyarsky attended the University of Minnesota and speaks English well. He even sounds slightly Minnesotan.

Thus far, African travel recalled the dreariest aspects of war. Always up in the middle of the night, always exhausted, always deep in discomfort varying from fierce to nasty, and always preyed on by boredom. The one fine, loved aspect of war was missing: except for two days of C., in Cameroun, I had met no companions of the road. War is full of them, a shifting population of men made extraordinary by circumstance. Nobody to laugh with means the horrors of the journey are undiluted. Very heavy going.",

The journey out took two and a half hours in calm weather; the way back was longer and more unnerving. Rowing in thick mist and darkness, compassless and moonless, over tide races and currents, Shaw’s guides steered by instinct and knowledge alone. The following evening, sitting by the fire in the Parknasilla Hotel in Sneem, Shaw wrote a letter to his friend Barry Jackson about his experience on Skellig Michael. ‘I tell you the thing does not belong to any world that you and I have lived and worked in: it is part of our dream world . . . I hardly feel real again yet!’ For Shaw, as for the monks who once lived there, on the Skellig you were brought to think in ways that would be possible nowhere else. It was a place for deep dreaming.",

While other hotels in Bali went through peak and non-peak seasons, Spartacvs was different. In his office, Gary showed me a computer monitor displaying the resort’s colour-coded bookings. Vacancies were represented by white space, and for months ahead, there was barely any white space at all. The spreadsheet was a wince-inducing rainbow. Visitors streamed in from Australia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. Increasingly, with the global recession, visitors had started to pour in from across Asia, Africa and the Middle East, too. Bookings now came from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and South Africa. International homosexuals had become a non-stop market.",

He found the abortionist, he supplied a part, at least, of the money, and he even arranged to be at the apartment on the day of the operation to make sure we got back all right—for I went with her, of course. I can see now that it all must have been a considerable strain on him as well as on Kathy, but at the time, when we got back and found him drunk, I was not inclined to make allowances. I'd found it very difficult to get Kathy up the stairs, and the sight of Ivan, staggering and foolish, was too much. Grimly, I got her to bed. She was trembling, and rather green in the face.",

I chat with Hagrid in the baño and help Panchita hide her stolen underwear, I walk through the sunlit shadows with Wayra and think those times the most precious. And then I bury her, again and again. Ashamed. Ashamed to feel this much, to miss these animals, quite so much. It’s not what is supposed to happen. The parque was just something I did when I was travelling, a cool thing, an adventure, and now it’s over.",

It was only ten o’clock and nothing was happening at the quayside – the Chevette, dressed with sleety snow, stood alone and forlorn in the big car park – so I went and walked around, down to the site of the original Fort Mackinac and then along residential streets full of treeless lawns and one-storey ranch-houses. When I returned to the ferry site, about forty minutes later, the Chevette had gained some company and there was a fair crowd of people – twenty or thirty at least – already boarding the boat.",

During her younger years, the Deccan Queen had been decked out in regal splendour. Her first-class restaurant car was finished in silver oak with zebrawood panelling and glass-topped tables. The second-class dining car was panelled in maple with walnut mouldings. Third-class passengers were not allowed on board. As the British disappeared, so did the Queen’s grandeur, and we settled back in the standard chair-car carriage and shivered in the air conditioning. Our fellow passengers were mainly businessmen and office workers, many of whom have asked the Indian Railways to set up wi-fi connectivity and additional mobile and laptop charging points in the dining cars. But despite their gripes, they garland the Queen every 1 June, celebrating her birthday at Pune station without fail. We celebrated our evening journey with the grande dame with a hot veg-cutlet sandwich and a squirt of chilli ketchup, washed down with a couple of cups of tea.",

On the other hand, I once was less than a mile from thousand-foot cliffs in the Canaries on a sunny, clear day, when the sun illuminated some haze and the whole island disappeared. I desperately hope that I have underestimated my speed and that of the current. I’ve tried to be conservative.

Rather, he stood now in the door, his engine banging away deliberately, slowed down, bucking and rocking loosely as they passed. His attitude was that of a man who has just given up a race. He had turned to shout something at his fireman who stood there balanced, arms akimbo, black and grinning, as they moved up by them. The engineer had one gloved hand thrust out against the cab to support him, he held the other on his hip and he was grinning broadly at them, with solid teeth edged with one molar of bright gold – a fine, free, generous, and good-humoured smile, which said more plainly than any words could do: ‘Well, it’s over, now!

The rain came on again, bringing out the snakes for an afternoon shower. One – a yard long – I almost trod on. It curled out of my way in two elegant sweeps of its mud-colored body and then stopped just short of the long grass and turned to stare at me, totally unafraid. A cemetery of rusted car chassis marked the approach to a village and the railway track that runs south to Omagari. By the time I came out onto a surfaced road, the rain had gathered such spiteful force that, having eased my other complaints in the lavatory of a restaurant, I found the prospect of going out into it again too depressing to face. I flopped down at one of the restaurant tables and sat scowling out at the grizzling sky and slowly sipping my way through a chilly beer that I would gladly have swapped for a mouthful of beef stew.",

Barely two months earlier, bombs had torn through a Madrid train station filled with commuters on their way to work. One hundred and ninety-one people had died; 1,500 were injured. Not surprisingly, the chatter along the Camino often drifted toward politics, and the conversation became more heated and the hand gestures more demonstrative whenever Americanos were mentioned.",

Sometimes a pair of English hippies is in attendance, since the Dalai Lama is ready to take advice and instruction from anyone (and knows—such is the poignancy of his life—that even the most disorganized traveler may know, firsthand, more about contemporary Tibet, and the state of his people, than he does). When a photographer asks him to take off his glasses, pose with this expression, sit this way or sit that, he seizes the chance to ask the young man about what he saw when he photographed uprisings in Lhasa many years before.",

Both of the priests were Franciscans, they were on their way to Rome for the Holy Year, and apparently they had come well bestowed. Beside their table a frosty silver bucket, over the rim of which floated the gold necks of two empty champagne bottles, gave evidence of a meal from which nothing had been lacking. A waiter brought a box of Coronas and offered them prayerfully. The priests selected their cigars with an appeased and drowsy air: they bit the ends and grunted slightly at the flame the waiter offered them; then collapsing slowly against the cushioned wall, they meditated the ceiling in silence for several minutes through a blue, fragrant mist of dreamful ease.",

But all the maize was too close-planted and disastrously weedy. As I sought some non-alcoholic drink an ancient Asian Muslim, wearing a long white gown and embroidered skull-cap, stared derisively at me from his cubby-hole clothes shop. The other store was a Masai grocery, stocking only soap, Vick, salt, razor blades, weevil-infested biscuits, blighted Irish potatoes and warm Coca-Cola. A degenerate-looking young man charged me double for a Coke (fair enough in the back of beyond) and then tried to short-change me. The mzungu’s arrival had drawn the entire population on to the road but it did not form a welcoming crowd and my usually successful efforts to surmount the language barrier received no co-operation. As a group of ragged youths gathered around Lear, discussing his unfamiliar features without reference to me, I mused on the vulnerability of cyclists: the loot itself provides the getaway transport.",
