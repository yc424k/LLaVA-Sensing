The more interesting depicts a tilt between Ardeshir and his enemy Ardarun V, the last of the Arsacid dynasty, which he displaced. This is near the Firuzabad end; unfortunately I had missed it, and there was no time to go back so far. I did ride back to see the other, which the Kashgai had pointed out from the top of the cliff. This depicts the usual god, Hormuzd, and king, also Ardeshir in this case, grasping a ring; the king wears a balloon on his head, said by some authorities to be a bag for the hair, is followed by several attendants, and assumes an attitude of defence (meant by the artist to be deference) as practised in modern boxing. Small and alone among the huge cliffs, carved on a face of morose purplish rock where river, trees, and kingfisher were the only life, the row of ancient figures was reminder less of the Sasanids’ triumph than of the dark age they triumphed over. Neither they nor the gorge have changed, save that passers-by are not so common and find less convenience; for there used to be a bridge near the relief, and the river is still parted by a fallen pier, built of cut stone, whose mortar has withstood the spate of thirteen centuries. Forcing my horse through the reeds, till its belly touched the water, I looked hurriedly and in vain for the inscription Herzfeld saw here, which records that the bridge was built by Aprsam, Ardeshir’s minister.",

Towards the end I had to stop every twenty yards or so to summon the strength for the next twenty yards. Feelings of humiliating inadequacy afflicted me. Most Africans are underfed not for a few days but all the time. How do they keep going? What feeble creatures we Whites are! Then I remembered Thomson’s description of his ascent to the Mbeya Plateau: ‘The hard work of an entire day seemed concentrated in each step I took. Every few feet I had to stop, gasping for breath and blowing like a broken-winded horse, while my heart palpitated in a most alarming manner. My mind became dazed and stupid, while my poor limbs seemed made of jelly …’ This is a clear case of the knocks, aggravated in Thomson’s case by repeated attacks of malaria. He had a dangerous obsession about ‘keeping going’ and but for his youthful vigour might well have succumbed during that expedition, as Johnston did at the outset. Perhaps he wouldn’t have died at the age of 37 had he punished himself less.",

I had no desire to do any of these. It seemed like days, rather than mere hours, since I had dropped off my rental car in Oxford and set off for the station with the simpleminded plan of traveling from Oxford to Cambridge by way of a lunchtime break at Milton Keynes.",

As he gulped it down into his aching lungs, his whole life seemed to soar, to swoop, to yell with the demonic power, flight, and invincible caprice of the wind’s huge well until he no longer was nothing but a boy of fifteen, the nephew of a hardware merchant in a little town, one of the nameless little atoms of this huge, swarming earth whose most modest dream would have seemed ridiculous to older people had he dared to speak of it.",

The perspiration was streaming down his face when he reached the corner of the turnpike, and he sat down under the same thorn tree where, so short a time ago, he had waited in the summer darkness for Halo Spear. Even the memory of that day was obscured for him by what had happened since. He did not even like to think of Miss Spear’s touch on his arm as she turned him toward the sunrise, or of the way she had looked as she sat by the pool leaning her head on her hand and listening while he recited his poems to her. All that seemed to belong to the far-off world of the hills, the world he had voluntarily forsaken, he didn’t know why. . . .",

So I opened the commissary and gave them all a woollen shirt apiece, men women and children (you should have seen them, the kids in a man’s shirt, the ones that were just big enough to walk I mean. They wore them outside, like overcoats.) and a can of beans apiece and sent them out on the ore train. There was still a considerable hands, fists now, and I could hear them for a good while after the train was out of sight. Going down Hogben (he runs the ore train; the railroad pays him) just uses the engine to brake with, so it dont make much fuss. Not as much as they did, anyway. But the hunkies stayed.”",

The fence turned at an angle and Suratt stopped the car and the youth stepped down and opened the warped wooden gate and Suratt drove on into the barnyard where stood a wagon with drunken wheels and a home-made bed, and the rusting skeleton of a ford car.

    "target_paragraph": "Now there was water on both sides of the road and now, as if once they had become aware of movement in the water the water seemed to have given over deception and concealment, they seemed to be able to watch it rising up the flanks of the dump; trees which a few miles back had stood on tall trunks above the water now seemed to burst from the surface at the level of the lower branches like decorative shrubs on barbered lawns. The truck passed a negro cabin. The water was up to the window ledges. A woman clutching two children squatted on the ridgepole, a man and a halfgrown youth, standing waist-deep, were hoisting a squealing pig onto the slanting roof of a barn, on the ridgepole of which sat a row of chickens and a turkey. Near the barn was a haystack on which a cow stood tied by a rope to the center pole and bawling steadily; a yelling negro boy on a saddleless mule which he flogged steadily, his legs clutching the mule’s barrel and his body leaned to the drag of a rope attached to a second mule, approached the haystack, splashing and floundering. The woman on the housetop began to shriek at the passing truck, her voice carrying faint and melodious across the brown water, becoming fainter and fainter as the truck passed and went on, ceasing at last, whether because of distance or because she had stopped screaming those in the truck did not know.",

After two days, and with no sign of rescue, Mr Bullen set off walking to find help. His wife was found in the vehicle three days later, down to her last half litre of water, and probably a day away from death. Mr Bullen has never been found, his body presumed to have been devoured by the predators which killed him. The risk of attack from animals is ever present in Chobe. Therefore, leaving the vehicle even for a few moments to remove stones or branches from the track, required absolute vigilance, with Kirsty posted as a lookout on the cab roof.",

We didn’t pass any other cars on our ascent through the quiet wood and at the summit were rewarded with a magnificent panorama of the surrounding valley and Ionian Sea. Our car was the only one in the parking lot of the eighteenth-century retreat, still functioning and available for use by reservation. Following signs, we quickly located access to the grotto, a deep, natural cave with jagged walls and sixty-two steps carved out of the stone that descended to the floor of the underground chamber. The small chapel at the bottom could be seen from above, six rows of chairs facing a raised altar set into the rock.",

    "target_paragraph": "When I returned back to my old life after this journey, everything on land seemed glorious and wonderful. I had developed a new appreciation for the common things. My bed, although disappointingly motionless, was big and soft and luxurious. My bathroom seemed incredibly convenient, with running water, a toilet that flushed every time, and a big bathtub with hot water and plenty of soap and shampoo. The laundry room, the kitchen, all the space in my house, the big yard – everything seemed so big and decadent, and still. It’s odd that nothing moves on land, while everything moves on the ocean. A sailor is never still, and thus can never totally relax. On land, one is often totally relaxed, and this seemed a luxury to me, although now I see that this is one reason why so many people are out of shape.\nThe company of people is a blessing that the solo sailor foregoes when at sea. While the tranquility and solitude are wonderful, after this journey I craved talking to other people. I wanted to tell my story to everyone. I wanted to hear what all my friends had been up to as well. Really it is the contrast which is so good. Everything on land and in society is a contrast to a solo sailing journey and this makes both seem more valuable, if both are experienced.\nI was lucky enough to find steady work soon after arriving home, and I will soon have all my debts paid off. I plan to work hard all year until spring and then sail to The Bahamas. In the past my attitude towards work has been slack. I’ve always enjoyed working short days, and taking days off whenever I felt like it. But now I have a new attitude. I’ve been working hard, putting in forty-hour weeks consistently. I don’t want days off spread out randomly. Instead I want to work hard and steadily until it’s time to go on another adventure.\nI want to focus only on the “prime time” of life, that is, the important activities, like adventure. Sobriety has helped me a lot in this respect. In the past, I was always encouraged to go home early from work by the fact that intoxicants were always waiting for me there. Why not go home and catch a buzz, the little devils in me would say. Sure, why not? Not anymore. Now I work all I can, knowing that I’m on schedule to be able to take a few months off in the spring if I can work steadily for the rest of the year.\nFor my next adventure, I plan is to sail from Jacksonville, Florida, where Sobrius is comfortably docked at The Marina at Ortega Landing, to San Salvador, The Bahamas, where I will clear customs and take a break, and maybe go surfing and SCUBA-diving. Then perhaps I’ll explore some of the more remote islands, like Samana Cay, the Plana Cays, and the Jumentos Cays. I’ll bask in solitude and do some freediving. I’ll look for the fabled blue holes and try to find an octopus to get on video. After getting my fill of the remote “Far Bahamas”, I’ll cruise through the Exumas, Eluthra, then the Abacos, and on back to Florida. Maybe I’ll go visit Cristina again before sailing home to St Augustine. There’s sure to be another book in such an adventure.\n*** END OF THIS TEXT Becoming a Sailor: A Singlehand Sailing Adventure ***",

All the shops were shut; the town centre was near-deserted; jeep-loads of heavily armed paramilitary types were patrolling the streets, their expressions suggesting direct descent from the ruga-ruga. In an unobtrusive one-storey tourist hotel by the lake I sought beer and information. For all I knew, it was normal in Malawi to have armed men cruising around a town but surely it was abnormal for shops to be shut on a weekday. In the hotel bar a grey-haired, elegantly dressed man was trying to get the World Service on his transistor. That seemed healthy; it is illegal to listen to foreign broadcasts that might occasionally criticise Banda or encourage the populace to think for themselves, but at least this gentleman was not being cowed by the cruising paramilitary.",

Before the Treaty of Trianon in 1920 Satu Mare was Szatmarnemeti, capital of the Hungarian county of Szatmar and a major trading post on the river Szamos. The Magyars claim that since being deprived of its natural hinterland across the border it has lost not only its prosperity but its character: which may well be true. Yet I enjoyed my first glimpse, despite every step provoking red-hot twinges. The architectural flavour of the city centre remains Magyar, as does a big minority of the population – though how big I couldn’t discover. The lack of reliable figures is a handicap all writers on Rumania must accept. Unreliable figures of course abound; statistics on everything from agriculture to zoology poured from Ceausescu’s presses, all designed to prove how singularly blessed among the nations was the Socialist Republic of Rumania.",

Later on had followed the marriage, hastily performed at Burgos, a small town on the frontier between the two countries, and the grand public entry into Madrid with the customary celebration of high mass at the Church of La Atocha, and a more than usually solemn auto-da-fé, in which nearly three hundred heretics, amongst whom were many Englishmen, had been delivered over to the secular arm to be burned.",

A moment later a flaming ten-foot-long plank crashed onto the pavement near him and he accepted advice to withdraw.

When one of them said, “Our next operation will be very soon!” Ugwu’s fear mixed with excitement at the thought that he was a soldier fighting for Biafra. If only he was with a real battalion, fighting with a gun. He remembered Professor Ekwenugo describing the ogbunigwe: “high-impact land mine.” How glamorous it sounded, this Biafran-made mine, this Ojukwu Bucket, this wonder that was so perplexing to the vandals that they were said to send cattle herds ahead to understand just how the ogbunigwe killed so many. But when he went to the first training session, he stared at what was before him: a dull metal container full of scrap metal.",

    "target_paragraph": "The crossing was over. They were arriving. The movement of the little steamer that had collected the passengers from the packet-boat drove the raw air against Miriam’s face. In her tired brain the grey river and the flat misty shores slid constantly into a vision of the gaslit dining-room at home ... the large clear glowing fire, the sounds of the family voices. Every effort to obliterate the picture brought back again the moment that had come at the dinner-table as they all sat silent for an instant with downcast eyes and she had suddenly longed to go on for ever just sitting there with them all.\nNow, in the boat she wanted to be free for the strange grey river and the grey shores. But the home scenes recurred relentlessly. Again and again she went through the last moments ... the good-byes, the unexpected convulsive force of her mother’s arms, her own dreadful inability to give any answering embrace. She could not remember saying a single word. There had been a feeling that came like a tide carrying her away. Eager and dumb and remorseful she had gone out of the house and into the cab with Sarah, and then had come the long sitting in the loop-line train ... “talk about something” ... Sarah sitting opposite and her unchanged voice saying “What shall we talk about?” And then a long waiting, and the brown leather strap swinging against the yellow grained door, the smell of dust and the dirty wooden flooring, with the noise of the wheels underneath going to the swinging tune of one of Heller’s “Sleepless Nights.” The train had made her sway with its movements. How still Sarah seemed to sit, fixed in the old life. Nothing had come but strange cruel emotions.\nAfter the suburban train nothing was distinct until the warm snowflakes were drifting against her face through the cold darkness on Harwich quay. Then, after what seemed like a great loop of time spent going helplessly up a gangway towards “the world” she had stood, face to face with the pale polite stewardess in her cabin. “I had better have a lemon, cut in two,” she had said, feeling suddenly stifled with fear. For hours she had lain despairing, watching the slowly swaying walls of her cabin or sinking with closed eyes through invertebrate dipping spaces. Before each releasing paroxysm she told herself “this is like death; one day I shall die, it will be like this.”\nShe supposed there would be breakfast soon on shore, a firm room and a teapot and cups and saucers. Cold and exhaustion would come to an end. She would be talking to her father.",

Now he comprehended what the old Negress had meant. He remembered now that it was Edmonds who had actually sent the boy to Jefferson in the first place: he had caught the boy breaking into his commissary store and had ordered him off the place and had forbidden him ever to return. And not the sheriff, the police, he thought. Something broader, quicker in scope.… He rose and took his old fine worn panama and descended the outside stairs and crossed the empty square in the hot suspension of noon’s beginning, to the office of the county newspaper.

He slammed on his brakes and asked, “Ma perchè?” But why would it not be safe? That anyone should disturb the peace of a graveyard was unbelievable to him. “Bestiale! Bestiale,” he alternately moaned and shouted, hitting his forehead with his hand as his bewilderment increased. “Have you no respect for the dead in your country?” he asked. “Are you barbarians, then?” When we reached the black iron entrance gates, he bought a white rose from a flower stall and presented it to me on account of my having to live among barbarians. . . .

He was a rather dejected-looking man whom I had already noticed maundering about the streets of Kyrenia. He was a cobbler by trade. He did not seem very exuberant – perhaps it was the weather – but almost without a word spoken led us up the boulder-strewn main street, slipping and stumbling amongst the wet stones. Irrigation channels everywhere had burst their banks and Sabri, still clad in his handkerchief, gazed gloomily about him as he picked his way among the compost heaps where the chickens browsed. ‘It’s no good, my dear,’ he said after we had covered about a hun­dred yards without arriving at the house. ‘You could never get up here.’ But still the guide led on, and curiosity made us follow him. The road had now become very steep indeed and resembled the bed of a torrent; down the centre poured a cas­cade of water. ‘My God,’ groaned Sabri, ‘it is a trout-stream, my dear.’ It certainly seemed like one. The three of us crept upwards, walking wherever possible on the facing-stones of the irrigation channel. ‘I am terribly sorry,’ said Sabri. ‘You will have a cold and blame me.’",

To change gears I had to push or pull with might and main. Next to walking, the freedom of a car is my favourite way to travel, depending on the car. This heavy ancient vehicle was going to be a beast but between us, turn and turn about, we could rest from the effort. Slowly we wound uphill past fields and thick forest until we reached the eastern edge of the Rift Valley. Far below, as far as I could see, lay the golden plain ringed by blue mountains.

The janitor turned the key in the lock; the door swung open to reveal a steep flight of steps disappearing deep down into the ground. He turned on his flashlight and led the way into the darkness. The steps were narrow, damp and slippery. Water dripped from the ceiling, generating soft growths of strange yellow lichens on the steps and on the walls.

This strange and moving illumination of his history explained so much about him--the growing bitterness and disdain towards everyone and everything, the sense of weary disgust and resignation, the cold venom of his humour, and that smile which kept his face almost perpetually puckered up. As he sat there, fragile, small, and graceful, smiling his wry smile, the whole legend of his life became plain. He had been life's tender child, so sensitive, so affectionate, so amazingly intelligent. He had been the fleeceling lamb thrust out into the cold to bear the blast and to endure want and loneliness. He had been wounded cruelly. He had been warped and twisted. He had come to this, and yet he had maintained a kind of bitter integrity.",

A slight, pale young man of Kashmiri – originally Persian – extraction, he was born and bred in Skardu but wears spotless, well-cut European-style clothes and speaks fluent English. It would not be unfair to call him a dandy; he objected to five hens sharing the charpoy on which we were sitting outside the chi-khana ‘because they will spoil our clothes’. Then he glanced at my grimy husky-suit and commiserated with me on the lack of dhobi facilities in Baltistan. I replied dryly that to us the dhobi situation is irrelevant as we have no change of outer garments. Despite his sartorial foibles Abbas Kazmi is a most likeable character, very knowledgeable about Baltistan and extremely kind. In Gilgit he had heard that I was planning to rent a room in Skardu for some weeks and today he assured me that this will not be necessary as we can use the empty house of a friend of his who winters down-country. In Asia it is always a good idea to broadcast one’s plans.",

Buckets of tea roses, carnations, tulips, gladiolas, birds of paradise, daisies, chrysanthemums, and tiger lilies are flown in from Holland and Central America and sold on every street corner. Milk chocolates come in shiny wrappings tied with ribbons; kiosk vendors shove aside their boxed juices and beer to make shelf space for perfumes and scented soaps and creams. Women parade about in their feminine finest while men commit random acts of chivalry. A perfect stranger actually stopped me in the middle of the street to hand me two pink carnations. Russians first celebrated this holiday as part of the peace movement against World War I in 1913. The Bolsheviks appropriated it as a socialist holiday, but it has since evolved from a day of feminism to one of femininity.",

They had moved away the week before, not only from their apartment but from Paris; and Miss Viner's breach with Mrs. Murrett had been too sudden to permit her letter and telegram to overtake them. Both communications, no doubt, still reposed in a pigeon-hole of the loge; but its custodian, when drawn from his lair, sulkily declined to let Miss Viner verify the fact, and only flung out, in return for Darrow's bribe, the statement that the Americans had gone to Joigny.",

Orwell was never oppressed himself; how could he write about oppression? It was a good question. Nineteen Eighty-Four has been recognized worldwide as a remarkably accurate description of life under a totalitarian regime. The book describes a soulless society ruled by the all-powerful Party, which controls people through ignorance (all history has been erased and current events are rewritten) and fear (through the ever present telescreen and the threat of vaporization).",

Every town has intricate locks on medieval doors, curly lanterns, holders for standards, garden gates, even fanciful iron animals and serpents shaped into rings for tying horses to the wall. Like other artisan traditions, this one is fast disappearing and it’s easy to see why. The key word in blacksmith is black. His shop is charred, soot covers him, the antiquated equipment, and the forges that seem to have changed very little since Hephaestus lit the fire in Aphrodite’s stove. Even the air seems hung with a fine veil of soot. All his neighbors have gates made by him. It must be satisfying to see one’s work all around like that. His own house has a square patterned balcony, a flirtation, no doubt, with moderne, redeemed by attached baskets for flowers. The shop faces the house and between them are hens, ten or so cages of rabbits, a vegetable garden, and a plum tree with a handmade wooden ladder leaning up into the laden branches. After supper, he must climb up a few rungs and pick his dessert. My impression that he stepped out of time strengthens. Where is Aphrodite, surely somewhere near this forge?",

Incontestably the best was Mr. Liu, the secretary of the Chinese Legation; then came Mr. Richardson, the British Representative, a gaunt Scotsman, slim and tough in his professional work. He had one great hobby—his splendid flower and vegetable garden. When one visited him, one imagined oneself in a garden in fairyland.",

    "target_paragraph": "There are few trees left now on Skye, as there are few people. The island lost many of its inhabitants during the Clearances of the nineteenth century, and it had lost most of its woodland only a few centuries earlier, through burning and felling. One of the first surviving descriptions of Skye, from 1549, describes it as an island with ‘maney woods, maney forests, maney deire’. Now the only real trace of Skye’s wooded past are the old paths through its remoter reaches, several of which were first paced out by foresters. Skye’s celebrated bleakness is a relatively recent acquisition, and one which speaks sadly of its past. Like so much of Scotland’s wildest land, this is not an empty landscape but an emptied one. On Skye, one recalls that ‘bleak’ comes from the Old Norse bleikr, meaning ‘white’ or ‘shining’; that it is a word through which the bone shows.",
