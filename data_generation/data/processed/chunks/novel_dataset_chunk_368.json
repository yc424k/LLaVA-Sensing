I stifled my protest, realizing I was about to be racist – a white expecting not to be treated as a potential shoplifter. Having emptied the bag I handed it over. The officer scowled. ‘Think I’m a thief? Think all blacks steal?’ I looked at him helplessly, too heat-addled to come up with a soothing reply. He turned away, making some remark in Xhosa that caused great merriment among the checkout queue.",

The jeep-track has long since been obliterated and the locals have tramped out for themselves an independent footpath which became so uncomfortable – and eventually dangerous – for Hallam that we had to turn back a mile short of the hamlet.

At about 200 feet, it suddenly made a 90-degree turn and I could clearly make out the silhouettes of the crew against the lights as they stood along the bridge deck. As they grazed by, my knees were shaking uncontrollably and I began to wonder, what if they hadn’t been watching? What could I have done? Varuna was heading downwind and it would have taken at least five minutes to drop the pole and jib and rearrange the sails in order to still have speed to get out of the way. In a brief twenty minutes, a ship could cross my horizon from first sight to last. If they could cross that distance so fast, five minutes and 200 feet would be scarcely enough to change my fate.",

When the sun shone that winter, reflected sunlight from the snow was bright enough to dazzle animals and birds. Poultry sat in their roosts all day long, stupefied into inaction by the land’s lustre.",

Blacks have also suffered most in the Special Period, since fewer can rely on remittances from overseas families (as far more whites have gone into exile than blacks).

It was full of cakes, pies, and puddings she and the cook had made ready for the coming holidays, when the Walkers, following a long-established custom, gave a party for all the British for miles around. I was glad to stay—my mouth was already watering—but how was I to get away afterward?",

    "target_paragraph": "Despite the economic risks?indeed, folly?of building ever larger theaters, owners somehow persuaded themselves that the answer was to keep doing so. The first half of 1927 alone saw the opening of Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, where patrons could enjoy movies from within the sanctum of a faux Buddhist pagoda; the 3,600-seat Norshore Theatre in Chicago, whose interiors were a confection of costly rococo; the similarly ornate and gleaming 3,100-seat Proctor’s 86th Street Theatre in New York; and the granddaddy of them all, the vast, bejeweled Roxy Theatre on 50th Street at Seventh Avenue in New York. Everything about the Roxy was without parallel: it seated 6,200 people; the dressing rooms could accommodate 300 performers; a 118-piece orchestra made every movie a symphonic as well as visual experience; an organ so massive it needed three men to play it provided musical interludes; 14 Steinway pianos were on permanent standby; the air in the theater was cooled and freshened by giant machines in the basement; and drinking fountains dispensed ice-cold water?a thrilling novelty. The Roxy even boasted its own “hospital” where, as the literature proudly noted, “even a major operation can be performed if necessary.” So dazzling was the infrastructure that even Scientific American sent a reporter to write a feature. A cartoon in The New Yorker showed a child in the lobby asking her mother in hushed awe, “Mama, does God live here?”",

Mega is a developer of malls in many Russian cities, and Ikea is—do I need to say what Ikea is? A behemoth, world-devouring home furnishings store? I asked a guy in the square how to get to the Mega-Ikea, and he told me what buses went there. He was wearing a jacket with the Dannon Yogurt label on it in Russian, so I figured he’d know.",

Then we entered the Palace of Ma’at, which was constructed under the direction of Hatshepsut. Her son, Thutmose III, resented her reign and ordered her cartouches destroyed or covered with other stones, and those new stones were inscribed with the great deeds of the bitter son. Mohamed explained the animosity as we walked along, but I was busy staring at the haunting figures all around us. We passed dozens of statues, many of which were toppled or defaced, if not destroyed outright. Often, the only remnant was a foot or pair of legs. These were the torsos and limbs of the statues that the Muslims encountered a thousand years ago. They saw only the heads, but we saw only the bodies. I asked Mohamed about the stone corpses.",

If you choose the wrong one it may simply stop five miles ahead, so that you have to back-track, having lost half a day’s travel. Or it may lead you to an abandoned, waterless windmill and bore, or slap-bang into a new fence-line, which, if followed, will begin leading you in exactly the opposite direction to where you thought you wanted to go, only now you’re not quite sure because you’ve made so many turnings and weavings that you are beginning to lose confidence in your sense of direction. Or it might lead you to a gate made by some jackaroo who thought he was Charles Atlas and which you haven’t got a hope in hell of opening, or if you can open it without suffering a rupture, then closing it is impossible without using the camels as a winch, which takes half an hour to do and you’re already hot and bothered and dusty and all you really want in life is to get to the next watering place and have an aspirin and a cup of tea and a good lie down.",

The cost of the move would likely be in the tens of millions of dollars, approximately none of which had yet been arranged. The state of Alaska had an office to deal with such potential moves, and a dozen communities threatened by climate change were considering relocating. The August vote wasn’t even the first such referendum in Shishmaref. The first one had been held in 1975, and residents had already voted, in 2002, to relocate.",

I laughed when Lakan set a Hindu trap—a large box that slammed shut when the critter walked into it. But I grew infuriated watching Lakan catch the mouse every morning and set him free across the road, only to see the rodent back by lunchtime. Then we sealed up the cracks in the house, but the mouse kept finding more—one night it even jumped down the chimney. I again called for killing as the only solution. Lakan blocked the chimney. Now I am like my Hindu guard—unable to kill anything. I’m not only vegetarian; even cockroaches and mosquitoes are safe in our home.",

Ralph Waldo Emerson, who traveled to St. Augustine in 1827 to recover from tuberculosis, was one of many who relished the city’s “dim vestiges of a romantic past” and ancient stones redolent of “a thousand heavy histories.”",

Two hours later in the twilight they saw through the streaming windows a burning plantation house. Juxtaposed to nowhere and neighbored by nothing it stood, a clear steady pyre-like flame rigidly fleeing its own reflection, burning in the dusk above the watery desolation with a quality paradoxical, outrageous and bizarre.",

    "target_paragraph": "REGROW MANGROVES\nMany of today’s popular beach vacation shorelines were once lined with mangroves, those large woody shrubs that thrive in the shallow, salty, coastal waters. They were removed for aesthetic reasons, or because experts believed that opening up the land to the sea breeze would make populations healthier. But it turns out that mangroves provide wonderful natural protection to coastlines against storms and erosion. Patrick Nunn, a geographer and geologist who spent much of his career researching the effects of sea level rise on Fiji, told me that on one Fijian island he studies, just two of the twenty or so waterfront villages never cleared their mangroves. “Of course those two communities are the ones that aren’t having any problems with shoreline erosion or coastal flooding,” he says.\nIn some places, including Fiji, efforts are under way to regrow the mangroves. Newly planted mangroves take around twenty-five years to mature into true protective buffers, and some long-term-oriented beach resorts are warming up to the idea of them. Six Senses, for example, is developing a couple of new resorts with plans to feature just a small beach surrounded by a big swath of mangroves.\nThe ultimate success of new mangrove forests at beach resorts will depend on a reimagining of what we consider to be an ideal beach, and that shift should be encouraged now, as we wait for newly planted mangroves to mature.\nBACK ON TIOMAN ISLAND, THE WORK CONTINUES FOR ALVIN CHELLIAH and Reef Check. It’s been a long road, but among the many small victories there has been a major one. The reefs around Tioman suffered their first major bleaching event in 2010, when 90 percent of the island’s surrounding coral reefs turned white, a major warning sign that coral is in danger of dying, and that is usually caused by warming waters. They slowly recovered, and the reefs in the water off Tioman Island have actually seen an increase in coral cover since 2013, a rare event in a world where coral cover has declined by somewhere between 30 and 50 percent since the 1980s. “I will not say it’s because of our own work, because we don’t know for sure,” Chelliah tells me. He lets a however hang in the air, unspoken.",

Later it found its way from the Vatican to the Bibliotheca Medicea Laurentiana in Florence.",

Dennis belonged to a group called the Children of God and had been sleeping rough in Japan for two years without money or a job. He was on his way to Korea (there is a boat that leaves from Shimonoseki), and the pamphlet he gave me, by ‘Moses David’, predicted among other things the destruction of the motor car (‘All of a sudden they are turned into carriages, wagon wheels and buggies!’). Dennis himself went a step further and predicted the destruction of America. This was a shame, he admitted, because his parents continued to live there, but every time he went back to America he was forced to be humble and polite because the people were all so much bigger than he was, and it was time God took a hand. Dennis also told me that spirits travel in bottles, and that at an exhibition of Chinese antiquities in London some spirits had jumped out of ancient bottles and entered carefully selected Englishmen. I escaped from Dennis fairly briskly and spent much of the afternoon in a coffee shop chatting to an old workman with large spaces between his teeth, which I glimpsed often because when he paused for breath he opened his mouth wide enough to trap half the bottled spirits in Shimonoseki.",

Then there were the bird cages, the iron hoops, the steel skates, the Queen Anne coal-scuttle, the bagatelle board, the hand organ—all gone, and jewels, too. Opals and emeralds, they lie about the roots of turnips. What a scraping paring affair it is to be sure! The wonder is that I've any clothes on my back, that I sit surrounded by solid furniture at this moment. Why, if one wants to compare life to anything, one must liken it to being blown through the Tube at fifty miles an hour—landing at the other end without a single hairpin in one's hair! Shot out at the feet of God entirely naked! Tumbling head over heels in the asphodel meadows like brown paper parcels pitched down a shoot in the post office! With one's hair flying back like the tail of a race-horse. Yes, that seems to express the rapidity of life, the perpetual waste and repair; all so casual, all so haphazard…",

Kangaroos are commoner in Australia now than they were before Europeans came because all the rural improvements—the encouragement of grassland, the creating of ponds and so on—has benefited them in the same way it has sheep and cattle. Nobody knows how many kangaroos the country holds, but the number is generally assumed to be over 100 million, making them not much less numerous than sheep. But could I find even one out here? I could not.",

    "target_paragraph": "Of course, Amsterdam’s flourishing mercantile classes did not invest only in art. Trade also financed the construction of the concentric canals encircling the city. Each of these was given a name indicative of the class of resident it hoped to attract: the Gentleman’s Canal (Herengracht), the Prince’s Canal (Prinsengracht), the Emperor’s Canal (Keizersgracht). A northern Venice was born, albeit with colder weather and worse food. Along the canals, handsome townhouses were built in classical or neo-Renaissance style, complete with ornamented façades, large windows and high-ceilinged rooms for entertaining guests. The houses were taxed according to their width at the front, so a unique shape of building evolved: narrow fronted but very tall and surprisingly deep, often with a sizable garden hidden Tardis-like at the back. Many included what the Dutch called doorzonwoningen, individual rooms running the whole length of the house, so that sunlight could shine all the way through from the windows at either end. Steep staircases saved valuable space inside, with elaborate systems of ropes and pulleys enabling front doors to be opened from upstairs by tugging on a loose end. Building smaller rooms on the upper floors than on the lower ones helped enhance the sense of perspective when one looked up from the street, exaggerating the height of the buildings. Gabled rooves were topped with flagpole holders pointing out like fingers, together with cranes and pulleys for lifting in furniture that would not fit through the narrow interior staircases.",
