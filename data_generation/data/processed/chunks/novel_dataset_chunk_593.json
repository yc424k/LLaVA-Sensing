    "target_paragraph": "We were lying within the dry cutting of a canal dug by Harun er Rashid, and now called the Nahr el ?aim. It is connected with the Tigris by several cross-cuttings, over one of which we passed a quarter of an hour from the camping-ground, and found upon the further side the ruins of ?adisiyah[116] (Fig. 119). They are nothing but a crumbling wall of sun-dried brick enclosing an octagonal area, but whether this space was ever covered with buildings it is difficult to determine[117]; I noticed, however, that the surface of the ground was piled into low mounds such as are left by the decay of sun-dried bricks. The octagon is far from regular. I paced the eight sides of the enclosing walls and found them to vary considerably from interior angle to interior angle, the smallest side being 565 paces, the largest 725 paces. Each angle is provided with an exterior round bastion, and at intervals of from twenty-eight to twenty-nine paces smaller round bastions project from the face of the wall. Six of the sides are broken by three gates apiece, one by four gates and one by two. The double-gated wall is the northern side of the octagon, and in the middle part of its length, between the two gates, there is a series of ten small vaulted chambers (3.55 m. wide by 3.65 m. deep) set against the interior face of the wall. The barrel vault of some of these chambers is still fairly well preserved. It is built of sun-dried brick laid in slices against the head wall on the Mesopotamian system, by which centering was avoided. Round the interior of the octagon, at a distance of thirteen paces from the wall, runs a shallow ditch, ten metres wide, having on its inner side a low mound which occupies a space about seventeen metres wide. The mound is no doubt the remains of a wall. Opposite each of the doorways in the outer wall, a causeway has been laid across the ditch. A wall and ditch upon the inner side of a strong fortification such as the enclosing wall of ?adisiyah are singular features. They can scarcely have been intended for defence, indeed I am not certain that they extend round the whole enclosure. The ditch may have been a canal bringing water to the palace or fortress.",

The nearest animal rose on its hind legs with lightning rapidity and struck twice with its fore feet at Varner’s face, faster than a boxer, the movement of its surge against the wire which held it travelling backward among the rest of the band in a wave of thuds and lunges. “Hup, you broom-tailed hay-burning sidewinders,” the same voice said. This was the second man who had arrived in the wagon. He was a stranger. He wore a heavy densely black moustache, a wide pale hat. When he thrust himself through and turned to herd them back from the horses they saw, thrust into the hip pockets of his tight jeans pants, the butt of a heavy pearl-handled pistol and a florid carton such as small cakes come in. “Keep away from them, boys,” he said. “They’ve got kind of skittish, they aint been rode in so long.”",

    "target_paragraph": "I’m fascinated by the perfect doors of the dead on this street. Traditionally, they’re considered to be exits for the plague dead—bad juju for them to go out the door the living use. If this is so, the custom must have come from some superstition much older than Christianity, which was firmly the religious preference of that time. Some suggest that the raised, narrow doors were used in times of strife when the portone, the main door, was barricaded. I’ve wondered if they were not simply doors used when stepping out of a carriage or off a horse and right into the house in bad weather—rather than stepping down into the wet, probably filthy, street—or even in good weather to protect a long silk skirt. George Dennis, nineteenth-century archaeologist, described Cortona as “squalid in the extreme.” That the doors are rather coffin shaped, however, lends a certain visual reinforcement to the door of the dead theory.",

He loved the sooty brown London walls, houses standing back to back, the dark flanks of the back wings jutting out, almost meeting across the trenches of the gardens, making the colours in his rooms brilliant as stained glass.\nHe loved the sound of the street outside, intensifying the quiet of the house.\nIt was the backs that were so beautiful at night; the long straight ranges of the dark walls, the sudden high dark cliffs and peaks of the walls, hollowed out into long galleries filled with thick, burning light, rows on rows of oblong casements opening into the light. Here and there a tree stood up black in the trenches of the gardens.\nThe tight strain in her mind loosened and melted in the stream of the pure new light, the pure new darkness, the pure new colours.\nRichard came in. They stood together a long time, looking out; they didn't say a word.\nThen, as they turned back to the lighted outer room, \"I thought I was to have had Tiedeman's flat?\"\n\"Well, he's up another flight of stairs and the rain makes a row on the skylight.

He didn’t buy it. “Nothing’s going to change,” he said, still smirking. “It’ll all be the same.” He watched for a few minutes more as Díaz-Canel was called up to the dais. The new president walked briskly, his expensive suit jacket unbuttoned. When he casually slapped the hands of the first-row delegates as though they were opponents at the end of a friendly baseball game, Oscar yelled, “Hey, look at that!” This new guy’s politics might not be any different from the others, but at least he had a sense of style.",

The cold drink craze has also taken off – yet another American bad habit – despite icy drinks being so unhealthy in hot climates. (As the Indians taught me many years ago, scalding tea is the most cooling drink when one’s body is overheated.) Even in non-electrified Nem Thone fizzy drinks and Beerlao are cooled in large metal iceboxes standing on beer crates outside every little eat-drink shop.

As we approached the car, he lifted his hand, and said in English, ‘No photograph,’ then in Pitjantjara, ‘It makes me feel sick.’ I laughed. Rick captured that one moment and then desisted. When we had that photo developed much later on, there was a woman smiling at an old Aboriginal man, whose hand was raised in a cheery salute. So much for the discerning eye of the camera. That one slide speaks volumes. Or rather lies volumes. Whenever I look at it now, it sums up all the images of the journey. While I love the photos Rick took, they are essentially of his trip, not my own. I don’t think dear Richard has ever understood this.",

Presumably he is engaged on some intrigue with one of the maids in the pantry, but as no visible proof is offered us, in the courtyard, we can but hope for the best and leave it. Clouds pass, thin or thick, with some disturbance of the colour of the grass beneath. The sun-dial registers the hour in its usual cryptic way. One’s mind begins tossing up a question or two, idly, vainly, about this same life. Life, it sings, or croons rather, like a kettle on a hob, Life, life, what art thou? Light or darkness, the baize apron of the under footman or the shadow of the starling on the grass?",

    "target_paragraph": "From the drawing-room Alina led me down a long corridor-cum-patio, the former roofed, the latter a jungle of shrubs, cacti, creepers, ferns and young trees, now being thoroughly washed through wire netting to Alina’s gratification. Superb tiles, brought from Spain in the eighteenth century but still unchipped, brightened both floor and wainscoting. Antique copper bracket lamps lit all the main rooms and delicately wrought grills protected the windows. The ten-foot-high doorways were narrow in proportion – the effect elegant, with finely carved wooden screens filling each doorway’s middle section, allowing air to circulate in the windowless bedrooms. Alina warned me that my 1940s air-conditioning didn’t respond for eight minutes after the switch being pressed – then it came on with multiple thuds, like an elephant step-dancing, before settling down to a rattle-and-whine duet. I sweated instead. Just outside my door a giant tinajone was still in use beneath a gutter. These bulbous clay jars, up to five feet tall and ten feet in diameter, are to be seen all over Camaguey – though usually, now, as ornaments. Invented to store oil, wine or grain, the Spaniards imported them to this drought-prone city for water storage; when half-buried in the earth their contents remain cool and fresh. In the seventeenth century Camaguey began to make its own tinajones and soon a family’s wealth was being judged by the quantity and quality of its water-jars.",

I picked up a card from reception with the name and address of the hotel in English, and its Chinese language equivalent beneath. Exploring Beijing was exhausting. The distances seemed huge, and we began to doubt the accuracy of the scale on our Rough Guide map. Also, with few 'free range' western tourists managing to escape from their tour groups, we became something of a sensation as we visited Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. Chinese visitors from the countryside were particularly excited to see us, and as crowds gathered, an ancient camera would be produced for a family snap with the exotic European visitors. Babies were held aloft, teens blushed and giggled, and bashful grandparents shoved to the front, as we grinned for the camera and revelled in our new-found celebrity status.",

We sat cross-legged on purple cushions while Leo prepared a fire in a copper pyramid using sun-dried cowdung coated with ghee, and at the exact moment of sunset he began chanting the first mantra. Precision, apparently, is crucial, and a computer printout is dispatched from Agnihotra headquarters in the United States with daily timings – down to seconds – calculated according to latitude and longitude. During this mantra he sprinkled grains of ghee-moistened brown rice onto the fire. This was repeated with another mantra, and meditation. The principle behind Agnihotra is that fire purifies the atmosphere, releasing healing energies: ‘Heal the atmosphere, and the atmosphere heals you.’ Some people eat the ash of the cowdung as a sifted powder after the ceremony, but we were spared this.",

When he presented himself at the luncheon hour the very air of the little sitting-room breathed a new serenity; it was as if she had been out early to fill it with flowers. Boyne was not used to delicate readjustments in his sentimental relations. For so many years now his feeling for Rose Sellars had been something apart, like a beautiful picture on the wall of a quiet room; and his other amorous episodes had been too brief and simple for any great amount of manœuvring. He was therefore completely reassured by the gaiety and simplicity of her welcome, and thought to himself once again that there was everything to be said in favour of a long social acquiescence. “A stupid woman, now, would insist on going over the whole thing again, like a blue-bottle that starts in banging about the room after you’re sure you’ve driven it out of the window.”",

Choosing the left fork – it looked more used – I jolted past a few comely farmhouses but had covered scarcely a mile when the rain came, driven by a gusty gale that made cycling in a cape on a deeply-rutted track seem unduly hazardous. So I walked the next five miles as the track continued to climb, gradually, towards the distant dark blue bulk of Mount Harghita. This was a densely populated, non-collectivised ridge.",

From what I could gather, no topics were off limits. They joked about eating disorders and how ugly they all looked.

When they discovered the love motel only played boring straight porn, Bourebonne-san had to use gay porn on his iPod to get his lover into the mood, by which time the man had fallen asleep.

As he left the room I had the uneasy feeling that he had misunderstood me. He thought I believed he was not trying hard enough. He came back into the room holding a thick, clear plastic bag of medium size, the kind you get when you buy a twenty-pound bag of ice cubes. Erby eyed the bag. The chief winked at me and smiled. It occurred to me that the bag might be a standard piece of equipment here at the station. The chief took his time, casually holding the bag’s top open and shaking it into shape, holding it in front of Erby and grinning malevolently at him. He suddenly snapped it down, bagging Erby’s head. He tightened its mouth at Erby’s throat with his right hand, glanced at his watch and assumed an air of boredom. A look of panic gripped Erby’s features, his face clearly visible through the plastic. He started to buck and shake, sucking plastic into his mouth as he gasped for air. He was a thief, but I still felt bad for the guy. I thought the chief might kill him if he didn’t get the information he wanted. I protested.",

But the fire is cold, as in the eyes of a cat, it is a green fire. It is fluid, electric. At its maximum it is the white ecstasy of phosphorescence, in the darkness, always amid the darkness, as under the black fur of a cat. Like the feline fire, it is destructive, always consuming and reducing to the ecstasy of sensation, which is the end in itself.",

It was a classic Colombian scene: children too numerous to keep track of, an indulgent father, a grandmother who muttered to herself on a porch overlooking flowers and fruit trees, an angelic sister who more than once carried her brother and me home half-drunk to a mother, kind beyond words, who stood by the garden gate, hands on hips, feigning anger as she tapped her foot on the stone steps. For eight weeks, I encountered the warmth and decency of a people charged with a strange intensity, a passion for life, and a quiet acceptance of the frailty of the human spirit. Several of the older Canadian students longed for home. I felt as if I had finally found it.",

Decidedly it was his day; the fire lit, the stovepipe drew. But as he knelt before it he felt a faint anxiety. Laura Lou sat behind him. She had not spoken since they had entered the shanty, and he wondered if she had felt a shock of disappointment. Perhaps she had expected a cosy overheated room in a New York or Philadelphia hotel, with white sheets on the bed and running water--oh, God, he thought suddenly, how the hell were they going to get washed? There wasn’t a basin or pitcher, much less soap or towel. In summer, no doubt, the manager and his wife just ran down to the sea for a dip. . . . Vance began to be afraid to look around. At length he heard a sound behind him and felt Laura Lou’s hands on his shoulders. He turned without rising, and her face, flushed and wet with tears, hung close over him. “Why, what is it, darling? The place too rough for you--too lonely? You’re sorry we came?” he cried remorsefully.",

It was formed by the curtains of Beijing’s LGBT centre, thick vertical blocks of red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple that – when pulled right across – formed a pride flag. You’d think a giant gay rainbow would be conspicuous in a grey cement city like Beijing, but rainbows were only a beacon if you were looking for one, and most Chinese people weren’t aware a local pride movement existed, not knowing that rainbows were used to represent it.",
