After hours of grinding up over what is truly spectacular scenery, I am shocked to discover that the downside is so steep as to be unrideable. This section is one of the top ten best hill climbs in the world, if you are riding up the other way. Several years ago, it was part of the Tour de France. Yes, the Tour went through Yorkshire Dales as attested to by the numerous memento yellow cycles hanging on walls and displayed in gardens and town squares. We walk down successive grades of 14%, 16%, and 19%. For a really, really long time. To experience this, take that twenty kilogram box and let it hang from your arms while walking along for two hours. The redeeming factor is that the scenery is broad, open, and majestic. We make it to Pateley Bridge. It is still raining.",

Weary as she was she went—all the way down the rambling staircases to the ground floor, then to search for a lantern, which she lighted and hid under her cloak; then for a wet sponge, and next forth into the night. The white railing stared out in the darkness at her approach, and a ray from the enshrouded lantern fell upon the blood—just where he had told her it would be found. She shuddered. It was almost too much to bear in one day—but with a shaking hand she sponged the rail clean, and returned to the house.",

And poor Juana, with head down and ears back, was misery personified. At last Rachel began to crack up; for the first time she complained, of cold feet. I knew the agony she was enduring – you might say we were both in the same boot – but as the sky was lightening slightly I urged her to keep going in the hope that soon we could set up a dry camp. Then the snow became rain/sleet and soon there was a lull, though the clouds remained low and unbroken. We rushed the tent up and were just putting down the last peg when the sleet started again.",

We have wandered arm in arm through the seven rooms of the Miami Beach gay club Twist until the gray predawn. We have swayed together to Lana Del Rey’s languorous voice in an Atlanta amphitheater and held hands on the chain lift of a Dollywood roller-coaster.

On his feet, it was noticed, he wore carpet slippers. The entire enterprise was patently misguided, but no one tried to stop him. As Pinedo’s plane hurtled down the runway, it began to weave from side to side, then veered toward an administration building where a small crowd had gathered. It missed the crowd but clipped a wing on some obstruction, tipped up on its nose, and crashed into a parked car. Pinedo was thrown clear. According to some accounts, he rose from the tarmac and tried to get back into the plane?presumably in a state of confusion. Other witnesses said he remained motionless on the ground. At all events, before anyone could get to him the plane exploded. Pinedo perished in a giant fireball. What was going through his mind that morning and why he didn’t abandon the takeoff when it was so clearly going wrong are questions that can of course now never be answered.",

Everyone wanted to invite me to their home or show me some special feature of the landscape, and the week was quickly booked up with projected outings and dinners. Later in the evening Mario made a fulsome speech thanking his good and loyal friends for sharing this special day with him.

While he was filming an interview, Taliban officials chopped down a door with an ax and burst in—luckily the ax was so blunt he had time to hide his camera. After experiencing a country suffering from the hardships imposed by a puritanical Islamic regime, a dreadful drought, disease, famine and war, he is depressed about the human condition. I was concerned my stories would seem rather self-indulgent to him, but Jonathan insists he needs them. I am his keyhole to the world of peace and love.",

Seagulls scream round the portholes.\nThe dawn has broken over a river three miles wide. On either shore the trees look dwindled and sickly, or are not there at all. The tundra is starting. The clouds lie in some stilled current of their own, making long, flat-bottomed flotillas across the blue. The eye searches for a focus, fails.

There were only one or two drawbacks—at mealtimes I found myself less and less able to choke down my dry chicken and rice, and there were still those damned log bridges, though Sabani had worked out a method of getting me over them that saved time, even though it shamed me. Whenever we came to a bridge, half the party went ahead and spaced themselves along it like a bucket squad, the last one holding out his hand for me. I would then inch cautiously across, clutching with my other hand that of the first member of the rear party, solemnly following. It worked every time but one. That was toward the end of a long day's march. The log was unusually fat, and perhaps I was overconfident that I could negotiate it. Across the creek was a welcoming committee from the next village, waiting for us. I was carrying Angelique on my shoulder. There had been a sharp rainfall a few minutes earlier, and I guess the log was slimier than I expected. Anyway, halfway over my foot slipped and it happened. Down I went into a stream bed that was more than half mud, Angelique throttling me and yelling in terror.",

His letters from the Isle of Pines prison (not written for publication) reveal an extraordinary depth and breadth of reading for a man in his middle twenties. Discussing books kept him a happy prisoner – Shakespeare and Thackeray, Kant and Freud, Turgenev and Dostoyevsky, Descartes and Marx, Varela and Martí, Cervantes and Plutarch. From dawn to dusk he read, mentioning in a letter dated 18 March 1954, ‘I fell asleep finishing The Transcendental Aesthetics of Space and Time’. Most of us would have fallen asleep beginning it.",

We bumped along overgrown tracks through meadowy vales and skittered up near-perpendicular gravel roads to hidden fire towers. At every turn there was a point of interest or a memorable view. Alpine National Park is immense—about three times the size of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in America—but it is actually vaster still because it is contiguous along its eastern border with the even larger Kosciusko National Park in the Snowy Mountains just over the border in New South Wales.

It was a gesture, not the youth’s but the family’s—one of those gestures of modesty and discretion of the potent and powerful who are powerful and potent enough to afford even discretion and modesty; they and he too were all waiting for the same thing: for the arrival of the great suave hearselike midnight-colored limousine bringing not the civilian secretary bearing the captaincy like a ducal coronet on a velvet cushion, but rather the uncle-Minister himself, who would walk the nephew back to the Quai d’Orsay and in that privacy fling away the meagre African subaltern’s kit with the cold outrage of a cardinal plucking a copy of Martin Luther from the robe of a kneeling candidate for consecration. But that didn’t happen either. The car would have come too late. Because, although the draft to which he would have been posted was not to leave for two weeks yet and its personnel had not even begun to arrive at the depot, he was gone after only one night, to Africa, to immediate field service, quietly, almost surreptitiously, with the same simple sublieutenant’s rank and the same meagre equipment which the rest of them would have in their turn.",

The interminable forest is richer and greener than anything I have yet seen, but penetrable only by narrow tracks which have been made for hauling timber. The trees are so dense, and so matted together with trailers, that no ray of noon-day sun brightens the moist tangle of exquisite mosses and ferns which covers the ground. Yams with their burnished leaves, and the Polypodium spectrum, wind round every tree stem, and the heavy ie, which here attains gigantic proportions, links the tops of the tallest trees together by its knotted coils. Hot-house flowers grow in rank profusion round every house, and tea-roses, fuchsias, geraniums fifteen feet high, Nile lilies, Chinese lantern plants, begonias, lantanas, hibiscus, passion-flowers, Cape jasmine, the hoya, the tuberose, the beautiful but overpoweringly sweet ginger plant, and a hundred others: while the whole district is overrun with the Datura brugmansia (?), here an arborescent shrub fourteen feet high, bearing seventy great, trumpet-shaped, white blossoms at a time, which at night vie with those of the night-blowing Cereus in filling the air with odours.",

This was a rather sad occasion, for during their three weeks here these people became very much part of the camp, and their kindness and gaiety considerably brightened our lives. After dinner we went to the local cinema where I saw my first – and I sincerely hope my last – Hindi film. It was supposed to be superb, one of the best ever, but to me it seemed too boring for description. And it lasted for hours. Oliver very sensibly went to sleep after fifteen minutes, was wakened at the interval and returned to sleep immediately on resumption of play. Juliet, who likes everything Indian, enjoyed it thoroughly; I planned a new article and our host and hostess hunted fleas, of which there were an inordinate number in the immediate vicinity. By the time we were released at 11 p.m. it had become bitterly cold and the sky was ablaze with a frosty glitter of stars.",

As Kate sat there in the dark, she saw, detached against the blackness of her closed lids, a child stumbling with unsteady steps across a windy beach, a funny flushed child with sand in her hair and in the creases of her fat legs, who clutched to her breast something she was bringing to her mother. “It’s for mummy,” she said solemnly, opening her pink palms on a dead star-fish.

    "target_paragraph": "I’ve evolved a new technique of cycling in this sort of weather. Instead of taking a three-hour midday break I experimented yesterday and today with quarter-hour rests every twelve or fifteen miles and found this much more satisfactory. By 7.30 a.m. today it was uncomfortably hot and I find that fifteen miles is the limit at a stretch without a feeling of exhaustion setting in. Then just ten or fifteen minutes out of the sun, with hot, very sweet tea, restores one for the next lap. Perhaps this technique is quite wrong medically; I’m just going on instinct as to what best suits my physique. At 2 p.m. today an American AID man in a jeep pulled up to tell me that the temperature was 102° in the shade and that I was mad. I thanked him and explained my technique, but just standing still under that sun for a few minutes while talking to him made me feel quite dizzy. Roz will have to get rubber grips for her brakes as I burnt three fingers today on the over-heated metal. What’s really worrying me is the effect this heat must be having on her tyres.",

Because we were so preponderantly female, the conversation had a way of slipping over into things which interested women, especially clothes. Well, Dad took to listening. He would prick up his ears when we spoke of dress, alert against the slightest sign of vanity. He permitted us to discuss clothing in its primary function, as a protection against the elements, but that was all. As long as Mother said something harmless, such as \"It's time to get you a warm coat, Helen. Your blue won't do for really cold weather,\" or Dauphine spoke up for a new pair of rubbers, nothing happened down at Dad's end of the table. But the talk never stopped there. Sooner or later, one of us, usually one of the older ones, would begin describing the divine red party dress she was planning for spring, or someone would set up a howl for a new hat, and there the fat would be, sizzling right in the middle of the fire.",

At a corner he stopped to dip his handkerchief in a trough for watering horses, bathing his face and hands.

At the corner stood a lonely house—and in the road-side the most battered, life-weary old carriage I have ever seen. The jaunty mate sorted out the post—the boy with the tattered-battered brown carriage and brown pony signed the book as we all stood in the roadway. There was a little wait for a man who was fetching up another parcel. The postbag and parcels from the tattered carriage were received and stowed and signed for. We walked up and down in the sun to get warm. The landscape was wild and open round about.",

    "target_paragraph": "At one moment her eyes, which had clung to his so anxiously, always asking for something he could not guess, suddenly became the eyes of a stranger. She looked at him in terror, and sitting up thrust him back. “Oh, go away--go away! You shan’t take Vanny from me . . . I say you shan’t!” For a while she rambled on, battling against the obduracy of some invisible presence; then she sank back, and tears of weakness forced their way through the lids she had shut against her husband . . . Vance threw himself down by her and held her in beseeching arms. “Laura Lou . . . Laura Lou . . . Vanny’s here; love, it’s Vanny holding you. . . .” With passionate murmurs he smoothed the hair from her forehead, and gradually her contracted face relaxed, and she opened her lids, and tried to smile. “Is it you, Vanny? Don’t go . . . you’ll never leave me any more, will you?” . . . She dozed off on his shoulder for a few minutes before the cough woke her again. . . .When morning came she refused to touch the milk he had warmed, and lay tossing and coughing in parched misery. What was it? Bronchitis? His heart sank: what was it people did for bronchitis? There was no telephone, and no nearby neighbour except an old deaf woman who would probably not be of much use--even if Vance could absent himself long enough to summon her. He decided to run across to the deaf woman’s house, and bribe her grandson, a lazy fellow who was not on good terms with Mrs. Tracy, to bicycle to Paul’s Landing for a doctor; but whenever he tried to creep out of the room his shoes creaked or a board cried, and Laura Lou started up. “Don’t leave me, Vanny--you mustn’t leave me . . .” and the heavy hours dragged on . . . Vance rummaged out an old bottle of cough mixture, and gave her some; but it did not relieve her, and the hands she wound about his neck grew drier and more burning. It was as if the fever were visibly consuming her, so small and shrunken had her restless body become. As he sat there and watched it was her turn to become a stranger: this haggard changeling was not the tender creature whom he loved. This discovery of the frail limits of personality, of the transformation of what seemed closest and most fixed in the flux of life, dragged his brain down into a labyrinth of conjecture. What was she, this being so beloved and so unknown? Something in her craved for him and clung to him, yet when he tried to reach that something it was not there. Unknown forces possessed her, she was wandering in ways he could not follow. . . . Now and then he got up and replenished the stove; now and then he wet a handkerchief with cologne water and put it on her forehead, or clumsily shook up her pillows. . . . But he did it all automatically, as if he too were elsewhere, in ways as lonely as those she walked. . . . Was this why we were all so fundamentally alone? Because, as each might blend with another in blissful fusion, so, at any moment, the empty eyes of a stranger might meet us under familiar brows? But then, where was the real primordial personality, each man’s indestructible inmost self? Where did it hide, what was it made of, what laws controlled it? What was the Vance Weston who must remain himself though sickness and sorrow and ruin destroyed the familiar surface of his being? Or was there no such unchangeable nucleus? Would he and Laura Lou and all their kind flow back finally into that vast impersonal Divinity which had loomed in his boyish dreams? . . . But, oh, those little hands with twining fingers, the deep-lashed eyes, the hollows under the cheekbones--those were Laura Lou’s and no other’s, they belonged to the body he worshipped, whose lovely secrets were his. . . .",

But you also can expect one result of this kind of impact to be a lot of pieces that are utterly invisible to our radar or optical sensors. I wonder about those pieces we can’t see. Whenever the astronauts take space walks I always think what guts they have. One little paint fleck to the visor, at those velocities, and you’re dead.”",

Everywhere the effects were felt. The hardy country gentleman, who had sat down gladly to a meal of ale and beef in a room designed, perhaps by the brothers Adam,* with classic dignity, now felt chilly. Rugs appeared; beards were grown; trousers were fastened tight under the instep. The chill which he felt in his legs the country gentleman soon transferred to his house; furniture was muffled; walls and tables were covered; nothing was left bare. Then a change of diet became essential. The muffin was invented and the crumpet. Coffee supplanted the after-dinner port, and, as coffee led to a drawing-room in which to drink it, and a drawing-room to glass cases, and glass cases to artificial flowers, and artificial flowers to mantelpieces, and mantelpieces to pianofortes, and pianofortes to drawing-room ballads, and drawing-room ballads (skipping a stage or two) to innumerable little dogs, mats, and china ornaments, the home—which had become extremely important—was completely altered.",

The dust was fine as powder and unbroken; only an occasional hoof-print, a fading ghost of a forgotten passage.

Brad was getting frustrated, clearly wanting to demonstrate his horsemanship by achieving a faster pace from Angelo, his black gelding. His initial attempts at trotting were greeted with a discouraging shake of the head from Ignacio. My own horse, El Gordo, or the Fat One, lived up to his name with an excessively broad back, which caused my thighs to splay across his width a little more than was comfortable. I was therefore happy with the sedentary pace.",

    "target_paragraph": "However lukewarm many Chilean Catholics were about the faith, everyone I met, up and down the country, seemed to have a strong sense of the importance of the Church as a national institution, both historically and in their own time. It was different from faith. It was a sense, or an awareness, which had been bred into their ancestors. It had survived the arrival of the secular age, which by the mid-nineteenth century had dislodged the Church from the privileged position it had inherited from medieval Europe, and it had outlived the 1925 constitution, which officially separated Church and State after almost fifty years of political controversy on the subject. (Disestablishment was characteristic of a trend in Europe as well as South America, and in Chile the transition was a particularly smooth one.) Despite the fact that over the next decades the Chilean Catholic Church moved towards the centre, it remained close to the ruling and landowning élite until the 1960s – and then it was overtaken by a small revolution.",
