Instead, the guides reassured me that it was going to take time to learn to approach an elephant. They even told me to expect to run away many more times. “It’s okay to back away and get out of there,” one said. “Running away gives you a chance to come back and try again. Stay at the wrong time and you won’t get that chance.” That observation seemed sensible.",

Whoever commissioned this extravaganza in dark carved wood should have been struck dead by St Michael’s sword.

There is not a street in Naples in which some tough little kid in shorts and mismatched socks is not screaming up from the sidewalk to some other tough little kid on a rooftop nearby.

Translated as “the real people,” the Blackfoot Indians of Western Montana call these mountains the backbone of the world. The Blackfoot traditionally used Glacier’s passes as travel routes and rarely lived in the mountains, steep as they were, glaciated and inhospitable. Some peaks have sacred purposes—vision quests, celebrations—but home was always the plains, where long vistas made enemies easy to spot and prevalent game surrounded the settlement. The current towns of Babb and East Glacier mimic that historical range, lying just east of the divide on the Blackfoot Reservation. To an outsider’s eye it’s a desolate and hardscrabble place; rustic, undeveloped, perched on the edge of the gust-scoured plains as if it’s only there until the wind moves it again.",

    "target_paragraph": "We rode the water taxi across the bay toward the Muelle Ecoturistico, the new ecotourism dock in front of the charming seaside village of Baquerizo Moreno, also the capital Galápagos Province. Blue-footed boobies circled high above the bay, wheeling until they spotted a meal swimming below the surface, whereupon they tucked in their wings and became missiles, screaming down at fantastic speed until they slammed into the water and shot down onto their unsuspecting prey, trailing streams of bubbles through the cold, clear water. Seldom did they surface without a fish dangling from their beaks. We passed close by anchored tour boats awaiting passengers and moored fishing skiffs overloaded with lolling sea lions basking in the sun on carpets of hairy slime. The animals showed no fear. They seemed to know they are now protected by law and can’t be harmed by people. They appeared to be taunting us, daring us to try and run them off their co-opted perches. Brilliant equatorial sunshine sparkled on the bay’s surface. It looked hot, but the air felt unnaturally cool, chilled by the frigid water. The Humboldt Current flows directly up from the high latitudes at the southern tip of Chile and right through the Galápagos archipelago, dropping the water temperature many degrees below what it would otherwise be. One of the great ocean currents of the world, its low salinity and cool temperatures make it possible for many of the exceptional life forms of these islands to thrive, particularly the marine animals.",

She’d growl though, if we coughed or spoke too loudly. Or worse, she’d hiss, like she was a hair’s breadth away from attacking. Why she didn’t, I don’t know. She could have done. And just the possibility was enough to keep my nerves impossibly frayed. I concentrated on holding my questions to a minimum but towards the end, when my stomach was eating itself with hunger, I was finding it hard. Would we be out all night? How could we possibly convince her to get back to the cage? The forest had hushed, edged with the grainy golds of dusk. And then, right then, everything changed. Suddenly she wanted to go back. The cage was no more than five minutes from where we’d been sitting—we’d been walking in circles, Jane told me, rather than further and further away from anything, as my brain had tricked me into believing. And Wayra hurried back to that small, cramped cage like a magnet finding her way home, just in time for dinner.",

By noon the little pueblo – its red roofs widely scattered among green groves – looked like a wooden Toytown I had as a child. Our path was then rounding a colossal rocky bulge (a sort of mountain hernia) and it seemed one could drop stones onto the diminutive roofs. The teachers had told us how to find the way at this point but somehow I missed the junction they had so carefully described. For half an hour we rambled to and fro across a plateau divided by dry stone walls into small, parched fields. Here the dirge-like rustle of dead maize sounded loud and we grieved over the unrewarded labour that had gone into the cultivation of these crops. Eventually we plunged into a narrow green valley and began a gruelling climb through thorny scrub onto another plateau, higher and more rugged. From here a shadowy path, overhanging a sensational abyss, led to a distant craggy summit. I rejoiced, but not so Rachel. ‘That’s only for goats!’ she snorted. We climbed through vicious thickets of spiked cacti and poisonous thorn-bushes which one didn’t dare dodge because that crumbling path left no room for manoeuvring. Then the gradient became even more severe, amidst a wide, forbidding wilderness of large dark boulders. Finally the going got so rough that I went on alone to investigate, just as the puna wind drove an opaque sheet of sleet in our direction. Tiresomely, Rachel was right again. It would have been impossible to get Juana over the top; I found the climb difficult enough and if she missed her footing the drop would be onto a disarray of boulders a thousand feet below.",

Entire families sit clinging to their luggage—women dressed in their best silk saris with fresh flowers in their hair clutch children dressed as Krishna.

Day in and day out there’s a continuous field of growing wheat, the green flatness relieved only now and then by a copse of green birch trees. In its monotone texture and color it feels much like Mongolia, though I’m still grateful to see green instead of brown. It’s early summer and the air is fresh, moistened each day with several hours of drizzle. It all seems benign and cultivated, but I can see how this flat landscape, when whipped by winds during Siberia’s subarctic winters, would be a more impenetrable barrier than anything man made. In areas such as this, more than a quarter of the gulag population died of cold and starvation during World War II. Today, in this massive monoculture landscape, there’s no animal life to see, no shaggy Mongolian goats chased by skittering motor bikes, no shedding Bactrian camels pacing toward greener pastures. The only life along the road is an occasional black and tan raven scavenging road-killed bunnies. For all the greenery, this landscape feels more empty than Mongolia.",

We received stacks and stacks of these daily, all seemingly written in the same florid hand and all saying the same numbing things: “A most fascinating demonstration was given by Mr Arthur Smoat of Pokesdown on the art of making animal shadows,” “Mrs Evelyn Stubbs honoured the assembled guests with a most fascinating and amusing talk on her recent hysterectomy,” “Mrs Throop was unable to give her planned talk on dog management because of her recent tragic mauling by her mastiff, Prince, but Mrs Smethwick gamely stepped into the breach with an hilarious account of her experiences as a free-lance funeral organist.” Every one of them went on and on with page after page of votes of thanks, appeals for funds, long-winded accounts of successful jumble sales and coffee mornings, and detailed lists of who had supplied which refreshments and how delightful they all were.

Then I handed him another two and said his father should take these in four hours, per the directions on the bottle. Here a language problem created what became an afternoon of drama for me, though I told no one about it. The Russian phrases for “in four hours” and “at four o’clock” resemble each other, and though I had meant to say the first, I accidentally said the second.

But the town itself was a riot of greens, reds and oranges: trees and gardens backing onto flat-topped Turkish houses, with the whole vista broken by the vertical punctuation of a hundred minarets. Some of these were the conventional Turkish pencil-shape, others were more unusual: the Ulu Jami retained its Byzantine octagon, while a square campanile rising above the fishponds with four double-arched horseshoe openings may once also have been the bell-tower of an early medieval church.",

    "target_paragraph": "KOBE, FROM WHERE I HAVE just come, is indication enough of Japan’s sad future. It has become a large, overgrown, unfinished-looking city. It contains big new hotels shouldering out shrines and temples, big new banks pushing away parks and gardens, big new parking lots where the gracious old inns of the city once stood. Yet enough of the old remains to spoil the effect of a new Los Angeles. The city is a hybrid. East and West have collided here and the wreckage is strewn at large.\nKobe looks like Manila, that city which is neither one thing nor the other. It is like the gentle tiglon—no teeth, no claws, the strongest characteristics of each parent having been canceled out. In the abject Philippines the resemblance to this unhappy animal is stronger in that such has been the fate not only of the city but of the countryside as well. In Japan the symptoms are, as yet, mainly visible only in the larger cities.\nIt is at Kobe, or at Yokohama, that the sea-borne traveler gets his first glimpse of new Japan. A single look, one would think, would be enough to send him back home again. Nor does the air-borne traveler fare better with the airports of Tokyo and Osaka.\nEven here at Himeji the destruction is already well begun, though the results are less unsightly. I am sitting in front of the new railway station, all 1960-ish modern with square windows, escalators, free-form counters, a playground on the roof, probably a bowling alley in the basement. In order to construct this gleaming building all the old trees around the station were cut down, and here the station sits baking in dusty sunlight.\nNew Japan does not like trees. Its totem is the bulldozer. Whole stretches of park are razed, healthy trees ripped out like sound teeth by this voracious machine, and then, eventually, the whole is landscaped with grass that cannot grow without shade and with bushes that wither in the eternal glare.\nI squint into the sun and watch the people as I wait for the bus that will take me to the port of Shikama. It is morning and the people are mainly farm women who have carried their produce into town and are now resting, squinting, wiping the dust from their faces. They wear traditional farm-woman garb—padded trousers, straw sandals, their bundles caught in great squares of cloth. So dressed their mothers and their mothers’ mothers. Yet, as I watch, one of the younger suddenly draws from her pouchlike front pocket a shiny compact from which she powders her face. Back to the farm? On to the cabaret? Either seems likely.\nI look around. There are still local faces in Japan. It has been only a century since the opening of the country, only decades since people began to move freely from region to region. Before this, for hundreds of years, people lived where they were born. High mountains, a lack of roads, a martinet government kept people in their place. Even now one sees a kind of eyebrow, a cast of nose, that is sure Ibaragi, certain Kyoto.\nJapan continues to give this unexampled view of history. It also offers the excitement of watching change. Old and new in these small provincial cities continue to exist side by side, and the new is often built directly beside, rather than directly on top of. One may, for a time, compare; for a space, see history in the gap. Very attractive to a heritage-starved, history-parched American.\nI stand up. My bus is coming.\nI look eagerly for the sea. On the trip from Kobe to Himeji I saw little enough of it. A glimpse of its eastern reaches, as yet islandless, on the other side of factory chimneys, fertilizer plants, salt works, and the belching fogs of heavy industry. Now the bus trip to the harbor gives no indication that the sea is anywhere near. The port is like a deserted lot, piled with rusting refuse, boilers, wrecked autos. All of this, I tell myself, is typical of the mainland whose dust I am about to shake from my feet, as I spend the next days and weeks touring the Inland Sea. I lean forward, impatient for the horizon.\nThe islands of this sea will be my steppingstones, out, far away from the smoking land, onto the formless water. I will continue into history, island after island, far to the west, far to the south.\nThe ferryboat shudders, whistles blow, people shout. A magical moment. One is sea-borne. The distant city grows dim. A sudden sun-struck ground mist spreads out from the land but cannot catch us. The open sea is ahead and from somewhere above comes the cry of a sea bird—a long, lonely, piercing cry, different far from the chirrupings of land. And then, as though in answer, a sailor in some corner of the ship, already hard at work, begins a song—a folk song, perhaps, from the islands that I shall visit.\nI turn toward the sea. I don’t care if I never come back.",

His wife had gone raving mad—murdering mad. They were leisurely enough for the first paralysing effect of this discovery to pass away before a resolute determination to come out victorious from the ghastly struggle with that armed lunatic. They were leisurely enough for Mr Verloc to elaborate a plan of defence involving a dash behind the table, and the felling of the woman to the ground with a heavy wooden chair. But they were not leisurely enough to allow Mr Verloc the time to move either hand or foot. The knife was already planted in his breast. It met no resistance on its way. Hazard has such accuracies. Into that plunging blow, delivered over the side of the couch, Mrs Verloc had put all the inheritance of her immemorial and obscure descent, the simple ferocity of the age of caverns, and the unbalanced nervous fury of the age of bar-rooms. Mr Verloc, the Secret Agent, turning slightly on his side with the force of the blow, expired without stirring a limb, in the muttered sound of the word “Don’t” by way of protest.",

In Costa Rica, we explore countless dirt roads, always with our windows wide open to the warm air and jungle noises outside. Lilly loves reaching out to touch the endless green curtain of leaves around us, and we marvel at the sound of vines scratching on our walls and roof as we squeeze through a narrow track in the dense jungle. Whenever a low branch hits the windshield in front of us, we both instinctively duck and then laugh at our silly reaction. This full-immersion driving experience is a far cry from driving on a paved highway, and I love it.",

In a book filled with horrors, the worst moment of all is Fisk’s description of a visit to a maternity hospital shortly after this phosphorus bombardment had taken place. There he met a nurse. After the bombardment had ended she had had to put several burning babies into a big bucket of water in order to put out the flames. When she took them out half an hour later, they were still burning. Even in the freezing cold of the mortuary they smouldered. The following morning the doctor took the tiny corpses out of the mortuary for burial. To her horror, they again burst into flames. I shuddered at the memory of this, but Samira was still continuing with her story.",

As for Mrs. Spragg, her son-in-law could not remember having had a sustained conversation with her since the distant day when he had first called at the Stentorian, and had been “entertained,” in Undine’s absence, by her astonished mother. The shock of that encounter had moved Mrs. Spragg to eloquence; but Ralph’s entrance into the family, without making him seem less of a stranger, appeared once for all to have relieved her of the obligation of finding something to say to him.",

Not yet in view, the nine fall silent in the sudden way that birds are stilled by the shadow of a hawk, or tree frogs cease their shrilling, leaving a ringing silence in the silence. Then, one by one, the nine figures round the point of rock in silhouette, unreal beneath big bulky loads that threaten each second to bump the cliff and nudge them over the precipice. On they come, staring straight ahead, as steadily and certainly as ants, yet seeming to glide with an easy, ethereal lightness, as if some sort of inner concentration was lifting them just off the surface of the ground. Bent far forward against the tump lines around their foreheads, fingers wide spread by way of balance, they touch the cliff face lightly to the left side, strike the north wind to the right. Light fingertips touch my upper leg, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine hands, but the intensity is such that they seem not to distinguish between cold rock face and warm blue jeans. Mute, unknowing, dull eyes glazed, the figures brush past one by one in their wool boots and sashed tunics, leaving behind in the clear air the smell of grease and fires. When the bad stretch is past, the hooting instantly resumes, perhaps at the point where they left off, as if all had awakened from a trance.",

Everyone we’d encountered spoke fondly of him. He had pushed for equality between rich and poor, across caste and religion lines, and devoted himself to making a better India, and I could see his legend radiating brightly through people’s facial expressions as they offered any memory or story passed down the line.

    "target_paragraph": "They will come to thee on foot and (mounted) on every kind of camel, lean on account of journeys through deep and distant mountain highways… (Quran 22:27)\nSherief led our trio steadily into the surging eddies of belief. We hurried. We wanted to reach the Masjid al-Haram by Isha, the nighttime prayer.\nWe spilled into a curved plaza, joining a crowd of a hundred thousand. We had reached the edges of the Masjid al-Haram. Crests of humanity dissolved into surf, rolling first to the marble forecourt that surrounded the mosque and then, in the far distance, surging into it through innumerable gateways like a gaining tide. Dusk was falling, above the sky was clear, the heat of the day was finally dissipating and a gentle breeze tugged at the edges of my scarf. Randa and Sherief pressed forward, pulling me out of my stupefaction. As we crossed a final road cleared of traffic which separated us from the marble forecourt of the immense oval al-Haram Mosque at the center of Hajj, the Azan rang out. All motion began to slow. We had to answer the call of prayer.\nAt once Randa turned. “Let's pray here,” she said and stopped exactly where we were standing. She stood next to Sherief, shoulder to shoulder, and I stood next to Randa. We removed our shoes, placing them in plastic bags we were carrying, and set them between us. I looked at my feet. We were immediately adjacent to the curb of the road. We would be praying on tarmac, yet the ground was clean, not even a single wrapper or piece of litter. We began symbolically patting the dusty ground around us and went through the motions of our ablutions, using dust in place of water, allowed precisely for the traveling Muslim who cannot reach water before prayer.\nAround us the mass of a hundred thousand had silently arranged itself identically. Where once a tumultuous crowd had surged, a peaceful, patient congregation now gathered, perfectly aligned in every direction. To my right and left, ahead of me, behind me, I found I had become part of a massive circular crowd, every pilgrim abreast of another, the sides of our feet touching, planted a little astride. Like a magic organism forming out of ether, the Hajj crowds had become a parish. After prayer, we would again dissolve into the Hajj ocean, leaving no trace of an assembly.\nTo the rhythms of familiar prayer, we bowed our heads, kneeled, and finally prostrated in unison. The holy ground radiated warmth, pulsing with absorbed heat. Something lived here. Mid-prostration my veiled head grazed against the inches-high concrete curb. A smell of carbon, petroleum, and heated dust rose into my nostrils, yet I remained unsoiled. Completing both rakats (each rakat consists of two prostrations in Islamic prayer) of the prescribed pilgrims' abbreviated prayer, I expected to leave, but the invisible Muezzin called onward. There seemed to be more prayers due. These were unfamiliar, and the particular choreography not in my repertoire. I constantly muddled the correct order, exposing myself as a novice Muslim. I struggled to copy the veteran worshippers around me. As the prayers ended and the rows began their magic dissolution, I turned to Randa, “What were those final prayers? I did them all wrong.”",

The rocks were round, mostly, but the shorebreak borderland you had to cross to enter the water was simply too wide, particularly when the surf was big. Even after timing it carefully, waiting for a lull, letting a shorebreak wave expend itself, then running recklessly with your board over wet boulders, you sometimes didn’t make it to water deep enough to paddle on before the next wave slammed you, banging you backward across the rocks—board, body, dignity all battered, sometimes severely. This was not a normal ocean problem. It felt like bad arithmetic—the time and distance did not, for some Madeira-only reason, compute. I had never seen a surf spot with an entrance so daunting. And the exit, getting back onto dry land, could be even worse. The wave we were there to ride was at most only thirty yards offshore, but I sometimes resorted to a very long paddle, around a seawall at the far east end of the village, rather than face that shorebreak.",

Two thousand Tibetans armed with matchlock guns, swords and spears faced a smaller British force carrying cannon and Maxim guns.

When the guns stopped chattering, twelve British had been wounded, and 628 Tibetans killed. By the time Younghusband reached Lhasa, a further 2,000 Tibetans had died, compared to forty British soldiers.",

None of us paid much attention to the fact that Ang Dorje and Ngawang Norbu, another Sherpa on Hall’s team, were sitting beside us sharing a thermos of tea and seemed to be in no hurry to go higher. Around 11:40, Beidleman eventually asked, “Hey, Ang Dorje, are you going to fix the ropes, or what?” Ang Dorje’s reply was a quick, unequivocal “No”—perhaps because none of Fischer’s Sherpas were there to share the work.",

Three hide-covered huts stood clustered in the distance. Kataktovik was now very tentative, bringing the dogs to a halt. Bartlett told him to stay there, and he would approach first. When Bartlett came within ten yards of the people, he put out his hand and greeted them in English with a big smile. “How do you do?” he said. After a short pause, more people came forward. They were friendly, and Bartlett waved for Kataktovik to follow on. “They immediately rushed towards us and grasped us warmly by the hand, jabbering away in great excitement.” Neither Bartlett nor Kataktovik could understand their language, but through their actions, they welcomed the weary travelers. They unharnessed the ragged dogs and fed them, pulling the sled around to the outside of their small wooden house and lifting it up onto a scaffold and under an awning, where it would be out of the dogs’ reach and protected from the weather.",

He was very uncomfortable downstairs, and, as he did not know what was going on, constantly in the way; but he would not leave the drawing-room. Too restless to read, and having nothing to do, he began to pace up and down reciting poetry in an undertone. Occupied in various ways—now in undoing parcels, now in uncorking bottles, now in writing directions, the sound of Ridley’s song and the beat of his pacing worked into the minds of Terence and St John all the morning as a half-comprehended refrain.",

    "target_paragraph": "Of the many alcoholic drinks made from the bergamot including a grappa infused with the flavor, a bitter and a digestivo (after dinner drink to help with digestion), my favorite is the crema di bergamotto (bergamot cream), as the fruit’s subtle character blends well with the velvety-textured liquor. A tasty soda is also being marketed in Calabria where residents have long appreciated the very refreshing bergamot gelato, a treat that has crossed international borders. As the pope’s chefs experimented half a millennium ago, contemporary culinary innovators continue to create new gastronomic combinations, such as grated zest to flavor pasta, extra virgin olive oil infused with the essential oil or a few drops of juice to lighten the spicy Calabrian ‘nduja salami or to assuage the intensity of an anchovy dish.",
