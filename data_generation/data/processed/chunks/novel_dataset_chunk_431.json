    "target_paragraph": "In some contexts, this moralized debauchery might sound hypocritical, reminiscent of the Saturday-night libertines and Sunday-morning churchgoers of a Tammy Wynette song. But hypocrisy implies a real discrepancy between public and private selves, and in India, where all opposites are flung together into the same helter-skelter confusion and dichotomies are, if not united, at least entertained simultaneously, the term seemed hardly to apply. Besides, the movies were only providing a bigger, bolder, more colorful and immediate version of the very mix of gin and tonic that pervaded the society as a whole. In one railway bookstore, I saw The Life of Mahatma Gandhi next to Jackie Collins’s Hollywood Wives; the most popular English novels, I found, were still those of Ayn Rand, mistress of self-important philosophizing, and those of Harold Robbins, master of wish-fulfillment smut. Along the streets of the cities, those billboards that did not lay bare the fleshly torsos of the movie gods and goddesses were likely to offer maxims: “Lane Driving Is Sane Driving,” “Small Family Is Happy Family,” “Don’t Play with Fire / The Consequences Are Dire” and—my favorite—“Let Us Solicit the Serenity of Silence (Blow Horn If You Must).”",

On reaching the valley floor the track crossed the nullah and was visible running level along the base of the opposite mountains before curving away out of sight halfway down the valley.

Waiting was a skill that Cubans mastered no matter where they lived or what they were doing. At first, Cary and Pipo thought of riding out the storm where they often did, in Oscar’s bedroom. Their house was big and solid—a prerevolution midcentury modern that had been split into two apartments; their upstairs neighbors had even built a clandestine metalworking shop on the roof. But the coming storm threatened to be so bad they might be stuck inside for a long time. Oscar’s room was the smallest in the house, and there was nothing but louvers in the windows to keep out the wind and rain. There wasn’t enough room for them in the kitchen or storeroom, and the parlor, facing the street, was far too exposed. That left their own bedroom, with its lone window facing south, away from Irma.",

The carriage was waiting; and the Archbishop, back in cardinal’s robes and the wide ermine mantle that showed he was a temporal as well as an ecclesiastical Prince, climbed slowly in. His gentleman-at-arms, helped by a chaplain with a prominent Adam’s apple and pince-nez and a postillion in hussar’s uniform, were gathering in his train, yard upon yard, like fishermen with a net, until it filled the carriage with geranium-coloured watered-silk. The chaplain climbed in and sat opposite, then the gentleman-at-arms, sitting upright with black-gloved hands on the hilt of his scimitar. The postillion folded the steps, a small busbied tiger slammed a door painted with arms under a tasselled hat and when both of them had leaped up behind, the similarly fur-hatted coachman gave a twitch to the reins, the ostrich feathers nodded and the four greys moved off. As the equipage swayed down the hill, applause rippled through the gathered crowd, all hats came off and a hand at the window, pastorally ringed over its red glove, fluttered in blessing.",

As I walk around the heritage buildings with Jean Wee, responsible for preserving the best of Singapore’s past, she points out, “We try to find new uses for old buildings.” But when we pass a glassy new cube in what is otherwise a beautifully restored old colonial classic, she surprises me by saying, “We should not try to mimic the old.

There is a handy Leprosarium; Africa apparently swarms with these wretched people. At 9.30 a.m.—which is late in the morning—we arrived at the leper colony. We turned off the main dust road on to a dust track and after a few minutes were in a small clearing in the bush. Around a central dust square, the lepers have their houses, square mud shacks with thatched roofs, crumbling. I think there were twenty such huts in all, though I went into a state of shock at the beginning and failed to see well throughout. We had missed the Mayor and other notables (who can they have been?) who made speeches in honour of the day; no one was left except the resident lepers and their visiting families. Apart from small children, everyone was drunk, cheerful to roaring.",

I did not understand how the Niva was maintaining traction on ice that looked sheer. But when I got out to examine the roadway, I saw that it had a more granular surface than I’d thought, and in its heavily traveled sections the tires had roughed it up, so I couldn’t slide on it if I tried. Just a short distance from the roadway on either side, the ice was pristine. Several times when we stopped, I lay face-first on it and looked down. Within the ice I could see planes like in a cracked cube of crystal extending for six feet or more, and milky white fracture lines, and bubbles the size of baseballs or peas, and somewhere deep below, the blue darkness of unfrozen water.",

The corporations, said the article, take these games very seriously: they sign up the finest amateur players in the country and subject them to eighty games a season and eleven months a year of practice. This year, the finals of the competition were to be held before a sellout crowd at Korakuen Stadium on August 2, only four days after my arrival.

    "target_paragraph": "He left Lily to a passion of disgust and fear. It seemed incredible that Gus Trenor should have spoken of her to Rosedale. With all his faults, Trenor had the safeguard of his traditions, and was the less likely to overstep them because they were so purely instinctive. But Lily recalled with a pang that there were convivial moments when, as Judy had confided to her, Gus ‘talked foolishly’: in one of these, no doubt, the fatal word had slipped from him. As for Rosedale, she did not, after the first shock, greatly care what conclusions he had drawn. Though usually adroit enough where her own interests were concerned, she made the mistake, not uncommon to persons in whom the social habits are instinctive, of supposing that the inability to acquire them quickly implies a general dulness. Because a bluebottle bangs irrationally against a window-pane, the drawing-room naturalist may forget that under less artificial conditions it is capable of measuring distances and drawing conclusions with all the accuracy needful to its welfare; and the fact that Mr Rosedale’s drawing-room manner lacked perspective made Lily class him with Trenor and the other dull men she knew, and assume that a little flattery, and the occasional acceptance of his hospitality, would suffice to render him innocuous. However, there could be no doubt of the expediency of showing herself in his box on the opening night of the opera; and after all, since Judy Trenor had promised to take him up that winter, it was as well to reap the advantage of being first in the field.",

    "target_paragraph": "Kampala could grow on one. Visually it has little to recommend it, apart from views of the surrounding countryside, but the feeling is of a friendly provincial town rather than a bustling capital. In March 1992 the shops were not much better stocked than Rumania’s in January 1990 and the traffic, being light by urban standards, had speeding-space enough to threaten life at every pedestrian crossing. Many of the street names bespeak a residual affection for the British: Queen Mary’s Gardens, Burton Street, Philip Road, Wilson Road, William Street, Windsor Crescent. Neighbouring streets pay homage to African heroes: Said Barre Avenue, Nkrumah Road, Nasser Road, Lumumba Road. The rich district, Nakasero Hill, boasts substantial residences lining wide, amply shaded streets. On the hilltop swaggers a Sheraton Hotel, its sweeping lawns patrolled by security guards to keep the poor at bay. These askari looked at me uneasily when I encroached on the territory of the privileged, desperately searching for a bookshop; but most Ugandans give Whites the benefit of the doubt. There was no bookshop, only a few shelves of fat and unreadable paperback novels. Later, while seeking a battery for Lear’s lamp, I came on a small pile of second-hand books in an electrician’s duka and – almost swooning with relief – bought a stout volume (The State and Agriculture in Africa) for 50 pence. Not as relaxing as Nancy Mitford but a considerable improvement on Jeffrey Archer.",

A bus driver for thirty years, Pacho was working for Rápido Ochoa on the Medellín-to-Maicao run when he and his bus were caught in an ambush, a cross fire that left one of his passengers dead. Uncertain what to do with the corpse, and with no funerary services nearby, he improvised a coffin, borrowed a car, and returned immediately to Medellín, driving twenty-three hours without stopping for food or water. When he delivered the body to the victim’s mother, he felt a tremendous sense of pride and relief, overwhelmed that such a simple deed could mean so much to a family. After that, he felt only warm affection for the dead, and pity for their suffering families.",

I feel moments of utmost contentment, knowing that I accomplished something mind-boggling, whereas other moments I gaze out the window, wondering if I merely dreamt it. In still other moments, the absence of focus, miles, and freedom to walk sends me spiraling into despair, and I grieve. Life feels empty when the trail is over, even when it’s full. The memories are like those of a loved one who is gone forever—with a churning in my stomach and an ache in my soul mixed with bittersweet joy. Having loved and lost—having hiked and come home—is better than never having hiked at all. Only time, and perhaps another journey, can mend the wound, though I know I’ll be scarred forever. I say, “Never again,” over and over, but it is a lie, a lie I tell myself when the grief overwhelms me. In the end, my memories of the trail are what make me feel whole. Despite the scars, loss, and depression, I know I will seek it again. For the joy, beauty, focus, drive, depletion, pain, and chance to achieve the impossible are simply too alluring. Just as I cannot hike forever, neither can I walk away for good.",

The park up there was known as Lands End, and the hills looked west into the ocean and north into the Golden Gate. Cypress, eucalyptus, and tall, gnarled Monterey pines helped break the cold sea breeze. There was an old public golf course, never busy, up there too. Somebody gave me three or four rusty clubs—I could carry them all in one fist—and I started playing, for laughs, during our walks, the few holes near our place. I knew nothing about golf, and we never saw the clubhouse, but I liked whacking the ball off the deep-shadowed tees, down the lush fairways, while the low sun made the hills glow before it fell into the Pacific. Caroline wore baggy sweaters and long, beribboned skirts that she sewed herself. She had enormous eyes and a laugh that pealed thrillingly in the twilight.",

The city’s older, more elegant part is walkable, with buildings of painted stucco and ornamental brick and a different aspect of the port at the foot of every hill. At one dock we saw a freighter being unloaded of those used Japanese cars that the cross-country drivers would speed back to more western parts of Russia for resale. Blackened ruts of ice ran down the middle of many streets and the sidewalks were all hard-polished snow. So many high heels had walked on this snow that it was riddled by the small round holes the heels had punched; it looked like a ceiling of acoustical tile. At a short distance from the city’s central part, the trash-strewn places began. Next to heaped-up trash bags that had been slashed open by beaks, all-black crows and ravens flipped through refuse scraps and croaked their raspy cries. Meanwhile the usual Russian Miss Universes, some in really unseasonal outfits, went step-stepping along.",

Carlos Lehder founded the National Latino Movement, a Columbian political party which maintained three congressional seats. The political party’s main purpose was to oppose extradition. It wasn’t until April 30, 1984 with the assassination of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, the Colombian Minister of Justice that all his friends began to bail. The President of Panama, Manuel Noriega, tried to strike a deal with the US government for amnesty by informing on Carlos. After many fruitful years of cordial business dealings, the Bahamian Government then turned on Carlos and indicted him for bribing Bahamian officials. The whole enterprise unraveled and Carlos became a ward of the US prison system. Carlos was out of the drug business. He had his sentence reduced to 55 years for testifying against Manuel Noriega who was promptly convicted in a US court. The listening post was stripped to the foundation. American Air Force attack helicopters were sent to Norman’s Cay to strafe and redecorate Carlos’s palatial estate with air to surface missiles.",

The next day, we spent an enjoyable afternoon wandering the crumbling French colonial streets, with gingerbread houses and rusting, New Orleans style balconies, and exploring the chaotic Marche de Fer, or Iron Market, which sells everything from toiletries to voodoo paraphernalia. In a square near the city's Notre Dame cathedral, we spotted the Americans sat outside a bar, swigging bottles of Prestige Beer, surrounded by a bevy of giggling, plump 'bouzens.' I noticed the plastic sandals had been replaced by hideous white Nike's.",

None of my questions about my ability would be answered if I didn’t. Each day I awoke at 4 a.m. and moved until my legs wobbled and my eyes could barely focus on the trail tread. Eventually collapse would become inevitable—that was when I would allow myself to stop. I knew that if I focused on reaching that point daily I would have done my best. There was simply nothing more I could do. My absolute best every single day would give me my absolute best result. Regardless of whether it was a record or not, it would be what I could do.

Twenty years ago the Ponte Vecchio was home to silversmiths and artisan jewellers and it was quiet enough, even in August, to take a picture of a friend (or in my case a picture of Stephen Katz) sitting on the bridge rail. Now it’s like the stowage deck of the Lusitania just after somebody’s said, ‘Say, is that a torpedo?’ It was covered with Senegalese immigrants selling semi-crappy items of jewellery and replica Louis Vuitton luggage spread out on blankets or pieces of black velvet. And the crowds of tourists pushing among them were unbelievable. It took me half an hour to bull my way through, and I didn’t try again for the rest of the week. Far easier, I concluded, to make a quarter-mile detour to the Ponte di Santa Trinita, the next bridge downriver, and cross from there.",

And then out in the tropics, riding the bowsprit, the sails slack and the white bow wave cutting the dark sea; or up aloft on a pitching yard-arm, with green water smashing over the deck, dragging in canvas that was wet through or frozen stiff; or waking one night in a norther off Valparaíso, the ship on her beam ends and his friend saying: ‘Go to sleep, Ugly, you little fool, and you won’t feel the drowning’, and then thirty-six hours on the pumps and the cheers of the men as the pumps sucked dry.",

I went by road, in the company of a young IAS officer, encountered on the train to Kalka. He spoke sadly of the decay of the town since 1947. To him, as to all Indians, the myth was real. The glory of Simla was part of the Indian inheritance, which was being squandered: there were now pan-shops in the town. While we talked rustles came from the back of the van from the officer’s pet weaver-birds. They were in a large covered cage, and when the rustles appeared to be reaching a pitch of frenzy the officer clucked and cooed and spoke soothingly to the cage. From time to time we had a glimpse of the toy train going into or coming out of a toy tunnel. It was mid-January, the air frosty, but the shirtsleeved passengers leaned passively out of open windows as though, this being India, it was always summer.",

A kindly growth, lover of men, their dwellings and ordered ways. That is why we foster it. We are all utilitarians here, Mr. Denis; we think of the main purposes of life. Besides food, it gives us welcome shade at this season; the leaves fall off in winter and allow the sunlight to percolate into our rooms. You will not find evergreen trees planted near our windows. We know the value of sunshine; where the sun enters, we say, the physician does not enter. In England the light is feebler and yet they made this mistake, during the Georgian period of architecture. They thought that houses were invented to be looked at, not to be lived in. Determined to be faithful to the tradition and regardless of the difference in climate, they planted the ilex about those mansions which must be dank and gloomy in wintertime, however charming, externally, to those who relish the chill Palladian outlines. You have lately been to Florence, I hear? Come! Let us sit indoors. The courtyard is rather too sultry to-day, in spite of the shade. My old servant will bring some tea, presently. Or perhaps you would prefer some wine and a biscuit? Or a glass of liqueur?… Well? And Florence?\"",
