However, this time Dopey acted oddly “out of it.” He became totally confused by ordinary experiences, like reading our paperwork or building the set. One memorable day on the Fort Worth yard Dopey’s moves looked particularly unnatural. He displayed an exaggerated cautiousness in his actions. Resembling a man whose next step might cause him to fall from the ledge of a high building, Dopey walked in a decidedly wooden manner. On the terminal yard that day Dopey forgot to set the parking brake upon exiting the truck cab, causing the rig to roll unattended with other trucks, trailers and worse, other drivers, nearby. As we both stood outside the truck, tons of weight rolled across the pavement, unchecked. Fortunately, Dopey climbed back up into the truck, jerking on the parking brake and jolting the rig to a stop before it hit anything or anyone.",

Examining the stem, he discovered that the ice had shorn off two of the brass stem plates completely and loosened the bolts of others. All needed repair before they moved again, and he set the engineers to the task. He told the rest of the crew, whoever wasn’t assigned to specific work detail, “Eat when you feel like it and sleep when you feel like it, for you never know how soon you will have neither.”",

My appetite and imagination failed as I walked from one airless little shop to another, collecting tins of soup and cornbeef and vegetables, crackers, cheese, tea, condensed milk, cereal. Lack of foresight must be the foundation of African contentment and though Joshua wasn’t by any means a happy-go-lucky gather-ye-rosebuds-while-ye-may type, he couldn’t think four days ahead.

The province was roughly hourglass-shaped and just a few miles across in places, so the journey amounted to a brief sightseeing tour of its attractions. Compared to the rest of the Netherlands the landscape was strikingly varied, with not only the usual flat farmland but also thick patches of forest and countless small hills swelling from between the loops of the river Maas. In the distance I could see what looked like vineyards and grand country houses. I recalled something a Dutch friend had told me in astonished tones when she heard I was visiting the hilly south: ‘In Limburg, the bicycles have three gears!’",

Here, gazing across the radiant harbour-bar towards the Caramanian moun­tains, we sat ourselves down in solitude and space like a couple of emperors while a bewildering succession of cold beers found their way out on to the table-cloth, backed up by various sau­cers full of delicious Cypriot comestibles. And here Sabri’s wind punctually arrived – the faintest breath of coolness, stirring across the waters of the harbour, ruffling them. ‘You see?’ he said quietly, raising his cheek to it like a sail. He was obviously endowed with that wonderful Moslem quality which is called kayf – the contemplation which comes of silence and ease. It is not meditation or reverie, which presupposes a conscious mind relaxing: it is something deeper, a fathomless repose of the will which does not even pose to itself the question: ‘Am I happy or unhappy?’",

He saw her against a background of pale grottos and sleek hides; camels slanted their heavy-lidded eyes at her, giraffes fastidiously observed her from their melancholy eminence, and the pink-lined trunks of elephants cautiously abstracted buns from her outstretched hands. Then there were the hothouses. He saw her bending over pythons coiled upon the sand, or considering the brown rock breaking the stagnant water of the alligators’ pool, or searching some minute section of tropical forest for the golden eye of a lizard or the indrawn movement of the green frogs’ flanks. In particular, he saw her outlined against the deep green waters, in which squadrons of silvery fish wheeled incessantly, or ogled her for a moment, pressing their distorted mouths against the glass, quivering their tails straight out behind them. Again, there was the insect house, where she lifted the blinds of the little cages, and marvelled at the purple circles marked upon the rich tussore wings of some lately emerged and semi-conscious butterfly, or at caterpillars immobile like the knobbed twigs of a pale-skinned tree, or at slim green snakes stabbing the glass wall again and again with their flickering cleft tongues. The heat of the air, and the bloom of heavy flowers, which swam in water or rose stiffly from great red jars, together with the display of curious patterns and fantastic shapes, produced an atmosphere in which human beings tended to look pale and to fall silent.",

When Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka, U.S. Army, was sent to look over the area in 1883, he was instructed to determine, roughly, where the Yukon came into Alaska. Rafting hundreds of miles through Canadian mountains down the giant bending river, he noted shifts in its direction, guessed distances, guessed current velocities, ran the data through his mind, and what is now named Eagle Bluff he called Boundary Butte. It was some guess—like a sailor’s fixing his position by the feel of it—for the hundred-and-forty-first (boundary) meridian was scarcely twelve miles upstream, and, by air line, six miles away. William Ogilvie, sent by Ottawa, surveyed the border four years later. Eagle, Alaska, looking east from a bend in the river, has all before it a sweep of boundary ridgelines, and behind them rise the Ogilvie Mountains, Yukon Territory. The international boundary is now absurdly shaved. Trees are levelled and brush kept cut in a thirty-foot swath.",

I stopped about twenty yards from the spot where I had been lying and destroyed the last of the creatures that still clung to me. My body was like a sieve, drops of blood seeping through the pores of every patch of bare skin. The tree I had been lying under was a horrifying sight, and the reddish-brown termites were eating into all my belongings. I took a few steps closer to them, stopped to get my nerve up, ran into their midst, threw my pack as far as I could, and dashed away. The pack already had quite a few holes in it. I shook it off and killed the termites that clung to it, repeating the motion a few times. I ran back and pitched from among the swarming insects one shoe, and then the other, followed by the sacks of food, the nets, poncho, and my walking stick. I heaved it all as far as I could from the terrifying circle of bugs.",

The first thing he did after kissing me hello was remove the backpack from my shoulders and slip it onto his own. Initially, this worried me (Is he going to run off with it?); then it angered me (I can carry my own damn bag!); but eventually, admittedly, it pleased me (It’s nice not having backaches). He also ripped off his jacket whenever mine didn’t appear warm enough and wrapped it around my shoulders. Painted me landscapes with watercolors. Read me excerpts from his family’s extensive library. Took me down to Red Square to hear the Kremlin bells strike midnight. Called me his golubka (little pigeon), his lapachka (cat’s paw), his dusha moya (soul). Mario used to treat me to sumptuous five-course meals, but that didn’t mean nearly as much as when Andrei brought me half his supper in a Tupperware dish that his cat had chewed on.",

Some newspaper placard went up in the air, gallantly, like a kite at first, then paused, swooped, fluttered; and a lady’s veil hung. Yellow awnings trembled. The speed of the morning traffic slackened, and single carts rattled carelessly down half-empty streets. In Norfolk, of which Richard Dalloway was half thinking, a soft warm wind blew back the petals; confused the waters; ruffled the flowering grasses. Haymakers, who had pitched beneath hedges to sleep away the morning toil, parted curtains of green blades; moved trembling globes of cow parsley to see the sky; the blue, the steadfast, the blazing summer sky.",

On the gray moisture of the grass were marks where the cows had lain through the night – dark-green islands of dry herbage the size of their carcases, in the general sea of dew. From each island proceeded a serpentine trail, by which the cow had rambled away to feed after getting up, at the end of which trail they found her; the snoring breath from her nostrils, when she recognized them, making an intenser little fog of her own amid the prevailing one. Then they drove the animals back to the barton, or sat down to milk them on the spot, as the case might require.",

He would go home. He would get away as soon as ever it could be managed without Alice knowing. Duplicity? Very well. Conduct unbecoming in a clergyman? So be it. Nothing but duplicity and unbecoming conduct would get him out of this, James felt, and accordingly they would have to be gone in for wholeheartedly. For what excuse could he make that she wouldn’t instantly brush aside, if he began trying to make excuses? And what use would it be to say straight out he wanted to go home, seeing that she would then go home with him? It was essential that he should see his neighbour, at least the first time, without the feeling that Alice was just round the corner, and might appear any moment. He must, he must see his neighbour alone. He had kept her out of his mind because of having to make amends to Alice for what he had done, and he knew that only by not thinking of Jennifer could he properly attend to Alice; but now that he suspected the hand beneath the bandage was as well as it had ever been, and that the headaches and low spirits were all put on, he flung the doors of his heart wide open, and Jennifer—had she not told him her sweet name was Jennifer?—came flooding back into it like light, like warmth, like a man’s hope of heaven.",

    "target_paragraph": "We get back into the boats, shove off, and begin the run down the Kobuk. Paddling on a big lake is much the same. You fix your eye on a point two miles away and watch it until it puts you to sleep. The river bottom, nearly as distinct as the Salmon’s, is no less absorbing. It is gravelled, and lightly covered with silt. In shallow places, salmon leave trails in the silt, like lines made by fingers in dust. Eskimos know that one school of salmon will follow the trails of another. In shallow bends of the river, fishing camps are set up beside the trails. “We must have fish to live,” the people say; and they use every part of the salmon. They eat the eggs with bearberries. They roast, smoke, fry, boil, or dry the flesh. They bury the heads in leaf-lined pits and leave them for weeks. The result is a delicacy reminiscent of cheese. Fevers and colds are sometimes treated by placing fermented salmon on the skin of the neck and nose. A family might use as many as a thousand salmon a year. To feed dogs, many salmon are needed. Dogs eat whole fish, and they clean up the fins, intestines, and bones of the fish eaten by people. Dog teams have largely been replaced by snowmobiles (or snow machines, as they are almost universally called in Alaska), and, as a result, the salmon harvest at first declined. Snow machines, however—for all their breathtaking ability to go as fast as fifty miles an hour over roadless terrain—break down now and again, and are thus perilous. A stranded traveller cannot eat a snow machine. Dog teams in the region are increasing in number, and the take of salmon is growing as well.",

Mr. and Mrs. Spragg seldom spoke to each other when they met, and words of greeting seemed almost unknown to their domestic vocabulary. Marvell, at first, had fancied that his own warmth would call forth a response from his wife, who had been so quick to learn the forms of worldly intercourse; but he soon saw that she regarded intimacy as a pretext for escaping from such forms into a total absence of expression.",

Shrubs, trees, and all signs are blown down. There is a very high risk of injury or death to people’. We were in for it. There was no where to run. We would make our stand on our boat in Clarkes Court Bay Marina. Ivan would come calling at 2:30 that afternoon. There wasn’t a minute to lose. We had 48 hours of work to do in eight hours. We raced into town in the 4X4 to fuel up and buy any supplies that would be left on the shelves of the stores. When we reached Saint George I pulled into the first gas station. I expected the pumps to be out of fuel. Since there were no customers, I went into the office and asked if they were already out of fuel.

It’s hardly Hyde Park. Under a sky that’s a white-hot sweltering soup of pollution we join middle-aged men in shorts pulled high over round paunches as they stride and clap their hands to applaud their own efforts. Young men play cricket to an audience of cows, and old men leg-squat, star-jump and gather to comment on the weather or to congratulate each other on being Indian.

    "target_paragraph": "Thus they sat depressed to silence at the dining-room table, oblivious of everything, while Rodney paced the drawing-room overhead in such agitation and exaltation of mind as he had never conceived possible, and Cassandra remained alone with her uncle. Ralph, at length, rose and walked gloomily to the window. He pressed close to the pane. Outside were truth and freedom and the immensity only to be apprehended by the mind in loneliness, and never communicated to another. What worse sacrilege was there than to attempt to violate what he perceived by seeking to impart it? Some movement behind him made him reflect that Katharine had the power, if she chose, to be in person what he dreamed of her spirit. He turned sharply to implore her help, when again he was struck cold by her look of distance, her expression of intentness upon some far object. As if conscious of his look upon her she rose and came to him, standing close by his side, and looking with him out into the dusky atmosphere. Their physical closeness was to him a bitter enough comment upon the distance between their minds. Yet distant as she was, her presence by his side transformed the world. He saw himself performing wonderful deeds of courage; saving the drowning, rescuing the forlorn. Impatient with this form of egotism, he could not shake off the conviction that somehow life was wonderful, romantic, a master worth serving so long as she stood there. He had no wish that she should speak; he did not look at her or touch her; she was apparently deep in her own thoughts and oblivious of his presence.",

He thought of her, Popeye, the woman, the child, Goodwin, all put into a single chamber, bare, lethal, immediate and profound: a single blotting instant between the indignation and the surprise. And I too; thinking how that were the only solution. Removed, cauterised out of the old and tragic flank of the world. And I, too, now that we’re all isolated; thinking of a gentle dark wind blowing in the long corridors of sleep; of lying beneath a low cozy roof under the long sound of the rain: the evil, the injustice, the tears. In an alley-mouth two figures stood, face to face, not touching; the man speaking in a low tone unprintable epithet after epithet in a caressing whisper, the woman motionless before him as though in a musing swoon of voluptuous ecstasy. Perhaps it is upon the instant that we realise, admit, that there is a logical pattern to evil, that we die, he thought, thinking of the expression he had once seen in the eyes of a dead child, and of other dead: the cooling indignation, the shocked despair fading, leaving two empty globes in which the motionless world lurked profoundly in miniature.",

The mere act of going out from the monastic quiet of the shop into the tumult of the streets filled her with a subdued excitement which grew too intense for pleasure as she was swallowed by the engulfing roar of Broadway or Third Avenue, and began to do timid battle with their incessant cross-currents of humanity. After a glance or two into the great show windows she usually allowed herself to be swept back into the shelter of a side street, and finally regained her own roof in a state of breathless bewilderment and fatigue; but gradually, as her nerves were soothed by the familiar quiet of the little shop, and the click of Evelina’s pinking machine, certain sights and sounds would detach themselves from the torrent along which she had been swept, and she would devote the rest of the day to a mental reconstruction of the different episodes of her walk, till finally it took shape in her thought as a consecutive and highly-coloured experience, from which, for weeks afterwards, she would detach some fragmentary recollection in the course of her long dialogues with her sister.",

But when again Miriam turned to consult the old lady’s eyes she found in their depths a warmth that was not all pride in the satisfactory grandson, and the room’s deep peace returned as she exchanged with Mrs Peebles a shy, appreciative smile.\nWith everything on the table, and the tea by this time thoroughly infused, the old lady was feeling it was time for her to disappear. But before she went, moving soundlessly with her remote, sleep-walking air, she bent to give the tea-cosy a small, adjusting pat; a silent sign, a tribute to their meeting.\nJust having stood there, without any manner for the old lady, remaining relaxed as if alone, rather than keyed up to sustain an invasion, had been enough. The moment she had come in with her laden tray and found one standing unarmed and available, though not even looking her way, Mrs Peebles had known the barriers were down.",

Black-robed monks with shaven heads and trainee monks in loose black jackets and trousers sauntered through the corridors and halls with little smirks on their scrubbed faces, ignoring the tourists who were being ushered about, shuffling and whispering; and as the rain still fell, the rustle of robes, the ring of curious fingers brushing a gong, the patter of slippered feet on the cold, smooth boards or the shush of silk tabi socks over soft straw matting – all rose and fell in volume like the gasps of air in a bamboo flute and left in their wake a greater silence than before.",
