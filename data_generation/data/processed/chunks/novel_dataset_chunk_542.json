It could also be applied to those ‘Coalition’ troops who invaded a sovereign state under false pretences in March 2003 to secure US control of Iraq’s oil. Personally I would like all homicidal combats to be regarded as ‘unlawful’. But that’s another debate for another generation – perhaps the Trio’s?",

As always with these things in America, it was well done and interesting. Photographs of Roosevelt at Warm Springs covered the walls and lots of his personal effects were on display in glass cases – his wheelchairs, crutches, leg-braces and other such implements. Some of these were surprisingly elaborate and exerted a morbid interest because F.D.R. was always careful not to let the public see him as the cripple he was. And here we were viewing him with his trousers off, so to speak. I was particularly taken with a room full of all the handmade gifts that had been given to him when he was President and then presumably stuck at the back of a very large cupboard. There were carved walking-sticks by the dozen and maps of America made of inlaid wood and portraits of F.D.R. scratched on walrus tusks and etched with acid into slate. The amazing thing was how well done they all were. Every one of them represented hundreds of hours of delicate carving and tireless polishing, and all to be given away to a stranger for whom it would be just one more item in a veritable cavalcade of personalized keepsakes. I became so absorbed in these items that I scarcely noticed when the old people barged in, a trifle breathless but none the less lively. A lady with a bluish tint to her hair pushed in front of me at one of the display cases. She gave me a brief look that said, ‘I am an old person. I can go where I want,’ and then she dismissed me from her mind. ‘Say, Hazel,’ she called in a loud voice, ‘did you know you shared a birthday with Eleanor Roosevelt?’",

Although there was one season we tried to reach Tehipite Valley by heading up the Middle Fork of the Kings River from Yucca Point, in Kings Canyon. That was a huge mistake. As we got up the canyon, the river became too treacherous to wade across and the banks steep and thick with thorny gooseberry. At one point your father nearly stepped off a fallen trunk onto a rattler. It’s the only trip we ever turned back on. By the time we’d scrambled out of that gorge, we’d both torn up our legs and our hiking pants, and each of us had a case of poison oak that lasted a week.”",

    "target_paragraph": "CHAPTER XXIII\nIndia, 2011\nAT SIX IN THE MORNING there’s a knock at my door. A man stands there with a tray of tea and biscuits. As I thank him, once more I can see my own breath. I hand him my hot-water bottle and ask if he could fill it for the morning safari. He nods as if he understands, and I scurry back inside, ready for a shower but the water is still ice-cold. I leave it on and wait but still nothing. Finally I take a cold rinse off, throw on a pair of jeans. I put on all the layers I have—a long-sleeve T-shirt, sweatshirt, and fleece vest, much of which I’ll peel off in the heat of the day, and head out to the open-air jeep that, apparently, tigers don’t jump inside. Or at least thus far they have not, though I can’t see what is to stop one.\nMy driver, Sudhir, is waiting for me. With his handlebar mustache, khaki fatigues, safari hat, and vest he looks as if he walked out of The Jungle Book. As I fling myself into the jeep, scratchy horsehair blankets are tossed over my legs. Then someone runs back into the inn and returns with my hot-water bottle, which is piping hot. I slip it onto my lap. I am coughing, hacking, sneezing, and trying to control it. And I am swallowing, one after the other, the Halls cherry cough drops that Dinesh bought for me on the road.\nIt can’t be much above freezing as we head out into the darkness before dawn. In the distance there is the first hint of sun, a sliver of light in the sky, but it is not enough to warm the air. We bounce on the furrowed dirt road for about half an hour until we come to what seems to be a small village, and there ahead of us in the predawn light I can see the gate that is the entrance to Pench. Near the gate dozens of men in green uniforms sit in folding chairs. These are the mandatory guides. Every jeep going into the reserve must have a driver and a professional guide. Here Sudhir pulls over. He bounces out of the jeep and tells me to wait. I nod, huddled beneath the horsehair blankets, gazing into the morning mist.\nTo my left in the field stand tall platforms upon which men sleep on straw pallets. Some of the men are waking, stretching. Beneath them the small fires that warm them at night are now no more than embers, sending smoke into the air. These men are hired to guard the fields and keep the wild animals away. A long rope extends from their platform into the fields. If an animal comes through their area, the rope will pull and the man somehow is supposed to chase the creature away. Now, as we wait for our guide, it is a strange sight to see these half-naked men, warming their hands at the waning fires.\nFor almost an hour we are motionless. I keep a scarf wrapped around my throat and the hot-water bottle, which is growing tepid by the minute, in my lap, but I can’t seem to stop coughing. I’m popping cough drops and I’m going to be running out soon. From the thermos at my feet I sip warm tea—nervous not to sip too much because I’m not sure where the first pit stop will be.\nThe sun rises and a thin line of scarlet appears in the east, but everyone is freezing. The men on the platform, the guides, children riding their bikes to school, everyone is chastened by this chill. It’s almost seven-thirty when a bespectacled young man jumps into our jeep. He has a woman’s bright pink wool scarf wrapped around his head, and Sudhir seems very happy to see him, but the man barely nods at me.",

The moments that stayed were those of retreat: darkened bedrooms, lunches, shuttered clubs, a dawn drive to the ruins of Tughlakabad, a vision of the Flame of the Forest. Sightseeing was not easy. Bare feet were required in too many places. The entrances to temples were wet and muddy and the courtyards of mosques were more scorching than tropical beaches in mid-afternoon. At every mosque and temple there were idlers waiting to pounce on those who did not take off their shoes. Their delight and their idleness infuriated me. So did one notice: ‘If you think it is beneath your dignity to take off your shoes, slippers are provided.’ At Rajghat, faced with an unnecessarily long walk over hot sand to the site of Gandhi’s cremation, I refused to follow the Tourist Department’s guide and sat, a fully shod heretic, in the shade. Blue-shirted schoolboys waited for the Americans among the tourists. The boys were well fed and well shod and carried their schoolbooks like emblems of their worthiness. They ran to the old ladies. The ladies, informed of India’s poverty, stopped, opened their purses and smilingly distributed coins and notes, while from the road the professional beggars, denied entrance, watched enviously. The heat was unhinging me. I advanced towards the schoolboys, simple murder in my heart. They ran away, nimble in the heat. The Americans looked assessingly at me: the proud young Indian nationalist. Well, it would do. I walked back to the coach, converting exhaustion into anger and shame.",

They are mostly open-air affairs of low wooden tables and tiny stools that spill out on to the pavements beneath high awnings or umbrellas. Each tea shop has its own specialty. Everyone admires the mutton curry puffs at the Minthiha Tea Shop chain in Mandalay, for instance, and I favoured a corner tea shop near my hotel where the baked-to-order naan bread and split-pea dip became my breakfast staple. There is a pleasing rhythm to the life of the Mandalay tea shops, and whole days can be lost inside them. In the morning, bicycles and motorbikes crowd around them in congested rows as customers down their first cup of the day before going to work. At lunchtime, the peak of the day’s heat, the tea shops are lazy and quiet; the young waiting boys doze on the tables, while flies hover above them in sultry slow motion. In the late afternoon and early evenings the pace picks up as the boys become busy with orders for tea and snacks, and the shops are again noisy with chatter.",

I looked down to see my light-colored tiles covered in black. It took me a minute to realize that the window I habitually opened to let out humidity, on that day had let in volcanic ash. I hadn’t opened the big rolling shutters in the living room or glanced out the small window in the bathroom before I hopped in the shower. By the time I surveyed the streaked, graying sky, similar to that of a large forest fire, Etna’s peak was completely cloud covered. My friend Luisa swept ashes up from her balcony on Via Marina several times a day for a week, using the powder as plant fertilizer. In the open-air market, the vendors shrugged off the black dust landing on their prepared items, declaring the consumption of Etna’s ash nutritious. The cinders certainly did wonders for the local fruits and vegetables.",

If, on the afternoon of a hot day, you kneel and put your face close to the surface of a glacier or a frozen lake, you will enter a new architectural world of tiny palaces, town halls and cathedrals. They are formed by the uneven melting power of the sun on the ice’s surface and are fruitlessly exquisite creations: destined to be erased overnight and then recreated in further baroque variations with each sunrise. I once spent a quarter of an hour on my knees in the snow, examining a huddle of these tiny ice buildings, and then looked up to find the mountains there. I was shocked for several seconds by how startlingly large they were in the winter sky.",

What he did in running the Colonial Army was risky and audacious, not to say skilful. People tend to forget that the Revolutionary War dragged on for eight years and that Washington often didn’t get a whole lot of support. Out of a populace of 5.5 million, Washington sometimes had as few as 5,000 soldiers in his army – one soldier for every 1,100 people. When you see what a tranquil and handsome place Mt Vernon is, and what an easy and agreeable life he led there, you wonder why he bothered. But that’s the appealing thing about Washington, he is such an enigma. We don’t even know for sure what he looked like. Almost all the portraits of him were done by, or copied from the works of, Charles Willson Peale. Peale painted sixty portraits of Washington, but unfortunately he wasn’t very hot at faces. In fact, according to Samuel Eliot Morison, Peale’s pictures of Washington, Lafayette and John Paul Jones all look to be more or less the same person.",

Below beyond the palmaria on the beach, the Indian’s dogs continued to bark uproariously. He wondered what had upset them so much, and, peering down from his elevation, was surprised to detect unaccountable movements of the ground below, as if several oblong pieces of the plain had been in motion. Those dark, shifting patches, alternately catching and eluding the eye, altered their place always away from the harbour, with a suggestion of consecutive order and purpose. A light dawned upon him. It was a column of infantry on a night march towards the higher broken country at the foot of the hills. But he was too much in the dark about everything for wonder and speculation.",

In between then and three o’clock, I might have as many as three forty-minute round-trips to the airstrip; and if I sat with the guests for dinner, my evening could run as late as midnight. This was the routine for seven days a week, three months straight. From about the midway point of any three-month stint in the bush, I would be exhausted. And on the rare days that I had no guests to pick up or drop off at the airstrip, I would rush to my baking-hot tent, soak a bedsheet, lie underneath its cool moisture, and try to doze for an hour or so. The monkeys seemed to want me awake, though, and took great delight in climbing the tree nearest to my abode and launching themselves at its taut canvas roof.",

Then she stood on one leg and raised the other one. Under her fingers was a small, hard bump, slightly feverish. Gabriel’s pants, she whispered, they’ve found us again.

As if in a dream, I made the long ascent up to the Potala Palace, whose thirteen white and brown and golden stories preside over the town with silent majesty. Inside, the secret rooms were heavy with the chanting of holy texts. The smell of butter lamps was everywhere, and flashes of a sky, now brilliant blue, outside. Banners fluttered in the wind, prayer bells sounded. Sunlight and silence and high air.",

We tip Tweedledum and Tweedledee handsomely for not killing us and then kiss the ground. Here, a gorgeous garden somehow grows out of crumbling dry dirt: white and pink poppies, yellow chrysanthemums, deep crimson buds, orange star-shaped things and some bizarre cabbage-like vegetables. Steep, jagged cliffs with profiles like steak knives rise above us. Tiny villages perch perilously on top. The buzz of a billion Indians and their noisy cars is so distant I can now hear subtle sounds: the caw of crows, the squawk of mynah birds and the chattering squeak of a tiny squirrel. Yet it’s a landscape of tired splendor. The sky is too exhausted to be blue and it sits low on my shoulders; the earth seems drained of its vitality and the trees are limp and dusty. The only thing showing any sparkle is the Ganges—it burbles over small rapids swirling blue-green and broad.",

In this wintry place, in the gray light, the little band has strayed from some Gothic tale. The shivering boy, not more than ten, carries a load that looks heavier than my own; the little woolen girl, still toddling, must be lifted across the frozen brooks that protrude like ice tongues from ravines in the east wall. The old woman is bent beneath a load of sheepskins; what she will get for them farther south can scarcely repay such a hard journey. She lifts gnarled fingers to her mouth, but I have no food: I make sign that she should ask food of the Sherpas when they come. They smile at me as best they can. Perhaps these cheerful children are brave orphans, perhaps they are abroad so early to avoid freezing to death for want of fuel. I go on to Raka, walking as hard as possible just to keep warm.",

And because their floe was still drifting, there was the possibility that—given what Bartlett knew about the drift of the polar ice pack—they’d skirt beyond Wrangel Island and “slide westward and circle the Pole until, some years hence, we would possibly emerge down through the Greenland Sea.” That had happened to Nansen’s Fram twenty years before. “But by that time,” Bartlett committed to his log with a resigned frankness, “we should all be frozen stiff.”",

    "target_paragraph": "Yogi Johnson stood looking out of the window of a big pump-factory in Michigan. Spring would soon be here. Could it be that what this writing fellow Hutchinson had said, “If winter comes can spring be far behind?” would be true again this year? Yogi Johnson wondered. Near Yogi at the next window but one stood Scripps O’Neil, a tall, lean man with a tall, lean face. Both stood and looked out at the empty yard of the pump-factory. Snow covered the crated pumps that would soon be shipped away. Once the spring should come and the snow melt, workmen from the factory would break out the pumps from piles where they were snowed in and haul them down to the G.R. & I. station, where they would be loaded on flat-cars and shipped away. Yogi Johnson looked out of the window at the snowed-in pumps, and his breath made little fairy tracings on the cold windowpane. Yogi Johnson thought of Paris. Perhaps it was the little fairy tracings that reminded him of the gay city where he had once spent two weeks. Two weeks that were to have been the happiest weeks of his life. That was all behind him now. That and everything else.\nScripps O’Neil had two wives. As he looked out of the window, standing tall and lean and resilient with his own tenuous hardness, he thought of both of them. One lived in Mancelona and the other lived in Petoskey. He had not seen the wife who lived in Mancelona since last spring. He looked out at the snow-covered pump-yards and thought what spring would mean. With his wife in Mancelona Scripps often got drunk. When he was drunk he and his wife were happy. They would go down together to the railway station and walk out along the tracks, and then sit together and drink and watch the trains go by. They would sit under a pine-tree on a little hill that overlooked the railway and drink. Sometimes they drank all night. Sometimes they drank for a week at a time. It did them good. It made Scripps strong.\nScripps had a daughter whom he playfully called Lousy O’Neil. Her real name was Lucy O’Neil. One night, after Scripps and his old woman had been out drinking on the railroad line for three or four days, he lost his wife. He didn’t know where she was. When he came to himself everything was dark. He walked along the railroad track toward town. The ties were stiff and hard under his feet. He tried walking on the rails. He couldn’t do it. He had the dope on that all right. He went back to walking along the ties. It was a long way into town. Finally he came to where he could see the lights of the switch-yard. He cut away from the tracks and passed the Mancelona High School. It was a yellow-brick building. There was nothing rococo about it, like the buildings he had seen in Paris. No, he had never been in Paris. That was not he. That was his friend Yogi Johnson.\nYogi Johnson looked out of the window. Soon it would be time to shut the pump-factory for the night. He opened the window carefully, just a crack. Just a crack, but that was enough. Outside in the yard the snow had begun to melt. A warm breeze was blowing. A chinook wind the pump fellows called it. The warm chinook wind came in through the window into the pump-factory. All the workmen laid down their tools. Many of them were Indians.\nThe foreman was a short, iron-jawed man. He had once made a trip as far as Duluth. Duluth was far across the blue waters of the lake in the hills of Minnesota. A wonderful thing had happened to him there.\nThe foreman put his finger in his mouth to moisten it and held it up in the air. He felt the warm breeze on his finger. He shook his head ruefully and smiled at the men, a little grimly perhaps.\n“Well, it’s a regular chinook, boys,” he said.\nSilently for the most part, the workmen hung up their tools. The half-completed pumps were put away in their racks. The workmen filed, some of them talking, others silent, a few muttering, to the washroom to wash up.\nOutside through the window came the sound of an Indian war-whoop.",

It was a spacious chamber, twenty feet each way and twelve feet high, and in these noble proportions was written quietly a message of luxurious wellbeing and assurance. In the exact centre of the wall that faced the door stood his bed, a chaste four-poster of the Revolutionary period, and beside it a little table holding a small clock, a few books, and a lamp. In the centre of another wall was an antique chest of drawers, and tastefully arranged about the room were a gate-legged table, with a row of books and the latest magazines upon it, two fine old Windsor chairs, and a comfortable, well-padded east chair. Several charming French prints hung on the walls. On the floor was a thick and heavy carpet of dull grey. These were all the furnishings. The total effect was one of modest and almost austere simplicity, subtly combined with a sense of spaciousness, wealth, and power.",

    "target_paragraph": "We drove back that night from our first meeting with the ‘hermits of Lapithos’ with a profound content, and as the moon was late and high, turned off the road to spend an hour in the owl-haunted ruins of Lambousa, an old church standing in magnificent desolation upon the echoing stony beach below Lapithos. Here, walking about in the ruins, eating the sweet brown grapes we had stolen from Pearce Hubbard’s table, we talked of our houses, of the books we were going to write, and of the lives we should be able to live here in the sun: within reach of each other on this eloquent range of hills. The owls whistled and the sea banged and rubbed under the moon. We were full of the premonitions of a life to be lived which could offer, not merely leisure in sunlight, but a proper field in which to read and reflect, deploy words and study. Marie was to leave for India next morning (she always left like this, without a word of warning, to reappear after a month or two as suddenly) and felt disinclined to sleep, so we drove back along the silent coast and down to the little mosque, blazing like a diamond on the rocky peninsula opposite her wattle hut. Here we bathed in a sea still full of cold currents, smarting to the flesh, and drank the last of a bottle of red Chianti which we found in the hut. The dawn was breaking before we were ready almost, rushing out of the night-sea beyond Cape Andreas, a steeply mounting flush upon the bronze faces of the mountains. A dense dew lay upon everything as we drove back through the silent fields to Kyrenia for breakfast. There were to be many such mornings, many such evenings spent in good fellowship and wine, before the vagaries of fortune and the demons of ill luck dragged Cyprus into the stock-market of world affairs and destroyed not only the fortuitous happiness of these friendships but, more tragically and just as surely, the old tried relationships on which the life of the little village itself was founded.",

Two months at sea, bare-footed all the time, without space in which to exercise one's limbs, is not the best preliminary to leather shoes and walking. Besides, the land had to cease its nauseous rolling before we could feel fit for riding goat-like horses over giddy trails. So we took a short ride to break in, and crawled through thick jungle to make the acquaintance of a venerable moss-grown idol, where had foregathered a German trader and a Norwegian captain to estimate the weight of said idol, and to speculate upon depreciation in value caused by sawing him in half. They treated the old fellow sacrilegiously, digging their knives into him to see how hard he was and how deep his mossy mantle, and commanding him to rise up and save them trouble by walking down to the ship himself. In lieu of which, nineteen Kanakas slung him on a frame of timbers and toted him to the ship, where, battened down under hatches, even now he is cleaving the South Pacific Hornward and toward Europe—the ultimate abiding-place for all good heathen idols, save for the few in America and one in particular who grins beside me as I write, and who, barring shipwreck, will grin somewhere in my neighbourhood until I die. And he will win out. He will be grinning when I am dust.",

The song that kept time to their tread, ‘Volk, ans Gewehr!’ – often within earshot during the following weeks – was succeeded by the truculent beat of the Horst Wessel Lied: once heard, never forgotten; and when it finished, the singers were halted in a three-sided square, and stood at ease. It was dark now and thick snow flakes began falling across the lamplight. The S.A. men wore breeches and boots and stiff brown ski-caps with the chin-straps lowered like those of motor-bicyclists, and belts with a holster and a cross-brace. Their shirts, with a red arm-band on the left sleeve, looked like brown paper; but as they listened to an address by their commander they had a menacing and purposeful look. He stood in the middle of the empty fourth side of the square, and the rasp of his utterance, even robbed of its meaning, struck a chill. Ironic crescendoes were spaced out with due pauses for laughter and each clap of laughter preceded a serious and admonitory drop in key. When his peroration had died away the speaker clapped his left hand to his belt buckle, his right arm shot out, and a forest of arms answered him in concert with a three-fold ‘Heil!’ to his clipped introductory ‘Sieg!’ They fell out and streamed across the square, beating the snow off their caps and readjusting their chin-straps, while the standard-bearer rolled up his scarlet emblem and loped away with the flagpole over his shoulder.",

Archaeologists have discussed adding air purifiers and fans (to regulate the air and protect the tombs, not the visitors), but it was an expensive proposition beyond reality. As Mohamed spoke, I tried to focus on his words, but my mind drifted to the ceiling, and those incredible undulating waves. The grape vines looked incredibly realistic, and I wished very much that I were outside, under a tent, surrounded by a real vineyard in a strong breeze.",

In the days before digital cameras and phones, it was often the case that you'd only recall a place or event, when you revisited it on that exciting day you got your holiday photos back from Supa Snaps.

Despite the high numbers of January detoxers, the upstairs section of The Crown & Two Chairmen in Soho was jammed with well-wishers waving us off. Almost 40 friends crammed in around beer-covered tables. If this had been my birthday, six dependable friends would have turned up on time. Another seven or eight would have arrived in stages throughout the night, while the rest would have texted me with last-minute cancellations. Outside the steamed-up windows it was snowing heavily. Tubes would inevitably be cancelled and buses delayed, yet the overarching possibility that I might die in a train crash had brought everyone out of the woodwork. At least I knew my funeral would have a good turnout.",
