She was weary, for the moment, of ugliness, pain and hard work, and life seemed to recover its meaning under the aspect of a graceful leisure. Lynbrook also, whither she had been persuaded to go with Bessy at the end of their woodland cure, had at first amused and interested her. The big house on its spreading terraces, with windows looking over bright gardens to the hazy distances of the plains, seemed a haven of harmless ease and gaiety. Justine was sensitive to the finer graces of luxurious living, to the warm lights on old pictures and bronzes, the soft mingling of tints in faded rugs and panellings of time-warmed oak. And the existence to which this background formed a setting seemed at first to have the same decorative qualities. It was pleasant, for once, to be among people whose chief business was to look well and take life lightly, and Justine's own buoyancy of nature won her immediate access among the amiable persons who peopled Bessy's week-end parties. If they had only abounded a little more in their own line she might have succumbed to their spell. But it seemed to her that they missed the poetry of their situation, transacting their pleasures with the dreary method and shortness of view of a race tethered to the ledger. Even the verbal flexibility which had made her feel that she was in a world of freer ideas, soon revealed itself as a form of flight from them, in which the race was distinctly to the swift; and Justine's phase of passive enjoyment passed with the return of her physical and mental activity. She was a creature tingling with energy, a little fleeting particle of the power that moves the sun and the other stars, and the deadening influences of the life at Lynbrook roused these tendencies to greater intensity, as a suffocated person will suddenly develop abnormal strength in the struggle for air.",

Several foreign journalists witnessed soldiers getting ripped to pieces by angry mobs on June 4, and in the months that followed, bands of youth launched some 170 assaults against them that resulted in at least 21 deaths. In Mandate of Heaven, Orville Schell observes that the soldiers were almost as traumatized as the civilians by the end.",

White pyramids shot past in succession – salt mounds drying out in the sunshine. By teatime the train galloped past cliff faces and over canyons, where the outlines of once thick rivers wormed their way along, now just streams waiting for a monsoon to restore their health. Since the Kerala Express, few other journeys had included such varied topography, so the Pune-Nizamuddin Duronto Express ranked highly in our esteem. Even the interiors were upgraded. Nifty bottle holders replaced net pockets and LED panels had ousted the rusty metal light fittings that often scraped the back of my head.",

The wind drew among the cedars in long sighs, and steadily as pulses the sad hopeless reiteration of the doves came along the sunny air. Isom returned for the last armful of dead flowers, and looking out across the marble vistas where shadows of noon moved, she watched a group of children playing quietly and a little stiffly in their bright Sunday finery, among the tranquil dead. Well, it was the last one, at last, gathered in solemn conclave about the dying reverberation of their arrogant lusts, their dust moldering quietly beneath the pagan symbols of their vainglory and the carven gestures of it in enduring stone; and she remembered something Narcissa had said once, about a world without men, and wondered if therein lay peaceful avenues and dwellings thatched with quiet; and she didn’t know.",

He left the scene of his daily labours quickly like an unobtrusive shadow. His descent into the street was like the descent into a slimy aquarium from which the water had been run off. A murky, gloomy dampness enveloped him. The walls of the houses were wet, the mud of the roadway glistened with an effect of phosphorescence, and when he emerged into the Strand out of a narrow street by the side of Charing Cross Station the genius of the locality assimilated him. He might have been but one more of the queer foreign fish that can be seen of an evening about there flitting round the dark corners.",

When we had completed one length of wire we carried it to Quest’s mast which was lying on saw horses just outside the building. Piece by piece the rigging was made up. We were out of the building just in time for the Sunday Thistle race. When I first started the rigging I expected it to be difficult. After the first couple of swages it was a breeze.

After midnight a squad fired a few shots at his village home, smashed the front door, vandalised two rooms, made him strip naked on the public street, then removed him to one of Israel’s five detention centres, leaving his family not knowing where he was or for how long. Within the 1967 borders there are also 21 prisons, 4 interrogation centres and one secret interrogation facility said to be furnished with state-of-the-art ‘enhancement tools’ donated by the CIA.

Yet its inhabitants maintain the ways of villagers, and have resisted the municipalizing forces thrust upon them. A few paces beyond the wide, asphalted main streets lies a network of separate self-contained villages with their own pastures and fields. Already, at eight o’clock in the morning, these villages were in the full swing of the agricultural day. Women were carrying piles of firewood towards their houses, while the men began solemnly to disembowel their tractors. Children were sitting on broken balustrades, watching the grazing sheep or throwing grain to the hens and the bantams. A few of the older ones rattled worry beads. In the tea gardens other families were picnicking. They sat in close little groups around boiling demlik (Anatolian samovars) reproducing in the open the zenana of the house: girls were tucked into neat semicircles around odalisque mothers, at a safe distance from the men.",

But alas, sunset light was unsympathetic to her make-up; plated it looked, not deeply interfused.124 And he dropped her hand; and she gave him an arch roguish twinkle, as if to say – but the end of that sentence was cut short.

I pulled on to the gravel drive and went inside. A woman of about seventy-five was sitting behind the desk. She wore butterfly glasses and a beehive hairdo. She was doing one of those books that require you to find words in a mass of letters and circle them. I think it was called ‘Word Puzzles for Morons’.",

The main effect of the repeated delays has been extra expense: over and over, the porters have been paid to sit and sleep. GS figured his budget rather closely—he is rigorous in his responsibility to the societies that sponsor him—and at Pokhara, the expedition was already so short of money, even with my own thrown in, that we could not afford an extra porter to carry more kerosene for the lamps, or more canned food to vary our diet, or even a single bottle of strong drink. The sausage, crackers, and coffee are all gone, and sugar, chocolate, tinned cheese, peanut butter, and sardines are nearly finished; we shall soon be down to a pallid regimen of bitter rice, coarse flour, lentils, onions, and a few potatoes, without butter. With short days, no heat, dwindling lamp fuel, and white food, life promises to be stringent at Shey Gompa, where much time will be spent in sleeping bags, in order to keep warm; writing notes in this wretched tent, I cannot even sit upright, but must hunch forward with a bent and aching neck.",

My contract still had several months to run, however, and it would be wiser to let it lapse than to hurry away and perhaps give the Greek press grounds for believing that I had resigned on policy grounds, which would have been unfair to my masters. But Maurice was leaving soon and Sarah – and the precious circle of friends which had composed and framed my own personal picture of the island, had given it density and beauty. Austen and Pearce came and went at their swallow-like tasks of house-building in other, more favourable climates. Freya came through for a few days on her way to Turkey. And Sir Harry, to whom the island meant more than it could to any Cypriot, bound up as it was with his own youth. We lunched quietly on a deserted beach to the west of Kyrenia, drinking the good red wine labelled incongruously ‘Ace of Hearts’, and eat­ing a moussaka for old time’s sake while the old unchanging sea rushed and hissed upon the pebbled shore. How could he find the times through which we were passing anything but incomprehensible and inexpressibly painful? In his memory he was still sitting upon the famous keep at Famagusta, watching the sea uncurl and flex itself, yawn and stretch like a heraldic lion of Saint Mark, in the year 1918. What could I tell him that would afford him any comfort? His mind’s eye was still full of a forgotten sleepy Cyprus with its old-fashioned kindnesses and haunting white villages. The island that he knew so intimately and loved so much was soon going to pass through the eye of a needle – with no Kingdom of Heaven waiting for it on the other side.",

Is it a particular low-maintenance strain, do you suppose? And here’s another one. Why can’t they make cereal boxes with pouring spouts? Is some guy at General Foods splitting his sides at the thought that every time people pour out a bowl of cornflakes they spill some of it on the floor? And why is that when you clean a sink, no matter how long you let the water run or how much you wipe it with a cloth there’s always a strand of hair and some bits of wet fluff left behind?

    "target_paragraph": "He borrows Fedeler’s rod and sends the lure on its way. He reels. Nothing. He casts again. He reels. Nothing. Out in the river, there may be less water than salmon, but that is no guarantee that one will strike. Salmon do not feed on the spawning run. They apparently bite only by instinctive reflex if something flashes close before them. Pourchot casts again. Nothing. He casts again. The lure this time stops in the river as if it were encased in cement. Could be a boulder. Could be a submerged log. The lure seems irretrievably snagged—until the river erupts. Pourchot is a big man with a flowing red beard. He is well over six feet. Blond hair tumbles across his shoulders. The muscles in his arms are strong from many hundreds of miles of paddling. This salmon, nonetheless, is dragging him up the beach. The fish leaps into the air, thrashes at the river surface, and makes charging runs of such thrust that Pourchot has no choice but to follow or break the line. He follows—fifty, seventy-five yards down the river with the salmon. The fish now changes plan and goes upstream. Pourchot follows. The struggle lasts thirty minutes, and the energy drawn away is almost half Pourchot’s. He wins, though, because he is bigger. The fish is scarcely larger than his leg. When, finally, it moves out of the water and onto the gravel, it has no hook in its mouth. It has been snagged, inadvertently, in the dorsal fin. Alaska law forbids keeping any sport fish caught in that way. The salmon must take the lure in its mouth. Pourchot extracts the hook, gently lifts the big fish in his arms, and walks into the river. He will hold the salmon right side up in the water until he is certain that its shock has passed and that it has regained its faculties. Otherwise, it might turn bottom up and drown.",

He was sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton. Most people are heartless about turtles because a turtle’s heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered. But the old man thought, I have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs. He ate the white eggs to give himself strength. He ate them all through May to be strong in September and October for the truly big fish.\nHe also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of the fishermen kept their gear. It was there for all fishermen who wanted it. Most fishermen hated the taste. But it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes.\nNow the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again.\n“He’s found fish,” he said aloud. No flying fish broke the surface and there was no scattering of bait fish. But as the old man watched, a small tuna rose in the air, turned and dropped head first into the water. The tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in all directions, churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait. They were circling it and driving it.",

    "target_paragraph": "Authoritarian rule, with all its small humiliations, instilled in Bolívar from the earliest age a festering hatred for Spaniards, an anger as deeply felt as the sorrow that swept over his life as first his father, and then, six years later, his mother succumbed to tuberculosis, leaving him an orphan at the age of nine. Happily, he was raised by a kind uncle, who placed him in the care of an extraordinary teacher, Simón Rodríguez, who awakened in the lad an insatiable appetite for learning. They studied together in the wild, often on horseback, with all the forests, mountains, and beaches of Venezuela as their classroom. Rodríguez believed, as he wrote, that “a child learns more in one second, carving a little stick, than in one whole day, listening to a teacher.” Receptive to all that was unexpected and new, Rodríguez, in time, introduced his young charge to the writings of Voltaire, Locke, and Montesquieu, instilling in him a love of ideas that, along with a deep appreciation of nature, became two of the foundational pillars of Bolívar’s life. The third came more slowly, as Rodríguez, like a wizard, gave flight to the boy’s spirit, allowing fury, bitterness, and resentment to spin into a passion for justice and a burning desire to liberate the New World.",

To enter, I must step high onto what seems a raised floorone that gives under my weight with a sickening lurch. As my eyes adjust, I see the cause: the room is flooded with slurrythigh-deep and set in places to a smooth, level surface like poured concrete. Under a gap in the roof where the rain gets in, it has liquefied and dried many times over, forming a warped and dusty crust pronged through with fallen beams. The manure has risen up the sides of the interior walls, filling the fireplace and truncating doorways, and is in the process of spilling, in slow motion, through the front door onto the ground outside.",

Several hundred yards offshore, it curls north-east and runs in this direction for around three miles, still offshore, before cutting back to make landfall at Fisherman’s Head, the uppermost tip of a large, low-lying and little-known marshy island called Foulness.",

A sea-turtle lay dead upon the beach (some disturbing memory here – was it Orpheus’ lyre?) and a lean dog was digging out and feasting upon its decomposed entrails, closely watched by a scabby vulture from a heft of rock hard by. The vulture chuckled and gurgled and ruffled its feathers with hunger, and from time to time, overcome perhaps by the horrible slobber­ing noises of the dog as it ate, it hopped down and started to share the repast, jabbing and pulling at the turtle with its great beak. At each sortie the dog, trembling with hunger and rage, would turn aside and attack the vulture, which leaped nimbly into the air with a great beat of its wings, and retired to its rock again, crooning and mumbling protestingly.",

He passed under the archway, and found himself in a curious cul-de-sac, that was apparently occupied by a French Laundry, as a perfect network of clothes-lines was stretched across from house to house, and there was a flutter of white linen in the morning air. He walked right to the end, and knocked at a little green house. After some delay, during which every window in the court became a blurred mass of peering faces, the door was opened by a rather rough-looking foreigner, who asked him in very bad English what his business was. Lord Arthur handed him the paper Count Rouvaloff had given him. When the man saw it he bowed, and invited Lord Arthur into a very shabby front parlour on the ground-floor, and in a few moments Herr Winckelkopf, as he was called in England, bustled into the room, with a very wine-stained napkin round his neck, and a fork in his left hand.",
