Stand on the sea-shore with thy back to the moon, and cut away from around thy feet thy shadow, which is thy soul's body, and bid thy soul leave thee, and it will do so.'\n\nThe young Fisherman trembled.

She has no links with Ireland; her father emigrated as a young man.

One of you get the hammer out of the lorry.’ Luckily their orders had been not to drive the nails home but merely to secure the lid temporarily (apparently the body was to be transferred to something a little more elegant or anyway commensurate with its purpose when it reached Paris) so they could draw them without difficulty. Which they did and removed the lid and then recoiled from the thin burst, gout of odor which rushed up at them almost visibly, like thin smoke—one last faint thin valedictory of corruption and mortality, as if the corpse itself had hoarded it for three years against this moment or any similar one with the gleeful demonic sentience of a small boy. Then the old woman returned, clasping two bottles against her breast, still running or at least trotting, panting now, shaking, almost as though from physical exhaustion because she couldn’t even climb the steps when she reached the door, so that two of them dropped to the ground and lifted her bodily into the carriage. A third one took the bottles from her, though she didn’t seem to notice it. For a second or so she couldn’t even seem to see the coffin. Then she saw it and half knelt half collapsed at the head of it and turned the tarpaulin back from what had been a face. They—the speaker—had been right; she could have told nothing from the face because it was no longer man. Then they knew that she was not even looking at it: just kneeling there, one hand resting on what had been the face and the other caressing what remained of its hair. She said:",

By the end of college, it looked like I had eaten her. Hope, however, could always keep a lot of balls in the air, so still managed to spend a semester studying abroad in Ecuador, and graduated with a double major in business and Spanish in four years, while some of her fellow college buddies ended up living in boxes in San Francisco. By twenty-six she had grown into an adventurous, sporty, constantly cheerful woman who worked hard and played hard, so when she invited me to tag along on a business trip to Amsterdam for some girl fun she said I desperately needed, it was easy to say yes.",

    "target_paragraph": "Unlike most African towns, Iringa is a place you could learn to love. It has a natural advantage, straddling a high, breezy, wooded ridge top, overlooking immense sweeps of countryside – ochre and green, merging into low, vaguely blue mountain ranges in the far distance. Satellite villages straggle away from it on two sides and rural life seeps in from every side, nullifying the urban feel that might otherwise be generated by handsome though decaying colonial offices, ill-kept churches and mosques, an ugly breeze-block bishop’s palace, an affluent-looking new bank, a few prefabricated office blocks housing either commercial enterprises (usually stillborn) or Tanzania’s superfluity of bureaucrats. I was perhaps becoming used to the incongruity and run-down shoddiness of these remnants of empire where once the District Commissioner and his staff genuinely ‘did their best for the natives’ and where African administrators now genuinely do their best for themselves and their families. Familiarity was blunting the exasperation provoked by an agglomeration of malfunctioning Western imports – tarmac streets as eroded as cattle-tracks, factories closed or operating at 25 per cent capacity, telephones that don’t work, banks that have no currency left, moody electricity, officials who are never in their offices, schools without textbooks, post offices without stamps, hospitals without medicines, courts without justice. Parallel to this world of pretence, the ordinary folk survive – somehow. By setting up a set of bathroom weighing-scales on the pavement outside the bank and charging passers-by a penny a go; by pressing people’s clothes, while they wait, with a charcoal-filled iron; by squatting in the wayside dust selling a few combs, mirrors, razor blades, soap bars (probably stolen) spread on a plastic sack; by turning a bicycle upside-down and sharpening knives and axes on a whetstone attached to the whizzing rear wheel – by 101 stratagems bred of desperation. The phrase ‘subsistence economy’ is cold and hard, an idea in an academic mind unrelated to everyday life. The reality, when one pauses to observe the individuals engaged in it at the lowest level, is harrowing and haunting.",

I found the rosy-cheeked Nenets children irresistibly cute, in their little traditional coats; they seemed happy to have visitors. Nenets are a Samoyedic ethnic group native to northern arctic Russia and look almost Eurasian, some of them blue-eyed or green-eyed. They are tall with fair skin but have distinct Asian features, and I found them very beautiful.",

We rode above the clouds, under the clouds, and through the clouds! and every now and then a shaft of sunshine penetrated like a search-light to the depths yawning beneath us, or flashed upon some pinnacle of the crater-rim thousands of feet above. At every turn of the trail a waterfall or a dozen waterfalls, leaping hundreds of feet through the air, burst upon our vision. At our first night's camp, in the Keanae Gulch, we counted thirty-two waterfalls from a single viewpoint. The vegetation ran riot over that wild land. There were forests of koa and kolea trees, and candlenut trees; and then there were the trees called ohia-ai, which bore red mountain apples, mellow and juicy and most excellent to eat. Wild bananas grew everywhere, clinging to the sides of the gorges, and, overborne by their great bunches of ripe fruit, falling across the trail and blocking the way. And over the forest surged a sea of green life, the climbers of a thousand varieties, some that floated airily, in lacelike filaments, from the tallest branches others that coiled and wound about the trees like huge serpents; and one, the ei-ei, that was for all the world like a climbing palm, swinging on a thick stem from branch to branch and tree to tree and throttling the supports whereby it climbed. Through the sea of green, lofty tree-ferns thrust their great delicate fronds, and the lehua flaunted its scarlet blossoms. Underneath the climbers, in no less profusion, grew the warm-coloured, strangely-marked plants that in the United States one is accustomed to seeing preciously conserved in hot- houses. In fact, the ditch country of Maui is nothing more nor less than a huge conservatory. Every familiar variety of fern flourishes, and more varieties that are unfamiliar, from the tiniest maidenhair to the gross and voracious staghorn, the latter the terror of the woodsmen, interlacing with itself in tangled masses five or six feet deep and covering acres.",

We were already damp from the steady mountain drizzle by the time we'd tightened our boots, sorted out our backpacks and each been issued with a stout walking stick by our guides. It was time to set off. Led by the chief guide, a serious looking man with large, white, horse-like teeth, we plunged into the green abyss of the forest. Less than ten minutes later, we strode back out, without breaking sweat! The radio had crackled into life almost as soon as we'd set off, with news that a large gorilla group was nearby, so after a couple of hundred yards, our jungle trek was terminated and we were ushered back to the Land Rover.",

After about a mile a car slowed and offered him a ride. “I’m just walking before supper,” he said; “I’ll turn back soon.” After another mile he could see the lights of town. It was a faint glare, low and close. It got stronger as he approached. Before he reached town he began to hear the sound, the voices. Then he saw the people, a shifting mass filling the street, and the bleak, shallow yard above which the square and slotted bulk of the jail loomed. In the yard, beneath the barred window, a man in his shirt sleeves faced the crowd, hoarse, gesticulant. The barred window was empty.",

Almost all the diners are men. The functional rooms that lead off the mustard-, brown-, and salmon-colored hallways generally accommodate the wedding guests to whom the Europa caters. At one wedding of 360 people, Mendelssohn is played off-key while the TV flickers and the Terror Kids watch. Marco and Antonio, local truck drivers, their chests bare and hung with gold chains, thread their way in and out of the crowd, everyone drunk, the two exceptions being the sweating priest and the shy bride.",

So, as sleeping out without tents isn’t very healthy during the monsoon, we are now billeted on the unwelcoming though not overtly hostile villagers. We will sleep on various verandahs at the approximate cost of one penny per sleeping-space and I’m among the honoured few who are to be accommodated on the verandah of the village store, which sells nothing but cigarettes, matches and cloth, plus kerosene at certain seasons. The weary Tibetans were jubilant at this unexpectedly early halt and it suited me too. While wood was being collected to boil big saucepans of tea for our tsampa supper I set off on an exploratory walk to the top of this mountain, revelling in the cool evening air and in the dramatic splendour all around me.",

The walls were cool to touch and the ground warm from hundreds of pairs of feet padding through. Worshippers had thronged for the evening puja and hurried past carrying ladoos, garlands and restless children. In the heart of the temple, butter-balls, rolled and sold outside, were being thrown at the statue of Meenakshi and her consort and a group had gathered before Parvathi, the temple elephant. If visitors bowed before her, she placed a blessing on their head with her trunk, then swung the hairy tip down to take a coin from their hand, dropping it into the lap of her owner who sat behind. It was a smart, entrepreneurial move, marrying charm and religious servitude for material gain, but ultimately being tapped on the head by a smiley elephant was a rare occurrence and a childish thrill. One afternoon, while being walked to the temple, Parvathi had been scared by a couple of stray dogs and charged into a restaurant, much to the horror of the diners but to the delight of the owner. Overjoyed that the elephant had blessed his establishment, he rewarded the tearaway with 100 idlis and a handful of bananas. Parvathi was a proper little Indian with the right level of cunning to survive.",

In Protectorate times it was Uganda’s administrative centre; now various government departments and aid organisations occupy the old colonial offices, while the President occupies the governor’s residence on a grassy slope overlooking the lake. This august dwelling is so closely guarded that one hesitates even to glance at it lest some trigger-happy sentry might suspect the worst. Expats live in orderly oases of spacious bungalows and blossom-bright gardens, well-watered and green even in the dry season. One such oasis is the security-conscious EC compound, almost as difficult to get into as an Israeli nuclear weapons silo. Nearby, across the dual-carriageway leading to the airport, a trading centre lines a deep, wide hollow beneath a wooded ridge. Here I was extra-warmly welcomed on introducing myself as Joy’s friend and I visited that market daily to keep in touch with the real Uganda, which fast recedes if one is being sybaritic in a White ghetto.",

Pale puffy clouds lazily drift past the trees sleeping on either side of us. When it becomes clear that Lorenzo isn’t going anywhere though, she lifts up his wings to show me the plastic spines Agustino has added to the bottoms. Lorenzo squawks indignantly but continues to grip the stick, his claws wrapped tightly around it as if he can’t let go. Why him and not others, I wonder? I guess time, money . . . people. Luck. Lorenzo is going to have me, for the whole hour before breakfast. But the rest of the macaws, they just get Paddy, and that’s for just half an hour because of all the other tasks that have to be done. There aren’t enough volunteers to go around.",

And now I ask, “Who am I?” I have been talking of Bernard, Neville, Jinny, Susan, Rhoda and Louis. Am I all of them? Am I one and distinct? I do not know. We sat here together. But now Percival is dead, and Rhoda is dead; we are divided; we are not here. Yet I cannot find any obstacle separating us. There is no division between me and them. As I talked I felt, “I am you”. This difference we make so much of, this identity we so feverishly cherish, was overcome. Yes, ever since old Mrs Constable lifted her sponge and pouring warm water over me covered me with flesh I have been sensitive, percipient. Here on my brow is the blow I got when Percival fell. Here on the nape of my neck is the kiss Jinny gave Louis. My eyes fill with Susan’s tears.

Across the field the spire of a little Lutheran church looked out oddly round the end of the pagan portico. Behind and on either side were beeches. Not a soul came out as we drew up at the bottom of the steps. Not a soul was to be seen except the souls with scythes in the meadow. We waited a moment, thinking to hear a bell rung and to see flying waiters, but no one came. The scythes in the meadow swished, the larks called down that it was a fine evening, some fowls came and pecked about on the sunny steps of the temple, some red sails passed between the trunks of the willows down near the water.",

The broken sign points up to the sky. After we wander about, a farmer points us in the right direction. At the end of a dirt road we park and set out along the edge of a wheat field. A few meters down the path, we encounter a severed goat head covered with flies. Here, indeed, is a sign—a primitive one of sacrifice. “This is getting spooky,” I say as we step around it. The terrain becomes precipitous. We’re climbing down and all I can think about is the climb back up. A few rusted hand railings indicate we’re going in the right direction. The declivity becomes sharper; we’re skidding, holding on to vines. Haven’t we seen enough of these tombs? When it levels out, we start to see the openings into the hillside, dark mouths, vines, and brush. We venture into two, breaking through impressive spiderwebs with sticks. Inside, it’s as black as, well, a tomb. We see slabs and pits where the bodies and urns lay. Vipers must coil here now. We walk about half a mile along this level. The tombs are more numerous than at Sovana and poke into the hillside at various levels. There’s an oppressive feeling of danger I can’t identify. I just want to leave. I ask Ed if he thinks this is a weird place and he says, “Definitely, let’s go.” The way out is as awful as I expected. Ed stops to empty dirt out of his loafer and a sliver of bone falls out. We come to the place where we saw the goat head; it is no longer there. When we get back to the car, another one is parked near us. A young couple is kissing and rolling around with such intensity that they don’t hear us. This dispels the bad aura and we head back to the hotel, saturated with Etruscan voodoo.",

Ever since we had left Kebeisah the temperature had been exceedingly high, and from Babylon to Baghdad we travelled through a heat wave very unusual at the beginning of April. The early morning was cool and pleasant, but by about ten o’clock the scorching sun became almost unbearable, even for people so well inured to heat as my servants and I. As long as we were moving, it was tempered by the breath of our progress, but if we stood still it burnt through our clothes like a flame. There was not a leaf or any green thing upon the plain, and the only diversion in a monotonous ride was caused by a peasant who caught us up with lamentations and laid hold of my stirrup.",

He stretched and went to the window. It rained in slants here in Port Harcourt so that the water hit the windows and walls rather than the roof. Perhaps it was because the ocean was so close, because the air was so heavy with water that it let it fall too soon. For a moment, the rain became intense and the sound against the window grew loud, like pebbles being flung against the glass. He stretched again. The rain had stopped and the windowpanes were cloudy.

The sound itself is like a fading cry from far away—“Chi-tahhhhhh . . .” Perhaps as a symbol of how remote the city is from anywhere, its central square is huge; it practically has its own horizon. Overseeing the square at about the halfway point, a tall, dark-gray Lenin stands with the tails of his long coat flared to one side as if blown in that direction by the wind, or by the motion of the planet through space. In Chita, as usual, the plentitude of beautiful women overwhelmed and swamped description. I even gave up trying to decide if the number of beauties in Chita was greater than in Krasnoyarsk or Velikii Ustyug or anywhere. There were just a hell of a lot of them, is all. In straight lines that followed no pattern, they crossed the square’s vast concrete reaches, their stiltlike heels clicking sharply.",

Mrs Pert was there, sweet, gentle, a trifle more fuzzy than usual. Miss Newton, a wrenny and neurotic old maid, with asthma, who had gradually become Eliza’s unofficial assistant in the management of the house, was there. Miss Malone, the gaunt drug-eater with the loose grey lips, was there. Fowler, a civil engineer with blond hair and a red face, who came and departed quietly, leaving a sodden stench of corn-whisky in his wake, was there. Gant, who had now moved definitely from the house on Woodson Street, which he had rented, to a big back room at Eliza’s, was there – a little more waxen, a little more petulant, a little feebler than he had been before. And Ben was there.",
