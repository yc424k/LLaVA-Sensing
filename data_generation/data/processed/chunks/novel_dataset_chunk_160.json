Beggars, pavement dwellers and sick children carrying sick babies are just a part of the landscape. On the other side of the train, a row of ladies with jasmine dangling from their plaits waited with wedding-sized garlands and a silver tray of coconut, sandalwood paste and a pot of kumkum. A flame flickered in the centre on a piece of camphor. Four dancers carried a palanquin on their shoulders on which a bare-chested child was sitting in a dhoti, wearing a papier-mâché head of Lord Ganesha and holding an umbrella above him. He looked like a mannequin. As each passenger descended the steps, bellies like Ganesha, they were draped with the flowers and their foreheads swiped with red, a ritual that continued for the next seven days.",

    "target_paragraph": "Valentina Gerdun’s museum displayed photographs of prisoners who worked on the road, along with short biographies of them, articles of clothing and other small mementos, and poems they had written. The museum’s general tone was not at all accusatory, however; rather, Valentina Gerdun celebrated the highway as a great achievement of the Russian people. As in many Russian museums, a lot of this one celebrated the country’s victory in the Great Patriotic War. The village—also known as Posyolok Dorozhnikov, or Roadbuilders’ Settlement—had been the site of an airfield on the Alaska–Siberia transfer route, a Lend-Lease program that brought almost eight thousand fighter planes and light bombers from American factories to Russia’s Eastern Front, thereby helping to win the battles of Kursk, Kuban, Stalingrad, and the war itself. Four hundred and fifty prisoners, two hundred horses, and fifty trucks and other machines built the Posyolok Dorozhnikov landing strip during August, September, and October 1943, she said. For finishing this airstrip ahead of time, many NKVD officers and a few civilians received awards, although no awards were given to the prisoners.",

Choosing then, only those selves we have found room for, Orlando may now have called on the boy who cut the nigger’s head down; the boy who strung it up again; the boy who sat on the hill; the boy who saw the poet; the boy who handed the Queen the bowl of rose water; or she may have called upon the young man who fell in love with Sasha; or upon the Courtier; or upon the Ambassador; or upon the Soldier; or upon the Traveller; or she may have wanted the woman to come to her; the Gipsy; the Fine Lady; the Hermit; the girl in love with life; the Patroness of Letters; the woman who called Mar (meaning hot baths and evening fires) or Shelmerdine (meaning crocuses in autumn woods) or Bonthrop (meaning the death we die daily) or all three together—which meant more things than we have space to write out—all were different and she may have called upon any one of them.",

The air smelled of rotting seafood, which I took as a good sign that the year’s early berry crop had not converted Kodiak’s famous omnivores into half-ton fruitarians. Brigid indicated a very large, very fresh bear bed (“This thing’s like an impact crater”) and some bits of brown fur clinging to trees adjacent to the trail. I tried to keep in mind what I’d come to think of as Harriman’s Rule: Just because you travel a long distance doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed a bear at your convenience.

Thanks to the largesse of one participant with the connections to import cases of Moët & Chandon, there’s also champagne for the entire Rally. The very frivolity of this gesture boosts our spirits, and I’m especially looking forward to sharing a toast with Bernard and our friends. Hoping to surprise everyone, I ransack Roxanne for some extra treats, pulling out our precious stash of beef jerky and some sticky sweet lemon energy bars. Thus laden, I take the long way to the dining hall, enjoying the feel of the clean night air with its hint of moisture, and the spring of grass under my feet. I relish this rare chance to be alone. On my detour, there’s a small, fancy yurt I hadn’t noticed earlier. Like in a fairy tale, it’s small and squat, with a carved wood door and canvas walls covered in curlicues of blue and red embroidery. Light flickers in a window, and I hear low voices punctuated by sharp laughs. “Ah, a secret discovery,” I think, already planning the memorable end to the evening that Bernard and I can have here. I pull open the door and peer in, expecting to see a few locals clustered round a bartender. Mongolians are hospitable and I have no doubt I’ll be greeted by gestures to step inside. Instead I glimpse Matthieu, sitting in a sumptuously decorated yurt with his mates, bottles of wine open on the table, a Mongolian singer performing for their private pleasure. He looks up, sees me, just as James does. After our shared work day in UB, I feel I know James, or if not “know” then at least am acquainted insofar as he sometimes nods when he sees me. Though I’ve also noticed that sometimes he sees me and does not nod. I’ve forgiven the latter episodes, attributing it not to snobbery, but to him being distracted by his own car problems. Though since he has his own mechanic, I can’t imagine he’d have any.",

David stripped and bathed in the pool, letting the river rinse away the morning’s miles. He swam out to a flat boulder that lay just beneath the water, and assumed the lotus position upon it, perched miraculously on the water’s surface like a yogi, grinning. But soon the midges moved us on. They were there in their thousands, and they rose like smoke from the heather as we passed: a robust encouragement to all-day walking.",

All Kyoto seems out today. As we walk towards the hills, Sachi fills me in happily on friends from high school, their husbands, the drawings she’s selling online, not least of the fox shrine near her grandparents’ house, and all the whimsical ghosts and spirits she’s superimposing upon the photographs she’s taken. That mention of “husbands” is a slippery one, though I’m less anxious than her mother might be. Sachi’s brother, like most Japanese males, followed a more conventional course—going to Tokyo as soon as he graduated, getting a job with a good, solid company (Japan Airlines), finding a sweetheart at twenty-five, settling down with his wife, his little girl and his steady, if not always exhilarating work. But Japanese women still have no good place in the system, so either they defect—as Hiroko had done by marrying me—or they try to make the most of the free time that being denied most public opportunity can bring.",

Dynamite exploding ahead made the windows rattle. The two men were bitterly disappointed. We cooked sausages later over a fire near a small bridge, and watched a black mink grubbing among a pile of stones.

He had once been precise and dapper but now he was clad slovenly in careless uncreased grey and earthy shoes. His hair still curled youthfully upon his head and he had Cecily’s eyes. He was a Catholic, which was almost as sinful as being a republican; his fellow townsmen, while envying his social and financial position in the community, yet looked askance at him because he and his family made periodical trips to Atlanta to attend church.",

Two mornings ago the milk wagon which made the beach route stopped there and the doctor’s wife saw the man once returning up the beach from a small grocery store owned by a Portuguese ex-fisherman, carrying a loaf of bread and a bulky paper sack. And she told the doctor about watching him cleaning (or trying to clean) a mess of fish at the kitchen steps, told the doctor about it with bitter and outraged conviction—a shapeless woman yet not fat, not anywhere near as plump as the doctor himself, who had begun to turn gray all over about ten years ago, as if hair and complection both were being subtly altered, along with the shade of her eyes, by the color of the house dresses which she apparently chose to match them. “And a mess of it he was making!” she cried. “A mess outside the kitchen and a mess on the stove too probably!”",

    "target_paragraph": "The doctor, Abulmajid Khan, proved to be a Cambridge graduate, a charming and cultivated man, whose natural reserve, so rare in Indians, soon expanded into geniality. He has been here eight years, and, seeing my surprise, explained that he had had to leave the Indian Medical Service owing to an incident connected with the Non-Cooperation Movement. He spoke rather wistfully of this youthful indiscretion, which had wrecked his career, and added that the Non-Cooperation Movement seemed to be dead now, as if to imply that the effort which had cost him so much had been given to a lost cause. But there was no bitterness in his voice, and none of that embarrassing defiance which Indian nationalists often assume towards an Englishman. I tried to convey, without seeming fulsome, that the nationalists had my sympathy and that of many more Englishmen today than ten years ago. There was no bitterness either in his remarks about Afghanistan. He is fond of the people and of his work, in which he differs from the other Indians I have met in this country.",

It chanced that Indiana (who was now in full social progress, and had “run over” for a few weeks to get her dresses for Newport) had organized for the same evening a showy cosmopolitan banquet in which she was enchanted to include the Marquise de Chelles; and Undine, as she had hoped, found Elmer Moffatt of the party. When she drove up to the Nouveau Luxe she had not fixed on any plan of action; but once she had crossed its magic threshold her energies revived like plants in water. At last she was in her native air again, among associations she shared and conventions she understood; and all her self-confidence returned as the familiar accents uttered the accustomed things.",

Strings of waggons were returning empty upstream or labouring south loaded with tree-trunks to be lashed together and floated down the Danube; and when two of them crossed, ropes of dust lengthened in both directions and wrapped the road and its passengers in a cloud; it settled on the fruit trees that sometimes lined the road for furlongs on end, heavy with blue plums nobody picked that scattered the roadside in wasp-haunted rings.",

Then, as it lowered its speed near Yonkers, she rose from her seat and drifted slowly down the carriage. As she passed Mr Gryce, the train gave a lurch, and he was aware of a slender hand gripping the back of his chair.

Then a group of men, who had been watching our approach, came to the edge of the compound and invited me to stop for a drink. They were led by a priest – a small, slender man of perhaps thirty-five, with remarkably regular Semitic features, an effeminate voice, intelligent eyes and the cruellest mouth I have ever seen. This face so unnerved me that I declined the insistently repeated invitations and quickened my pace past the compound, hardly knowing whether to try to look friendly or formidable. For a few moments I could hear voices raised in excited argument behind us; then we rounded an outcrop of rock and were beyond sight and sound of the tukuls.",

    "target_paragraph": "The Model T, like Ford himself, was an unlikely candidate for greatness. It was almost willfully rudimentary. For years the car had no speedometer and no gas gauge. Drivers who wanted to know how much gas they had in the tank had to stop the car, get out, and tip back the driver’s seat to check a dipstick located on the chassis floor. Determining the oil level was even trickier. The owner, or some other compliant soul, had to slide under the chassis, open two petcocks with pliers, and judge from how fast the oil ran out how much and how urgently more was needed. For shifting, the car employed something called a planetary transmission, which was famously idiosyncratic. It took much practice to master the two forward gears and one reverse one. The headlights, run off a magneto, were uselessly dim at low speeds and burned so hot at high speeds that they were inclined to explode. The front and rear tires were of different sizes, a needless quirk that required every owner to carry two sets of spares. Electric starters didn’t become standard until 1926, years after nearly all other manufacturers included them as a matter of routine.",

The houses scattered on the hillside lay cold and smokeless under the sun-flecked clouds, and not a human being was in sight. Charity paused on the threshold and tried to discover the road by which she had come the night before. Across the field surrounding Mrs. Hyatt’s shanty she saw the tumble-down house in which she supposed the funeral service had taken place. The trail ran across the ground between the two houses and disappeared in the pine-wood on the flank of the Mountain; and a little way to the right, under a wind-beaten thorn, a mound of fresh earth made a dark spot on the fawn-coloured stubble. Charity walked across the field to the ground. As she approached it she heard a bird’s note in the still air, and looking up she saw a brown song-sparrow perched in an upper branch of the thorn above the grave. She stood a minute listening to his small solitary song; then she rejoined the trail and began to mount the hill to the pine-wood.",

Sergio welcomed me warmly, introducing Alejandro and then his lovely daughter, Mariana, a biologist and an ardent environmentalist. There was a wonderful synergy between the two men. Alejandro was gracious, thoughtful, personally humble, and yet ferociously proud of all that had been accomplished. A strong sense of irony and whimsy was the key to his charm. Sergio, by contrast, struck me as a natural leader with a strong personality; he was confident, charismatic, and bold, with none of the traits normally associated with politicians. He listened more than he spoke, and he asked questions in a manner that suggested he really did believe that everyone had something to say, and each person deserved to be heard. What completely won me over was his connection to Mariana, the way he looked at her, listened to what she had to say, how he softly challenged her views. There is no better measure of a man than the love and respect he has for a daughter.",

Two women were injured, several children were separated from their parents, and many people were bruised or had clothing torn. Lindbergh was trapped in his plane for fifteen minutes.
