He very nearly said so. He had grown suspicious and embittered. Could it be that the old woman had such an excellent nose? But the unreasonableness of such a suspicion was patent, and Mr Verloc held his tongue. Not altogether, however. He muttered heavily:\n\n“Perhaps it’s just as well.”",

The east side of the road was lined with office and apartment buildings, but the west side was open to the river, save for the occasional restaurant or snack stand. The buildings along the Corniche seemed newer and taller than much of what we had seen in Luxor and Cairo. The shops were a mix of high-end retailers selling women’s and men’s fashions and electronics and furniture. There were several banks, including international chains that we recognized from Europe. Everything was closed for Ramadan; their posted hours promised they would open in the evening. The sidewalk, though shaded by the porticos, was cracked and caked in sand and dirt. A dozen women set out blankets and cloths across the sidewalk and displayed their wares in a makeshift market. Their goods included mounds of nuts and herbs and fruits and vegetables. Meanwhile, dozens of taxi drivers slowed and honked. Tax! Tax!",

These people are Tibetans who live mostly in Nepal and have made a name for themselves as guides and porters in the Himalayas. They are nicknamed “the tigers of the Himalayas.” They gave us valuable advice regarding our preparations and helped us to find a new yak, which was a real service to us, as we had hitherto invariably been swindled when we bought one of these creatures. We noted with satisfaction that our new yak was a well-behaved beast. He was a powerful bull, black with a few white flecks, and his long flowing coat nearly swept the ground. In his youth his horns had been removed and the operation seemed to have improved his temper without diminishing his strength. He wore the usual nose-ring. With a very little encouragement one could get him to exceed his average speed of two miles an hour. The poor devil had a lot of weight to carry, as we had made it a rule always to have at least eight days’ rations with us.",

Having escaped from the Bolsheviks, he has become a Persian subject, and now lives in a style more Persian than the Persians. A servant carrying a paper lantern three feet high conducted us to his house through the labyrinths of the old bazaar. The other guests were a Kajar prince, son of Firman Firma, and his wife, who had been brought up in Hongkong. They, being more English than the English, were disconcerted at having to eat off the floor. The house was tiny; but its miniature wind-tower and sunken court gave it an air. Hannibal is busy instituting a Firdaussi library in honour of the poet’s millennium next year.",

Having never set eyes on that last argument of men’s justice except in illustrative woodcuts to a certain type of tales, she first saw them erect against a black and stormy background, festooned with chains and human bones, circled about by birds that peck at dead men’s eyes. This was frightful enough, but Mrs Verloc, though not a well-informed woman, had a sufficient knowledge of the institutions of her country to know that gallows are no longer erected romantically on the banks of dismal rivers or on wind-swept headlands, but in the yards of jails. There within four high walls, as if into a pit, at dawn of day, the murderer was brought out to be executed, with a horrible quietness and, as the reports in the newspapers always said, “in the presence of the authorities.” With her eyes staring on the floor, her nostrils quivering with anguish and shame, she imagined herself all alone amongst a lot of strange gentlemen in silk hats who were calmly proceeding about the business of hanging her by the neck. That—never! Never! And how was it done? The impossibility of imagining the details of such quiet execution added something maddening to her abstract terror. The newspapers never gave any details except one, but that one with some affectation was always there at the end of a meagre report. Mrs Verloc remembered its nature. It came with a cruel burning pain into her head, as if the words “The drop given was fourteen feet” had been scratched on her brain with a hot needle. “The drop given was fourteen feet.”",

Top of the bill on the circus program, I sang for them, played the taiko for them, attempted to explain the rules of cricket to them (an explanation doomed from the start by their unshakable conviction that cricket, croquet, and polo were the same game), drank a lot of their sakè and most of their draft beer, and ended up being put to bed by two ryokan maids who told me that I had a good voice but rather loud, and that I should try to avoid the downstairs guests in the morning.

Suddenly he grinned mirthlessly and as if at a shameless thought.\n‘The Queen will write the letter his Grace shall send us,’ he said.\nThen their eyes met. The one glance, panic-stricken, seeing no issue, hopeless and without resource, met the other — crafty, alert, fox-like, with a dance in it. The glances transfused and mingled. Lascelles remained upon his knees as if, stretching out his right knee behind him, he were taking a long rest.",

It was that period in the vernal quarter when we may suppose the Dryads to be waking for the season – the vegetable world begins to move and swell and the saps to rise, till in the completest silences of lone gardens and trackless plantations, where everything seemed helpless and still after the bond and slavery of frost, there are bustlings, strainings, united thrusts and pulls – altogether, in comparison with which the powerful tug of cranes and pulleys in a noisy city are but pigmy efforts.",

That was in March 2001 when settlers were again attempting to seize Abu Snina, a nearby neighbourhood long disputed. The single bullet, fired from Abu Snina, was aimed at a member of the Bat Ayyin terrorist group; it wounded his leg while smashing his daughter’s skull. Instantly neighbours grabbed her body; it could not be buried, they said, until the IDF had been allowed to occupy Abu Snina on their behalf. They erected a protest tent and launched a week-long revenge rampage, looting shops and burning waqf buildings. Emunah Elon, a settler journalist, elucidated:",

Walking away from the jetty, I was very nearly run down by a suicidal pizza delivery boy on a speeding moped, beeping his horn insistently as he hurtled down a cycle lane. Nearby, three men in tracksuits were having a noisy argument outside a dingy café. A police car crawled past in an effort to intimidate them into good behaviour, with no effect. Two blonde women in matching pink vests jogged by, silencing the three men far more effectively than a carload of glowering policeman had. Trying and failing not to stare myself, I waited a couple of minutes before boarding a tram, a clanking grey box with small Dutch flags adoring its front corners, like a diplomat’s limousine. It trundled away from the Maas, towards the central train station.",

At this sort of altitude I must never again leave my boots outside; they were frozen so stiff it was almost impossible to force my feet into them. We couldn’t have a breakfast drink because our water was frozen solid.

He had no illusions. Unless he\ndid something to stop it, the whole thing would be one enormous and\nlamentable and expensive failure.",

Initially it seemed dark and somewhat disorganized and dingy. It took a while for my eyes to adjust to the dimly lit shadowy areas. Inside there were a couple of nondescript makeshift buildings with open-air majlis dotted with low, upholstered sofas in traditional Saudi fabric, well-worn and lumpy looking.

Having reached a conclusion it was apt to stay there. The very length of its stride made turning awkward for it.",

When his mother's light soprano broke, breathless for a\nmoment, on a top note, Mrs. Randall's rich, guttural contralto came to\nits support, Mr. Randall supplying a running accompaniment of bass.

Pale woods and plastics were juggled together with stale and pretentious vorticism, and the chairs resembled satin boxing-gloves and nickel plumbing. Carved dwarfs with red noses stoppered all the bottles on the oval bar and glass ballerinas pirouetted on ashtrays of agate that rose from the beige carpets on chromium stalks. There were paintings – or tinted photographs – of the Alps at sunset and of naked babies astride Great Danes. Everything looked better, however, after I’d swallowed two White Ladies taken from a tray that was carried about by a white-gloved butler. I helped myself to cigarettes from a seventeenth-century vellum-bound Dante, with the pages glued together and scooped hollow, the only book in sight. Down the dinner table, beside napkins that were half mitres and half Rajput turbans, glittered a promising arsenal of glasses, and by the time we had worked our way through them, the scene was delightfully blurred. From time to time during dinner, I intercepted a puzzled bloodhound scrutiny from the other end of the table. My host obviously found me a question mark; possibly a bit of a rotter, and up to no good; I didn’t like him either. I bet he’s a terrific Nazi, I thought. I asked the girls later, and they both exclaimed ‘Und wie!’ in vehement unison: ‘And how!’ I think he found something fishy, too, about my being on Du terms with his unwilling favourites, while he, most properly, was still restricted to Sie. (We had drunk threefold Brüderschaft and embraced in the Cologne style the night before.) When we were back in the salon, the men armed with cigars like truncheons and brandy rotating in glasses like transparent footballs, the party began to lose coherence. The host flogged it along with a jarring laugh even louder than the non-stop gramophone, between-whiles manoeuvring first Lise and then Annie into a window-bay whence each extricated herself in turn like a good-humoured Syrinx. I watched them as I listened to my namesake Dr Braun, a learned and delightful fogey who was telling me all about the Suevi and the Alemanni and the Hohenstaufens and Eberhardt the Bearded. When the evening broke up, and Lise and Annie were back in the car, our host stood leaning against the top of the car door, idiotically telling them they looked like two Graces. I ducked under his arm and slipped in between them. ‘Three now!’ Lise said. He looked at me with disfavour. ‘Ah! And where shall I tell him to drop you, junger Mann?’",

If the game came to a standstill before all the cards were numerically stacked up on top of the aces according to suit, I was sure we were doomed. That only launched me into dealing the cards with renewed fervor until they had all left my hands and I finally won a game. Then, and only then, was I able to get on with sailing. If a game was in progress, it was of no consequence that we were veering off course; it was of no relevance that the wind had died or picked up, just as long as the cards kept turning. The more fatigued I became, the more I dealt the cards with a vengeance, and once in a while the thought occurred to me that I might be going a bit mad.",

Some hotels in Vietnam offer elevators, some have watercoolers, some have girls who slip into your room the minute you return from dinner. Some have Viettronics shortwave radios in each room, some high-tech phones so complex they cannot reach even the front desk, some caged monkeys inexplicably in their gardens. In one deluxe hotel I stayed in, keys were scattered across the reception desk so that any guest could effectively take the key to any room (communal property indeed!). In another, ubiquitous signs warned: PETS, FIRE ARMS, EXPLOSIVES, INFLAMABLES, AND STINKING THINGS ARE NOT ALLOWED IN THE HOTEL. In another, I went into my room one day to find a chambermaid cadging a free shower. Vietnam is still the kind of place where you look out of your hotel window to see not two, not three, but nine cows grazing on the lawn.",

They have long been cursed by their own greatest strength—their indomitable adaptability and their bottomless capacity to make do. That’s why the U.S. embargo hasn’t worked, and never will. The idea of making conditions on the island so intolerable that the people will rise up and crush the Castro regime ignores the Cubans’ innate ability to find a way to survive. People who can turn a plastic soda bottle into a gas tank for a motorcycle, or use an old piston heated in a kitchen stove to repair a flat tire, see the world differently from other more conventional societies. When adversity is a constant, survival is a process of adjustment. Perhaps living on an island routinely hit by hurricanes has helped them develop this aspect of their national character. After all, nothing can stop a hurricane or prevent it from doing damage. The only option is to pick up the pieces and figure out how to reuse them.",

At 12.30 p.m. it was firmly closed: peering through the window we saw four tables on which chairs had been upturned. The next-door state bakery sold unlimited fresh lime juice, served ice-cold in small jam jars for NP1. Its day’s stock of ship’s biscuits was gone but we rejoiced to see, on otherwise bare shelves, two long yellow-brown cakes, each weighing half a kilo and costing NP10. These were stodgy and over-sweet (I sampled a fragment) but the Trio fell upon them as Rachel asked if there were any more, or anything else edible. No, not until mañana, but sometimes the tienda across the road stocked tinned food. Leaving the Trio under a mango tree finishing those revolting cakes, Rachel cruised around in search of fruit while I investigated the tienda. Even in Rachel’s estimation, our current state of malnutrition would surely justify the purchase of those junk foods we had so improvidently spurned in Chivirico. But Uvero’s residents, lacking tourism-generated convertible pesos, apparently couldn’t afford junk food. They could however occasionally afford beer and ruthlessly I bought the entire stock of nine half-litre tins. The amiable and very beautiful young woman behind the counter assumed that I was on my way to Uvero’s Rebel Army monument – some way up a hillside, guarded by a stately grove of royal palms. But I lacked the energy to pay my respects and anyway the others weren’t interested.",
