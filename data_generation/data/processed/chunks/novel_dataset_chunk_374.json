It was still daylight here; a rush, a stir, a turmoil of variegated life came racing towards her. It was as if something had broken loose – in her, in the world. She seemed, after her concentration, to be dissipated, tossed about. She wandered along the Strand, looking with pleasure at the racing street; at the shops full of bright chains and leather cases; at the white-faced churches; at the irregular jagged roofs laced across and across with wires. Above was the dazzle of a watery but gleaming sky. The wind blew in her face. She breathed in a gulp of fresh wet air. And that man, she thought, thinking of the dark little Court and its cut-out faces, has to sit there all day, every day. She saw Sanders Curry again, lying back in his great chair, with his face falling in folds of iron. Every day, all day, she thought, arguing points of law. How could Morris stand it? But he had always wanted to go to the Bar.",

They got there finally to the junction and found the train that had been chartered for them waiting. Ten dusty, grimy coaches of the Seaboard Air Line waited for them. They clambered in, found places if they could. Ten minutes later they were on the way to Richmond.

We rapidly established that our rusty cycles and perspiring, pedal-weary bodies were occupying a stretch of tarmac which would, in seconds, also occupy a fast moving fourteen-seater, single propeller aircraft. Considering what was the worst thing that could happen at this stage was as futile as it was obvious. Our adrenaline kicked in, to propel our aching legs into action, and we quickly swerved onto the grass apron running alongside the runway. Once out of the plane's immediate path, we turned just in time to see its wheels kick up a cloud of dust upon touchdown, and I remember being amazed at how quickly it seemed to accelerate once upon the runway. In seconds, it was alongside us, close enough for us to see the angry face of the co-pilot staring incredulously at us, as it sped past. I could clearly see the passengers, and made eye contact with a fat, bearded man in a baseball cap, as he pointed us out to his wife.",

The lobes of his nostrils were quite white against his brown face, and she said: “God, are you drunk too?” He came along the porch. “She’s not here,” the woman said. “You cant find her.” He brushed past her, trailing a reek of whiskey. She turned, watching him. He looked swiftly about the kitchen, then he turned and looked at her standing in the door, blocking it. “You wont find her,” she said. “She’s gone.” He came toward her, lifting his hand. “Dont put your hand on me,” she said. He gripped her arm, slowly. His eyes were a little bloodshot. The lobes of his nostrils looked like wax.",

In that village of more than 1200 Palestinians only the Sheikh’s large house had been preserved for Zionist use. Crude breeze-block cubes went up on its ruins but quite quickly these Polish refugees tired of the long climb home at the end of a hard day’s work. A majority of members then voted to descend to their present site, semi-surrounded by a conifer plantation. Because of the summer heat that move, too, was soon regretted but by then the members lacked energy for a second rebuilding. As Shaul (and others) often reminded me, those destitute newcomers, the majority debilitated by harsh years in Europe’s displaced persons camps, had not chosen to settle on Palestinian territory. They were TINA cases, to be disposed of as the JNF thought fit.",

It took us about a half an hour to jury rig some dock lines on the distressed boat so that it wouldn’t fly away when the wind freshened. Quick as we could, we returned to what we thought was the safety of Quest. Rain hitting skin at 60 mph felt like piercing needles. We were forced to walk sideways to make any progress. It was laborious to breathe. The docks were pitching so hard we had to crawl on our hands and knees back to Quest.",

Surely, I thought, even the Raj didn’t get around to building a Rest House here! I was right. The jeep crawled back the way we had come, through lightly falling snow, and eventually, having climbed a short, sharp hill, we found ourselves on the verandah of a small Rest House built only last year to accommodate government officials on tour. It is modelled on the Raj’s dak-bungalow, though at its worst the British PWD would never have put three large windows with ill-fitting frames in one smallish room at 8,500 feet.",

The fresh air of spring, the sky washed of clouds and already shedding warmth from its blue, seemed the reply vouchsafed by nature to the mood of her chosen spirits. These chosen spirits were to be found also among the deer, dumbly basking, and among the fish, set still in mid-stream, for they were mute sharers in a benignant state not needing any exposition by the tongue. No words that Cassandra could come by expressed the stillness, the brightness, the air of expectancy which lay upon the orderly beauty of the grass walks and gravel paths down which they went walking four abreast that Sunday afternoon. Silently the shadows of the trees lay across the broad sunshine; silence wrapt her heart in its folds. The quivering stillness of the butterfly on the half-opened flower, the silent grazing of the deer in the sun, were the sights her eye rested upon and received as the images of her own nature laid open to happiness and trembling in its ecstasy.",

I decided I wanted to swim with the sea lions before we left. They seemed so playful, I thought it would be a blast to interact with them. Cheryl, having more sense than I do, opted out. I pulled on my thin shorty wet suit and dived off a rock ledge into a sea lion filled bay across the hill from the harbor. When I hit the frigid water I thought my heart would stop. Once I recovered enough to move my limbs I kicked back to shore and dragged myself out. I had known the water would be cold but hadn’t expected it to be quite that cold. Cheryl had a good laugh and once I got my breath back I laughed with her. That was the end of my swim with sea lions.",

They had swelled up in the heat and the smell was terrible. My mother sent me to my room so I shouldn’t see. Then the officer cut the heads off and came up the steps, here, carrying them by the hair. And he asked my mother for preserving alcohol. You see, this Agencia in New York was paying five thousand dollars a head. They wanted to send the heads up there and get the money. This made my father very angry. He shouted them to give over the heads and the bodies and he buried them.’",

The palace had been built regardless of expense. It was originally laid out, Keith explained, by one of the old rulers of Nepenthe who, to tease his faithful subjects, simulated a frenzied devotion for the poetry and architecture of the Saracens, their bitterest enemies.",

The town sits on a bank of the wide Irrawaddy river, and is surrounded on all sides by the jagged outline of distant mountain ranges. The air is laced with the crisp, fresh smell of fir trees. Decaying colonial mansions and teak houses the colour of cooking-chocolate are hidden amid a forest of mahogany trees and rose bushes. If you’ve read Burmese Days, it is hard not to think of Katha as a fictional town. Though the colonial society which peopled its pages has long since moved away, all the novel’s key buildings still remain. Walking through the streets of Katha is therefore an eerie experience—a bit like walking on to an abandoned stage set.",

We were coming home from the pulmonologist, and I left her alone, unsupported, for a few seconds on East 90th Street. I turned and saw her trying to negotiate a step that was too much for her. She toppled backward before I could reach her, cracking her pelvis. With that, she was bedridden. Mollie and I started spending nearly every evening with her. Old friends from California visited. Michael, who was now at the Los Angeles Times, came as often as possible. So did Colleen and her family. Kevin and his partner.",
