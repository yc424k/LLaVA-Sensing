Huts lit by oil lamps and candles slid past, while fires burned beneath pots of food, the smoke flitting across the train doors. The city flickered like a fairytale kingdom as the train clanked and rolled past open homes and families winding down for the day. A body pressed itself against me and I jumped back to find a boy in an anorak, lighting a cigarette. He fixed me with a pair of slanted green eyes as his friend cleaned his nails with a blade. They were both Naga.",

A smooth, roiling path, the rumble of engines, and a plume of smoke trail behind. The mist is heavy now, almost a light rain. My excited heart has been pounding off the cold. Now the sagging of my enthusiasm allows this chill to creep under my skin. Dark bands of clouds are lit by the rising sun just under the horizon. I set off another hand flare, still confident that I have been seen. Wakes from the ship rock the raft, and I ride them out still standing. He’ll turn and approach to windward. As the flare dies, a tall burning ember, like a devil’s fire cone, stands in my hand. I throw it down, smoking and sizzling as it hits the surface, then groaning and boiling as it sinks into the depths.",

I could have leaned over and used her buttocks as bongos, but it gradually dawned on me that if I wanted service I would have to present myself at the counter and make a formal request. It would never occur to her to conclude that I was a foreign visitor who didn’t know the drill and say to me in a pleasant voice, ‘Coffee, mein Liebschen?’ or even just signal to me that I should step to the counter. No, I was breaking a rule and for this I had to be ignored. This is the worst characteristic of the Germans. Well, actually a predilection for starting land wars in Europe is their worst characteristic, but this is up there with it.",

They were high up Sgùrr na Coinnich, the 739 metre mountain down whose flank I have just ridden. They saw my yellow Big Bird jacket and wondered what it was. Perhaps one of the cornucopia? I explain that the jacket is a visibility enhancement so that mountain rescue can find me when I go crashing off a cliff. It is heartening to know they have seen me from so far away. Especially good since I now realise that I am totally knackered. Instead of carrying on, I head up an unmarked forest track towards Otter Haven, with its Otter Hide, to find a wild camping spot and collapse. Since the flanks of Sgùrr na Coinnich are equally steep here, it is a fool’s errand. Finally, I pitch the tent in the middle of the forest road. I hope nobody will run me over in the middle of the night. I discover a nice waterfall to wash in. Exhaustion and another swarm of midges drive me to an early bed.",

The transports carried used Japanese cars, most of them Toyotas, with their front ends covered in masking tape, like bandaged noses, to protect them from flying gravel on the road. So far I have not described this important aspect of Siberian trade: throughout the year, but especially in the summer, guys ride the Trans-Siberian to Vladivostok, buy used Japanese cars there, and drive the cars west across Siberia for resale. Cargo ships full of these vehicles arrive in Vladivostok all the time. A used car bought in Vladivostok for $2,000 can be resold farther west in Russia for three times that much. The entrepreneurs who drive this long-distance shuttle tend to wear muscle shirts, shiny Adidas sweatpants, and running shoes, and their short, pale haircuts stand up straight in a bristly Russian way. On the road they are easy to recognize by the tape on their vehicles and the fact that they speed like madmen. The faster they finish each round-trip, the more trips they can do and the more money they can make.",

She took her chair and looked through the smoke at a crude glass painting of a cow in a stable; also at a cock and a hen. She raised her glass to her lips. And drank. And listened.

The more difficult the feat, the greater the satisfaction at its accomplishment. Thus it is with the man who leaps forward from the springboard, out over the swimming pool, and with a backward half-revolution of the body, enters the water head first. Once he leaves the springboard his environment becomes immediately savage, and savage the penalty it will exact should he fail and strike the water flat. Of course, the man does not have to run the risk of the penalty. He could remain on the bank in a sweet and placid environment of summer air, sunshine, and stability. Only he is not made that way. In that swift mid-air moment he lives as he could never live on the bank.",

They flung themselves before his horse’s hoofs and begged him not to leave them, crying that if he went away they would be left without a leader, at the mercy of the Chinese. The officials feared that the monks would try to prevent the Dalai Lama from going any further, but at this critical moment he showed the strength of his personality and explained to the monks that he could do more for his country if he did not fall into the hands of the enemy, and that he would return as soon as he had concluded a suitable agreement with them.

Even if one didn’t know that on arrival, the vibes would soon impinge. Since the Hani assassination groups of men wearing black AWB uniforms and wielding rifles have thrice invaded Tshing, Ventersdorp’s township, swearing and jeering at the residents and threatening them with ‘What we did to Hani.’ In reaction, the Tshing folk erected barriers and armed themselves. Those barriers remain up – and so does the tension. Ventersdorp struck me as a dark place despite the cloudless sky, wide tree-lined streets, brightly painted shops, flowery front gardens. Men in khaki uniforms, with guns on hips, strode around looking angrily purposeful. Women with suspicious eyes, tight perms and thin lips were short-tempered with their small children. No English-language newspapers, not even The Citizen, were on sale. No blacks were visible. Every lamp-post displayed a notice summoning farmers to an anti-new South Africa rally in Potchefstroom. The hotel admitted the sweaty, dusty uitlander only after some hesitation.",

In his day, he added, it was not thought right to drink in the modern fashion; this wine-bibbing was responsible for considerable mischief; it troubled the brain, driving men to do things they afterwards repented. He drank only milk, having become accustomed to it during a long life among the hills. Milk cools the blood, he said, and steadies the hand, and keeps a man’s judgment undisturbed.\nThe person he had named was found after some further search. He was a bronzed, clean-shaven type of about fifty, who began by refusing his services point-blank, but soon relented, on hearing the ex-brigand’s recommendation of his qualities.",

No one is there at that hour, although the hotel manager warned us of crowds later in the day. Pale blue but clear water cascades over tufa, which the falls have hollowed out in many places, forming perfect places to sit down and let the warm water flow over and around you. When I first heard of the falls, I thought we might emerge smelling like old Easter eggs, but the sulphur is mild. The current has enough force so that you feel massaged, not enough to sweep you away. Bliss. Where are the water nymphs? Whatever it is supposed to cure, I’m sure it does. After an hour I feel as though I have no bones in my body. I am utterly relaxed, limp, speechless. We leave just as two cars pull up. Back at Acquaviva, we have breakfast on the terrace: fresh orange juice, nut bread, toast, something like pound cake, and pots of coffee and warm milk. It’s hard to leave. Only the lure of the Etruscans stirs us to pick up our map and go.",

I sat on the platform’s edge enjoying the silence and the beauty of this place while Mr Tang knelt by the log, blowing until it flamed. Then two loud shots sent echoes reverberating weirdly around those rock walls – double, triple echoes. Sadly I thought, ‘Two less of some endangered species!’ Mr Tang pointed to the knife-crested summit of the highest mountain in sight and boasted that he and an older man, an experienced climber, had recently reached the top and shot for the pot two big birds – he didn’t know the name in English – and a gibbon. I made no comment. If one wishes peasant cultures to survive, hunting for meat must be accepted. It is a much less off-putting activity than game-bird shooting and fox or stag hunting for fun – not to mention big game hunting. Mr Tang asked what animals people hunt in my country and looked puzzled on hearing that Ireland has no hunters who risk life and limb to feed the family.",

Then another impression sharply diverted his attention. Above the fagged faces of the Parisian crowd he had caught the fresh fair countenance of Owen Leath signalling a joyful recognition. The young man, slim and eager, had detached himself from two companions of his own type, and was seeking to push through the press to his step-mother's friend. The encounter, to Darrow, could hardly have been more inopportune; it woke in him a confusion of feelings of which only the uppermost was allayed by seeing Sophy Viner, as if instinctively warned, melt back into the shadow of their box.",

As I navigated the crowds of eaters and drinkers and smokers and queuers, I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly everyone was; another challenge to my snooty prejudices about football fans. ‘No, please, after you,’ a heavily tattooed man with a shaved head said, patting me on the back as he let me edge ahead of him in the coffee queue.",

The situation in Egypt appeared far more threatening when viewed from the newsrooms of Fleet Street or the conference halls of the Pentagon than it did from the calm and shady banks of the Nile.

Their shapes differed, too: the curragh was generally long and thin, with a snub nose and squared-off bows, while the coracle was lenticular. What they shared was a method of construction. Their hulls were of oxhide, which was oak-tanned, then wetted and stretched over a framework of bent wood and wicker. As it dried, the hide shrank around the framework, setting it rigid. Once it had set, it was caulked with tallow. What these craft had in common, too, was a logic of motion. They were designed, in their lightness and their shallow draft, to slide over the currents and the tide-rips, to slip up and over waves. This was their talent as vessels: they possessed a kind of maritime guile, barely displacing water, moving over the sea with the delicate touch of a pond-skater.",

Farmers hauled in cabbages by the truckload in November, which everyone left in the sun to dry a week or two before storing them for the long winter ahead. During the cold season, carts yielded carrots, potatoes, radishes, and lotus roots shaped like baby arms. Cherry blossoms and wild vegetables announced the arrival of spring; strawberries, pineapples, mangoes, and melons meant summer was near. Bananas were perennial, and foreigners apparently had a reputation for liking them, because every time I rode past a guy selling some, he’d grab one and jiggle it at me.

    "target_paragraph": "Turning back from the gate toward town, I walk to the other treasure of a church, San Niccolò. It’s newer, mid-fifteenth century. Like San Cristoforo’s, the decorations are amateurish and charming. The serious piece of art is a Signorelli double-sided painting, a deposition on one side and the Madonna and baby on the other. Meant to be borne on a standard in a procession, it now can be reversed by the custodian. On a hot day, this is a good rest. The eye is entertained; the feet can cool on the stone floor. On the way out, almost hidden, I spot a small Christ by Gino Severini, another Cortona boy. As a signer of the Futurist manifesto and an adherent to the slogan “Kill the moonlight,” Severini doesn’t readily associate in my mind with religious art. The Futurists were down on the past, embraced velocity, machines, industry. Around town, in restaurants and bars, I’ve seen posters of Severini’s paintings, all color, swirl, energy. Then, over a table in Bar Sport, I noticed that the modern Madonna nursing a baby is his. The woman, unlike any Madonna I’ve seen, has breasts the size of cantaloupes. Usually a Madonna’s breasts look disassociated from the body; often they’re as round as a tennis ball. The Severini original in the Etruscan museum just escapes being lugubrious by being tedious. A separate room devoted to Severini is filled with an interesting hodge-podge of his work. Nothing major, unfortunately, but a taste of the styles he ran through: Braque-like collages with the gears, pipes, speedometers the Futurists loved, a portrait of a woman rather in the style of Sargent, art school-quality drawings, and the more well-known Cubist abstractions. A couple of glass cases hold his publications and a few letters from Braque and Apollinaire. None of this work shows the verve and ambition he was capable of. Of course, all the Futurists have suffered from their early enthusiasm for Fascism; baby went out with the bathwater. They’ve suffered more from the tendency we have had, until recently, to look to France for the news about art. Many astounding paintings from the Futurists are unknown. For whatever reasons, Severini, in his later years, returned to his roots for subjects. I think there’s a microbe in Italian painters’ bloodstreams that infects them with the compulsion to paint Jesus and Mary.",

Mark liked to say that surfing “is essentially a religious practice.” But there was too much performance, too much competition (however unstructured), too much appetite and raw preening in it for that description to ring true to me. Style was everything in surfing—how graceful your moves, how quick your reactions, how clever your solutions to the puzzles presented, how deeply carved and cleanly linked your turns, even what you did with your hands. Great surfers could make you gasp with the beauty of what they did. They could make the hardest moves look easy. Casual power, the proverbial grace under pressure, these were our beau ideals. Pull into a heaving barrel, come out cleanly. Act like you’ve been there before. Make it look good. That was the real fascination, and terror, of photos of oneself. Do I look good? If this was a religion, perhaps it didn’t bear thinking about what was being worshipped. “Muthiya maar,” Caroline sometimes trilled over her etching plates as I swapped stories with other surfers over beers.",

I imagined asking the backhoe driver an inside question: “What’s the GVW on that?” Or, pickup-line style, “Hey, nice masonry.” It’s embarrassing, the desire to force community; too much ego in it, a wanting-to-be-known that feels vulnerable and grasping. If someone said those things to me out of the blue on a work site, I’d curl my lip. No one gets into the club that easily. Self-consciousness trumps the wish for connection, and I never ask.",

    "target_paragraph": "Up to his day, Mexican armies had always carried with them hundreds of the women and children of the soldiers; Villa was the first man to think of swift forced marches of bodies of cavalry, leaving their women behind. Up to his time no Mexican army had ever abandoned its base; it had always stuck closely to the railroad and the supply trains. But\nVilla struck terror into the enemy by abandoning his trains and throwing his entire effective army upon the field, as he did at Gomez Palacio.\nHe invented in Mexico that most demoralizing form of battle—the night attack. When, after the fall of Torreon last September, he withdrew his entire army in the face of Orozco’s advance from Mexico City and for five days unsuccessfully attacked Chihuahua, it was a terrible shock to the Federal General when he waked up one morning and found that Villa had sneaked around the city under cover of darkness, captured a freight train at Terrazzas and descended with his entire army upon the comparatively undefended city of Juarez. It wasn’t fair! Villa found that he hadn’t enough trains to carry all his soldiers, even when he had ambushed and captured a Federal troop train, sent south by General\nCastro, the Federal commander in Juarez. So he telegraphed that gentleman as follows, signing the name of the Colonel in command of the troop train: \"Engine broken down at Moctezuma. Send another engine and five cars.\" The unsuspecting Castro immediately dispatched a new train.\nVilla then telegraphed him: \"Wires cut between here and Chihuahua.\nLarge force of rebels approaching from south. What shall I do?\" Castro replied: \"Return at once.\" And Villa obeyed, telegraphing cheering messages at every station along the way. The Federal commander got wind of his coming about an hour before he arrived, and left, without informing his garrison, so that, outside of a small massacre, Villa took\nJuarez almost without a shot. And with the border so near he managed to smuggle across enough ammunition to equip his almost armless forces and a week later sallied out and routed the pursuing Federal forces with great slaughter at Tierra Blanca.",

The hotel was a small dirty café downstairs and a few dirty little rooms upstairs. The Greek owner welcomed Roy as a friend, and was in splendid form. Every day that his hotel escaped intact was like a special favour from God. He said, “L’alerte est très correcte ici.” The people had two to three hours warning so they could run from the city. Pre-alarm was one balloon, floating over the town; then two balloons were floated and the siren wailed, really time to get moving. For the final urgent alert the balloons were hauled down and the siren wailed steadily. The only casualties were people who got sick and tired of running off into the fields every day, and stayed and took their chances.",
