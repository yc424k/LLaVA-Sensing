It never worked, but then it was no less successful than my own approach, which involved asking the least attractive girl in the room if I could buy her a drink and being told to fuck off. So instead we spent the nights getting ourselves into a state of what we called ACD ? advanced cognitive dysfunction. One night we fell in with some puzzled-looking Africans whom Katz encouraged to foment rebellion in their homeland. He got so drunk that he gave them his watch (he seemed to think that punctual timekeeping would make all the difference in the revolution), a Bulova that had belonged to his grandfather and was worth a fortune, and for the rest of the summer whenever I forgot and asked him the time he would reply sourly, ‘I don’t know. I have a man in Zululand who looks after these things for me.’ At the end of the week we discovered we had spent exactly half our funds of $700 each and concluded that it was time to move on.",

A pop-up shop around the corner is selling the hotel’s coveted Champagne Truffle Snow-Skin Mooncakes, for Mid-Autumn Festival, as famous as the Christmas carolers who gather around the tree in the lobby in December. A temporary gift-shop down the road is ensuring that visitors can return to their other homes, in Bristol or Fukuoka, with Raffles-encrusted tea towels and sugar bowls. Members of the Raffles staff have been showing me photos of the twenty-second-century spaces that are being built only metres away to give the hotel a new dynamism and brightness. Any legend that’s been around for one hundred and thirty-two years knows: it can honour the past only by changing with the times.",

It was like those funny old portraits in the picture-restorers’ windows, with a veil of age and dust removed from one half to show the real surface underneath. Lita’s entrance did not make him look either younger or happier; it simply removed from his face the soul-disguising veil which life interposes between a man’s daily world and himself. He looked stripped—exposed . . . exposed . . . that was it. Nona glanced at Lita, not to surprise her off her guard, but simply to look away from her father.",

In his development of this museum – its exhibits change annually – the Curator looks to Michel Foucault as one of his main guides. I found him the most exciting and encouraging thinker I had met in Jerusalem. Although free of false optimism, he gives one the courage to believe that both sides could eventually ‘foster values of mutual respect’. He believes it is not too late to ‘take the first steps of this long journey that should have started long ago’. All concerned must search, he believes, for ‘an equality of thought that enables opposites to exist side by side’. In his introduction to the catalogue he explains, ‘The works I chose for this exhibition … aspire to move the spectators’ hearts and raise their consciousness with the use of realism rather than abstract qualities.’",

The \"station\" consists of a wool shed, a low grass hut, a hut with one side gone, a bell-tent, and the more substantial cabin in which we are lodged. Several saddled horses were tethered outside, and some natives were shearing sheep, but the fog shut out whatever else there might be of an outer world. Every now and then a native came in and sat on the floor to warm himself, but there were no mats as in native houses. It was intolerably cold. I singed my clothes by sitting in the chimney, but could not warm myself. A fowl was stewed native fashion, and some rice was boiled, and we had sheep's milk and some ice cold water, the drip, I think, from a neighbouring cave, as running and standing water are unknown.",

The last room along from us had not only left the doors open, they had draped clothes all over the deck to dry. The animal snatched and sniffed the clothes and tossed them over the wall. I shouted, but we were far too far away to do anything – it was quite a long uphill hike from our room. Presumably there was nobody there otherwise they’d have been dealing with the situation, so even if we went there we wouldn’t be able to get in. The adventurous baboon was joined by a companion and they disappeared into the interior. Heaven knows what they were getting up to. (We found out later – the room was totally trashed.)",

The snow had filtered into the vestibules and covered the door with a slippery coating. It was intriguing this cold, it crept in everywhere. Her breath was quite visible and she blew into the air with a naïve enjoyment. Seated in the diner she stared out the window at white hills and valleys and scattered pines whose every branch was a green platter for a cold feast of snow. Sometimes a solitary farmhouse would fly by, ugly and bleak and lone on the white waste; and with each one she had an instant of chill compassion for the souls shut in there waiting for spring.",

Most of the teachers had a meticulous pronunciation. Il professore would prove a challenge. I remember a class early on, in which a few minutes remained until the end of the hour. Il professore gave what sounded like an expansive closing statement and then started to read the newspaper. I began gathering my things and had my coat on before I looked around and realized everyone was still sitting there silently in place, presumably waiting for the next pearl. They watched me put my coat on and stand up and still no one made a move. I said something like, “I’ve got a train to catch—until next time,” as I walked away, wondering how long they all sat there looking straight ahead, watching him read the newspaper.",

They were all gratified by this praise of their native county; and Mary now had the pleasure of hearing these short questions and answers lose their undertone of suspicious inspection, so far as her brothers were concerned, and develop into a genuine conversation about the habits of birds which afterwards turned to a discussion as to the habits of solicitors, in which it was scarcely necessary for her to take part. She was pleased to see that her brothers liked Ralph, to the extent, that is, of wishing to secure his good opinion. Whether or not he liked them it was impossible to tell from his kind but experienced manner. Now and then she fed the fire with a fresh log, and as the room filled with the fine, dry heat of burning wood, they all, with the exception of Elizabeth, who was outside the range of the fire, felt less and less anxious about the effect they were making, and more and more inclined for sleep. At this moment a vehement scratching was heard on the door.",

    "target_paragraph": "For Germán, this deep association with the Magdalena was not a matter of sentiment or nostalgia, and he certainly did not intend his reflections to be taken by his paisanos as flattery. He saw the Río Magdalena as having a deeply ambivalent nature, as if a sentient being capable of embodying duality and living with contradictions, much as the nation itself does. It creates its own universe of extremes. For half the year, it runs in flood, feeding the wetlands. In the dry season it shrivels, as sandbars become exposed, riverboats run aground, and only water flowing in from the ciénagas keeps the river moving to the sea. For much of Colombia’s history, the Magdalena has served as the nation’s graveyard, carrying the unknown dead, faceless corpses floating downstream, with vultures perched aloft feeding on the decaying flesh. But it has also been a river of hope, a source of food and fresh water, a muse of poets, the inspiration for song.",

The truth was that a certain shyness of revealing his conduct prevented Michael Henchard from following up the investigation with the loud hue-and-cry such a pursuit demanded to render it effectual; and it was probably for this reason that he obtained no clue, though everything was done by him that did not involve an explanation of the circumstances under which he had lost her.",

During the night, I had somehow made a decision: If Lindbergh had landed in France, it followed with logical progression—the same clear logic that I knew existed in crystallography—that I was as free as he was, and therefore that I could quit my job. Of course, if he hadn't made it I would have to stay. Fair was fair.",

We approached it from the north, on which side a long low building runs out towards the sandy depression of the Wadi Lebai’ah (Fig. 77). A zaptieth caught me up as I reached the first of the vaulted rooms, and out of the northern gateway a man in long robes of white and black came trailing down towards us through the hot silence.",

He brazened it out on the strength of his reputation with very fair success. His hearers thought him very capable of such an act. They were disposed to believe his flattering tale. There is no credulity so eager and blind as the credulity of covetousness, which, in its universal extent, measures the moral misery and the intellectual destitution of mankind. Ah! he had confessed everything, this fractious Jew, this bribon. Good! Then he was no longer wanted. A sudden dense guffaw was heard from the senior captain—a big-headed man, with little round eyes and monstrously fat cheeks which never moved. The old major, tall and fantastically ragged like a scarecrow, walked round the body of the late Señor Hirsch, muttering to himself with ineffable complacency that like this there was no need to guard against any future treacheries of that scoundrel. The others stared, shifting from foot to foot, and whispering short remarks to each other.",
