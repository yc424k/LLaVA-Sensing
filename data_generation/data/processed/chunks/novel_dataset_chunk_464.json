She had seen mountains in the East, and she knew enough about the difficulties of driving cars along hilly roads to be somewhat apprehensive. Hitherto, the Model T had behaved beautifully, she admitted, but we would shortly have to cross a high range between Colorado and New Mexico, where the air would be thinner than the car was accustomed to breathing. The engine would get overheated. We must change the mixture, look to our brakes, and have a general overhaul before we tried the pass. All this was duly carried out in a town in the foothills, where Jane and a garage mechanic went into serious conference while I stared, rapt and foolish and useless, at the heaped-up landscape ahead. Eventually, Jane broke into my trance and sent me shopping for canvas buckets. \"Extra water to take along,\" she explained.",

At last, I walked over to the other side of the house and found a group of women —Abanzima, Sissy, and a couple of friends—gathered around Nambedru, who was crouching on a stool and sniffling.

Here the ladies and gentlemen had the same kind of way with them. She glanced approvingly into the shops as she passed. And General Arbuthnot, who used to visit the Master, lived in Ebury Street she reflected as she turned into that gloomy thoroughfare. He was dead now; Louisa had shown her the notice in the papers. But when he was alive, he had lived here. She had reached Mr Martin’s lodgings. She paused on the steps and adjusted her bonnet. She always had a word with Martin when she came to fetch his socks; it was one of her pleasures; and she enjoyed a gossip with Mrs Briggs, his landlady. Today she would have the pleasure of telling her of the death of Rover. Sidling cautiously down the area steps which were slippery with sleet she stood at the back door and rang the bell.",

In the rambling Lake View Hotel my £2 room had a bath – alas! sans water. This welcoming Muslim establishment was teetotal, a snag dealt with by giving one of the staff 2,000 shillings and telling him that if he brought me two beers (costing 1,000 shillings) I wouldn’t expect any change. In the humid restaurant I supped off more soggy rice and an extraordinarily nasty fish stew. Then I fell into bed and had an unique experience.",

He looked around in near darkness and found a toboggan trail. He camped, and next day followed the trail to a cabin—under smoke. He shouted toward it.

Florence is redeemed and magnificent on a cold December morning. As in all the towns, the decorations are sweet—lights strung across the narrow streets at short intervals, necklaces of light with dangling pendants. Obviously the women of this city have not heard of cruelty to wildlife; I never have seen so many long, lavish fur coats. We look in vain for fake fur. The men are dressed in fine wool overcoats and elegant scarves. Gilli, one of my favorite bars, is crowded with noisy voices and clinks of cups and constant rushes of steam from the espresso machine. In the middle of the street, Ed pauses and holds up his hands. “Listen!”",

The pickup spat and sputtered. It was just a year old and in powerful shape, but had been idle all through the winter. He reasoned that its engine was full of carbon, so he went into the hills burning it out with speed. He was found two hours later. The truck had rolled three times. He had broken all his left ribs and both legs. The right leg was not so much broken as shattered. Pieces of the bone were never found. Eagle’s satellite radio called for help. Thirteen hours after the accident, Dungan reached the hospital in Fairbanks, two hundred miles away. In the years since, he has been given skin grafts, bone grafts, a steel plate, and seven pins that look like wood screws. “They said I didn’t have much chance of keeping my leg after the bone graft and the plate, but I fooled ’em. I still have the leg.” The plate is to come out when the bone graft is solid, but the plan is not working well, because a hole will not close in the leg above the plate. “Sometime next winter, I should be working. After the cast comes off, I can walk with a shoepac and a cane. I’ll be off these crutches soon. I won’t be wearing them forever.”",

At the moment there is heavy traffic on this route because Afghanistan and Pakistan are not on speaking terms and their frontier is closed, so that many of the goods which would normally be imported via Karachi and the Khyber Pass are coming from Russia via Mazar-i-Sharif. But this track was never meant to be a grand trunk road and the sight of grossly overloaded and mainly ‘home-made’ trucks negotiating these fantastic hairpin bends, with inches between the outer wheels and a 1,000-foot drop, made me sweat with vicarious terror – and thank God that it was only vicarious as I pushed Roz up, keeping close to the cliffside. In fact, the climb wasn’t as stiff as I had anticipated, because the foot of the pass is itself about 7,000 feet above sea level; yet over the last thousand feet I did notice the effects of the altitude – shortness of breath and aching calf-muscles. But it was worth it all to rise gradually from that fertile, warm valley to the still, cold splendour of the snow-line, where the highest peaks of the Hindu Kush crowd the horizon in every direction and one begins to understand why some people believe that gods live on mountain tops.",

The torrent does not burst noisily from the mountain side; it is born in a deep still pool that lies, swathed in a robe of maidenhair fern, in thickets “annihilating all that’s made to a green thought in a green shade.” From the pool issues a translucent river, unbroken of surface, narrow and profound; it runs into swirls and eddies and then into foaming cataracts and waterfalls that toss their white spray into the branches of mulberry and plane. Under the trees stand eleven water-mills; the ragged millers are the only inhabitants of Apollo’s shrine. They brought us walnuts to eat by the edge of the stream, and small antique gems that had dropped from the ornaments of those who sought pleasures less innocent perhaps than ours by the banks of that same torrent.",

It seemed that everyone but me had staked out a place to sleep, and most were already lying on overlapping woven mats or flattened cardboard boxes so that the decks were a human carpet. I’d been told that you never step over a prostrate Micronesian, so how could I walk around the ship without stepping over bodies?

As she opened her eyes they rested on the picture that hung above the bed. It was a large engraving with a dazzling white margin enclosed in a wide frame of bird’s-eye maple with an inner scroll of gold. The engraving represented a young man in a boat on a lake overhung with trees. He was leaning over to gather water-lilies for the girl in a light dress who lay among the cushions in the stern. The scene was full of a drowsy midsummer radiance, and Charity averted her eyes from it and, rising from her chair, began to wander restlessly about the room.",

Instead, he jerked his head sideways to Eliza, and said with a soft, scornful laugh: ‘By God, mamma, I don’t see why you have to take them in. You’ve got enough of them in the family already.’",

He still found the phrase “world peace” hilariously inane. I was more earnest. In high school I had marched against the Vietnam War, fervently believing it must be stopped. I had been raised on coffeehouse protest music—Joan Baez, Phil Ochs—and it still had a secret place in my heart. Bryan loathed such stuff and all the sentimental, suburban self-congratulation it represented.
