She had dragged her dress up about her shoulders, revealing her startling white bathing suit between her knickers and the satin band binding her breasts. “On my back,” she moaned, bending forward again, “quick! Quick!”",

The sun dappled the table and gave her a curious look of transparency, as if she were caught in a net of light; as if she were composed of lozenges of floating colours. Martin half thought that he knew her; he half raised his hat. But she sat there looking in front of her; sipping her ice. No, he thought; he did not know her, and he stopped for a moment to light his pipe. What would the world be, he said to himself – he was still thinking of the fat man brandishing his arm – without ‘I’in it? He lit the match. He looked at the flame that had become almost invisible in the sun. He stood for a second drawing at his pipe. Sara had walked on. She too was netted with floating lights from between the leaves. A primal innocence seemed to brood over the scene. The birds made a fitful sweet chirping in the branches; the roar of London encircled the open space in a ring of distant but complete sound. The pink and white chestnut blossoms rode up and down as the branches moved in the breeze. The sun dappling the leaves gave everything a curious look of insubstantiality as if it were broken into separate points of light. He too, himself, seemed dispersed. His mind for a moment was a blank. Then he roused himself, threw away his match, and caught up Sally.",

Foreigners had a knack of coming to the island and mysteriously vanishing again; it was quite the regular thing to run up accounts all around and then clear out. Hotel-keepers, aware of this idiosyncrasy on the part of distinguished guests, arranged their scale of charges accordingly; they made the prices so high that the honest paid for the dishonest, as with English tailors. The other tradespeople of the place—the smiling confectioner, the simple-minded bootmaker and good-natured stationer, the ever-polite hosier—they all worked on the same principle. They recouped themselves by fleecing the more ingenuous of their clients.",

So she loves the Cocumella—whoopee! Sometimes I think she ought to act more sophisticated (in order to support my apparent breezy acceptance of luxury, my act), but Italians love her enthusiasm—allegra, vivace—they ravish her with their eyes and ply her with the Cocumella drink: Aperol and vodka and champagne. She walks like a princess through the reception rooms that unfold in an enfilade. This space calls for leisured dignity; Anna understands space. The floors of the arched hallways are red-tiled; along the halls are hydrangeas in alabaster vases resting on Nello's father's furniture, and carved wooden saints from the Cocumella's convent days. Our sleep will be made in two brass double beds, under oiled wooden rafters, creamy crocheted curtains stirring at our windows. . . . And after eating two fat veal chops grilled with basil butter at the pool, Anna takes it into her head to swim, but there are no lights on near the pool, the sun has set, and Anna, her sensibilities excited by the glamour and the goodness of this honeyed day, says: “What if there are monsters?,” which question Aldo, the headwaiter, takes seriously, whereupon Anna sees its foolishness.",

Seen and being seen was the order of the day, from the very young, proud to be walking with their parents, to the not so young, proud to still be participating in this longstanding social tradition. I once accompanied an older friend buying new glasses, and somewhat surprisingly for me, listened to her tell the optometrist that her main concern was being able to distinguish friends and acquaintances during the passeggiata (promenade).",

    "target_paragraph": "The islanders’ passion for their country turns the island itself into the heroine of most of their songs: ‘Crete, my beautiful island, crown of the Levant,’ runs one of the couplets they often sing, ‘your earth is silver and your rocks are diamonds.’ This is more than a flowery trope: the metamorphic limestone mass, especially where it soars above the tree-line in a wilderness where nothing can grow, does shine like silver and lend to the great peaks, even in August, an illusion of eternal snow; and the sharp-edged and many-faceted rocks throw back the light with a dazzling and adamantine flash. In ravines and hollows at midday, when the sun has drained every shadow, a hint of fear is present. There are no trees for the cicadas, no goat bells to be heard across the stagnant air; the far-off ricochets of an invisible shepherd practising against a boulder, stop. Sound expires with a gasp; the only hint of life is a horned skeleton lying among the rocks, as though an ogre lived not far off. The world becomes a hushed and blinding wilderness. Colour ebbs from the sky; the hot mineral shudders; all is haggard and aghast. It is the hour of meridian fright and an invisible finger runs up the nape of the lonely traveller there and sets his hair on end. At moments like these the island stands in the sea like an anvil for the inaudible strokes of the sun.",

    "target_paragraph": "‘Who dares to say I am drunk?’ roared Frangos for perhaps the ninth time, blowing with the same breath a squeak or two from his handsome brass flute. More guffaws. He then began a splendid tirade, couched in the wildest argot, against the damned English and those who endured them with such patience. The policemen began to look more alert at this, and Clito explained hastily: ‘When he goes too far … pouf! they cut him off and take him away.’ With his two fingers he edited a strip of cinema film. But Frangos seemed to me a formidable person to cut off in this fashion. He had shoulders like an ox. One of the policemen patted him awkwardly and was shaken off like a fly. ‘Why,’ bellowed Frangos, ‘do you tell me to shut up when I am saying what everyone knows?’ He gave a toot on his instrument and followed it up with a belch like a slammed door. ‘As for the English I am not afraid of them – let them put me in irons.’ He joined a pair of huge fists dramatically. A couple of timid English spinsters peered nervously into the tavern as they passed. ‘Let them fire on me.’ He tore open his shirt and exposed an expanse of breast-bone curly with dense black hair with a gold cross nestling in it. He waited for a full half-second for the English to fire. They did nothing. He leaned against the bar once more, making it creak, and growled on, lashing his tail. Renos, the little boot-black sitting next to me, was shaken by giggles; but lest I might find this impolite he explained breathlessly between sobs: ‘He doesn’t really mean it, sir, he doesn’t.’",

With the dark-green curtain covering her, Mari watched them intently. “This one doesn’t smile for anyone,” she whispered, tilting her head toward one of the girls who seemed to be struggling to remember her steps. Music flowed through scratchy speakers that dulled the notes but not the girls’ nervous energy. One performance after another, Mari narrated a brief history of the music, then retreated into silence. When the most experienced girls performed “Amor Gitano,” she sighed. “I love this one. For me this is the true classic of Spanish dance.” The young women swirled and strutted to the exotic music with staccato heel strikes that Mari followed intently. Her eyes focused on one dancer in particular, a slender young woman with reddish-blond hair, glistening red lips, and dark eyebrows that flared across her broad, unlined forehead. She danced with precision and a sharp-edged dignity that suggested the María del Carmen of forty years ago, when she was a young woman immersed in the sounds and sensual movements of Spanish dance. Mari stared as if she were watching herself performing onstage back when she had dreams, when her hopes and visions for the future had not yet been blocked by obstacles that were impossible for her to overcome without denying her true self.",

A Chinese with gel-spiked hair, a black muscle shirt made of netting, and silver hoop earrings flung open the door and threw his arms around me. I peeked over his shoulder and marveled. The apartment walls were painted hot pink and decorated with black-and-white photos of girls kissing girls and boys kissing boys. Pink triangles fashioned out of pipe cleaners hung from the light fixtures; a rainbow flag covered the back wall. Several dozen Chinese in hip-hop gear danced a lambada around the hostess, a Western diva draped in turquoise velvet who wore horned-rimmed glasses.",

Yet there are any number of virgins who love children walking the world today, some of whom look a little like you, probably, and a modest number of which I allow myself to believe, without conceit, that I could marry. And yet.……” He struck another match to his pipe, but he let it go out again and sat forward in his chair, the pipe held loosely in his joined hands. “That may be the secret, after all. Not any subconscious striving after what we believe will be happiness, contentment; but a sort of gadfly urge after the petty, ignoble impulses which man has tried so vainly to conjure with words out of himself. Nature, perhaps, watching him as he tries to wean himself away from the rank and richly foul old mire that spawned him, biding her time and flouting that illusion of purifaction which he has foisted upon himself and calls his soul. But it’s something there, something you—you—” He brooded upon the fire, holding his cold pipe.

From that time onward his conduct changed. He grew restless and desirous of converting the heathen. He set sail for Lybia, suffered shipwreck in the Greater Syrtis, and narrowly escaped with his life. Thence he passed onward, preaching to black nations as he moved along, and converting tribes innumerable. For three-and-thirty years he wandered till, one evening, he saw the moon rise on the right side of his face.",

I walked as far as the Villa Geno, on a promontory at a bend in the lake, and strolled back round to the opposite bank to the small lakeside park with its museum, built in the likeness of a temple, in commemoration of Allesandro Volta, who lived in Como from 1745 to 1827, and there I lolled some more. I walked back to the hotel through empty streets, browsing in shop windows, and thinking how very lucky the Italians are not to have Boots and Dixons and Rumbelows filling their shopping streets with tat and glare, and retired to bed a happy man.",

Nobody knows Zeena’s thoughts. Anyhow, when she heard o’ the accident she came right in and stayed with Ethan over to the minister’s, where they’d carried him.

Am I not, as I walk, trembling with strange oscillations and vibrations of sympathy, which, unmoored as I am from a private being, bid me embrace these engrossed flocks; these starers and trippers; these errand-boys and furtive and fugitive girls who, ignoring their doom, look in at shop-windows?

A fitting tribute to the man who wrote: “Poems are made by fools like me, / But only God can make a tree.”",

But March often brings the year’s coldest snap; winter still has the reins. Only in late April, as southern climates watch for crocuses, do we see the beginning of the end of ice. Alaska’s fifth season, squeezed between winter and spring, is “breakup.” Breakup of rivers as shed-size chunks of ice give way; breakup of frozen driveways and roads, thaw triggering spring’s buckle and heave so the same potholes open up and gravel roads ripple with washboard; breakup of overflow, the layers of water and ice that percolate frozen-solid creeks and rivers; breakup of snow pack in the tundra lowlands, exposing winter-kill and last year’s cranberries. It’s fitting that breakup’s label alludes to the end of romance: grim, gray, trudging. While it’s happening, it seems it will never pass. It always does.",

The complex in which the Renaissance health club sits is distilled essence of modern Japan. Until six years ago, it was just rolling hills, like the ones we can see in every direction. The trees blazed and reddened in November; sheep grazed—as they still do—in the grassy area above what is now a long, spooky flight of steps, across from the fresh shopping center that calls itself “Life.”",

The cloud had raced ahead, and this first swell seemed to travel upon a sea of lead. There was no life in that stir. It managed, though, to knock over something in my head. What would you have done? You are sure of yourself — aren’t you? What would you do if you felt now — this minute — the house here move, just move a little under your chair. Leap!

    "target_paragraph": "Stephen stayed with the Unit right up to the eve of its departure for Germany, then she left it, taking Mary Llewellyn with her. Their work was over; remained only the honour of joining the army’s triumphal progress, but Mary Llewellyn was completely worn out, and Stephen had no thought except for Mary.\nThey said farewell to Mrs. Claude Breakspeare, to Howard and Blakeney and the rest of their comrades. And Stephen knew, as indeed did they also, that a mighty event had slipped into the past, had gone from them into the realms of history—something terrible yet splendid, a oneness with life in its titanic struggle against death. Not a woman of them all but felt vaguely regretful in spite of the infinite blessing of peace, for none could know what the future might hold of trivial days filled with trivial actions. Great wars will be followed by great discontents—the pruning knife has been laid to the tree, and the urge to grow throbs through its mutilated branches.",

Soon it began to rain and, after that very hot morning, it became quite cold. It was still raining when Mr Butt returned. His fur cap was soaked into mean, glistening kinkiness; his jacket was dark with wet; his shoulders were hunched below the turned-up collar; his shirt-tail was dripping.

I was camped in the woods outside Cordova, Alaska, trying in vain to find work as a deckhand on a seine boat, biding my time until the Department of Fish and Game announced the first “opener”—the start of the commercial salmon season. One rainy afternoon while walking into town, I crossed paths with an unkempt, agitated man who appeared to be about forty. He wore a bushlike black beard and shoulder-length hair, which he kept out of his face with a headband made from a filthy nylon strap. He was walking toward me at a brisk clip, hunched beneath the considerable weight of a six-foot log balanced across one shoulder.",

We might have been walking through a Chinese scroll painting. The understorey of the forest was thickened with rhododendron, whose leaves shone bronze where the full light caught them. Up through the trees we went, crossing iced streams and passing through tunnels of leaning oaks, following a leaf-and-dirt path.

Stampede Road tees west off the highway toward the park on the skyline, turning from pavement to gravel to two-track to trail, finally passable only by mountain bike and ATV, or dog teams and snow-gos in winter. Out Stampede there are a few big houses, but most people live in modest homes and tiny cabins they’ve built out-of-pocket, a tarp-covered lumber pile far more common than a heated garage. Our first rental was particularly rustic—a sixteen-by-twenty log cabin with no running water—but by no means unusual. Septic systems and wells indicate longevity, money socked away or borrowed to get three hundred feet deep where the water table lies. The rest of us shit in outhouses and collect rainwater in fifty-gallon barrels and haul drinking water from the well house with five-gallon jugs or PVC tanks in the backs of pickups. Friends with showers offer them freely. At dry-cabin potlucks, people bring their own full water bottles so as not to burden the hosts with more hauling.",

The essential fact, the fact that would remain, the picture that would be most vivid, was that it was Jim’s game. No game that was ever played achieved a more classical and perfect unity for the projection of its great protagonist. It was even better that he scored just that one touchdown, made just that one run. If he had done more, it would have spoiled the unity and intensity of their later image. As it was, it was perfect. Their hero did precisely what they expected him to do. He did it in his own way, by the exercise of his own faultless and incomparable style, and later on that was all they could remember. The game became nothing. All they saw was Jim, pacing and weaving out around right end, his right hand pawing delicately at the air, the ball hollowed in the crook of his long left arm, and then cutting loose on his race-horse gallop.",

In build she was small and squat, but she had a magnificent nose and a proud chin which was covered in a shadow of sharp stubble. She spoke with a fearsome, piercing voice and was held in great respect by the other yoghurt-women. Under her direction these women were distributed around the corridors of Chini Bagh peddling their wares. We, however, were her exclusive property. She remained remarkably unmoved by my tirade, and set about explaining herself in a rattle of loud, guttural Turki. Madam Curd appeared to be a subscriber to the theory (often thought to be exclusively British) that to be understood by a foreigner she had merely to speak louder than he. Having tired of explaining she sidestepped into the room and wandered over to Louisa’s bed to inspect its contents. Louisa was still asleep and only a few strands of her blond hair could be seen above the quilt. At these Madam Curd tugged with a surprising forcefulness. Louisa emerged from beneath her bed clothes like a snail from its shell. Slightly less than half awake, she stared at Madam Curd with a mixture of fury and bemusement. Madam Curd stared adoringly back. She lifted her hand and began running her fingers through Louisa’s locks. She beamed. She had never seen blond hair before.",

I explained that we were looking for Ramses Station, and Teresa offered the map to her, just in case. The woman smiled and pulled a pair of reading glasses from her bag. She paused to think, and said “End of street.” Her English was stilted like she knew the words but hadn’t used them in a very long time. She was right, though. The road ended in a jungle of highway ramps and bridges, and on the far side of that mess stood Ramses Station. A pedestrian bridge carried us over the traffic. Trash covered the stairs, and wide cracks in the concrete revealed the streets below. Twisted and rusted rebar jutted straight up and threatened tetanus with every step. The bridge lifted us high over the city and we could see for blocks in every direction. Dozens of white microbuses filled the adjacent parking lots and curbs. Grocers stacked coolers and crates in front of their shops. I stopped to photograph the scene, but Teresa told me to hurry.",
