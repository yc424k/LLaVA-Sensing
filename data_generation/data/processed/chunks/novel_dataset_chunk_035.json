Ardita scarcely touched her food as she watched his dark young face—handome, ironic faintly ineffectual.",

Here the experienced guide quickly found another flight of stairs that led up to an upper deck, and now again they stepped out upon another tremendous promenade, a promenade even more astounding in its atmosphere of space, of width, of vista, and of luxury than the one below. This promenade was glass-enclosed, which added to the impression of its wealth. More people were to be seen here, pacing, the white shirt-fronts and evening black of men, the pearl-hued nakedness of women’s shoulders. And yet there were not many people—a few couples making the great promenade around the deck, a few more stretched out in their steamer chairs. Broad windows flanked beside, and through these windows one could see the interiors of tremendous rooms—great lounges and salons, and cafés as large as those one would see in a great hotel, as solid-seeming also, as luxurious. Plemmons led the way quickly and confidently back along this deck in the direction of the stern, and finding here another flight of stairs, he mounted swiftly, and presently led the way around into a small verandah-like café, covered on top but open at the end, so that one had a clear view backward out across the broad wake of the ship. Here they seated themselves at a table and ordered a drink.",

So OK, I thought, they’re teenagers, so what? It’s just that the pure-white adults have more macho things to do, I expect, like hunt polar-bears.",

    "target_paragraph": "I could handle the fact that our room was on the fifth floor and the elevators never worked. I could live with the chronic lightbulb shortage that left the stairwells and hallways pitch black after sunset. I didn’t mind that our wallpaper peeled off in strips, or that our curtain covered only a fourth of the window and our room faced dead east, or that our room was infested with flies. One might assume insects die in Russia’s harsh winters, but they actually just migrate into student dormitories. They hovered over our heads as we brushed our teeth. They circled our skillets when we made spaghetti. They crawled up our noses as we slept. I was once the kind of person who carefully scooped up insects that strayed indoors and carried them outside to the bushes. But within a week of those flies, I joined my roommates’ declaration of war. Our first line of defense was a gooey roll of flypaper, which we attempted to suspend from a light fixture with an upside-down hanger. We ran into it more than the flies, however, so we soon made a nightly ritual of shutting the door, closing the window, rolling up some Pravda, and going on a killing spree. We became so adept, we sometimes murdered two with one blow.",

    "target_paragraph": "CHAPTER LXXII\nIndia, 2011\nIN THE LATE AFTERNOON back at my bungalow I drag a blanket outside and lie in a circle of sun on the patio. The heat of the day warms me—just as the night chills me. The warmth soothes my head and my chest, and I imagine that I am getting well. Butterflies flit from hibiscus to bougainvillea. I am content in this patch of sun. The jungle is just beyond with its alarm calls, but no tigers. Where are the tigers? What if I don’t see a tiger? After coming this far. How could I possibly not see one? If Ajay is the best guide in India and he can’t find one, then how could I hope to? How disappointed will I be? What if I fail? And in this kind of quest can there be such a thing as failure?\nI don’t know. I’m not sure. Still lying there in the warmth, I experienced something that I’ve felt only a few times in my life. Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar, or gazing at the Black Sea. On a train traversing Siberia. In the water with dolphins swimming around me. In a man’s arms. Nursing my daughter at my breast. It is the feeling that I want to stay here forever. I never want to leave. I want to hold on to this moment and never let it go. I want time to stop.\nBut that’s the thing about travel. The point isn’t to stay in one place. It is to move on. It is about seizing the moment, the hour, the day, with the understanding that it isn’t forever. We have to move on. In the Sicilian language there is no future tense. You don’t say, “I’ll go to the beach tomorrow.” You say, “I go to the beach tomorrow.” The Sicilians understand the importance of staying in the present. It is what the traveler must learn as well.\nAll these thoughts jumble in my brain as I lie like a lizard, warming myself. I am in the middle of India in a place that my internist considered with dismay. The heat enters my bones and I believe, incorrectly, that it will heal me just as the fresh air of spring once helped heal my broken ankle. But more than anything it seems as if I have traveled halfway around the world just so I could sit alone in a warm circle of light on a patio in a jungle where wild beasts roam.\nThat night a fire burns in the fire pit in the center of the encampment. Two men sit near the fire and I come and sit not far from them. One is a very old man who is scantily clad and keeps a walking stick at his side. He nods at me as he hums softly to himself. The other I recognize as a worker at the hotel. I know we have no common language, yet we sit together, eyes on the flames. My face and hands are hot. My back is cold. Still, the fire feels good and I am happy for the company—even in the silence. I stay for a while, until the flames subside, and then head back to my bungalow.\nOnce again I am cold and tired, so I crawl into bed. I’ve left the windows open. There’s no point in closing them. It’s just as cold inside as out. I think I’ll drift off to sleep but instead I lie there. I listen to the jungle sounds. A strange, guttural chatter, the calls of birds, a monkey’s shriek in the night.",

In the autumn, too, it was said to be a fine place for watching the aurora borealis, which shimmered like aerial phosphorescence, green and red. But I was most drawn to Hope in its winter moods. For several years I had wanted to climb it when snow was on the ground, and spend a cold night on its summit: the sense of polar space opening out beyond me, the scents of berg and frazil washing down off the invisible Arctic Ocean.",

From all these riverside towns, and from the interior of the southern provinces, thousands migrate to work in Thailand – including children as young as eight, many of whom (both boys and girls) end up in Bangkok’s ‘specialist’ brothels. One youth asked, ‘Is Ireland civilized same like Hong Kong?’ At this stage the answer, unfortunately, is ‘Almost …’ As we talked by the river – a bicycle or Honda passing now and then – we could see a stream of fast cars flowing along the far embankment and my young friends eyed them enviously. A cool breeze blew, wrinkling the Mekong, and under a nearby tree small boys were using catapults to knock off those furry pods – precious pods, and hard won, yet the smallest boy spontaneously ran over to present me with one. Tha Khaek is like that.",

So when he realised that the very circumstances which had made him vice president of a bank had been born of the fact that the bank had been looted by an oaf with no more courage or imagination than he knew his cousin Byron to possess, his decision to remove his money from it as soon as he could was no more irrational than the traveller who, unsaddling in the inn yard, sees a naked body with its throat cut being flung from an upstairs window and recinches his saddle with no loss of time and remounts and rides on again, to find another inn perhaps or if not, to pass the night in the woods, which after all, Indians and bears and highwaymen to the contrary, would not be a great deal more unsafe.",

Some 4 million people in Britain consider themselves to be hill-walkers of one stripe or another. Global sales of outdoor products and services are reckoned at $10 billion annually, and growing.",

The hotel was opposite a spanking new sports complex, which had been built to look vaguely like a hill: it had short-cropped grass growing up its sides. Quite what the idea of this was I couldn’t say, because the walls sloped so sharply that you couldn’t walk on the grass or sit on it, so it had no function. Its only real purpose was to enable the architect to say, ‘Look at this, everybody. I’ve designed a building with grass growing on it. Aren’t I something?’ This, as we shall see again, is the great failing of Paris architects.",

Sergei and Volodya knew that the cure for this was honey, combined with a thorough, pore-cleansing banya. On the road to Novosibirsk they had bought an amphora-sized glass jar of honey from a roadside seller. To loosen me up, they first struck me repeatedly with leafy, freshly cut birch branches. Then they laid on the honey in big handfuls all over my neck, back, and chest. This honey was not your store-bought pasteurized product; it still had bee legs and pieces of weed in it. I sat, honeyed and steaming, for some time. Then I was instructed to dive into a pool of icy-cold water in the anteroom, and I did, leaving a honey slick on the surface. Then I exited the banya chamber, showered, and drank mineral water in the return-to-normal room.",

At one end of a row, on a slightly raised chair, sat the young head of the monastery. Around him, tired, dusty, shaking monks, not reading their sutras from books, as is usual in Tibetan monasteries, but reciting them by heart. Eyes closed, bodies rocking back and forth on their cushions, the whole room seeming to shake and tremble with its collective, ragged chant.",

He ascertained afterwards that he had shot him through the mouth, a little upwards, the bullet coming out high at the back of the skull. With the impetus of his rush the man drove straight on, his face suddenly gaping disfigured, with his hands open before him gropingly, as though blinded, and landed with terrific violence on his forehead, just short of Jim’s bare toes. Jim says he didn’t lose the smallest detail of all this. He found himself calm, appeased, without rancour, without uneasiness, as if the death of that man had atoned for everything. The place was getting very full of sooty smoke from the torch, in which the unswaying flame burned blood-red without a flicker. He walked in resolutely, striding over the dead body, and covered with his revolver another naked figure outlined vaguely at the other end. As he was about to pull the trigger, the man threw away with force a short heavy spear, and squatted submissively on his hams, his back to the wall and his clasped hands between his legs. “You want your life?” Jim said. The other made no sound. “How many more of you?” asked Jim again. “Two more, Tuan,” said the man very softly, looking with big fascinated eyes into the muzzle of the revolver. Accordingly, two more crawled from under the mats, holding out ostentatiously their empty hands.’",

So Great Britain (as we used to call it) must once have been a hot desert? And how it made no sense? So any schoolmaster, every geography schoolmaster might and should have had the simple idea: Great Britain has moved. But they didn’t of course—but imagine! As you’d say—if they had: wouldn’t that have made boring old geology interesting? OK, so it wasn’t that boring, because it gave us time—thousands of millions of years. But imagine! If only it had also given us movement in geographical space! Then it would have been exciting, and made sense, and Ernst Mayr’s so right: even to understand the emergence, the diversity of life, you need geographical change, spatial change, don’t you? Because the Old Red Sandstone—that was laid down when England was where the Sahara is now!”",

They crept against the tawny precipices, clinging to their pinnacles like shreds of pallid gauze, and nestling demurely among dank clefts where something of the mystery of night still lingered. It was a procession of dainty shapes wreathing themselves into gracious attitudes; mounting—ever mounting. As he beheld their filmy draperies that swayed phantom-like among the crags overhead, he understood those pagan minds of olden days for whom such wavering exhalations were none other than sea-nymphs, Atlantides, offspring of some mild-eyed god of Ocean rising to greet their playfellows, the Oreads, on the hills.",

Aromatic smoke came from the ashes of a fire, and beside it a man in a long black gown and wide hat stood silently, as in trance, holding a wand. It was like a macabre dream, on that sunny morning, and it was partly because I did not wish to intrude, but partly because I was slightly shaken, that I hurried shamefaced by towards my fried garupa with egg plant (the Lamma fish restaurants are among the best in Hong Kong).",

    "target_paragraph": "But Hinduism’s inclusiveness and its respect for all religions are at risk from extremists. The next day on my morning walk I meet a young disciple of the VHP—the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. This is the World Hindu Council, a body of fundamentalist-leaning Hindus closely aligned to the BJP, which currently dominates India’s ruling coalition. This young VHP soldier is keen for me to see his organization’s showroom. Inside a tent patrolled by armed guards is a model of a mandir, or temple, the VHP wants built on the ruins of the mosque at Ayodhya. The group claims the site is the birthplace of Rama and is unapologetic about its role in the mosque’s destruction. The mandir model looks like a cross between the Vatican and a Disneyland castle. Its construction would be uglier—undermining India’s secular constitution and defying Hinduism’s basic belief that any path to God is divine. Until now the mosque’s destruction could be dismissed as a mindless act by a mob of minority extremists. But if a temple is constructed, the extremism would seem sanctioned by the government. Extreme Hinduism seems to be an oxymoron but in this country the nonsensical often triumphs.",

    "target_paragraph": "In thirty-five minutes from the camp we passed the mound of Balijah with Arab graves upon it; then for three hours we saw nothing of interest until we came to the mazar of Sultan ’Abdullah, a small modern shrine. Somewhere near it are the ruins of Jabariyeh, but they must lie closer to the mazar than Kiepert would have them. I rode on looking for them for half-an-hour, and when I questioned ’Affan he replied: “Jebariyeh? It is under the mazar. When you turned away I thought you did not wish to see those ruins.” It was too hot to go back. We were now opposite ?al’at Rafi?ah, a splendid pile upon the right bank of the Euphrates, and here we left the caravan with Murawwa? to guide it and followed the course of the river to ?al’at Bula?, which the Arabs call Retajah, an hour and a quarter’s ride in blazing sun. We found there a small square fort with round towers at the angles, the whole built of sun-dried brick. Though it is in complete ruin, I believe it to be modern, probably a Turkish ?ishla, but I saw some fragments of stone and mortar building which are, at any rate, older than the mud fort, and the site is so magnificent that it can scarcely have been neglected in ancient times. The hill on which the ruins stand is all but converted into an island by an abrupt turn of the river, which washes the precipitous rock on three sides. The current is gradually undermining the high seat of Retajah and the greater part of the older stone building has fallen into the stream. We had a hard gallop to catch up the caravan, and a long pull over rocky ground before we sighted the river again, flowing in wide and tranquil curves under the sunset. On either side the banks were lined with naouras, the Persian water-wheels. The quiet air was full of the rumble and grumble of them, a pleasant sound telling of green fields and clover pastures, but there were no villages or any other sign of man. As I looked, I knew that we had passed over an unseen frontier; whether the geographers admitted it or no, this was Babylonia.",

On the threshold his glance crossed that of the young man in an exchange of intelligence as full as it was rapid; and this brief scene left Anna so oddly enlightened that she felt no surprise when her companion, pushing an arm-chair forward, sociably asked her if she wouldn't have a cigarette.
