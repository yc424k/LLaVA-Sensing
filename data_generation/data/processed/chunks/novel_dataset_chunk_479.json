Said to be the oldest functioning public baths in Palestine, it has changed little (apart from electric lighting and invisible solar panels) since the Tuqan family built it in 1634. Its fort-like walls were only superficially damaged in 2002 when an Apache helicopter aimed three rockets at this cherished feature of Nablusi life. Yakob, the seventy-year-old in charge, had befriended me on my first visit. We had much in common, including an aversion to television with which As-Shifa’s soothing hush was now being threatened because of a discontented clientele. In an oddly named ‘summer room’ – a high, wide space with a stained glass dome – divans line the walls for post-bath cooling off and an ornate desk stands in one corner. Pointing to it, Yakob invited me to ‘write in peace’ any day of the week until men arrive. This I occasionally did, when my squat was extra-chilly. On the Sunday of my immobility it greatly cheered me when Yakob anxiously telephoned – ‘Why no washing? Are you OK?’",

He’d been traveling overland, alone, through deep snow and rough, boulder-strewn ground for seventeen consecutive hours, making nearly forty miles from Icy Spit. Along the way, he often thought of Captain Bartlett’s advice that no one travel alone in the Arctic, yet he’d done so out of necessity: alone, without dogs, and unarmed. Breddy had recently made a trip to Skeleton Island and discovered Mamen’s note describing the difficult times he and Templeman and Malloch had endured, that they planned on moving to Rodger’s Harbor, and the need for McKinlay to “get down to the coast as soon as you can.” Now, in the early morning hours of May 18, McKinlay crawled into the dilapidated igloo, its roof caved in, covering what contents remained with heavy blocks of snow. He wrestled free some buried skins, dusted them off, and lay them down on the snow. Kneeling, he picked a few frozen pieces of old biscuit from the snow and sucked on them like lozenges. Then he rolled onto his back and was almost instantly asleep.",

    "target_paragraph": "Last week it was revealed that President Mandela will be one of the three most highly paid Heads of State in the world, earning R734,350 per annum including expenses and allowances. All parliamentary salaries and allowances have been set, by the TEC-appointed Melamet Committee, at private-sector levels. This is rumoured to have been part of the ‘deal’ with the Nats. South Africa however is not a profit-making corporation run to benefit shareholders. Most of its citizens lucky enough to have jobs earn about R10,000 per annum while millions of jobless go permanently hungry. Nor is this a naturally rich country; the whites’ lifestyle gives a false impression. South Africa’s gold is dwindling fast and has always been harder to mine than other countries’ deposits. Its manufacturing industry has a poor reputation for both productivity and quality. Its black population rapidly increased during the period when modern farming methods were throwing thousands out of work. Much of the land is arid and becoming more so by the decade. In Cape Town I heard several veteran observers of the Struggle attributing its ‘happy ending’ – the much-admired negotiated revolution – to Nat shrewdness. When a country’s problems reach a critical mass, it makes sense to let someone else try to stop the explosion.",

I’d been spending some of my days off at his ranch, doing a little work around the place in return for room and board. (There’s a girl there, one of the paying guests.) I was sharing a bunkhouse room with Viviano one night when I heard the shuffling of feet, the sound of a mumbling voice. It was very late; Viviano was sound asleep. I got up and stepped outside and saw Roy walking by in his long underwear and boots, a revolver in his hand, talking to himself. What’s up? I asked him. Insomnia, he said. Try getting a little sleep. I tried, he said, and I can’t. What’s the gun for? Skunks, he said – they been at the chickens again. Well they’re no chickens here, I said. No but there’s skunks, and they’re living right under that room where you’re sleeping. And he walked away, unhappy and preoccupied.",

The only people visible were cheerfully chatting (in Bapedi) churchgoers, the women looking nurse-like in identical white uniforms and blue berets; each indigenous Church has its distinctive Sunday uniform. As no one spoke English I failed to find Lydenburg’s most cherished possession, the oldest extant school building in the Transvaal. (This failure was not too frustrating.) I did however pay my respects to an ancient – by South African standards – DRC church built in 1864 and now serving as a Voortrekker museum (closed on Sundays). On the earliest maps of the Transvaal only three towns are marked: Potchefstroom, Pretoria and Lydenburg, the last meaning ‘Place of Suffering’ – so named by a few grieving Voortrekkers who retreated to these heights from the lowveld after malaria had killed most of their companions and the tsetse fly most of their cattle. In the 1850s this dorp enjoyed a moment of glory as the capital of a short-lived independent Boer Republic. In the 1990s it is hopefully looking forward – so the hotel receptionist told me – to the expansion of South Africa’s tourist industry.",

    "target_paragraph": "It sometimes occurs to me that the British have more heritage than is good for them. In a country where there is so astonishingly much of everything, it is easy to look on it as a kind of inexhaustible resource. Consider the numbers: 445,000 ancient or historic buildings, 12,000 medieval churches, 1.5 million acres of common land, 120,000 miles of footpaths and public rights of way, 600,000 known sites of archaeological interest. In my Yorkshire village alone there are almost certainly more genuine seventeenth-century buildings than in the whole of North America, and that’s just one obscure hamlet with a population comfortably under 100. Multiply that by all the other villages and hamlets in Britain and you see that the stockpile of ancient dwellings, barns, churches, pinfolds, walls, bridges, and other structures is immense almost beyond counting. There is so much of it everywhere that it’s easy to believe that you can take away chunks of it—a half-timbered frontage here, some Georgian windows there, a few hundred yards of ancient hedge or drystone wall—and that there will still be plenty left. In fact, the country is being nibbled to death.",

Scaled up, the mechanical regularity of the speeding hook gained soul, its roaring, sparkling depths and vaulted ceiling like some kind of recurring miracle, the tracery on the surface and the ribbed power in the wall full of delicate, now visible detail, each wave suffused with the richness of a one-off. Sometimes the wind swung east, blowing into the hook and sending a hard chop up the face, particularly in the last hundred yards to the channel. When the wind blew south or southwest, it came around the west side of the island, making a mess of the waves as they approached us on the half-mile-long wrap from the southern edge of the reef. But then they cleaned up suddenly as they made the last turn into the lineup, and the slingshot aspect of the wave was doubled by a trailing wind that slipped under your board and whispered, Go.",

Behind the memorial, the tip of the Erasmusbrug, the great white bridge over the Maas, was just visible in the distance over cranes and the masts of old sailing barges. In front of the statue, three rows of chairs were filled with minor dignitaries, and a local TV news cameraman was enjoying shooting close-ups of a leggy blonde sitting among them. A smattering of proud military veterans wore ancient uniforms weighed down with medals and ribbons, together with perhaps a dozen serving soldiers and sailors in crisp jackets and caps. A brass band warmed up while a choir waited patiently nearby, three rows of grey-haired men in black suits and bow ties. The sunny, cheerful weather seemed slightly inappropriate for the occasion. ‘Dit is leuk!’ a woman standing next to me exclaimed loudly to her husband. ‘This is fun!’",

Unseen, it seemed to have become unbearably dirty. He desired something, vaguely—a newspaper, perhaps, but before striking a match he looked quickly over his shoulder. They were gone, hushing their chimed footsteps up the dark curve of the stair: their chimed tread was like a physical embrace. His match flared a puny fledged gold that followed his clasped gleaming stick as if it were a train of gun powder. But the passage was empty, swept with chill stone, imminent with weary moisture ... the match burned down to the even polished temper of his fingernails and plunged him back into darkness more intense.",

Everyone seemed content and happy to be back in the swing of normal life, and by Monday, driving Becky to the airport, Gary enthusiastically sought to persuade Becky to remain in Saudi. By the following Thursday, however, another major terrorist attack incurring deaths and injuries occurred. Gary held a town hall meeting to announce an Ordered Departure—immediate evacuation for all nonessential embassy personnel—on April 15, 2004. This status declares that you are ordered, not invited to leave. The State Department provides support systems to get you to a safe haven, and you may return only when they deem it safe. The result is that families are split up, everyone’s lives are interrupted, children are removed from school and inserted into another educational system midyear. Many of these folks were being evacuated for the third time in a short time period. Each time was disrupting, challenging and emotionally exhausting, because you would be leaving loved ones behind in circumstances that were less than predictable.",

Hungarians tend to use Budapest’s long wide straight streets as racing-tracks; seventy miles per hour is acceptable, which in a city indicates some sort of mass death-wish. Even the trams and trolley-buses compete at lethal speeds, swaying along as though drunk, while the metro elevators whizz up and down like something in a cartoon film. To the unnerved visitor, it seems that Budapest’s drivers display all the most unpleasant Hungarian qualities: aggression, ruthlessness, self-centredness. On my first day in the city, a young woman carrying a toddler was knocked down beside me when using a zebra crossing while the green light was on; a car swooped round the corner, ignoring the lights as too many Hungarian drivers do, and the victim had to be taken to hospital with a broken leg and a concussed child. The driver fled the scene but I was assured he would almost certainly be caught, through cooperation between public and police. My own leg might have been broken en route to Egressy ut. when a car parked by the pavement abruptly reversed with never a backward glance; I leaped to safety just in time.",

It was Raúl Castro’s last attempt to prolong the revolution that he and his brother had started more than sixty years earlier. Raúl had assembled the constitutional commission and put himself at its head. The draft proposals had been written, submitted to the National Assembly, and approved unanimously, in less than four months, another initiative accomplished in tiempo récord.

    "target_paragraph": "On smaller days, perseverance was usually rewarded. Bigger days were another matter. From the water’s edge, looking out across a stepladder of six or seven walls of cold, growling, onrushing whitewater, the idea of paddling out actually carried with it a whiff of lunacy. The project looked impossible, like trying to swim up a waterfall. It took a literal leap of faith to start. You threw yourself into the icy torrent and started plowing seaward. The waves as they approached sounded like bowling balls rumbling down a lane, and then like the crashing of pins as they slammed into and rolled over your bowed head and shoulders, inducing instant ice-cream headache. Long, strain-filled minutes passed. Little or no progress. The frisky, punishing waves came on and on. You tried to present the least possible resistance to the onrushing walls of whitewater, willing them past your body even as they snatched at you, sucking you backward. Breathing turned to gasping, then rasping, and your mind began to play ever-shorter loops, turning over the same half-nonsensical questions: Is perseverance rewarded? Is it even recorded? Meanwhile, underneath this aimless, half-hysterical activity, your brain struggled to detect the underlying patterns in the surf. Somewhere—upcoast, downcoast, or perhaps just beyond this next shallow spot—the waves might be weaker. Somewhere, the current must be running in a more helpful direction. The best available route would be obvious from almost any other vantage—from the embankment, or from that pelican’s airborne perspective—but from down in the maelstrom, where you sometimes spent more time underwater than out in the visible world, and often got just one foam-edged breath between waves, it merely danced cruelly in the imagination: the theoretical solution to an impossibly complex problem.",

His hatred of cruelty, the nauseating horror at the idiotic brutality of youth, had not yet sufficiently defined itself to check his plunge.

At that hour, there were no flights to contend with at the airport, and the traffic light at the end of the runway was green, so they proceeded into the main harbor. Le Grand Bleu was gone, and they wondered if she might have headed to Moorea. They made the turn to port and headed out of the pass with the wind 10-15 knots out of the north, which would give them a beam reach to Moorea. The seas had died down a little bit and were 6’-10’, but they were still really lumpy. Even with the full main and Genny up, motor sailing would be the order of the day. With the course and Monitor set, they settled in for the uncomfortable ride and watched as the sun lit up the peaks of Moorea.",

    "target_paragraph": "But that season gave me the chance to see my father skate. He came down to the rink when he could to watch our early Saturday practices, and once or twice stayed for the first public session of the day. I had seen his skates, rusted and neglected, in our garage forever. They were old-fashioned speed skates, with extraordinarily long blades, Hans Brinker gear. The Tarzana Ice Rink had nothing like them, certainly. Now he got them down and polished them up, and after my practice we took to the fresh ice together. He skated bent forward at the waist, with his hands clasped behind him, pushing off effortlessly, smiling to himself. Slowly he picked up the pace, and the rink began to seem small as he took the straightaways in a few flashing strokes. The routine for public sessions was to alternate the mood and rules with each song on the rink’s P.A., so that Couples Only skated to sappy doo-wop, Girls Only skated to “Big Girls Don’t Cry,” and so on. Men and Boys Fast skated, for some reason, to Dion’s “Runaround Sue,” a song I loved, and I urged my dad to light the afterburners for those three minutes. He didn’t seem too sure about that, but he started pumping his arms and cross-stepping on the turns, and I was very sure that I had never seen anyone skate so fast. On the way home, I demanded tales of all the races he had won back in Michigan as a kid. Later I convinced myself that if it hadn’t been for World War II canceling the key Games, he would definitely have gone to the Olympics—if not as a skater, then as a miler, or a ski jumper.",

Mrs. D. and I usually spend our evenings in writing and working in the verandah, or in each other's rooms; but I have become so interested in the affairs of this little state, that in spite of the mosquitos, I attended both lectures, but was not warmed into sympathy with the views of either Speaker.",

Even the old men in the cay shops could not help. In a way this was hardly surprising. Blaise was never an important saint in his own town; his fame was greater further away. In the early Middle Ages his cult had spread fast, collecting further legends as it went. By the eighth century churches were dedicated to him in both Milan and Genoa. By the ninth, ‘Blas’ had become a popular saint in Germany, and the abbey of Metz claimed to possess a bit of his skull (‘remarkably thick, brown in colour and about eleven centimetres in size’). He remained popular among Germans ever after, except with the sailors. Blas in German means wind. Even in the nineteenth century ‘mariners avoided pronouncing the name of this [saint’s] feast … and looked upon winds blowing on that day as prognostic of tempests blowing throughout the year’.",

    "target_paragraph": "Much of the Japanese energy went into changing the forms of the place. Superficially at least everything was Nipponized, the stores, the banks, the hotels, the Jockey Club and even its horses, which were renamed with Japanese names, and supplemented with Japanese ponies. Lane Crawford’s became Matsuzakaya, and its staff were photographed, just as they had been in the old days, grouped formally outside the front entrance around their Japanese managing director. The Peninsula Hotel became the Toa, Jimmy’s Kitchen became the Sai Mun Café, Queen’s Road became Nakameiji-dori. The military governor did not in fact move into his newly orientalized Government House, preferring requisitioned quarters at Repulse Bay, but Japanese sentries stood at the old guardhouses on Upper Albert Road, and the Rising Sun flew largely, of course, above the new tower. The Star ferry-boats were requisitioned, and some of them were used on the Guangzhou run – the first time they had ever sailed outside the harbour. All the royal statues were eventually removed from Statue Square (‘a logical step’, observed the News obsequiously), and were shipped to Japan to be melted down.",

Joined by an elderly gentleman with an Aberdeen terrier, by men without occupation, the crowd increased. Little Mr Bowley, who had rooms in the Albany* and was sealed with wax over the deeper sources of life, but could be unsealed suddenly, inappropriately, sentimentally, by this sort of thing—poor women waiting to see the Queen go past—poor women, nice little children, orphans, widows, the War—tut-tut—actually had tears in his eyes. A breeze flaunting ever so warming down the Mall through the thin trees, past the bronze heroes,* lifted some flag flying in the British breast of Mr Bowley and he raised his hat as the car turned into the Mall and held it high as the car approached and let the poor mothers of Pimlico press close to him, and stood very upright. The car came on.",
