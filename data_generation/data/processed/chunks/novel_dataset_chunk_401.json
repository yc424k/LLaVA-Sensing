(An exception is the IT department, run in collaboration with the Korean government.) Cosima rarely visited either campus, finding the vibes uncongenial. In May 2008 when a student (a Hamas ‘suspect’) was shot dead in mid-afternoon by a Fatah security guard, no inquiry was allowed. Nor is the university’s human rights unit encouraged; the authorities prefer to keep aloof from students who are being harassed by the IDF or their PA accomplices. During Cast Lead the An-Najah president expressed sympathy with the Gazan people but ordered the students and staff to show no support for Hamas.",

An odd phenomenon, panic. Its paralysing illogic cancels out one’s instinct of self-preservation, supposedly our strongest instinct though I’ve never believed that. The sane and normal reaction to a shifting cliff-face is to get off it, fast – not to stand around poking it with an umbrella.",

Here they are, here are works in their hand.

With the glitter of copper, the expanse of dark, rose-coloured, pebbled floor, the space, the few low, clean-gleaming faggots, it was really beautiful. We sat and warmed ourselves, welcomed by a plump hostess and a pleasant daughter, both in madder-brown dress and full white shirt. People strayed in and out, through the various doors. The houses are built without any plan at all, the rooms just happening, here or there.

They were absolutely delighted to find ten women stranded in the middle of nowhere. They greeted us warmly, smelling of strong vodka and sweat. They were dressed in jeans and leather jackets, barely seeming to feel the cold, with bright red noses and bushy beards?such a contrast to the way we were dressed in all layers of clothing, multicoloured expedition jackets and trousers, which we had dutifully pulled out of our luggage to wear as added protection from the cold. It was quite a comical scene actually and I thought to myself, this is a story I must tell my grandchildren one day.",

No steaks if you’re spiked at a backcountry site or unexpectedly out overnight—then it’s MREs with microscopic bottles of Tabasco sauce and space-age meatloaf salty enough to sap out of you whatever moisture hasn’t already gone by way of smoke or sweat.

I had the intelligence to salute his integrity; his research with bony fingers wrapped in rags because of chilblains for some diamond of indissoluble veracity. I buried boxes of burnt matches in holes in the turf at his feet. His grim and caustic tongue reproved my indolence. He fascinated me with his sordid imagination. His heroes wore bowler-hats and talked about selling pianos for tenners. Through his landscape the tram squealed; the factory poured its acrid fumes. He haunted mean streets and towns where women lay drunk, naked, on counterpanes on Christmas day. His words falling from a shot-tower hit the water and up it spurted. He found one word, one only for the moon. Then he got up and went; we all got up; we all went. But I, pausing, looked at the tree, and as I looked in autumn at the fiery and yellow branches, some sediment formed; I formed; a drop fell; I fell—that is, from some completed experience I had emerged.",

Nothing I had ever faced in the bush had given me such a strong urge to run, but I was sure that whatever Badge was protecting me from would chase me if I did. I jabbed the light around, desperately looking for the telltale eye shine. None came. Fearing Badge’s excretions more than any predator, I charged in the direction he was staring, and Badge gave a little “huff” noise as if to say, “Damn fool! That’s where the danger is!” I wasn’t sure if he was backing me up or not, but I figured that being eaten was a faster death than being suffocated.",

For his last journey on the Magdalena, six hundred miles downriver to the sea, he traveled not by steamboat, where luxury awaited, but in a simple champán, customized to meet his needs. There was room for his hammock, a small table and chairs, cushions and mats to soften the floor. His lone companion was his cook, Fernanda Barriga, who each day prepared arepas and mazamorra, the only food, aside from fruit, Bolívar could tolerate. Though just forty-seven, he was little more than a bundle of bones: gaunt and frail, unable to walk, and scarcely able to breathe, so corrupted were his lungs, corroded by tuberculosis. His face hung yellow with jaundice; his eyes were dark as coal. Only his mind remained untarnished and alert, ensuring that his final days on the river, the last passage of his life, would be a torrent of regrets and recriminations.",

(“In the summer, the temperature’s about one twenty-five,” a man in Asunción had told me. “But with the humidity, of course, it feels much higher.”) When first the German settlers arrived, fleeing Russian Communism in 1930, they found an ungodly wilderness peopled only by a few Indians, and swarming with poisonous snakes. Many caught typhoid and died. Two years after they arrived, the Chaco War broke out all around them. Yet somehow they hung on to erect an astonishingly clean and well-managed community, with its own schools, buses, laws, and enormous cooperative stores. The supermarket in Filadelfia was spotless and better stocked than a store in Orange County and offered Japanese Super Gummi candies, Chinese Perfect Cube boxes, Jordache jeans, and tapes of Fips Asmussen. Nearby, a Christian bookstore (“The Messenger”) sold Indian statues of turtles and owls, and a video store promised James Bond and Mad Max, as well as special tapes in German, of the Bombing of Baghdad and the Paris-Dakar rally.",

A pale anxious youth stepping softly on long legs was being chaffed by a strutting and rubicund globe-trotter about his purchases in the bazaar. “No, really — do you think I’ve been done to that extent?” he inquired, very earnest and deliberate. The band moved away, dropping into chairs as they went; matches flared, illuminating for a second faces without the ghost of an expression and the flat glaze of white shirt-fronts; the hum of many conversations animated with the ardour of feasting sounded to me absurd and infinitely remote.",

    "target_paragraph": "I SPENT FOUR DAYS WANDERING around Sydney. I visited the principal museums with dutiful absorption and spent an afternoon in the admirably welcoming State Library of New South Wales, but mostly I just wandered wherever there was water. Without question, it is the harbor that makes Sydney. It’s not so much a harbor as a fjord, sixteen miles long and perfectly proportioned—big enough for grandeur, small enough to have a neighborly air. Wherever you stand, the people on the far shore are almost never so distant as to seem remote; often you could hail them if you wished. Because it runs through the heart of the city from east to west, it divides Sydney into more or less equal halves, known as the northern and eastern suburbs. (And never mind that the eastern suburbs are actually in the south, or that many of the northern suburbs are decidedly eastern. Australians, never forget, started life as Britons.) To note that it is 16 miles long barely hints at its extent. Because it constantly wanders off into arms that finish in the serenest little coves, the most gently scalloped bays, the harbor shoreline actually extends to 152 miles. The consequence of this wandering nature is that one moment you are walking beside a tiny sheltered cove that seems miles from anywhere, and the next you round a headland to find before you an open expanse of water with the Opera House and Harbour Bridge and downtown skyscrapers gleaming in airy sunshine and holding center stage. It is endlessly and unbelievably beguiling.",

The fire from the iron cookstove popped and spat, heating the room to almost unbearably warm, even though he wore only a light woolen shirt and trousers. Outside, members from the remains of his original Northern Party—including the photographer Wilkins, and several members of the Southern Party he’d convinced to remain as a base team for his New Northern Party—were busy loading sleds and getting gear in order. Stefansson wanted a small, nimble team, what he described as “a very few good men rather than a large number of ordinary ones.” They boxed up a sextant and other scientific instruments and gear that Dr. Anderson felt belonged to his Southern Party. There remained a good deal of animosity between Stefansson and Dr. Anderson.",

Now fewer than 250 remain, being protected and supported by North American Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT). These live on the spot – two at a time – with no mod cons, in a caravan-sized hut on a mountain ledge. When we arrived the pair currently on duty were at the local branch of the Women’s Co-op and I regretted not meeting them. CPT volunteers have been working in the Hebron Hills, and in H2, since 1995. They are indomitable defenders of Palestinians and rarely emerge undamaged from their At-Tuwani ordeal. Several have been seriously injured: broken ribs, a fractured skull, a ruptured kidney, usually the result of attacks as they escort children to school. Latterly the IDF, supervised by the CPT, have been acting as escorts, driving jeeps at walking speed before and after the pupils.",

The air would be steamy with recent baths, and perhaps powder in the light like chaff in barn-lofts, and they looking at one another, comparing, talking whether you could do more damage if you could just walk out on the floor like you were now. Some wouldn’t, mostly ones with short legs. Some of them were all right, but they just wouldn’t. They wouldn’t say why. The worst one of all said boys thought all girls were ugly except when they were dressed. She said the Snake had been seeing Eve for several days and never noticed her until Adam made her put on a fig leaf. How do you know? they said, and she said because the Snake was there before Adam, because he was the first one thrown out of heaven; he was there all the time. But that wasn’t what they meant and they said, How do you know, and Temple thought of her kind of backed up against the dressing table and the rest of them in a circle around her with their combed hair and their shoulders smelling of scented soap and the light powder in the air and their eyes like knives until you could almost watch her flesh where the eyes were touching it, and her eyes in her ugly face courageous and frightened and daring, and they all saying, How do you know? until she told them and held up her hand and swore she had. That was when the youngest one turned and ran out of the room. She locked herself in the bath and they could hear her being sick.",

As we were proceeding down some darkened, narrow street, suddenly people were stepping out of the shadows and into the road, kicking doors and heaving whatever came to hand. Ahead of me there were startling explosions of glass and intemperate shouting. To my deep and lasting astonishment someone about six cars ahead of me—a fussy little man from the foreign desk, whom even now I would happily drag over rough ground behind a Land Rover—got out to look at the damage to his car, as if he thought he might have run over a nail, bringing those of us behind to a halt. I remember watching in sputtering dismay as he tried to press back into position a flapping piece of trim, then turning my head to find at my window an enraged face—a white guy with dancing dreadlocks and an army surplus jacket—and everything took on a strange dreamlike quality. How odd, I thought, that a total stranger was about to pull me from my car and beat me mushy for the benefit of printworkers whom he had never met, who would mostly despise him as an unkempt hippie, and who would certainly never let him into their own union.",

Everyone else sits in the chant huddled in wool blankets and hats to stay warm, and I’m peeling layers off myself as the hymn drones on, foaming like an overworked farm horse. I come out of the temple after the Gurugita and the sweat rises off my skin in the cold morning air like fog—like horrible, green, stinky fog.

    "target_paragraph": "Dawn broke softly over the mountain. In the cleaned light, far beyond the orchards and poplars of Shams Kilaya, the castle precipice lifted two thousand feet above the valley floor in wrinkles of pink stone. Dogs were emptying garbage-cans in the street as I left. The air was cold. I went through cherry orchards, picking at ripe blackberries, while the rose-coloured bluff grew in front. Beyond a thin stream the slopes were furred in grass and climbed past a small shrine into wilderness.\nNow the whole mountain spread above me. It was split by clefts which ate their way up half its height, then delved into artificial-looking caves. Scree and boulders loosened and cascaded under my feet. In the airy silence their brittle grating was the only sound, like pebbles dragged by the tide. Nothing moved in the stone valley. It was as if the stream below marked a divide between the present and a shunned past. I followed a goat-track along the foot of the bluffs. I had imagined them untouched: but now, vertically above me, I made out scarps which had once been plastered, and the swell of a round tower. In the south-west angle, a change of light awoke walls reaching sixty feet up–a coating of brick stuccoed hard against the cliff, almost indistinguishable from it. Diagonal seams of rock might once have been stairways. The crescent of an arch showed clear in a cave, where swallows were flying in and out. The whole mountain was one vast, riddled sanctuary.\nI longed to enter. But the cavern-mouths gaped sixty feet sheer above, blackened where fire had raged inside, their outer structures burnt away. When I scrutinised the fissures ascending to them, only one seemed to offer a few thin holds. Tentatively at first, I started to climb its crevice. But under my fingers the solid-looking cliff felt loose and friable, and I realised that the whole mountain–perhaps the stark crags of all this region–was not living rock but a coagulate of sand and shale.\nAt first my body seemed light to me, and swung easily into the spaces I planned for it. I was a little surprised. When I tested the soft-looking scarp, kicking or wrenching at it before each step, nothing crumbled. My trainers felt out invisible knobs and dents. Slowly, clambering from side to side, I was winching myself into space. Then stones began to skitter down below me, and echoed on the rocks. A sharp wind was blowing over the higher cliffs. Little by little, I became afraid. I had not really thought the ascent possible.\nHalfway up, my nerve failed me. I stopped, spread-eagled against the rock-face. A few drops of rain fell. Above me the crevice–thirty feet of it–rose sheer. Beneath me was a drop to solid stone. I could see the autumn valley descending past the oasis of Shams Kilaya to hills like grey dust. I waited for my breathing to still. I noticed the hands clenching the rock close against my face: they were lean and broken-skinned, not hands that should be doing this. Then I looked up and glimpsed the ceiling of the cave-chamber I could not reach. It was sooted by Mongol fires.\nWith helpless excitement I began to crawl upwards again. It became too late to turn back. Years ago, young, I would have hurried in fear and perhaps fallen. Now I waited, with pained slowness, to secure a handhold here, a foothold there. I could hear my own heart. For the last ten feet the sides of the cleft were so close that I braced my body inside it. Once I felt my toes slipping; then they held. I was afraid to look down. A broken arch appeared in the opening above. The scarp beside me had been cemented smooth.\nOnly when I heaved myself on to the level floor, heady with triumph, did I look down at the sixty-foot drop to stone, shaking with the thought of my descent. I was in a huge broken chamber. Outside, but close by, the hewn stone of a tower bulged from the plaster.",

The musty rooms were crammed with mismatched furniture, and the beds were made with threadbare linen. A few years ago an international hotel chain renovated the building and turned it into a five-star hotel. Once again French meals are prepared at the Strand—courtesy of a resident chef flown in from France. And an afternoon tea of scones and imported jams is served to guests lounging in rattan chairs beneath whirling black ceiling fans.",

It was true that he had been happier out in the street, thinking of her, than now that he was in the same room with her. He looked at her with a guilty expression on his face. But her look expressed neither disappointment nor reproach. Her pose was easy, and she seemed to give effect to a mood of quiet speculation by the spinning of her ruby ring upon the polished table.

She worked as a professor of nursing, but her strength and spiritual sustenance came from the outdoors. She lived and breathed hiking. When life got out of hand, she would often say, “I need the trail.” Or if you were going through a tough patch, she would conclude, “You need the trail” and would then suggest a time and place.
