There I found tremendous uncemented blocks; they glared and twinkled in the powerful light, and I had to put on a blue eye-glass in order to throw into its proper perspective the vague Etruscan past…” A blue eye-glass? The nineteenth-century equivalent of sunglasses? I can see Henry peering up from the white road, nodding wisely to himself, dusting off his uppers, then, no doubt, heading back to his hotel to write his requisite number of pages for the day. I take the same stroll and attempt the same mysterious act, to throw the powerful light of the long, long past into the light of the morning.",

His arms lay along the arms of the chair, and his head was bent a little; but he lifted it quickly as Charity entered.

Mix the following: ½ teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 3 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 cup of cool water, and pour into a mound of 3-¼ cups of flour. Knead on a flat surface until elastic and smooth. If you’re using a food processor, pulse until the dough forms a ball, then remove and knead by hand. Place dough in a buttered and floured bowl and let rest for 30 minutes. Roll into 1 large or 2 smaller circles and brush with oil. Scatter cheese, onions, and sausage over the surface and bake at 400° for 15 minutes. Cut into 8 pieces.",

Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.",

Once a row was complete, the assistant began the flow of sulfurous gas and I breathed it through my nose one day and by mouth the next by way of little, throwaway plastic attachments put on the end of the hose. After a short rest, I moved on to the inhalation room, arranged in the same manner, but with a shorter, wider tube coming directly out of the partition. With shower caps in place to protect our hair from the humidity, we were like guppies at feeding time—open-mouthed, inhaling the hot, sulfurous steam that flowed from the yellowed tubes. Following another break, I proceeded to the humage treatment, which was carried out in a room with a large, square, glass container full of a greenish-yellow, bubbling liquid. A controlled number of people were admitted to the small chamber that was saturated with sulfurous gas, released through the gurgling of the thermal water. This particular therapy lent itself to conversation as it was practiced in a small group, and between the initial waiting time, ministrations and breaks, over a half hour easily passed in the company of the same handful of people. One pleasant, young history teacher who had a number of serious nasal issues swore by the spa’s humage and confirmed the general consensus that the waters of Acquappesa were by far the most effective in Calabria.",

    "target_paragraph": "Thomas loved the historical synchronicities of the chalk: the ancient path-lines that were echoed in form by yesterday’s plough furrows. He liked the evidence of human mark-making and tampering over millennia – tumuli, long barrows, chalk-pits, dew ponds – testifying to a landscape that was commemorative, tending to the consecrated. He wrote down lists of Hampshire and Sussex place names, enjoying the ‘wealth of poetry’ they possessed. He talked at length with the people he met along the paths of the Downs. And he walked: following lanes to lonely farmhouses or abandoned barns; walking flint-diggers’ cartways, smugglers’ tracks and hares’ paths, generating an elegant typology for the aspects of paths: the ‘airy motion’ and ‘bird-like curves’ of those tracks that descend from the ridge-tops down to clay, sand and river; the boustrophedon motion of a path that ‘doubles round the head of a coombe’; the long straight line of the Downs paths in which ‘a curve is latent’; the ‘sheaf of half-a-dozen footpaths worn side-by-side’ that ran through fields before narrowing and braiding as a bridge or gate was approached; the ‘grassy track[s] of great breadth’ that ran under ash trees and ‘amidst purple dogwood and crimson-hearted traveller’s joy’. Late every summer he would look out for a ‘gentleman of the road’ who he came to think of as the ‘umbrella man’, who had been tramping for forty years, and who towed behind him as he walked a perambulator that contained an ebony-handled umbrella and, the first August that Thomas met him, a cabbage. The umbrella man was often to be found camping in the deeper and wilder lanes of Hampshire: under a spreading oak or dark spruce, or in a bay of turf.",

His heart gave a bound of the most unspeakable joy and relief, and he turned quickly, and there across the pavement of the court, threading her way through the fast weavings of the crowd, he saw her coming towards him eager and ruddy as an apple, and clad in rich, russet, autumnal brown. Bright harvestings of young October sun fell over her, she trotted towards him briskly as a child, with rapid step and short-paced runs. She was panting for breath: at that moment he began to love her, he loved her with all his heart, but his heart would not utter or confess its love, and he did not know of it.",

The camels were black with them, and they followed us in clouds. In cattle country they were always worse than in the clean free desert. Ants work later shifts; in that blessed hour before the mosquitoes took over from the flies, masses of the horrid little creatures would crawl up my trouser legs while I was having a hard-earned cup of tea. This depended on where I camped of course and I soon learnt to stay away from nice flat claypan. The other nuisance in finding a good camping spot was prickles. Dry country has an infinite variety of prickles – there are little hairy ones that get caught in blankets and jumpers and saddle-cloths, there are tough cruel ones that get stuck in dogs’ paws, and there are giant monstrous ones that puncture bare flesh like tacks.",

    "target_paragraph": "Khotan is the last of the great Uighur towns, solitary on the desert’s edge in a vast, intricately watered oasis. Now that the railway has reached its sister-city, Kashgar, and the Chinese are pouring in, Khotan has become the stronghold and retreat of Uighur purity. As you approach it, and a pale sun comes out, the poplars line the road ten deep against the sand. Here and there, among the mud-built suburbs, a grander house shades its courtyard with a wooden portico, or covers itself in a vine trellis, and mosques with slim-towered gates and crenellated walls stand in the orchards.\nIn the town centre, the broad Chinese streets soon taper away, and the world belongs to farmers and traders, to women glittering in gold-threaded silk, to gangs of half-employed youths, and cart-drivers with roses behind their ears. Long two-tiered arcades totter above the bazaars, and seem to age prematurely, like the people below, their bright paint fading.\nYet Khotan was once a kingdom. More than two thousand years ago, after it was settled from north-west India, it grew into a luxuriant and sophisticated city-state, famous for its silks, jade and paper. Its citizens were connoisseurs of dance and music, elaborately courteous, and cunning. Chinese travellers wrote with astonishment how these people with deep-set eyes and prominent noses greeted each other by touching one knee to the ground, and how whenever they received a letter they would hold it to their forehead in respect. Their women–to Chinese horror–wore girdles and trousers and rode horses like the men; and an unveiled openness, with rumours of promiscuity, touches them still.\nThis sensuous and tolerant city was a Buddhist paradise. The monk Xuanzang in the seventh century described its oasis gleaming with scores of monasteries, and rife with miracle. Hermits radiated light from its forests, and statues of the Buddha flew magically by night. In the clefts of the Kun Lun mountains, holy men meditated so intensely that they turned almost to corpses; but their hair kept growing, and they were shaved by visiting shamans.\nI found the site of all this ardour and ceremony far from the modern city, deep in the oasis, deserted. Only a huge, shallow depression marked its confines, where nothing was left. A morning mist drifted over the rice-fields above it, stilling the mud-banks and water-channels in a soft, unreal light, while all around the horizon was closed by an amphitheatre of poplar trees, as if in memorial. I walked between the fields in faint bewilderment. Swarms of tiny frogs teemed at the pool edges. The distance echoed with cuckoos. Here and there some shards of brown pottery had been eased up by the flowing water, and lingered in its runnels. For centuries the city had rotted away under the moist earth–its dampness crumbling wood and clay-brick together–and the soil was leached for treasure by the local inhabitants again and again.\nOnly hardy fragments survived: pottery figurines and seals, and the thousands of flakes of leaf-gold which had covered palaces and temples. But these leftovers were startling in their diversity: engraved wind-deities and sun-chariots, griffins and coins bearing Indian symbols on one side, Chinese on the other. Hellenised Buddhist statues mingled with signs of Nestorian Christianity and Zoroaster. Mustachioed Indian heads were washed up alongside Roman intaglios. Strangest, perhaps, and still unexplained, were the hordes of lewd little terracotta monkeys–real monkeys were unknown here–which mimicked human activity in all its domestic variety: nursing babies, feasting, playing flutes, copulating, clashing cymbals.\nBut now this strained and sifted earth was at last at peace. The loudspeakers promoting family planning in a faraway village were drowned out by the pipe of wagtails. The mist never lifted, but hung as if painted, over a painted desolation. It was impossible to tell the limits of the city. But somewhere under my feet, in a fourteen-day ceremony, monastic floats like rolling temples had once carried their carved Buddhas and devas suspended in gold and silver, and the king and his women had emerged barefoot from the city gate to meet them, and prostrated themselves, and strewed the earth with flowers. Only in the tenth century, after bitter wars with Islamic Kashgar, did the kingdom fall; then the Mongols came, and the earth crept over it.",

But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motor-cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.",

But in the fifth century a new form of worship – physically demanding on the practitioner, and founded on an ideal of solitude, or desertum – spread from Gaul and arrived by means of the seaways into western and northern Britain. Peregrini – wandering devouts – travelled by boat on their pilgrimages, making landfall on distant islands and headlands (Iona, North Rona) long before the Norsemen reached such places. White has written well about this extraordinary moment in Christian history, when the monks – a-sail in search of their desertum – ‘suddenly began to move further afield, flying in a great …migration, their heads full of grammar and geography, verb tenses and tempests, quick thinking and poetry’.",

The Eregalerij, or ‘Gallery of Honour’, was another cavernous space, a long, nave-like hall that stretched into the distance, lined on both sides with deep alcoves in which the artworks were displayed. The high arched ceiling was painted with green leaves and red stars, giving the room a gothic flavour that made me feel once again that I could be in a cathedral rather than a museum. Even a cursory glance at the walls revealed how the gallery had got its self-promoting name: a dusky self-portrait of a rumpled Rembrandt here, Vermeer’s homely milkmaid with her breadbasket over there. Stormy grey walls drew the eye to rich still lifes of fruit and cheese, lively portraits by Frans Hals, sweeping landscapes by Jacob van Ruisdael and bawdy domestic scenes by Jan Steen. Amid such competition, an alcove of priceless Vermeers went all but unnoticed by the dozen or so visitors ambling through the chamber. ‘Everybody loves Vermeer, except me,’ Francis Bacon once said.",

They thought they'd convinced me when the secretary, or whatever he was, came out with the last proposals: handsome proposals I confess they were. After all, marriage is marriage, and money's money—both useful things in their way ... and I didn't know what to answer—\" She broke off and drew a long breath, as if speaking had become an effort. \"But the minute I laid eyes on her, I said: 'You sweet bird, you! Shut you up in that cage again? Never!' And now it's settled that she's to stay here and nurse her Granny as long as there's a Granny to nurse. It's not a gay prospect, but she doesn't mind; and of course I've told Letterblair that she's to be given her proper allowance.\"",

An old man led us to our rooms, and opened the doors on suites so new they came without furniture, without clothes hangers, without anything but space and light.

The officers lived in the same sort of barracks as the men, the officers’ mess was separated from the men’s by a sheet curtain that was never closed. The officers’ club had ten minimally easy chairs, three worn card tables and a makeshift bar. I came to love the Base too and bought a pair of sneakers as chigger prevention.",

A narrow but distinct pathlet led me through six bare brown fields towards the source of last evening’s shouted commands. Soon I could see in the distance a wretched stone hovel isolated on a high ledge; no other dwelling was visible. As I climbed towards it there came a dramatic surge of colour in the eastern sky beyond the Rio Pampas. Suddenly the long cloud banks above a line of smoky-blue peaks were gold and crimson and the vast contorted landscape all around me was drenched in rose-pink brilliance. I stood still, forgetting everything – our lost bag, my vile coffee hangover, my exhaustion after an almost sleepless night. During such Andean moments – and they are frequent – one’s own state of mind or body doesn’t matter.",

All day the sky remained low and dark, the wind icy, the thunder loud, the hail showers frequent. I ventured out between showers to forage around the corner, but in this depopulated district of front-room shops with three-quarters empty shelves I could find neither tea nor sardines. On my way home a ragged teenager followed me, begging insistently – ‘One shekel, only one shekel!’ It would have been unwise for a temporary resident to become known as ‘a soft touch’. When I said ‘No shekel’, kindly but firmly, he trailed me to my door, then grabbed the key as I was about to insert it and demanded, ‘Only one shekel!’ Looking up into his face I could see that he was no threat. When I smiled and seized his wrist while repeating ‘No!’ he at once released the key. Later, I was able to identify his family and donate an anonymous gift.",

But with the air the distant humming sound of far-off crowded thoroughfares was admitted to the room. The incessant and tumultuous hum of the distant traffic seemed, as she stood there, to represent the thick texture of her life, for her life was so hemmed in with the progress of other lives that the sound of its own advance was inaudible. People like Ralph and Mary, she thought, had it all their own way, and an empty space before them, and, as she envied them, she cast her mind out to imagine an empty land where all this petty intercourse of men and women, this life made up of the dense crossings and entanglements of men and women, had no existence whatever. Even now, alone, at night, looking out into the shapeless mass of London, she was forced to remember that there was one point and here another with which she had some connection. William Rodney, at this very moment, was seated in a minute speck of light somewhere to the east of her, and his mind was occupied, not with his book, but with her. She wished that no one in the whole world would think of her. However, there was no way of escaping from one’s fellow-beings, she concluded, and shut the window with a sigh, and returned once more to her letters.",

A raised hand slowed our pace, and silenced our excited whispers, as we crept forward. Scrambling down a steep incline I spotted a young blonde woman in khaki fatigues squatting by a tree trunk. Beside her was a man with a notepad, and two armed guides.

Children in Aurita’s extended family have long looked forward to the day that they stand taller than Nati, a rite of passage that in Alex’s case occurred just after his tenth birthday. Skeletons that Bingham’s team found showed that the average height for workers at Machu Picchu was about five feet, a measurement that hasn’t budged over the five intervening centuries. But Justo was short even by Andean standards, about four feet six. He looked like an anime version of Ricardo Montalban, if the star of Fantasy Island had capped his front teeth with gold and been left in the clothes dryer on high heat for a couple of years. John called him “Hummingbird,” because Justo was constantly in motion and talked nonstop.",

    "target_paragraph": "Immediately in front of me stood a small, thin, threadbare woman with baby on back and toddler at foot. I wondered why she was queuing; she carried no comforts. The queue was long and slow. Two nasty young warders with blond mini-moustaches and thick necks squeezed every loaf of bread, opened every packet of biscuits, felt every soup sachet, stirred every pot of jam, smelled every bottle of Coca-Cola. Behind their counter rose high strong iron bars through which the prisoners could be seen eagerly crowding forward, thrusting a hand between the bars when their turn came. At last the woman in front of me stepped forward, reached into a blouse pocket and handed over one cigarette. Then she and her husband exchanged quick smiles – smiles of love and reassurance. A lump came to my throat. That was a vignette I shall never forget. Later, as we drove away, she was walking along the verge, carrying the toddler, and I suggested giving her a lift. Georgina, however, said we had no room. Which was almost – but not quite – true.",
