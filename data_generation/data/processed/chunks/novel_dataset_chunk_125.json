My brother, sister and I in the back were miles away from my parents up front, in effect in another room. We quickly discovered during illicit forays into the picnic hamper that if you stuck a bunch of Ohio Blue Tip matches into an apple or hard-boiled egg, so that it resembled a porcupine, and casually dropped it out the tailgate window, it was like a bomb. It would explode with a small bang and a surprisingly big flash of blue flame, causing cars following behind to veer in an amusing fashion.",

He stared at her blankly for a moment, then his puzzled gaze – (O good!) – fell to the tiny object she was fingering nervously, with dawning comprehension. Blushing rosily, she tried to conceal the little jacket behind her. Grace! A great light broke on him! Do you mean it? She went to him with a cry, half laugh, half sob, and buried her burning face in his neck. You silly boy. Of course I mean it (you bastard!). The little dance girl. Smiling with wet lechery and manipulating his moist rope of cigar, Faro Jim shuffled a pack of cards slowly and fixed on her his vulturesque eye. A knife in his shiny boots, a small derringer and three aces up his ruffled sleeve, and suave murder in his heart. But the cold grey eyes of the Stranger missed nothing. Imperturbably he drank his Scotch, wheeled from the mirror with barking Colt just one-sixth of a second before the gambler could fire. Faro coughed and slid forward slowly upon the floor.",

Her talk of kings had carried him oddly back in flashes to the pearly White Way of Main Street in Erie, Pennsylvania, when he was fifteen. There was a restaurant with lobsters in the window and green weeds and bright lights on a shell cavern, and beyond behind a red curtain the terribly strange brooding mystery of people and violin music. That was just before he left for New York. This girl reminded him of the fresh iced fishes and lobsters in the window. She was Beautiful Doll. Minna had never been Beautiful Doll.",

Is it under the couch? In the cupboard? Hiding in a hole in the wall? Coiled up in your boot? If you knew, you could do something productive about it, like walk away, kill it, or befriend it and call it Barry—if you’re into that kind of thing. But because you don’t know where it is, or even if it’s there at all, you have the adrenaline response of fearful anticipation without the release that follows after you’ve fought or fled. That nervous energy gets trapped in the body as unresolved tension. Anxiety. And so, to find the snake in the room is better than not, because then you run, kill it, or befriend it and call it Barry. That’s why it’s important to face fears: to exorcize anxiety.",

For $11.27 an hour, he once operated a chain saw that helped to clear the pipeline’s right-of-way. When he goes out into the mountains, he is often accompanied by Michael David, who now runs lines in adjacent terrain. In the eyes of some people in the Village, including older ones, such endeavors in the wild are retrogressive. Adeline’s father, Willie Juneby, is just amused. “My dad thinks we’re crazy sometimes.” The Hungwitchin have historically been nervous about certain high ground in the area where Potts goes to trap. They call it the Devil’s Chair, and fear for Adeline if she is there. Septembers, Potts puts out nets for the running chum salmon. He dries them and packs them, and eventually has a chartered plane drop hundreds of pounds of fish in the mountains, where he caches them for his dogs in winter. The plane, out of Tok and costing eighty dollars a trip, also drops flour, salt, sugar, matches, candles, tea, coffee, tobacco, milk, baking powder, rice, Mapleine, jello, and canned goods in heavy double bags. Potts does not otherwise seek assistance. With sled and gear, moving up and over his mountains, he has broken trail for as much as nineteen straight hours through deep blown drifts at sixty below.",

It is neither condensed nor evaporated but “sterilized” whole milk, in a can, without preservatives. It is fine milk, but too expensive. Condensed milk, appropriately diluted, works out at 60¢ a quart, and powdered milk at half of that. Frozen steak costs $4.20 a pound, bacon $2.07, chicken $1.15, hamburger $2.10, cheddar cheese $2.35, butter $1.85—all this in Eagle’s only store. Grapefruit cost 55¢ apiece, a cucumber 75¢, tomatoes and lettuce about $1.15 a pound. Fresh food, after travelling upward of two thousand miles, for the most part has jet lag. Campbell’s soup is 51¢ a can, a dozen eggs $1.30. A standard box of Morton’s salt costs 62¢. Much is said about the high cost of things in Alaska, but what seems remarkable is that prices are not much higher than these, since virtually everything arrives by truck, plane, or boat from the rest of the United States. The supply lines to Anchorage and Fairbanks are long and costly enough, but these prices—roughly half again as high as they would be in New Jersey—are set in Eagle, where nearly everything has been brought in light planes another two hundred miles over mountains. Dave McCall, the pilot-storekeeper, charges 19¢ a pound for flying things in. Hence the especially costly salt.",

The Sperry Trail always gets a groan in the early season—Y’ain’t even roughed-in yet, the packers would say—but a month in, it’s doable, easy, even, nothing like the legendary Trout Lake Trail, uphill both ways and always demoralizing with a saw on your shoulder, or Cut Bank Pass, which could use a handrail to pull against.",

Also revulsion, its ugliness is so overwhelming; and its environs have been brutalised by gigantic machines and defaced by builders’ left-overs – hillocks of litter-strewn rubble, cottage-sized chunks of jagged concrete, rusty twisted girders. However many photographs and films one has seen, to be in this menacing presence is profoundly distressing – and frightening. It symbolises (amongst so much else) an over-armed regime that has lost the plot.",

Indeed the whole town has been smartened up lately. The bazaars are new and whitewashed, and their roofs are supported on piles which let in light and air underneath. In the new town, where the hotel and Government offices stand, the roads are edged with neat brick gutters. The traffic is shared between the Indian gharry, with an awning, and the Russian droshky, with its high wooden yoke over the horse’s neck. After Murghab and Maimena we feel in contact with the outer world again, and wish we had stayed longer in those places. Still, it would be churlish not to admit that the town is the pleasanter for these improvements. We are certainly enjoying the hotel.",

Internet-sourced flights, rental car and hotels, and an agenda gleaned from the Lonely Planet guide and Thorn Tree message board, delivered a cost-effective trip that was surprisingly easy to arrange. It seemed that the world had suddenly become a much smaller place. I think that was the first time I realised I could literally go anywhere in the world in my two-week holiday window, and do just what I wanted when I got there.",

Here the road has been damaged by this season’s rains, which explains why we met only three motor vehicles today. The noise of the Colorado, scarcely thirty yards away, reduced us to sign language; because of the gradient this torrent seems more like an interminable waterfall than a river. We are camping just beyond the Colorado canyon in another fly-infested and woefully neglected hacienda field. When it rained heavily after dark I stripped naked and stood enjoying the cool downpour on my sweat-prickly skin. As this is doubtless tarantula territory I’m writing under the most unfavourable conditions, lying nude on my flea-bag in a cramped, tightly-sealed, oven-hot tent. But even under favourable conditions it would be impossible adequately to describe today’s trek. There comes a time when we literary conquistadores must lay down our pens and admit defeat. I can only suggest – think of the Eroica as representing our journey from Cajamarca. And then think of the Apurimac gorge as the Finale.",

This involved following an uncomfortable little path over loose stones through deep snow to the edge of the Braldu. As we reached the water six men – the first people we had seen since leaving Yuno – arrived on the opposite bank. They had of course been visible for some time, moving towards us like ants across an immense width of snow, each man carrying a heavy goat-skin sack. They made no attempt to return my greeting but stared at us with that bewildered incredulity which is the normal reaction of the Baltis to the Misses Murphy. Then they took off their shalwars, tied them to their loads, and in three pairs, with arms around one another’s shoulders and sticks used to steady themselves, began very slowly to cross. The racing torrent was groin-deep and I realised too late that our presence meant their having to endure wet shirts in the cause of modesty. Their main difficulty was not the strength of the current – trying though that must have been – but the shifting stones on the riverbed. Three of the men were elderly and the frailest of these slipped once, briefly submerging his sack. But we discovered that it contained butter, so no harm was done.",

Oh well. I survived my allotted moment in the spotlight, the initial bombardment of cameras, journalists, interviews, television appearances and the like; after two months Olivier and I decided to leave New York for more quiet ways. We moved to a basement apartment in Newport, Rhode Island, where I could write and where we got married in May 1988. Tarzoon is with us, alive and well with a calico New York girlfriend named Suki.",

One horrid stretch, lacking the smallest handhold in the wall, rounds a windy point of cliff that is one hundred feet or more above the rocks at lake edge, and this I navigate on hands and knees, arriving a lifetime later—but still in my old life, alas—at one of the few points in that whole first mile where one can lean far enough into the cliff to let another man squeeze by.

The Icknield Way was my entry to a network of old routes criss-crossing the British landscapes and waters, and connecting them to countries and continents beyond. Along the way – along the ways – I broke more bones than I had in two decades of mountaineering, drank too much gin with a sort-of shaman in the Outer Hebrides, walked stride for stride with a 5,000-year-old man near Liverpool, followed wadi paths through occupied Palestine, and found myself – like many English walkers before me – tramping an arid branch-line of the Camino in Spain, under a vulture-filled sky. I traced a tidal path nicknamed ‘The Doomway’, which is allegedly the deadliest path in Britain but which turned out to be a cakewalk, I admired the celestial bling of meteor showers over the North Atlantic, I traversed an arc of the winter Ridgeway on skis and saw, I’m fairly sure, a black panther in Wiltshire. I spent nights out in copses, fields and beehive shielings, and on the haunted summit of a chalk down in Sussex where I underwent heebie-jeebies at the hands of ghosts that I now suspect were probably only owls. And everywhere I met people – usual and unusual, quiet and voluble, everyday and eccentric – for whom landscape and walking were vital means of making sense of themselves and of the world. I met dawdlers, dreamers, striders, guides, pilgrims, wanderers, stravaigers, trespassers, cartographers – and a man who believed he was a tree and that trees were people.",

I will not let myself even smell it until I smell the cold green air off the fields. But already these are not school fields; these are not school hedges; the men in these fields are doing real things; they fill carts with real hay; and those are real cows, not school cows. But the carbolic smell of corridors and the chalky smell of schoolrooms is still in my nostrils. The glazed, shiny look of matchboard is still in my eyes. I must wait for fields and hedges, and woods and fields, and steep railway cuttings, sprinkled with gorse bushes, and trucks in sidings, and tunnels and suburban gardens with women hanging out washing, and then fields again and children swinging on gates, to cover it over, to bury it deep, this school that I have hated.",

The spiritual experience is somewhat different, but it belongs to the same realm of the super-physical; and it is very far from Paganism.\nShe wrote of these supreme ardours and mysteries; and she wrote that most inspired and vehement song of passionate human love, \"Remembrance\":\nCold in the earth—and the deep snow piled above thee,\nFar, far removed, cold in the dreary grave!\nHave I forgot, my only Love, to love thee….",

They would create piles of debris, including downed palm fronds, greenery and miscellaneous stuff, which would blow around in frequent high winds. She watched the crews standing on top of the large piles and simultaneously attempting to pick the piles up and place them in the truck. The street sweepers were from countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India. Their type of logic seemed so strange to us, and if you didn’t develop a sense of humor around this, it would make you cry.",

This done, I wandered over to the main shopping street, Hohe Strasse, a long, straight pedestrian artery which is one of the two most expensive streets in Europe on which to rent retail space (the other is Kaufingerstrasse in Munich). It’s more expensive even than Bond Street in London or the Rue du Faubourg-St-Honore in Paris. Bernard Levin wrote glowingly of Hohe Strasse in To the End of the Rhine, but to me it just looked like any shopping street anywhere ? a succession of C&A-type department stores, shoe stores, record stores, places selling cameras and video recorders. It was aswarm with Saturday shoppers, but they didn’t look particularly discerning and nothing like as well-dressed as the citizens of Aachen. I could have been in Milton Keynes or Doncaster.",

It is not a word we use in America. When we sweep up after we have been doing woodworking and put it in a bag with mixed nuts and a little birdseed, and pretend it’s a healthful breakfast product, we call it granola, which frankly I think is a much superior word. To my mind, granola sounds precisely like a crunchy cereal involving bits of grain and chaff, whereas muesli doesn’t sound like anything at all, except perhaps a salve you would put on a cold sore (or possibly the cold sore itself).",

If she had had her way, she would have walked very fast down the Tottenham Court Road, and then sprung into a cab and raced swiftly home. The view she had had of the inside of an office was of the nature of a dream to her. Shut off up there, she compared Mrs Seal, and Mary Datchet, and Mr Clacton to enchanted people in a bewitched tower, with the spiders’ webs looping across the corners of the room, and all the tools of the necromancer’s craft at hand; for so aloof and unreal and apart from the normal world did they seem to her, in the house of innumerable typewriters, murmuring their incantations and concocting their drugs, and flinging their frail spiders’ webs over the torrent of life which rushed down the streets outside.",

The story of my long relationship with Budi, a guide by profession, need not be recounted here. Budi's house compound is in Jimbaran, a village of some 12, 000 people on the narrowest part of the isthmus connecting the Bukit to the main part of the island. I am the only foreign resident of Jimbaran. Recently two small hotels have been built in the village, but visitors have little contact with the villagers. Other than Budi, who spent two years at my house in Scottsdale, Arizona perfecting his English, nobody in the village can speak English. Most of the villagers are fishermen, tailors, salt makers, truckers, drivers, or are engaged in various other forms of small business. Jimbaran, and the dry limestone Bukit in general, is not \"typical\" of the Bali seen by most visitors. There is no handicraft industry other than a few small shell jewelry factories. There is no irrigation water and therefore no rice cultivation. It is a world away from the tourist meccas of Ubud, Kuta, Sanur, and Nusa Dua.",
