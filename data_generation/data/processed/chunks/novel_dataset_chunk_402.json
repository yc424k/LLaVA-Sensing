Jemina had no money, but she had paid her way in whiskey, bringing a pailful to school every morning and leaving it on Miss Lafarge’s desk. Miss Lafarge had died of delirium tremens after a year’s teaching, and so Jemina’s education had stopped.\nAcross the still stream, still another still was standing. It was that of the Doldrums. The Doldrums and the Tantrums never exchanged calls.\nThey hated each other.\nFifty years before old Jem Doldrum and old Jem Tantrum had quarrelled in the Tantrum cabin over a game of slapjack. Jem Doldrum had thrown the king of hearts in Jem Tantrum’s face, and old Tantrum, enraged, had felled the old Doldrum with the nine of diamonds. Other Doldrums and Tantrums had joined in and the little cabin was soon filled with flying cards. Harstrum Doldrum, one of the younger Doldrums, lay stretched on the floor writhing in agony, the ace of hearts crammed down his throat. Jem Tantrum, standing in the doorway, ran through suit after suit, his face alight with fiendish hatred. Old Mappy Tantrum stood on the table wetting down the Doldrums with hot whiskey. Old Heck Doldrum, having finally run out of trumps, was backed out of the cabin, striking left and right with his tobacco pouch, and gathering around him the rest of his clan. Then they mounted their steers and galloped furiously home.\nThat night old man Doldrum and his sons, vowing vengeance, had returned, put a ticktock on the Tantrum window, stuck a pin in the doorbell, and beaten a retreat.\nA week later the Tantrums had put Cod Liver Oil in the Doldrums’ still, and so, from year to year, the feud had continued, first one family being entirely wiped out, then the other.",

Actually she took this challenge rather well, after an initial display of shock and horror. The tree-trunks were close together, and only about ten feet above the racing café-au-lait river, and the afternoon was windless. Had this contraption been swaying, we might all have found it more difficult to negotiate. Rachel wanted to camp on the far side, in a eucalyptus grove by the water; I reminded her that one never camps at river-level – even during a drought. The drought has to end one day (or night). Also, the flat riverside fields were dotted with stagnant pools. So for the next hour we climbed steeply and at sunset reached this ideal site, an artificially levelled threshing-floor – the only level space for miles around – with ample (though not very sustaining) fodder for Juana and lots of firewood. By 6.30 lunch seemed many hours and climbs away and our noodles, simmered with a Knorr chicken cube, tasted like some fabulous Cordon Bleu invention. Unfamiliar trees cover the slopes directly above us and fill a nearby ravine, where a hidden stream is noisy; yet we have a spectacular view of the surrounding heights and depths.",

I was getting out my camera when he gave a sort of insane gurgle and came towards me with hands extended, whereupon I fled – if that is the right word for scrambling through nine inches of sand up a mountainside with a bicycle! When I got to the top of the slope I looked back and saw that the apparition had forgotten me and was now sitting hunched beneath a rock engaged in the contemplation of his toes.

However, Farnsworth’s most valuable patents ran out in the late 1940s, just as TV was about to take off, so he never got anything like the full measure of wealth to which he was rightly entitled.",

I crossed cautiously, alarmed at the force of the current in the center—each time I lifted a leg the current tried to reposition it downstream, as if it belonged to a gateleg table—but the water was never more than about three feet deep, and I reached the other side without falling.",

The members ranged from near-communists through liberal Muslims to fanatically orthodox Mullahs; from white-skinned Pathans through brown-skinned Punjabis to almost black-skinned Bengalis; from wealthy hereditary princes like Aurang Zeb through moderately well-off professional men to destitute representatives of the city slums; from men who spoke flawless Oxford English through men whose grammar and pronunciation were questionable to men who could only speak pidgin-English. And in the restaurant at the 11 a.m. interval the air was chaotic with Pushto, Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi and English, while the members (clad as variously as they spoke) sat arguing over their tea or coffee. Theoretically the unifying element here should be Islam but Pakistan’s years of exposure to Western influence have brought her religion to a crisis of reinterpretation, so that it tends to disrupt at least as much as it unites, while individual citizens battle to adapt it to what they believe is best for the country, or to defend it from any change.",

In 2011, Evo Morales—Bolivia’s socialist, Indigenous, longest-serving president—and his government created the Law of Mother Earth, controversially giving legal rights to all nature, equal with humans. Morales is outspoken in his criticism of industrialised countries and their failure to adequately tackle climate change. However, despite grounding Pachamama at the heart of his politics, industrialisation continues apace. His government has offered the parque barely any financial support, while still relying on us to take many unwanted animals who would find no homes otherwise. And worldwide, in just one decade, a conservative estimate is that corporations have destroyed over fifty million hectares of forest, largely in the production and use of palm oil, soya, meat and dairy for profit. More of the Amazon is sold off, and the world becomes hotter, drier, wetter, sadder and stormier.",

As it was, ignorant of everything really about the woman except what she looked and sounded like, why–there you were.

She told me her legs had been playing her up something wicked, so I offered her the tube of ointment I carried for muscular aches and pains. The ointment was called Rub, which is how Japanese people pronounce the English word ‘love’ – a coincidence that startled the crawling woman, caused her young niece to bounce up and down shrieking with laughter, and eventually so endeared me to them that they washed three pairs of my socks.",

I had expected him to rejoice at the prospect of even so short a trek for, like most Tibetans, he has an inborn inclination both to wander and to trade; but he showed an odd reluctance to go to Siglis and on being questioned as to the reason he declared that the track was exceptionally difficult at the best of times and would be downright dangerous now that the rivers were rising. This seemed a fair enough argument, yet it did not entirely convince me. When I enquired further he admitted that there was also a possibility of trouble with the Nepalese in Siglis, where the raiding exploits of Khamba brigands have made Tibetans so unpopular that the villagers would be more likely to attack our party than to trade with them; at which point I suddenly and delightedly saw that here was a perfect opportunity for me to combine duty and pleasure by accompanying the party as a pacifying agent, while getting my first experience of travel in the hills. Chimba at once agreed to organise the expedition if I came too, so tomorrow morning at six o’clock we will all set off together.",

It was windless and calm. Sounds coming through the veil – the bleat of sheep, the croak of rooks – were deadened. The uproar of the traffic merged into one growl.

While I’d been thinking our presence didn’t much matter to anyone, in fact our absence was noticed. “Where were you guys in St. Petersburg?” Sybil asks me when we finally meet up in Tallinn after her harrowing hours at the Russian border. I detect a faint ring of accusation in her tone, which makes me feel a tad embarrassed to reveal what until that moment I’d considered our brilliant move.",

I tried to!” But it was too late now in the pallid sun-glare of the tenth day of terror and hopelessness and despair and impotence and rage and outrage and it was himself and the mule, his mule (they had let him name it—John Henry) which no man save he had plowed for five years now and whose ways and habits he knew and respected and who knew his ways and habits so well that each of them could anticipate the other’s very movements and intentions; it was himself and the mule, the little gobbling faces flying before them, the familiar hard skull-bones shocking against his fists, his voice shouting, “Come on, John Henry! Plow them down! Gobble them down, boy!” even as the bright hot red wave turned back, meeting it joyously, happily, lifted, poised, then hurling through space, triumphant and yelling, then again the old shocking blow at the back of his head: he lay on the deck, flat on his back and pinned arm and leg and cold sober again, his nostrils gushing again, the mild man stooping over him with behind the thin rimless glasses the coldest eyes the convict had ever seen—eyes which the convict said were not looking at him but at the gushing blood with nothing in the world in them but complete impersonal interest.",

When they arrived downstairs at breakfast-time they were surprised to see what effects had been produced in the large kitchen to their glory since they had last beheld it. At some unnatural hour of the morning the dairyman had caused the yawning chimney-corner to be whitened, and the brick hearth reddened, and a blazing yellow damask blower to be hung across the arch in place of the old grimy blue cotton one with a black sprig pattern which had formerly done duty here. This renovated aspect of what was the focus indeed of the room on a dull winter morning, threw a smiling demeanour over the whole apartment.",

Beijing suffered greatly during the Cultural Revolution, but most of the damage was wreaked by outsiders, and the citizens of Beijing still love their city. But the people of Kyoto cannot bear the fact that Kyoto is not Tokyo. They are trying with all their might to catch up with Tokyo, but they will never come close. This has been going on a long time. I first noticed the malaise shortly after moving to Kyoto. I asked a friend, ‘When did the unhappiness set in?’ and he answered, ‘Around 1600.’ In other words, the people of Kyoto never forgave Edo for usurping its place as capital. When the Emperor moved to Tokyo in 1868, that was the final blow to Kyoto’s self-esteem.",
