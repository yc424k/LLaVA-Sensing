Mr. Lyons, one of the most famous of the early missionaries, still dings to this place, where he has worked for forty years. He is an Hawaiian poet; and, besides translating some of our best hymns, has composed enough to make up the greater part of a bulky volume, which is said to be of great merit. He says that the language lends itself very readily to rhythmical expression. He was indefatigable in his youth, and was four times let down the pali by ropes to preach in the Waimanu Valley. Neither he nor his wife can mount a horse now, and it is very dreary for them, as the population has receded and dwindled from about them. Their house is made lively, however, by some bright little native girls, who board with them, and receive an English and industrial education.",

He knew her by her walk and by the colour of her eyes, and by a way she had of putting back the hair off her face with her left hand. She had been wandering about, she said, selling herrings and the like, and now she was going back to Sligo, to the place in the Burrough where she was living with another woman, Mary Gillis, who had much the same story as herself. She would be well pleased, she said, if he would come and stop in the house with them, and be singing his songs to the bacachs and blind men and fiddlers of the Burrough. She remembered him well, she said, and had a wish for him; and as to Mary Gillis, she had some of his songs off by heart, so he need not be afraid of not getting good treatment, and all the bacachs and poor men that heard him would give him a share of their own earnings for his stories and his songs while he was with them, and would carry his name into all the parishes of Ireland.",

On the night before the proposed departure—August 27—snow fell heavily, covering the ice, making it harder to see weak spots where one might break through. Visibility was poor and the Eskimos said they feared the rotten ice. Hearing all of this, Beuchat reported that he was having “palpitations in the heart,” and he requested to be examined by Dr. Mackay. After listening carefully with his stethoscope, the doctor was unable to confirm any serious cardiac condition, and Beuchat sheepishly carried on with preparations for departure.",

This insight made me wonder about my future. Should I buy a larger traveling home and join the folks who live on the road? This would allow me to continue this life indefinitely . . . wandering wherever the mood took me. None of the stress or anxiety connected to close friendships. Make continual the pleasure of new sights and sounds and people. No, I thought. Probably not. As much as I love this, I also crave deep relationships, the intimacy of long-time friends. But for now, I could continue to enjoy this traveling life with Winnipeg, another new place to explore. The city’s heart?a confluence of two rivers now called “The Forks”?the place to begin.",

Despite being in reasonably good condition, I had to pause every thirty yards or so on the first ascent from Santo Domingo’s ugly bridge.

On several descents my brake-muscles ached and I envied those locals who sat on plank trays, with four tiny wheels, and scooted past me at life-threatening speeds.

When the ducks landed, he blasted a bunch, which Mamen and Wilkins picked up in the canoe. There were a good many ducks landing at the bottom end of the lead, but new ice was forming, and they had to smash it with their paddles to move along, which startled the ducks and made them fly away. So they stashed the canoe for a future hunt and walked back to the Karluk, where they found that McKinlay, Jenness, and Beuchat had also had good luck during their outing. Between them they had about fifty ducks to show for the day’s hunt.",

Now these and all other tokens of her presence had vanished, and the room looked as bare and comfortless as when Zeena had shown her into it on the day of her arrival.

Like most cabins in the Village, it is essentially one room, twenty by twenty feet, with a storm vestibule full of dog harnesses, guns, mukluks, parkas. In the main room, all furniture is against the walls, which are insulated with carton cardboard (“Burger King Frozen Shoestring Potatoes”). There are three beds, a bench and a table, a tall oval heat stove, a propane oven and range. Cordwood, stacked waist-high, is inside the cabin as well. Yet the first two impressions the cabin gives are a sense of neatness and a sense of space. Michael, three brothers, and two sisters are grown and away now, if not altogether gone. So his parents, Bessie and Harry David, have only four children at home with them still. The beds touch like dominoes. The three youngest sleep in one, parents in another, Minicup in the third. Clothes are in boxes under the beds. A broom hangs by the door. Coming inside in winter, you sweep your legs free of snow before it melts.",

    "target_paragraph": "Hemingway produced no novel in 1927. He was mostly preoccupied with personal affairs?he divorced one wife and wed another in Paris in early summer, just about the time Lindbergh was flying in?but did come out with a volume of short stories, Men Without Women. Dorothy Parker in The New Yorker called it “a truly magnificent work,” adding, “I don’t know where a greater collection of stories can be found,” but the book didn’t stir the same public excitement as Hemingway’s debut novel of the previous year, The Sun Also Rises. Also well received, but not runaway commercial successes, were The Bridge of San Luis Rey by a new writer named Thornton Wilder, and Mosquitoes by another newcomer, William Faulkner.",

As we approached the settlement, through a chilly, grey-blue twilight, I heard sounds of revelry and saw scores of men and youths sitting on the hillside drinking talla as they watched ten men dancing to the music of an azmari (wandering minstrel). Our arrival astonished everyone, but I was warmly welcomed and presented with two gourds of talla simultaneously – and after that climb I emptied them almost simultaneously. Then a laughing woman fed me with unfamiliar, delicious bread – wafer-thin, toasted crisp and faintly seasoned with salt and spices. As I sat on a boulder, devouring this delicacy, the azmari came to stand before me, playing his mazenka (a one-stringed fiddle) while improvising a song in my honour. (I could distinguish the words for ‘mule’, ‘high mountains’, ‘shifta’, ‘woman’, ‘cold’, ‘alone’ and I regretted my inability to understand it fully.) By now a golden half-moon had risen and was shining more brightly than a full moon at home; and it seemed to me that a day’s trek could have no happier ending than to sit in moonlight on a high mountain drinking with a friendly crowd and being serenaded by a wandering minstrel.",

Phallic poplars and bursts of pink geranium and a forest of white-trunked trees whose foliage flowed out of the sky covered the land. Nebulous weeds swung on the current: purple stems with fat animal leaves, long tentacular stems with no leaves at all, swishing balls of iodine and the curious chemical growths of stagnant waters. Crows cawed from one deep mist to another. The word “sick” effaced itself against the poisonous air and jittered lamely about between the tips of the island and halted on the white road that ran straight through the middle. “Sick” turned and twisted about the narrow ribbon of the highway like a roasting pig on a spit, and woke Alabama gouging at her eyeballs with the prongs of its letters.",

On snowfields or glaciers your normal spatial perspectives are warped by the whiteness and the uniformity of the landscape’s texture. Distances become hard to judge. Wandering the snow plains of the Alps in the 1830s and 1840s, the Scottish scientist and mountaineer James Forbes found himself unable to focus on anything at all, astonished by the ‘effect of interminable vastness with which icy plains outspread for miles, terminated by a perspective of almost shadowless snowy slopes’. On the Glacier du Buet, the combination of sunshine and high snow produced a mirage of smoothness so persuasive that Jean de Luc became convinced he was ‘suspended in the air on one of these clouds’.",

The forests are dense, the lay of the land is in places confusing, and all the towns and settlements are aligned with the roadways. One major site, however, speaks directly to the relationship between those who created the civilization of San Agustín and the river that made all of it possible. The trail to La Chaquira crosses meadows and pastures for a mile or more before falling away steeply to a promontory looking out across a deep chasm, through which flows the Magdalena. It is a stunning sight. Finally, here is the river, exploding out of the country, running away through a dark ravine and all the rolling hills and uplands of Huila.",

He could not eat, sleep, stand still, sit down, rest, talk coherently, or compose himself for five minutes at a time. He would go prowling and muttering around the house, rush out into the streets of the town, walk up and down the main street, pausing to talk with the loafers before the principal drug store, climb the hills and mountains all around the town and look down on the town with a kind of horror and disbelief, an awful dreamlike unreality because the town, since his long absence and return to it, and all the people in it, now seemed as familiar as his mother’s face and stranger than a dream, so that he could never regain his life or corporeal substance in it, any more than a man who revisits his youth in a dream, and so that, also, the town seemed to have shrunk together, got little, fragile, toy-like in his absence, until now when he walked in the street he thought he was going to ram his elbows through the walls, as if the walls were paper, or tear down the buildings, as if they had been made of straw.",

My mouth felt like I'd been chewing sandpaper from the bottom of a budgie cage, and I could sense the blood vessels pulsing in my eyeballs. My naked upper half felt strangely cool and damp to the touch, like a recently deceased corpse, and the air on the bus, like old veg soup, reminded me that my fellow passengers had also spent the last six hours expelling all their bodily toxins in this mobile sauna. And now it seemed I was hallucinating. Straining to see through the orange tinted glass, I was sure I could detect a subtle change in the light out of the right hand window, and hardly dared to believe that what I was witnessing, was the first glow of sunrise. The beginning of a new day, and the end to this intolerable journey. I pressed my nose to the glass like a child on a long car journey, and willed the sun to appear. As it slowly appeared above the low hills on the horizon, it filled the bus with a warm, apricot glow and my fellow passengers, Kirsty included, began to stir from their fitful sleep. She was surprised to find me, wired and grinning manically, as I jabbered a detailed commentary on the sun's ascent and my estimate of how many miles, and hours we had left on the bus. I'd moved beyond exhaustion, and extreme physical discomfort to a place where anything was better than another hour sitting hunched, sweating and sleepless in this steel capsule of torture.",

My thirst was now an ache dominating both body and mind and when I saw a shallow river, some 400 feet below this ledge, I rushed back for my bottle and made three attempts to reach the ravine. Thirst is so compulsive that sufferers within sight of water tend to disregard safety; but it was no use – everywhere the last hundred and fifty feet were sheer, smooth rock. The baboons now reappeared, far below me at the water’s edge, and I realised that when last seen they had been on their way to the local, as it were. For a few moments I stared at them gloomily, contemplating the disadvantages of having evolved. Then I precariously climbed back to camp and ate a tin of tuna fish, which considerably increased my thirst.",

And then it struck me how much easier it is for anyone who has been brought up a Catholic to ‘take’ Tibetan ritual, which for so many non-Catholic Christians is merely a revolting mess of incense-burning, bead-telling, genuflecting, incomprehensible chanting, and all sorts of crude superstitions like throwing blessed water around and lighting joss-sticks in front of religious pictures. Watching Buddhist ceremonies makes one realise how close Catholicism has remained to the East – which means that in this era of religious ‘getting together’ the Catholic Church has a shorter journey ahead of her, on one level, than some other Christian denominations. It seems odd that the majority of northern European Christians have felt compelled to turn Christianity into a bleak, sterilised affair, with a high resistance to the germs of mystery and of awe. And often people who have been brought up in this tradition of ‘common-sense Christianity’ become uneasy at ceremonies that allow for those unknown and ‘un-guess-atable’ elements which lie at the heart of every religion. Yet their brisk scorn of ‘all this nonsense’ seems to betray an unadmitted fear that the whole thing may be more complex than they would like to think.",
