    "target_paragraph": "¶ Paul Catchik Chater, a Christian Armenian from Calcutta, disembarked in Hong Kong in 1864, aged eighteen. Starting as a bank clerk, he soon had a finger in every kind of profitable pie – wharfing, electricity, rope-making, trams, ferries, banking, hotels, land. His Hong Kong and Kowloon Wharf and Godown Company became Hong Kong’s chief dock operators, his most brilliant real-estate coup was the Praya Reclamation Scheme in Central, which created a slab of the most valuable building land on earth. An Anglophile and enthusiastic royalist, Chater threw himself into all the right activities (almost all – his young Scandinavian wife, extracted from Lyndhurst Terrace, was never accepted at Government House). He was a Mason, an art collector, a passionate racegoer. He became almost unbelievably rich, and built himself a vast and awful palace in mid-Levels called Marble Hall. When he died on a May morning in 1926 he left instructions that he was to be buried within twelve hours. The Stock Exchange, having opened as usual, hastily closed its doors again to prepare for the funeral, and by five the same evening the old millionaire was safely under the turf.",

Warmed by the sun the small pools of water were a pleasant bathtub temperature. We hadn’t taken a decent wash in warm water in weeks. As we soaked we spoke and joked about many things. We laughed about man eating lizards, quick to anger Australians, the dangers that lurk in the cockpits of charter boats. Mostly we spoke of an adventure that had barely begun. On that Christmas Eve in the middle of the Bahamas there was nothing mentioned of the trials and tests of our courage and stamina that were inevitably awaiting us. On that day, our most cherished Christmas gift of all was a warm tidal pool and a faith in Quest and ourselves that was completely non-denominational.",

I averted my gaze from the building and quickened my pace. On this high plateau hovels cluster densely around the King’s extravaganza and beyond sight of the sentries I paused to talk to three friendly elders, sitting on low stools outside a kraal. They are very proud of the palace – had I taken photographs to show to people overseas? No, I said – the sentries seemed hostile.",

As you walk past it you can hear muffled squawking on the radio. ‘Attention, attention! Zero Tango Charlie! A Boeing 747 has just crashed into the nuclear power plant on Highway 69. People are wandering around with their hair on fire. Do you read me?’ Inside, oblivious of all this, are the two highway patrolmen, sitting at the counter eating apple pie with ice-cream and shooting the breeze with the waitress. Every once in a great while – perhaps twice in a day – the two patrolmen will get up from the counter and drive out to the highway to ticket some random motorists for trying to cross the state at seven miles an hour above the permitted limit. Then they will go and have some more pie. That is what it is to be a highway patrolman.",

On my first walk down into Havasupai Canyon, which is a branch of the Grand Canyon, never mind exactly where, I took with me only a quart of water, thinking that would be enough for a mere fourteen-mile downhill hike on a warm day in August. At Topocoba on the rim of the canyon the temperature was a tolerable ninety-six degrees but it rose about one degree for each mile on and downward. Like a fool I rationed my water, drank frugally, and could have died of the heatstroke. When late in the afternoon I finally stumbled – sun-dazed, blear-eyed, parched as an old bacon rind – upon that blue stream which flows like a miraculous mirage down the floor of the canyon I was too exhausted to pause and drink soberly from the bank. Dreamily, deliriously, I waded into the waist-deep water and fell on my face. Like a sponge I soaked up moisture through every pore, letting the current bear me along beneath a canopy of overhanging willow trees. I had no fear of drowning in the water – I intended to drink it all.",

She caught the eye of a young cabinetmaker from Haiti named Aristede Limonta who also worked with the Americans. He was dark and handsome, with a husky sex appeal that years later she’d compare to the American singer Barry White. They fell in love and moved into a small wooden house on the corner of Céspedes and Eighth, on the south side of the city of Guantánamo. When Zenaida became pregnant, she made a sacred vow to the Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, Cuba’s patron saint, whose sanctuary sits on a hill outside the city of Santiago. If the baby is a girl, she promised, her name will be Caridad.",

The axe still glanced off here and there and I had to rest often. I started the cut too narrow, and at the bottom of the V, the wood pinched the blade of the axe tight. The last swings to chop it free were the most difficult and awkward of the half-an-hour’s production, and taught me a critical thing: even a simple task relied on precision, and was easier if you planned ahead. The six-foot section finally dropped free of the trunk. Reba and I rolled it off to the side of the trail, then tipped it onto its angled butt and toppled it forward in a move I’d soon learn to call an “end-o.” Its bulk surprised me. So recently alive, the log was full of sap and water. It would take a year on the ground before it dried out enough to mimic the lighter-than-expected heft of well-seasoned firewood.",

But I live in jammed Manhattan, and I can stuff my shortboards in closets and corners, under beds, in homemade ceiling racks. I can jump on trains and buses, even the subway, with a shortboard, run through airports with relative ease, and lock boards inside cars, where a longboard wouldn’t fit. So I keep putting off the inevitable. In small, weak waves, I struggle to my feet now, especially if I’m wearing a thick wetsuit. A longboard would be a blessing on those days—easy, graceful gliding rather than blown waves and frustration. Instead, I avoid small, weak waves. In waves even slightly bigger, my shortboards still work fine. The stronger push, the vertical dimension—the board drops away on takeoffs, leaving room for my feet to get under me properly. I’m not riding tiny, up-to-the-minute boards, which are now mostly under six feet. I am, however, still riding boards that, by my standards, are loose and quick and fit nicely in the barrel—in those rare, electric moments when I manage to find my way there.",

For a silent movie to be sold overseas, it simply needed new title cards inserted, but, pending the invention of dubbing and subtitles, sound movies could only be shown where people spoke the language in which the movie was made. One solution was to make multiple versions of a movie, using a single set but with up to ten different troupes of actors from different language groups filming one version after another.",

It was just large enough to hold me, and it sloped back inland, so that I did not feel tipped out towards the cliff edge. I lay awake until midnight in my comfortable niche, watching the weather out over the Atlantic. It was a night of odd temperatures: the air cold enough for my breath to show white in it, but warm enough for lightning to gather and strike, bright wires standing again and again far out to sea, their light strobing on the cliffs around me.",

We produce a top award-winning olive oil every October. We’ve even accomplished another restoration—new roof, internal systems upgraded, and a conversion of the limonaia (lemon house) into a spacious kitchen with a greenhouse alcove. The restoration ripped the garden, which inspired new plantings and design. (I will not be chronicling that restoration. Enough!) Periodic renewal is always good. So is tradition. Every year the balcony and stone walls are festooned with the same big pots of trailing geraniums. The scent of jasmine wafts up through the bedroom windows. Lemon trees still define the garden entrance, and every year I have my plot of herbs and vegetables. My study on the third floor remains the same.",
