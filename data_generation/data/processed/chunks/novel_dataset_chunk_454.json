It’s impossible to describe the relief of seeing and feeling this grey dampness; of course the temperature was still about seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit – but what a joy, after the glare of the past weeks, to experience such cool dimness and to find clouds still shielding us as the morning progressed! Then at midday the sun reasserted itself and shone until about five o’clock when (cheers!) the monsoon started – not with any spectacular storm but just as a steady downpour, accompanied by incessant rumblings of thunder and frequent glares of blue sheet-lightning. On my way home from supper at Kay’s house I fell repeatedly on the slippery, flooded road, in the coal-black intervals between lightning flashes that clearly and beautifully illuminated the whole width of the valley; and now the din of heavy rain on the tin roof is so deafening that I can hardly hear myself think.",

Only water was available in the bakery where a memorably handsome young man interrupted his domino contest to fill our bottles – for free.

Finding a last piece of mango, I split it in two and throw the pieces in the air.

On these, turkeys were energetically breakfasting, the cocks often pausing to display magnificent quivering fans. Then, from yard after yard, came flocks of shrill guinea-fowl and a superb variety of hens and richly plumaged cocks. Grey and white geese halted on their way to the frozen river and hissed aggressively at the stranger – then waddled frustratedly over the ice, thrusting long necks this way and that like caricatures of disapproving school-marms. A shrunken old man, tripping over a patched army greatcoat several sizes too large, led a bony cow to the river’s edge and smashed the ice with an axe. At once geese and ducks came quacking and flapping from every direction and I too stopped to drink from cupped hands – which within seconds were numbed. The old man responded to my greeting with a scared glance and a mumble; seemingly he had not divined my foreignness till I spoke.",

He pulled in and asked a passer-by, an old Kurd in a dusty pinstripe jacket. The two exchanged anxious words in Kurdish, then he drove on.\n\n‘What did he say?’\n\n‘Don’t worry,’ said the driver. ‘It’s nothing.’",

If we had, we might have seen that we were in the middle of nowhere. I stared at the map and grumbled. Where are we? This can’t be Alexandria. This can’t be the city center. In fact, it was, but it wasn’t. City Center, I later learned, is a modern, full-service shopping mall with marble floors, ice-cold air-conditioning, restaurants, grocery store, and a cinema. The development fills a larger corner of Moharem Bek, a sprawling neighborhood south and east of downtown Alexandria. On-line, the mall sounded quite nice, but City Centre is, in fact, several miles from the city center, which, I quickly learned, didn’t matter, because we were nowhere City Center either. In fact, we were on some unpretty industrial road between the mall and the airport. I flipped through the guidebook, lost in maps and tiny fonts and wondering whether to buy reading glasses when I got home. I drew my finger back and forth across the map. Dammit. There it was, right on the map in our guidebook, a little grey icon in the shape of a bus: Al Mo’af Al Gedid, the city’s newish intermodal bus station. We were nowhere downtown, nowhere near the Corniche, nowhere near our hotel.",

Jane Austen has been embangled and set down in the drawing rooms of Calcutta in the work of Vikram Seth, and Dickens has been given a spin and relocated to a dusty Bombay apartment block in the novels of Rohinton Mistry. The Empire never left, it’s tempting to conclude; it just settled down in a backstreet in Madras, and started to tell its story from the other side.",

I took a seat at an open-air taverna, ordered a Coke and gazed across the water to the white houses gleaming on the brown hillside of Uskudar two miles across the strait. Distant cars glinted in the hot sunshine and ferries plied doggedly back and forth across the Bosphorus and on out to the distant Princes’ Islands, adrift in a bluish haze. It was beautiful and a perfect place to stop.",

The house had never been his anyway, but now even the new planks and sills and shingles, the hearth and stove and bed, were all a part of the memory of somebody else, so that he stopped in the half-open gate and said aloud, as though he had gone to sleep in one place and then waked suddenly to find himself in another: “Whut’s Ah doin hyar?” before he went on. Then he saw the dog. He had forgotten it. He remembered neither seeing nor hearing it since it began to howl just before dawn yesterday—a big dog, a hound with a strain of mastiff from somewhere (he had told Mannie a month after they married: “Ah needs a big dawg. You’s de onliest least thing whut ever kep up wid me one day, leff alone fo weeks.”) coming out from beneath the gallery and approaching, not running but seeming rather to drift across the dusk until it stood lightly against his leg, its head raised until the tips of his fingers just touched it, facing the house and making no sound; whereupon, as if the animal controlled it, had lain guardian before it during his absence and only this instant relinquished, the shell of planks and shingles facing him solidified, filled, and for the moment he believed that he could not possibly enter it. “But Ah needs to eat,” he said. “Us bofe needs to eat,” he said, moving on though the dog did not follow until he turned and cursed it. “Come on hyar!” he said. “Whut you skeered of? She lacked you too, same as me,” and they mounted the steps and crossed the porch and entered the house—the dusk-filled single room where all those six months were now crammed and crowded into one instant of time until there was no space left for air to breathe, crammed and crowded about the hearth where the fire which was to have lasted to the end of them, before which in the days before he was able to buy the stove he would enter after his four-mile walk from the mill and find her, the shape of her narrow back and haunches squatting, one narrow spread hand shielding her face from the blaze over which the other hand held the skillet, had already fallen to a dry, light soilure of dead ashes when the sun rose yesterday—and himself standing there while the last of light died about the strong and indomitable beating of his heart and the deep steady arch and collapse of his chest which walking fast over the rough going of woods and fields had not increased and standing still in the quiet and fading room had not slowed down.",

But the public relations people in Europe had asked for an article about the airstrip in Uli, so he left reluctantly, very early in the morning, so he would be back before midday when Nigerian planes strafed vehicles driving on major roads. A wide bomb crater loomed ahead on Okigwe Road. The driver swerved to avoid it and Richard felt a familiar foreboding, but his thoughts lightened as they approached Uli. It was his first visit to Biafra’s only link to the outside world, this wonder of an airstrip where food and arms evaded Nigerian bombers. He climbed out of the car and looked at the strip of tarmac with thick bush on either side and thought of the people who did so much with so little. A tiny jet was parked at the far end. The morning sun was hot; three men were spreading palm fronds on the tarmac, working swiftly and sweating, pushing along large carts piled with fronds. Richard went over to say, “Well done, jisienu ike.”",

I am quite taken with the glass pyramid at the Louvre and those buildings at La Defense that have the huge holes in the middle ? but I just hate the way architects and city planners and everyone else responsible for urban life seems to have lost sight of what cities are for. They are for people. That seems obvious enough, but for half a century we have been building cities that are for almost anything else: for cars, for businesses, for developers, for people with money and bold visions who refuse to see cities from ground level, as places in which people must live and function and get around. Why should I have to walk through a damp tunnel and negotiate two sets of stairs to get across a busy street? Why should cars be given priority over me? How can we be so rich and so stupid at the same time? It is the curse of our century ? too much money, too little sense ? and the Pompidou seems to me a kind of celebration of that in plastic.",

    "target_paragraph": "Sylvia Tietjens rose from her end of the lunch-table and swayed along it, carrying her plate. She still wore her hair in bandeaux and her skirts as long as she possibly could: she didn’t, she said, with her height, intend to be taken for a girl guide. She hadn’t, in complexion, in figure or in the languor of her gestures, aged by a minute. You couldn’t discover in the skin of her face any deadness: in her eyes the shade more of fatigue than she intended to express, but she had purposely increased her air of scornful insolence. That was because she felt that her hold over men increased to the measure of her coldness. Someone, she knew, had once said of a dangerous woman, that when she entered the room every woman kept her husband on the leash. It was Sylvia’s pleasure to think that, before she went out of that room, all the women in it realized with mortification—that they needn’t! For if coolly and distinctly she had said on entering: ‘Nothing doing!’ as barmaids will to the enterprising, she couldn’t more plainly have conveyed to the other women that she had no use for their treasured rubbish.",

He grabbed the VHF radio mic and called the Coast Guard. The radio crackled to life. They were around the bend at the channel entrance to the marina, waiting to escort them to the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. It was a beautiful morning that first week of October. The trees along the river were ablaze in color, and there was indeed a chill in the air. Rob had layers of clothes on to fend off the cold. As they reached the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, he radioed the patrol boat and thanked them for the escort. As they passed under the bridge, he looked up at the mast – one foot of clearance, he thought. He could see the underside of the cars through the draw bridge grate above. They were all headed to work at that hour. Strange, he thought, he wouldn’t be working in this town again.

I saw the shining of shop-fronts, the yellow glistening of a wet pavement, the hurrying people, the cabs, the omnibuses—and I wished I were amid it all.\nWhat did it mean, but that I wished I were young again? Not seldom I have a sudden vision of a London street, perhaps the dreariest and ugliest, which for a moment gives me a feeling of home-sickness. Often it is the High Street of Islington, which I have not seen for a quarter of a century, at least; no thoroughfare in all London less attractive to the imagination, one would say; but I see myself walking there—walking with the quick, light step of youth, and there, of course, is the charm. I see myself, after a long day of work and loneliness, setting forth from my lodging. For the weather I care nothing; rain, wind, fog—what does it matter! The fresh air fills my lungs; my blood circles rapidly; I feel my muscles, and have a pleasure in the hardness of the stone I tread upon. Perhaps I have money in my pocket; I am going to the theatre, and, afterwards, I shall treat myself to supper—sausage and mashed potatoes, with a pint of foaming ale. The gusto with which I look forward to each and every enjoyment! At the pit-door, I shall roll and hustle amid the throng, and find it amusing. Nothing tires me. Late at night, I shall walk all the way back to Islington, most likely singing as I go. Not because I am happy—nay, I am anything but that; but my age is something and twenty; I am strong and well.\nPut me in a London street this chill, damp night, and I should be lost in barren discomfort. But in those old days, if I am not mistaken, I rather preferred the seasons of bad weather; I had, in fact, the true instinct of townsfolk, which finds pleasure in the triumph of artificial circumstance over natural conditions, delighting in a glare and tumult of busy life under hostile heavens which, elsewhere, would mean shivering ill-content. The theatre, at such a time, is doubly warm and bright; every shop is a happy harbour of refuge—there, behind the counter, stand persons quite at their ease, ready to chat as they serve you; the supper bars make tempting display under their many gas-jets; the public houses are full of people who all have money to spend. Then clangs out the piano-organ—and what could be cheerier!\nI have much ado to believe that I really felt so. But then, if life had not somehow made itself tolerable to me, how should I have lived through those many years? Human creatures have a marvellous power of adapting themselves to necessity. Were I, even now, thrown back into squalid London, with no choice but to abide and work there—should I not abide and work? Notwithstanding thoughts of the chemist's shop, I suppose I should.",

Regulation businessmen, in ties and glasses, were marching around in platoons, jackets slung over their shoulders and, in their hands, matching bullhorns through which they could shout out the verses of their company song. In one spot, twenty-five Nissan cheerleaders had gathered in a circle, and were dancing, dervishing and chanting in a whirlwind show of team spirit. Players were being tossed into the air by their fellows. All about, there was shouting, singing, pep-rally frenzy. The tension was palpable, the excitement mounting. Both teams were clearly ready to go.",

I took refuge in Kasese, a smallish town tucked into the arid foothills of the Ruwenzori and more important than it looks.

The challenge of fitting the boxes together had an element of puzzle solving to it, like 3D Tetris. We placed bigger boxes below and stacked lighter ones on top.

It’s an appealing setting, open and filled with light. It’s easy to see why McCandless decided to make this his base camp.",

Or everybody except one, he added to himself because before he reached the store Will Varner came out of it and got onto the white horse which someone had just untied and held for him, and on the gallery beyond Ratliff now saw the eruption of men whose laden wagons stood along the road opposite, waiting for the scales, and as he drove up to the gallery in his turn, Mink Snopes and the other Snopes, the proverbist, the school-teacher (he now wore a new frock coat which, for all its newness, looked no less like it belonged to him than the old one in which Ratliff had first seen him did) came down the steps. Ratliff saw the intractable face now cold and still with fury behind the single eyebrow; beside it the rodent’s face of the teacher, the two of them seeming to pass him in a whirling of flung un-coordinated hands and arms out of the new, black, swirling frock coat, the voice that, also like the gestures, seemed to be not servant but master of the body which supplied blood and wind to them:",

He advised me to sit among the rocks at midnight and in the hot afternoons, conversing with the genii of earth and air. It would correct my worldly perspective. I think he may be right, in a way. There is something in it. So I asked him to climb into the hills with me, then and there, in order to get into touch with elemental Powers. He said he thought highly of my character, but as to climbing about in this heat—he said he'd be damned if he would. Those were his very words. He wanted to sleep.

Then he was thinking, and he frowned and rubbed his head hard, to help him in his thinking. Then he smiled again, but now his smiling was not very pleasant. His smile was now wavering on the edge of scorning. His smile changed more and more, and then he had a look as if he were deeply down, all disgusted.

    "target_paragraph": "My head was full of Hunyadi and I paced the yards and climbed the steps and explored the vaulted chambers in a state of great excitement. He is the most celebrated hero in Hungarian history; Rumanians rightly claim him as a kinsman; and he was the greatest fifteenth-century champion of the whole of Christendom. When young, he entered the service of King Sigismund of Hungary (son of the blind King of Bohemia killed at Crecy; and, later, Holy Roman Emperor), whose natural son Hunyadi was sometimes rumoured to be. He won brilliant victories, ruled Transylvania in times of trouble and finally administered the whole kingdom. His campaign in the Balkans broke the Sultan’s power in Herzegovina, Bosnia, Serbia, Bulgaria and Albania; and his greatest single achievement was the rout, outside beleaguered Belgrade, of the army of Mehmet II, three years after the conquering Sultan had captured Constantinople. This deliverance, and the triumph over the invincible Mehmet, were re-celebrated daily by church bells rung at noon throughout the Catholic world; in Hungary they still are. The victory had reprieved the kingdom for seventy more years, until the battle of Mohács, in fact. Known all over Europe as the White Knight, he was not only a great commander and statesman, but a rock of uprightness in a kingdom and an age that seethed with conspiracy.",
