He couldn’t believe that he couldn’t have everything, and so just wouldn’t choose. And I would tell him, so full of twentysomething wisdom, that life is almost never about choosing between one thing you really want and another thing you don’t want at all. If you’re lucky, and healthy, and live in a country where you have enough to eat and no fear that you’re going to get shot when you walk out your door, life is an endless series of choosing between two things you want almost equally. And you have to evaluate and determine which awesome thing you want infinitesimally more, and then give up that other awesome thing you want almost exactly as much.

Inside the station, a woman in a pink cap and low-cut T-shirt was handing out free newspapers to passing commuters.

He spreads out his fingers on his chest, warming everything he can. He has enormous hands. Yesterday I received a shock so hard my thumb went numb for half an hour. I was trying to pull the cord that turns on the overhead light in my study from the inside of the radiator, where it somehow had fallen. The clicker I had hold of split, leaving me with my thumb on the hot wires, my other hand on the metal radiator. I screamed and jumped back. That mindless, animal feeling of shock—I wonder if the man in the doorway feels that way in the sun. His life force siphoning off, the great solar energy coming at him, filling him up. His wife sits beside him and appears to be waiting. She’s not mending or pinching back her flowers. She’s his guard for his trip to the underworld. Perhaps she’ll dry his dead body, then anoint his bones with olive oil and wine. Or maybe the heat is getting to me, too, and he’s just recovering from an appendectomy.",

To the people of Khapalu he is still their beloved ‘Raja Sahib’, a man very nearly as poor as themselves in material possessions, but full of wisdom, and of concern for their well-being, and surrounded by the irreplaceable aura of some seven centuries of inherited authority. He himself is altogether without bitterness towards the Pakistani government; he is too dignified and profoundly self-assured for petty resentment, and too intelligent to imagine that any inhabited corner of the world can escape ‘Progress’ in the 1970s. But he does not disguise his personal antipathy to the trappings of Progress and it delighted me to hear him referring to jeeps and aeroplanes in a tone that put them on a level with disease-carrying insects. I laughingly remarked on this and he promptly pointed out that such machines are disease-carriers. Thirty years ago, when it took three weeks to walk in from down-country, smallpox, typhoid, TB and measles were virtually unknown here: now they are common.",

Just ahead of our party stood some guys from Mason City, Iowa, who had obtained a quick-visit visa in Nome and had flown over in their own plane on a whim to see what Russia was like. They told us they didn’t think much of it. From some inner airport office V——, the Chukotka minister of tourism, emerged with a couple of aides. The minister had curly blond hair, blue eyes, and the personable manner of a casino greeter. He spoke English well and asked the people in line if they’d had a good time. He got to our party right before we went through the door. In his spotless blue warm-up jersey and pants highlighted with parallel white stripes on the sides, he shook our hands and listened with his head cocked inquisitively. Seizing the moment, Karen said to him, “V——, Sandy here [indicating me] told us that most of the money we paid for this trip was spent on bribes. Is that really true?”",

In his haste to leave on his journey with Kataktovik, he’d written his instructions to Munro telling him to move to Rodger’s Harbor in mid-July, when they should expect rescue.

The waves there looked barely half the size of the gargantuan stuff on the north side, and almost manageable. There was still the question of getting out, however. People sometimes paddled out underneath the pier—a regular rip current, carrying water that the surf had piled up near the beach back out to sea, had dug a deep trench under the pier, so that waves rarely broke there. But it was nasty under the pier. There were loose cables dangling, and huge iron sheets sticking up at odd angles under the water, not to mention the pilings themselves, which were closely spaced and did not budge when the surf slammed you into them. I had paddled out under the pier a few times, on days when getting out at Sloat had been beyond me, but I had sworn not to do it again. In any case, even paddling out under the pier looked impossible this morning. Broken waves were rumbling through the pilings like small avalanches through an iron forest. The only nonlethal way to get out today would be to sneak past the guard on the construction project, run out on the pier, and jump off the end, which was safely outside the surf.",

We sit there for a bit, still holding hands, the escalating moan of the wind making us feel that much safer inside. A warm cloak of relief envelopes me as I crawl into my sleeping bag and shove earplugs into my ears. Drowsily I run my fingers through my hair, taking note of the thousands of grains of sand that now reside on my scalp, tiny fellow travelers on the road to Siberia. Then I search out Bernard’s hand again, reassured by the warmth of his skin that he’s still there with me.",

At the turn of tides, it can achieve a sleek calmness, but when the tides run, the water seethes and there is a submarine twining of currents. Where the races meet, waves stand up like shark-fins, and bubbles rise in gouts, as though the seabed itself were being stirred.",

    "target_paragraph": "I half wished, when I set off, that my plans were leading me in another direction, for a couple of days’ march north-east would have brought me to the Hortobágy desert and its herds of wild horses and their fierce and famous herdsmen. (Rather surprisingly these spurred and whip-cracking gauchos were strict Protestants; Debrecen, their steppe capital, had been a Calvinist stronghold since the Reformation.) But I had been swayed by the old maps in the library the day before and there were satisfactory hints of remoteness and desolation in the south-eastern route I was actually taking. A hundred years ago much of this stretch of the Alföld resembled a vast bog relieved by a few oases of higher ground. Hamlets were grudgingly scattered and, unlike the old village of Körösladány, many of these were nineteenth-century settlements which had sprung up when the marsh was drained. The air of desolation was confirmed by those tall and catapult-like sweep-wells rearing their timbers into the emptiness. In the southern parts of the Cuman region celebrated by Petöfi – it is strange how the names of Hungarian poets cropped up the whole time in conversation and books! – heavy rains often marooned the villages on their small hills, until they formed little archipelagoes only to be reached in flat-bottomed boats. But, to redress the balance, there were regions near Szeged which July and August dried up into glittering tracts of soda crystals, and to unwary travellers, already perplexed by mirages and dust-devils, these crystalline acres must have completed the summer’s hallucinations. Shallow lakes had been known to dry up completely then fill once more until, after a short evolutionary gap, reeds grew again, fish swam, tadpoles followed and frogs began to croak. It was refreshing to think of the unchanging carp-filled lakes of the south-west and the teeming abundance of the Tisza; and what about the fish those boys had been whisking out of the swift Körös by the armful? When the forlorn woods that lay all about me were no-man’s-land still, betyárs infested them: affable highwaymen and brigands who held travellers to ransom, drove away flocks and herds and levied tribute from noblemen islanded in their castles. It was a region of hazards, legends and fierce deeds.",

She paused a moment, glancing about her, calmly taking the measure of her situation. She heard someone ask a question about the date of the will; she caught a fragment of the lawyer’s answer – something about a sudden summons, and an ‘earlier instrument’. Then the tide of dispersal began to drift past her; Mrs Jack Stepney and Mrs Herbert Melson stood on the doorstep awaiting their motor; a sympathizing group escorted Grace Stepney to the cab it was felt to be fitting she should take, though she lived but a street or two away; and Miss Bart and Gerty found themselves almost alone in the purple drawing-room, which more than ever, in its stuffy dimness, resembled a well-kept family vault, in which the last corpse had just been decently deposited.",

A sign outside the Elks Lodge at the main intersection advertised steak night on Saturday. The supermarket was closed on Sunday. Politically, Wrangell was a dark crimson spot within a deep red state. At the diner where I ate breakfast following my run-in with the seminude man at the hotel, the TV sets were tuned to a low-budget network somewhat to the right of Fox News, and the counter held stacks of Guns & Ammo and Soldier of Fortune. I flipped through a three-year-old issue of North American Whitetail and brushed up on bowhunting techniques as I ate my oatmeal. One of the most contentious presidential races in U.S. history was brewing down south, but in Wrangell the only posters hung in store windows hyped the contest between Kyla and Alex for queen of the 4th of July Celebration.",

For most visitors, the main attractions of the park are Todai-ji’s Hall of the Great Buddha and Kasuga Shrine, with its walkway lined with hundreds of stone lanterns. Nandaimon is seen as no more than something you have to walk under to get to Todai-ji. However, for me, Nandaimon is the one perfect structure in the park. Built during the thirteenth century, when timber was plentiful, its huge pillars soar almost twenty-one meters into the air. The towering figures of two wrathful temple guardians are Kamakura originals, with furious faces and immense power in their bulging muscles. But most breathtaking of all is the massive roof, with eaves flung outwards and upwards like a bird taking flight.",

It was raining gently, and as she stood at the door, breathing in the mild damp air, she watched the curious shadows that trembled on the pavement under the trees. Morris disappeared under the shadows round the corner. She remembered how she used to stand at the door when he was a small boy and went to a day school with a satchel in his hand. She used to wave to him; and when he got to the corner he always turned and waved back. It was a curious little ceremony, dropped now that they were both grown up. The shadows shook as she stood waiting; in a moment he emerged from the shadows. He came along the street and up the steps.",

A bitter priest, too, bent on taking the Kingdom of Heaven by violence, and dragging her along with him. Flight, panic-stricken flight from whatever it was that had happened to him, flight into austerity, into a frantic concentration on saving and being saved, was what he was suddenly set on. He gave up his nice, comfortable curacy in Kensington, took vows and made her take them, turned his back and made her turn hers, for ever on everything except self-denial, and settled in the poorest part of Bethnal Green, using its sordidness as if it were a hair shirt. Why? For ten years she had puzzled miserably over this question, never daring to ask him the reason, because the look on his face, if she tried to approach the subject, shut her mouth; and now--",

The hostess seated us at a small table next to a window with a clear view of the pyramids. We ordered coffee for Teresa and water for me then explored the buffet. The food looked familiar, but with a local twist. I passed a large tray of bacon (beef) and sausages (beef) and roasted potatoes (not beef, but soaked in beef gravy). At the next station, a chef cheerily offered to prepare eggs in any manner of ways. At another table, I found something I didn’t recognize at all: fuul medames. Fuul is a traditional Egyptian dish of mashed and spiced fava beans, and it’s extremely popular in Egypt. At best, the dish looks a lot like refried beans. At worst, the dish looks a lot like, well, nothing I wanted to eat. I moved on, my plate empty, past a table filled with sliced fruits (I never trust sliced fruit in a buffet) and loaves of bread in every shape, size, and style. The next table offered chilled yoghurts and dry cereals. Still, my plate was empty. I bumped into Teresa. She had filled her plate with something from every station, except the fuul. Faced with too many choices in unfamiliar varieties, in the end, I settled on a couple pastries and a square of cheese.",

    "target_paragraph": "As Amsterdam thrived, it became a magnet for not only the entrepreneurial but also the persecuted. Just as later generations of Afghans and Iranians would flock to New York or London, persecuted minorities such as Sephardic Jews and French Huguenots fled to Amsterdam from France, Spain and Portugal. Swelled further by the ranks of Dutch farmers moving to the city in search of wealth, the population more than tripled between the 1580s and 1620s. The arrivals included prominent scientists and thinkers such as Baruch de Spinoza, a philosopher whose parents had fled from Portugal to Amsterdam, and the French philosopher Pierre Bayle, who immigrated to Rotterdam. It was in Amsterdam that Descartes published his Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One’s Reason and of Seeking Truth in Sciences (in which he wrote ‘I think therefore I am’). ‘In what other country could you find such complete freedom,’ he asked, ‘or sleep with less anxiety?’ Thomas Hobbes had his books printed in the Netherlands and Voltaire visited seven times, even setting part of his famous novel Candide in Amsterdam. The Dutch scholar Hugo Grotius established many of the basic principles of international law, including that of ‘Freedom of the Seas’, while the philosopher John Locke did some of his best work in Amsterdam. The latter’s diary praised the Dutch for their cheap bookshops, but complained bitterly about ‘the hardest winter in the memory of man’ and recommended warming up with hot tea mixed with eggs and sugar. The University of Leiden, established by William of Orange as a sign of his gratitude for the city’s support in the struggle for Dutch independence from Spain, became one of the finest in Europe. When Galileo’s claims that the sun rather than the earth lay at the centre of the solar system were banned by the Catholic Church, it was in Leiden that he was able to publish them. As Bertrand Russell wrote in his magisterial history of philosophy: ‘It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of Holland in the seventeenth century.’",

I always will! . . . Of course, with you it’s apparently on one day and off the next, but . . . well—” again the little twisted smile—“I’m just not built that way. . . .

The rope served only to curb its direction, not its speed, and among shouts from the pavement on either hand he swung the animal into another street. This was a quieter street; soon they would be in the country and the stallion could exhaust its rage without the added hazards of motors and pedestrians. Voices faded behind him in his own thunder: “Runaway! Runaway!” but the street was deserted save for a small automobile going in the same direction, and further along beneath the green tunnel, bright small spots of color scuttled out of the street. Children. Hope they stay there, he said to himself. His eyes were streaming a little; beneath him the surging lift and fall; in his nostrils a sharpness of rage and energy and violated pride like smoke from the animal’s body, and he swept past the motor car, remarking in a flashing second a woman’s face and a mouth partly open and two eyes round with tranquil astonishment. But the face flashed away without registering on his mind and he saw the children huddled on one side of the street, and on the opposite side a negro playing a hose on the sidewalk, and beside him a second negro with a pitchfork.",

I don’t suppose you’d care to come to see—us?” What was the etiquette on these occasions? One couldn’t imagine little Mademoiselle Raigneau in their rue gauche little bedrooms. “We live in such a funny part. But you see being Americans, we love it.” “O yes. I know many Americans. My pupils. Girls who have har-mon-y with Walter.” “Does Walter teach?” “Well not really—much.” Dear little Mademoiselle Raigneau, smiling and such an entente all at once flaming up between them. A big fire in the autumn burning rubbish that was the smile between them. O, don’t scatter the leaves, pile them in, don’t let the wind blow them about. They’ll blow up—you know (they said we mustn’t and set fire to the roof). Roof on fire, a little danger somewhere, being very careful with the slightly illicit pleasure of poking the fire. That was the smile between them. O yes that was the smile between them. They were being something funny together, not the horror, the blank starkly insane horror that stared at one with white sea-eyes out of Walter’s music. Let’s forget Walter. They didn’t talk at all about Walter. They were playing illicitly with garden rakes, at a little barn fire, don’t let the leaves scatter. They’ll find out and stop us. O they were so méchantes, all the time and began talking about clothes and did Mademoiselle—O but let me call you Hermione, Walter does—like dresses? What colours? Yes. She (now you must call me Vérenè—what a heavenly name, it sounds like verbena) herself sometimes liked very pale bois de rose, you know a sort of sea shell rose, do you understand? And Walter though you might think he never cares, sees everything. “Does he see ever? Doesn’t he—feel somehow. I can’t describe it. Isn’t Walter a sort of moth that has frozen, frozen—it’s all very inexact—a sort of moth whose feathers are snow crystals—O dear it sounds like a Christmas tree ornament—dear Vérenè—don’t let’s talk about him.”",

It takes place before dawn on Monday, meaning it ends at dawn with participants wandering dazed in the streets trying to figure out how to get home, or somewhere. Revelers may dress in costumes or just coat themselves with clay mud and brightly colored body paint, and join a band, meaning a group, as in a band of revelers. Each band marches through the streets all night long led by a float (usually pulled by a creeping farm tractor or truck) that carries an actual music band, traditionally a steel pan band. The partiers of the band follow behind the music float doing a slow-walking, jiving dance called chipping. The whole procession is followed by a beer wagon and a mud wagon, which may or may not carry more mud and body paint but always doubles as a “broom wagon” to sweep up and carry band members who are no longer able or willing to walk. Immediately following the mud wagon is the bandwagon of the next band in line, and so on, with the whole J’ouvert parade stretching through the streets for miles.",
