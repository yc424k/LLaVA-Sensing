It’s under this manhole here. Originally they promised access for pilgrims, and lighting as well, but it never materialised. In Jerusalem we Christians are now too small a community to have any influence. We don’t have a lobby. We don’t even have a vote. As a result, in the space of a few months, two of the biggest monasteries ever discovered in the Middle East have been erased from the face of the earth. A visitor passing this spot today would never know any Christian building – let alone a pair of the most important monasteries in Palestine – had ever been here.’",

    "target_paragraph": "The IDF frequently stages training exercises near Palestinian communities, using live ammunition. One such, in the ’90s, left the mayor of Al-Aqaba, Haj Sami Sadeq, paralysed from the waist down. Thereafter he campaigned doggedly until, in 2001, the Israeli High Court ordered the IDF to stop training on Al-Aqaba’s land and move their camp from the entrance to the village. Ignoring this, the authorities in 2003 ordered the demolition of most of Al-Aqaba, including the mosque, nursery school, health centre and many homes. When Mayor Sadeq appealed again to the High Court it submitted to pressure (‘We don’t know from where,’ said Salah) and upheld the demolition orders because all those buildings – raised in Area C on Palestinian land – had gone up without Israeli permission. Yet it was generally known that since 1998 the Civil Administration had been refusing permits to Al-Aqaba families, even for tents and water containers. Salah quoted from a UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs report – agricultural and pastoral communities have endured 90% of the Valley’s demolitions.",

Men squat on the tips of the overloaded low boats arguing ferociously about price and weighing produce with ancient measuring scales. Occasionally there’s a yell and a laugh and a thrown potato whizzes past our heads to plonk into the dark waters. Leathery old faces with no teeth split open as we give the Muslim greeting, “Assalam alaikum”—may peace be with you.",

I met my wife, Corey, in Bloomington, Indiana, in the summer of 2013 and she moved to Atlanta to be with me the following year. When I think about my life with her, my mind is flooded with moments we’ve shared in the states that helped elect Trump, like kayaking the pristine Weeki Wachee River in Hernando County, Florida, which broke 63 to 34 for Trump, or slamming down an enormous plate of bacon cheese fries at an East Tennessee diner with my bisexual best friend—and paying only seven dollars for the privilege. I think about Corey and me cramming our butts into the same creaky Cracker Barrel rocking chair, or sipping coffee together while the Chattahoochee crawls past our favorite bench.",

You’ve a much better time than we had, I may tell you. When I look back upon it, I can hardly believe how things have changed. When we were engaged I wasn’t allowed to go for walks with William alone—someone had always to be in the room with us—I really believe I had to show my parents all his letters!—though they were very fond of him too.

    "target_paragraph": "In the next valley our rio joined a wider stream (not even suggested on the map). Gazing down at this confluence, we remembered the black lake below the pass and felt vaguely sentimental; one doesn’t often accompany a river from birth to death. And nine fordings create a ‘special relationship’. Our path descended to the valley floor about half-a-mile upstream from the confluence, but no bridge was visible. ‘It’ll be fun fording that!’ exclaimed Rachel gleefully. I looked at the swirling brown torrent, some forty yards wide, and had my doubts. There wasn’t even an obvious ford and our path faded away on the valley floor. But then, as we were passing the only hovel in sight, barking dogs brought a young man (Quechua only) to the door and he indicated the shallowest stretch. I undressed before wading in, hanging onto the bridle with one hand and testing the way ahead with my palo. ‘This is terrific fun!’ enthused Rachel, from the dryness and security of the saddle, when we were half-way across. By then the water was above Juana’s belly and coping with the current wasn’t easy. ‘Won’t be such fun if we’re all swept down to the Amazon’, I retorted sourly. But Juana was at her best today and soon we were safely on a pseudo carretera, all grass-grown and traffic-free. This took us through a serpentine valley of green bogland, grey boulders blotched with red-gold lichen, and tall rustling eucalyptus trees grouped around a few red-tiled dwellings. Then we discovered the reason for this carretera’s ‘pseudoness’. A bridge had collapsed, leaving only four slim tree-trunks in situ with wide spaces between them through which the rio could be seen racing rowdily. Juana sensibly refused to have anything to do with this calamity and we found a ford where the river was very nearly a raging torrent. It was much wider than at the previous ford and only thigh-deep; but the current was so much stronger that I had to fight hard to remain upright and even Juana wavered in her course, possibly because I was hanging on so dependently to her neck.",

Below him, save for an occasional motorcar, the quiet thrum of a bicycle, or someone walking briskly to his work with a lean, spare clack of early morning, the KurfÃ¼rstendamm was bare and silent. In the centre of the street, above the tram tracks, the fine trees had already lost their summer freshness--that deep and dark intensity of German green which is the greenest green on earth and which has a kind of forest darkness, a legendary sense of coolness and of magic. The leaves looked faded now, and dusty. They were already touched here and there by the yellowing tinge of autumn. A tram, cream-yellow, spotless, shining like a perfect toy, slid past with a hissing sound upon the rails and at the contacts of the trolley. Except for this, the tram-car made no noise. Like everything the Germans built, the tram and its road-bed were perfect in their function. The rattling and metallic clatter of an American street-car were totally absent. Even the little cobble-stones that paved the space between the tracks were as clean and spotless as if each of them had just been gone over thoroughly with a whisk broom, and the strips of grass that bordered the tracks were as green and velvety as Oxford sward.",

It was in place, hanging from the skies and draped over the river. I raced down to B9 where, amid the neon lights, sari tying, catarrh clearing, toddler whacking and hair combing, Passepartout was curled up like a question mark, still asleep. As the train drew into Tinsukia, the morning dampness drifted through the open doors, bringing with it the smell of moss, mud and rain. It was certainly colder than West Bengal, but not cold enough to warrant the kind of attire that looked more suitable for a ski trip. A pair of newly-weds wore matching balaclavas – the man also wrapped in a checked scarf, while his bride was wearing a pair of fingerless gloves revealing the maroon of her wedding henna.",

Because it was our first day back on the trail, we were flush for food, including perishables like cheese and bread that had to be eaten before they went off or were shaken to bits in our packs, so we rather gorged ourselves, then sat around smoking and chatting idly until persistent and numerous midgelike creatures (no-see-ums, as they are universally known along the trail) drove us into our tents. It was perfect sleeping weather, cool enough to need a bag but warm enough that you could sleep in your underwear, and I was looking forward to a long night’s snooze—indeed was enjoying a long night’s snooze—when, at some indeterminate dark hour, there was a sound nearby that made my eyes fly open. Normally, I slept through everything—through thunderstorms, through Katz’s snoring and noisy midnight pees—so something big enough or distinctive enough to wake me was unusual. There was a sound of undergrowth being disturbed—a click of breaking branches, a weighty pushing through low foliage—and then a kind of large, vaguely irritable snuffling noise.",

This fear is real and deep. It is more like a group of fears. For there is the outspoken fear among the peasants of the work of Zombies. Sit in the market place and pass a day with the market woman and notice how often some vendeuse cries out that a Zombie with its invisible hand has filched her money, or her goods. Or the accusation is made that a Zombie has been set upon her or some one of her family to work a piece of evil. Big Zombies who come in the night to do malice are talked about. Also the little girl Zombies who are sent out by their owners in the dark dawn to sell little packets of roasted coffee. Before sun up their cries of “Cafe grille” can be heard from dark places in the streets and one can only see them if one calls out for the seller to come with her goods. Then the little dead one makes herself visible and mounts the steps.",

He himself was the monster, and it was at him that all the children had been laughing, and the little Princess who he had thought loved him—she too had been merely mocking at his ugliness, and making merry over his twisted limbs. Why had they not left him in the forest, where there was no mirror to tell him how loathsome he was? Why had his father not killed him, rather than sell him to his shame? The hot tears poured down his cheeks, and he tore the white rose to pieces. The sprawling monster did the same, and scattered the faint petals in the air. It grovelled on the ground, and, when he looked at it, it watched him with a face drawn with pain. He crept away, lest he should see it, and covered his eyes with his hands. He crawled, like some wounded thing, into the shadow, and lay there moaning.",

Meantime, however, the fine new temples were being strewn over Greece and Asia Minor, many dedicated to the Emperor, and cities which he had beautified were being named for him all over the place. He flitted, with a sure hand however, with all his baggage trains from one place and project to another; it was Olympus on the move, shrewd and mobile as a newspaperman, subject to fits of melancholy. His taste ran to the ornate, and his sense of scale, rather naturally, was bizarre, though not peculiar to him: bigness was in the air and was expected of him. Even so, his Temple of Venus and Rome over the Forum was really overbearing, and it seems the great architect Apollodorus fell out of favor for caviling at Hadrian’s designs for it, one of his objections being that if the gods stood up they would lift the roof off. Another important project was his tomb, across the Tiber from the tomb of Augustus and more splendid, to be decked with statues like a Christmas tree. But the great toy, or piece of autobiography, the true private and desperate expression of the man, was in Tivoli. It is there among the brambles that you get the only real glimpse of him, standing between the glory and the dark, like a colossal Des Esseintes studding the back of some impossible tortoise, to be defeated in the end by what he must have hated most: smug virtue, and common sense.",

At the age of sixty-two I’ve never owned a piece of property; the tiny, two-room apartment my wife and I have shared for twenty-six years in suburban Nara might almost be a suite in a no-star hotel. By the age of six, I was already spending six months with my parents in a hotel in Chicago, mesmerised by the sound of sirens in the street and the taste of Turtles chocolates; by the age of nine, I was going to school by plane. Nowadays, I often set myself up in such oases of convenient anonymity, my one-man writer’s retreats in which I don’t have to give a thought about food or laundry or maintenance and can live in the alternative world of my imagination for weeks on end.",
