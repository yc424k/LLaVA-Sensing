I thought there might be a party at the hotel. Curious, we followed the crowd around a corner where we found a large, ultramodern mall that filled the lower floors, under the hotel. The city had fasted and slept the day away, and now it was time for the young and hip to celebrate. The clubs open late, at one in the morning, but the popular crowd would arrive at three, and the music would play till sunrise. The prostitutes and billiard halls may be gone, but la belle époque lives on in the discos and shisha lounges and afwas of Alexandria. They would be jammed till all hours. Outclassed, outdressed, and outnumbered, we skipped the hotel, and the mall. Instead, we crossed the Corniche and strolled along the shore, back toward our hotel. The weather was beautiful – cool and dry – but the streets and sidewalks were busy, too busy to enjoy. We surrendered the city to the younger generation and went to bed.",

    "target_paragraph": "A cactus Nello's grandfather planted against the facade has grown to twenty feet, nearly bursting the terra-cotta urn in which it stands, reaching toward the lacy gray first-floor balcony. . . . In the south of Italy, where history is long, small actions have visible consequences. Does this change the moral geography of the mind? . . . Nello knows every piece of furniture in the long reception gallery, one pale-blue-and-white room opening onto another after another and another, rooms made for evenings of scented luxury and murmured conversation, women in long white gowns, languid flirtations. His father built the furniture, faux Baroque. He touches the pieces as we walk through the gallery. “This chair had to have a piece added—here—because the leg was wobbly.” As if it were yesterday. Each object has a story and Nello's story is inseparable from that of the objects. (“Rent, never buy,” says a Neapolitan acquaintance. “Ghosts come back to the houses they have lived in. And you must redecorate quickly; ghosts visit objects they have loved.” “But are there no ghosts who have rented?” I ask; and if so, wouldn't they come back? “Rent, don't buy, and redecorate,” he says again; Italians think reiteration is a form of argument, of logic, even. He lives in hotels, his family house in Posilippo is untenanted. . . . But Nello sleeps in the double bed in which he was born, a happy man.) Nello was a bartender at the Cocumella, now he works for the Italian government in America; his father was a furniture maker, his grandfather a gardener. This was Nello's stepping-stone to success, but sadness waits for him here; through his satisfaction runs a thread of bitterness, perhaps of anger.",

With distance, they looked much alike. Parrish checked his airspeed, the time, the heading; finally, he made a sharp southward turn and began to follow a stream course in the direction of its current, looking for a gravel bar, a man, a canoe. Confidently, he gave up altitude and searched the bending river. He found a great deal of gravel. For thirty, forty miles, he kept searching, until the hills around the river began to diminish in anticipation of—as we could see ahead —the wet-tundra Kobuk plain. If the river was the Salmon, Pourchot was not there. If Pourchot was on the Salmon, Parrish was somewhere else.",

He was in his forties, tall and rangey with a deeply lined face, and he immediately introduced himself. After chatting for a few minutes he invited us for a drink at his tent. He had two women friends with him, and when we arrived they kissed us on both cheeks. Chileans are keen cheek-kissers. It seemed the perfect paradigm of the Latin temperament, especially when compared with the British handshake. I suddenly thought of a moment during the preparations for my trip, when I had gone down to Dorset to visit a half-Chilean, half-British man called Tony who was a descendant of José Miguel Carrera, one of the most influential figures in the Independence movement and a member of a distinguished aristocratic family. We were feeding Tony’s pheasants in a field when he was struck by a reflection. ‘You know, it’s awfully difficult, this business of being both Chilean and British. I feel split in two, with no point of contact between the two halves.’ He had been smoking a pipe when I arrived, like the perfect English gent. After an hour the conversation turned to Chilean history and Bernardo O’Higgins, another Independence hero, whose relationship with Carrera developed into a public feud. In 1821, amid the bitter rivalries generated by the struggle for self-government, Carrera was executed, as his two brothers had been before him. Tony leapt from his chair and strode about the kitchen, waving his arms and telling me that his family used to go to the abattoir on O’Higgins’ birthday and buy a bucket of blood to throw over his statue. ‘And of course,’ he said, pouring himself a straight Scotch, ‘we would never dream of sticking the O’Higgins postage stamp the right way up on our letters.’",

He had graciously pulled off the casing, so I tried the rustic-looking creation, a slightly crushed cylindrical shape, orange-red with flecks of white that had a strong flavor, slightly spicy, lightly smoked. This type of soppressata is found throughout southern Italy and is another PDO pork product of Calabria. Made from the best thigh meat, minced with pieces of lard, salt, pepper and peperoncino (hot pepper), possibly cumin and fennel depending on the locality, stuffed in a large intestine (thoroughly cleaned), the salami takes its name and shape from the pressing it undergoes during the drying process before its five- to six-month aging. Praised as far back as the eighteenth century by the famed Venetian adventurer Casanova, the soppressata stands up to the robust Calabrian red wines and is most often served as an appetizer with other meats, cheeses and bread.",

Moocha is not a popular crossing; between junction and border-post the traffic consisted of one cyclist, coming from Zambia. He was so amazed to meet me that he fell off his bicycle. The track across the final low jungly foothills – innocuous-looking from a distance but very steep – was strewn with pretty, pale pink stones, sharp-edged and hell to walk on. Then, down on a sparsely populated, level plain extending far beyond Moocha, the gale took charge and pedalling was hardly necessary. Here the track consisted of two deep smooth sandy ruts separated by tall vegetation. In this region the Malawian-Zambian border is an abstraction, in no way reflecting those years of Banda-Kaunda hostility. Approaching Moocha, and again over stretches of the Great East Road from Lundazi to Lusaka, the highway itself forms the frontier and one can picnic freely in either country. The same tribe (its name forgotten: I neglected to make a note) lives on both sides – cheerful friendly folk, very black and very poor, who view the border as a ridiculous politicians’ irrelevance.",

Some underling, I assumed – and was considerably disquieted when he waved me into a streamlined but dusty dentist’s chair, picked up an unshiny instrument with unclean hands and began to poke hesitantly around my mouth. As I indicated the seat of the pain I realised that he spoke no more English than a schoolboy in the bazaar, though English is the language of instruction in Pakistan’s dental schools. I made a violent gesture signifying ‘Yank it out!’ but the ‘dental surgeon’ (he really must have inverted commas) shook his head while a fleeting expression of alarm crossed his face. At that moment five laughing young men erupted into the room and everybody exclaimed joyously, shook hands, embraced closely, kissed warmly and began an animated conversation while I sat forgotten, surveying the room and again recognising Skardu’s characteristic aura of unreality. The sleek German equipment seemed very up-to-date but there was no source of running – or even standing – water and I doubt if such equipment could ever be operated effectively on the available electricity supply. After a few moments, and without a glance in my direction, the dentist and his friends disappeared for a quarter of an hour. Rachel advised an immediate retreat, having not unreasonably concluded that our oafish friend had failed his examinations. But by then the whole scene had begun to have a certain macabre fascination for me and I longed to see how the situation would develop.",

A chalky mysticism established itself, a belief that it was a super-conductor of the sympathetic historical mind, allowing simultaneities and compassions to reach out across millennia. On ‘the first // Inhabited heights of chalk’, wrote Louis MacNeice – born in Belfast but educated at Marlborough, near the Downs – ‘I could feel my mind / Crumble and dry like a fossil sponge, I could feel / My body curl like a foetus and the rind / Of a barrow harden round me, to reveal / Millennia hence some inkling of the ways / Of man before he invented plough or wheel’.",

A surly young woman refused to serve me a Beerlao until I had handed over the cash; neither bottle-opener nor glass was provided. She lived in a shack adjoining the store and her husband, a shifty-looking character, at first treated me almost with contempt. As I sat on the exposed ‘veranda’ in a piercingly cold wind a line of silent children assembled nearby; their laughter and play had ceased on my arrival. A score of adults, mostly men, also gathered to stare and exchange muttered remarks. I was relieved when a distracting rat hunt eased the build-up of tension. Suddenly a man raced across the road, pursuing an ordinary brown rat, flinging stones at the fast-moving creature with uncanny accuracy. Twice it was struck before taking refuge among the boulders below the opposite cliff. How badly injured? I wondered – then wished it had been killed. The hunter persisted in poking a stick between the boulders, but unsuccessfully. This seemed like a pursuit inspired by protein deficiency rather than vermin control.",

Only then did he find himself rolling head over heels like a shot rabbit. He was bruised, shaken, pale as death, and out of breath when he got up. But he was calm, and perfectly able to meet the excited crowd of railway men who had gathered round him in a moment. He explained, in gentle and convincing tones, that his wife had started at a moment’s notice for Brittany to her dying mother; that, of course, she was greatly up-set, and he considerably concerned at her state; that he was trying to cheer her up, and had absolutely failed to notice at first that the train was moving out. To the general exclamation, “Why didn’t you go on to Southampton, then, sir?” he objected the inexperience of a young sister-in-law left alone in the house with three small children, and her alarm at his absence, the telegraph offices being closed. He had acted on impulse. “But I don’t think I’ll ever try that again,” he concluded; smiled all round; distributed some small change, and marched without a limp out of the station.",

The school was housed in an edifice of great, if accidental, distinction. It had been created as a pavilion for the World's Fair of 1904, with an Italian sunken garden and porticoes on all four sides. By the time we got there, it was as romantically decrepit as any real Italian ruin. Leaky roof, peeling paint, mounds of dead leaves and bushes run wild were fit surroundings for drawing in charcoal from casts of antique sculpture. I drew Apollo, Hercules, and Hera, then moved on into the sculpture class, where I modelled dogs, horses, praying hands. I loved it all.",

It is very agreeable to be in a country where one needn’t hesitate about sharing a bedroom with a young man whose face one hasn’t even seen clearly. Whatever the other hazards of highland travel, a woman knows that as a woman she can trust every man in every circumstance. This remarkable chivalry is so integral a part of the highland atmosphere that I had come to take it for granted – until it was underlined recently by the behaviour of an ostensibly civilised faranj, who was also staying at Lalibela and who never suffered from the hotel-manager’s initial delusion. His attempts to make me drunk, and then to invade my room, provided much food for thought on the subject of Comparative Civilisations.",

And Mrs Jarvis tells me——’ Mrs Flanders liked Mrs Jarvis, always said of her that she was too good for such a quiet place, and, though she never listened to her discontent and told her at the end of it (looking up, sucking her thread, or taking off her spectacles) that a little peat wrapped round the iris roots keeps them from the frost, and Parrot’s great white sale is Tuesday next, ‘do remember,’—Mrs Flanders knew precisely how Mrs Jarvis felt; and how interesting her letters were, about Mrs Jarvis, could one read them year in, year out—the unpublished works of women, written by the fireside in pale profusion, dried by the flame, for the blotting-paper’s worn to holes and the nib cleft and clotted. Then Captain Barfoot. Him she called ‘the Captain’, spoke of frankly, yet never without reserve. The Captain was enquiring for her about Garfit’s acre; advised chickens; could promise profit; or had the sciatica; or Mrs Barfoot had been indoors for weeks; or the Captain says things look bad, politics that is, for as Jacob knew, the Captain would sometimes talk, as the evening waned, about Ireland or India; and then Mrs Flanders would fall musing about Morty, her brother, lost all these years—had the natives got him, was his ship sunk—would the Admiralty tell her?—the Captain knocking his pipe out, as Jacob knew, rising to go, stiffly stretching to pick up Mrs Flanders’s wool which had rolled beneath the chair. Talk of the chicken farm came back and back, the woman, even at fifty, impulsive at heart, sketching on the cloudy future flocks of Leghorns, Cochin Chinas, Orpingtons; like Jacob in the blur of her outline; but powerful as he was; fresh and vigorous, running about the house, scolding Rebecca.",

Under her arm she was carrying a book, and as she came up she gave it to George.

Aware of Mr. Parish shouldering the trunk, she turned into the open dining-room. Mary followed her and shut the door.\nHer mother sat down, helplessly. Mary saw that she was crying; she had been crying a long time. Her soaked eyelashes were parted by her tears and gathered into points.\n\"Mamma—what is it?\"\n\"What is it? You've disgraced yourself.

    "target_paragraph": "I reached the Afghan frontier in mid-October. All along the Uzbek side, above the flood of the Amu Darya, stretched a triple rampart of barbed wire and minefields, laid to immunise the country against the Islamic insurgency and civil war that had raged for twenty-five years to the south. For two hours I threaded the guard-posts in chilling quiet. It was Friday, and nothing was entering or leaving. Soldiers and Russian officials checked my documents with remote consternation. Foreigners did not cross here. Twice my identity was radioed back to a nervous foreign ministry in Tashkent, while I waited in the sharpening wind, wondering still if they would let me go. To either side the electrified wire and insulators gleamed intact; the watch-towers were all manned.\nAt last, an hour before dusk, the enormous central gates bandaged in razor-wire rasped ajar, and I went out on to the empty span of the Friendship Bridge. For over half a mile its white cantilever hung above the river. The sun was dipping. I was walking across an aerial no-man’s-land, with nothing clear in front except the tapered highway of the bridge, and the river coiled below. My footsteps made a distant scraping in the stillness. Behind me the river port of Termez lay invisible beyond a fringe of reeds. I started, self-steeling, to sing. The asphalt underfoot was spotted with oil and divided by a Russian railtrack long abandoned. Here, in December 1979, the Soviet tanks had poured into Afghanistan; and ten years later it was across this bridge that the last Russian soldier on Afghan soil, the diminutive General Gromov, had walked back into a crumbling Soviet Union.\nThe shores were low and shelving, marking no change in the plain to north or south, where the river wound like an accident: a meandering, mud-coloured sea, glistening with sandbanks. I saw it with dreamlike excitement. This ancient Oxus, the immemorial divide between the Persian and Turkic worlds, had already plunged down half its length out of the Pamirs, and would wander another seven hundred miles north-west over the Turkmen desert to trickle at last into the dying Aral Sea. Over this branch of the Silk Road monks and merchants had travelled to the Afghan kingdom of Bactria, and piously on to India, while Buddhism, long before, had percolated north the other way.\nAs I neared the Afghan lines, I felt an odd lightness: a curiosity about what was going to happen, as if it would happen to someone else. On the shore just ahead, the village of Hairatan appeared to be in ruins. Then a barrier crossed my way, lounging with soldiers. They were swathed in cavalier headscarves and lambskin hats, and they were grinning. One cried in Russian: ‘Welcome Afghanistan!’ A courteous old man led me to a broken-down office, where he stamped my passport without looking at it, and logged me in under an unrecognisable name. A list of candidates for the past presidential election dangled on the crumbling wall. Outside, photographs of the Uzbek general Dostum, the region’s favourite warlord, were plastered on the customs-house gates. But Hairatan seemed a village of refugees. In the days of the Soviet occupation it had been a busy border crossing. Now leftover tin and wood were cobbled into makeshift dwellings, where patriarchs in loose-flowing trousers and careless turbans were striding through rubble.\nThe old man found a driver to take me the fifty miles south to Mazar-e-Sharif. It was nearly night. We entered a desert of yellow-grey dunes pricked with camel-thorn. We had no language between us. The man was swarthy and young, swathed stormily in cloaks and turban; but soon, as if unwrapping a monstrous parcel, he unwound his shawls and there emerged a delicate face with girlish skin and Tajik features. We drove in silence. The road was narrow and deserted. Often the dunes overlapped it in hillocks of ash-blond dust. We passed a lone satellite dish where a shepherd was lighting a campfire. The sand hardened under a glaze of grey stones. Once the rocks were daubed red in warning of mines, and a burnt-out personnel-carrier lay blown upside down. By now the sun was lowering in a blurred disc through dead seams of cloud, touching the horizon. At lonely checkpoints soldiers emerged from their beds in beached shipment containers to stare at us, wearing no uniform, muffled against the wind. It was blowing cold and hard in the darkness as we entered the outskirts of Mazar.\nI found a hotel on the main square. In its gaunt five storeys I was the only guest. The locks of all its rooms were smashed, but there was water in the communal bathroom. The hotelier sent out his son to bring me shashlik from the bazaar: it was dangerous at night, he said. For a long time I stood looking down from my window on the still city, which seemed to be glimmering under water. I felt a light expectancy. This, I thought idly, was how people died: by mistake, imagining themselves bodiless. I took this uncomfortable notion to bed with me, after wedging my door shut with a chair, and lay awake a long time, the bedsprings raking my back.

Before the train had stopped they took flying leaps into the doors, desperate to bag seats for the train’s next journey. Those last seconds became a blur, but Passepartout was rugby-tackled by a mouse of a man wearing bell-bottoms. He threw himself through the doorway while I ducked my head and rolled onto the platform, hoping my skull would not be stamped, if it even survived the impact. Checking for blood and bruises, we brushed ourselves off and gripped hands through the crowds with an air of triumph. So that was rush hour.",

The cost turned out to be modest, according to Boeing. Some fifteen years in the future, the cost of having relocated the capital would exceed by only a hundred and ten million dollars the cost of the capital should it stay in Juneau, in part because the state would be spared the expense of refurbishing its older buildings there. Boeing also decided that so much matériel and manpower would be on hand as a result of the pipeline project that the new capital’s building costs would be significantly reduced. The Boeing report could not help but influence the fate of the initiative on the ballot, and the report left Juneau particularly bitter. Juneau attorneys were quick to say that while the report depreciated the buildings of the old capital it did not depreciate the new buildings in the new location. Juneau rumbled about a lawsuit.",

Half a dozen boats were moored in the reeds beside a long jetty, built of stones and earth, and in a nearby hamlet of grass huts fish-bones littered the sandy ground. Beyond, a faint path wandered through waist-high golden grass, stretching for a mile or so to the edge of the semi-encircling forest. In a secluded corner, before the trees met the water, it was possible to swim unobserved. The clear lukewarm lake was disappointingly shallow near the shore and I dared not swim too far from my money-belt. Yet those were the best hours of each Bugala day – floating beneath the pastel morning sky, listening to the bird-calls in the forest, watching the fish-eagles gliding, gliding, gliding, then suddenly diving, splashing, swooping back to their young with a shiny catch.",
