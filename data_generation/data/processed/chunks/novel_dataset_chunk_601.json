    "target_paragraph": "In the fresh sweet mornings of Spring now, Eugene was howled out of bed at six-thirty by his father, descended to the cool garden, and there, assisted by Gant, filled small strawberry baskets with great crinkled lettuces, radishes, plums, and green apples – somewhat later, with cherries. With these packed in a great hamper, he would peddle his wares through the neighbourhood, selling them easily and delightfully, in a world of fragrant morning cookery, at five or ten cents a basket. He would return home gleefully with empty hamper in time for breakfast; he liked the work, the smell of gardens, of fresh wet vegetables; he loved the romantic structure of the earth which filled his pocket with chinking coins.",

    "target_paragraph": "CHAPTER XL\nMY MOTHER, standing on the stairs, is scolding me. Her red polished fingernail points in my direction. That is my first memory. But there are others that seem more confused. Am I really in a basket in the backseat as we drive to Indiana? A funnel cloud appears in the distance, touching down, and my father drives like a madman to beat the storm. And later me crying by a brook under a crab apple tree because my father had promised me a river and an orchard.\nI recall the day when my brother was stricken with a mysterious illness. He’s a newborn and it’s summer, a bright hot summer day. I am three years old when my brother wakes up from a nap, gasping. He is only a few months old and his windpipe has closed. He has to be rushed to the hospital and my mother is taking him in a car. I don’t remember who drove the car, but she is sitting in the backseat. A blazing summer day and I’m wearing shorts, a T-shirt. I’m standing outside with my nanny, who is dressed in white—a whiteness that is blinding. Everything else is green. The lawn, the trees. Though it is hot outside, in the car it is cool and dark. I know because I try to crawl in. My mother cradles my brother and just as they are about to leave, I jump into the car to hug her. Perhaps I fear she is leaving for good. Perhaps I only want to say goodbye, but she pushes me away. She shouts to the nanny, “Get her out of here.”\nMy nanny, in the blinding whiteness, drags me away, crying, screaming.\nA few days later we go to pick up my mother. I’m not sure if she’s been home while my brother’s been in the hospital, but I know we go to pick her up. My brother isn’t with her. He has to stay in the hospital another day or so. But she is coming home. I’m in the backseat, staring out the rear window when I see her walking toward us. She’s smiling in a snug gray dress, a hat, gloves. Her lipstick is bright red against the gray. It is a gloomy day, and all the leaves have fallen from the trees. Suddenly it is winter.\nYears later, when I have grown up and moved away, it will occur to me that this cannot be. Only days before it was summer. But this is how I remember it.",

A low Mughal gateway led on into a wet and glistening flagstone courtyard; it was deserted but for a solitary pupil running late towards his class.

The courtyard was bounded by a range of cloisters two storeys high. Classrooms filled the ground-floor rooms. On the first floor, leading off a covered balcony, were the chambers of the fellows and scholars. The arcades were broken on three sides by vaulted gateways, and on the fourth, the principal axis, by a red sandstone mosque. Before the mosque, filling both sides of the cloister garth, was a garden of healing herbs and shrubs.",

By the morning of August 28, as finally a somewhat steady wind began to escalate, I had finished reading Caravan and wasn’t very worried, especially since we proceeded to make the exhilarating progress of 140 miles during the next twenty-four hours under double-reefed main alone. As the wind jumped way out of the force bracket predicted on the pilot charts and began blowing at about 40 knots, I chalked it off to strong trades, because my pilot books didn’t mention these characteristics for Med storms, and the barometer hadn’t budged.",

I haven’t eaten animal product for months as summer in Delhi is not a good time for meat and the health authorities have closed down many of the butchers. But there’s no room for vegetarians here—there’s not even any room for vegetables. There’s mutton on the bone, mutton in gravy, mutton with peas, tandoori mutton, mutton with cream, mutton with spice, mutton kabobs, mutton shanks, mutton intestines, mutton flank, mutton balls and saffron rice with mutton bits. Then there’s mutton made in ways I cannot describe, with special spices and softening sauces. Jonathan and I sponge bits of mutton together with our fingers and try to flick them into our mouths—a move the men around us perform with ease. We end up with bits of mutton hanging from our collars, ears and hair. What’s worse, our plates are like the magic pudding. Every time we pause for breath the men rush to fill up our load and insist we eat more. The food is incredibly delicious but my belly is bursting with heaviness, my throat tightening in protest.",

In that instant, a pulse of joy swept around the earth. Within minutes the whole of America knew he was safe in Paris. Le Bourget was instantly a scene of exultant pandemonium as tens of thousands of people rushed across the airfield to Lindbergh’s plane?“a seething, howling mass of humanity … surging towards him from every direction of the compass,” in the words of one onlooker. An eight-foot-high chain-link fence that surrounded the field was flattened, and several bicycles were crushed under the mass of charging feet. Among those in the rush were the dancer Isadora Duncan (who would die four months later in a freak accident, strangled when the long scarf she was wearing got caught in the wheel of a car) and the tennis player Jean Borotra, who with Jacques Brugnon had beaten Bill Tilden and Francis T. Hunter at Saint-Cloud that day.",

I had seen a few grasshoppers along the bank, so I switched to a large, bushy dry fly that I’ve had luck with in Montana during grasshopper season. My first cast with it produced an enthusiastic little strike. Laying the fly in a seam between fast-moving water and slow-, I got a swirl from what appeared to be a real fish. By the color on its side I knew it had to be a trout. A cast or two later I dropped the fly next to a half-sunken log and something sucked it in. The hooked fish veered out into deep and heavy current and held there awhile before I could lead it to the shallows. It was not huge—nine or ten inches at the most—but it was a trout, unmistakably. The name for it in Russian is forel, which is only the Russian version of the German Forelle, which means “trout.”",

This is the \"Gondal Woman's Lament\":\nFar, far is mirth withdrawn:\n'Tis three long hours before the morn,\nAnd I watch lonely, drearily;\nSo come, thou shade, commune with me.",

The other he tried to slip through hers; but she eluded him nimbly, and Frome’s heart, which had swung out over a black void, trembled back to safety. A moment later he heard the jingle of departing sleigh bells and discerned a figure advancing alone toward the empty expanse of snow before the church.",

Their simplicity, boundless hospitality and generosity touched me profoundly. Hospitality matters because it feeds the most basic human need that we all have, to feel loved and accepted. It reminded me of the warmth and kindness in the Philippines. There is a measure of beauty in providing space for others to feel important, cared for and genuinely loved. Bedouins are considered the guardians of Arab virtues as well as the caretakers of the land’s historic memory. For centuries, when the weather changed, or foraging became difficult, they simply moved with their herds to find new lands. However, various forces, from the evolution of international borders to the vagaries of the modern global economy, have started to alter this. I asked Abdulla, our guide, if he felt that the Bedouin’s rural way of life was being threatened.",
