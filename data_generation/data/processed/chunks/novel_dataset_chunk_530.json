The room was silent except for the rustle of Master’s page-turning. Ugwu stood for a while before he began to edge closer and closer to the bookshelf, as though to hide in it, and then, after a while, he sank down to the floor, cradling his raffia bag between his knees. He looked up at the ceiling, so high up, so piercingly white. He closed his eyes and tried to reimagine this spacious room with the alien furniture, but he couldn’t. He opened his eyes, overcome by a new wonder, and looked around to make sure it was all real. To think that he would sit on these sofas, polish this slippery-smooth floor, wash these gauzy curtains.",

The moon hung low above the western peaks, and the village clock below them in the valley chimed out the three quarters after eleven as they walked down the road between blanched fields and sleeping houses. On the edge of the village a few lights still twinkled; but the Pension Rosenglüh, demurely withdrawn behind its white palings, showed a shuttered front to the moon. Boyne opened the garden gate, and started to go up the doorstep ahead of Judith. “Oh, you needn’t ring, Martin. It would wake everybody. I don’t believe the door’s locked. I told Scopy to see that I wasn’t shut out.” She tried the door-knob, which yielded hospitably, and then turned and flung her arms about her companion.",

I had forgotten just how distant the 1960s have grown. All the men in the photographs wore hats; the women and girls were in billowy skirts.

Anticipating a wind-assisted trip back, my prayer is that the wind does not change direction after I get to Lochbui. The road follows several beautiful lochs, a major geological fault that is still active, aquaculture operations, old settlements, four trees, and goes on until it reaches the beach at Lochbui which is the site of an estate, Old Post Office, and adders. The estate is not a large one but contains the site of standing stones, a stone circle, and 13th century castle ruins as well as an old church. It is hard to believe that these barren and wind swept shores have been a community for nigh onto 5,000 years. In my high tech clothing, I am still on the edge of cold. How those people of antiquity survived is beyond me. How they had time on their hands to create stone circles and standing stones in these far flung places continues to mystify.",

There were two amazing birds, white and black bodies, bigger than storks, with red beaks and red, yellow, and blue marking about their eyes. “What are those birds, Ali?” “Birds,” said he. I could not believe that the anthills really were anthills, though they had to be, but they were much bigger, higher, and solider than I had imagined, so I asked Ali what they were, too. “They have always been like that,” he answered.

Howard Martin trod gingerly across the drive and on to the warm brick flooring of the porch, on white, wincing, well-kept feet; Mrs Pierce and the girl wore light bathing-robes and walked firmly, with assurance. Mrs Pierce’s figure was as slender and as well-conditioned as the girl’s – her ankles and her legs were wonderfully graceful, strong and slender – but in comparison to her niece’s black and white voluptuousness – her dark and sullen, almost brooding, face and her swelling creamy thighs, her lavish belly and her melon-heavy breasts – the figure of Mrs Pierce was lacking in seduction: it had the strength and slenderness of youth without youth’s warmth and freshness; it had, like everything about her, a chilled and glacial perfection that spoke of stern regimen, grim watchfulness, and unflagging effort – ‘keeping fit’.",

Under the name we read: “The Faithful Lizzie. For forty-two years devoted maid of the Marchesa Malaspina”; with the vital data, born in Buenos Aires 1863, died in Rome 1942, and “Rest in Peace.” It was good of the Marchesa to put in her real name, and for all we know they may have had a lovely relationship. One forgets how many Lizzies there have been and still are, maids or governesses teaching their languages to children of the aristocracy and upper bourgeoisie of Rome. One still alive, German, in her eighties, some fifty years with a titled family rare in their rank for brains and goodness of heart, has put together over the years a long compendium of everything ever written about August Goethe and may know more about him than anyone alive, with only the possible failing of refusing to think ill of him, but in that she may be as near the truth as some of Goethe’s biographers. She is a Faithful Lizzie of higher degree, eating at the family table; she seems content; marriage could have been worse, and Mary Wollstonecraft is not for everyone.",

But orientation is exceedingly important to the Balinese. In Bali, a direction describes a vector not just in physical space, but in cultural, religious, and social \"space\" as well. As a result, every Balinese seems to possess a built-in sense of direction. And if for some reason this feeling is lacking, the individual is visibly uncomfortable and disoriented.",

He hadn’t heard many in his life; in fact, he hadn’t heard any, in women, that were definitely beautiful. Agreeable, well-bred—those were the best he had come across, and all the others were in different degrees, greater or less, on the whole afflicting. But this one—oh, he would like to listen to it for ever. It was so exactly suited to the occasion, falling on the night like the sound of water softly lapping in places set about with ferns, or like the sounds doves make, cooing in green enclosures. Could such a voice ever say bosh, James asked himself? He doubted it. Such music belonged only to kindness, and fair words. And when, in addition to being beautiful, instead of making the sort of conversation voices usually do make at a first meeting, and sometimes go on making at every subsequent meeting, it told him without any preliminaries what was really passing through its owner’s mind, James felt as much refreshed as if, on his long continued spiritual drought alone with Alice, the blessed rain of real companionship were at last descending.",

He is not a subtle or reserved man and if he had felt any resentment at being thwarted I doubt if he could have concealed it and simulated that cheerful unconcern with which he greeted the verdict. To us such an incident is symptomatic of a monstrous serfdom, to Dubkay it is merely an occasion for showing a natural dependence on the superior wisdom of one’s rulers. And though we would not consider the bargain a good one he has, in exchange for his personal liberty, a carefree existence on which no problems intrude because what might create them is always someone else’s responsibility. Also, in fairness to the Tibetan Government, we should remember that similar restrictions limit the freedom of movement of Indian nationals, though theoretically India is a fully-fledged modern democracy.",

Among them stood a lapis bowl in a Renaissance mounting of enamel and a vase of Phenician glass that was like a bit of rainbow caught in cobwebs. On a table against the window a little Greek marble lifted its pure lines. On every side some rare and sensitive object seemed to be shrinking back from the false colours and crude contours of the hotel furniture. There were no books in the room, but the florid console under the mirror was stacked with old numbers of Town Talk and the New York Radiator. Undine recalled the dingy hall-room that Moffatt had lodged in at Mrs. Flynn’s, over Hober’s livery stable, and her heart beat at the signs of his altered state. When her eyes came back to him their lids were moist.",

Armed with guns and a sense of moral superiority, the Imperial Police Force patrolled the countryside and kept this far-flung corner of the British Empire in line. Then, suddenly and without warning, he returned to England and handed in his notice. Just as abruptly, he began his career as a writer. Exchanging his real name, ‘Eric Arthur Blair’, for the pen-name ‘George Orwell’, he donned the rags of a tramp and marched off into the dank London nights to collect the stories of the down-at-heel. Orwell based his first novel, Burmese Days, on his experiences in the Far East, but it was his later novels such as Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four that would turn him into one of the most respected and visionary writers of the twentieth century.",

In addition to two English classes, I’m giving lectures in geography, general science, hygiene, current events, world history, etc. It all sounds very grand but I’m just trying to give some grounding in each subject. A special translator was brought from Delhi so I lecture in English and he translates as I go. The atmosphere became charged with excitement as they learned about the solar system, changes of season, etc. Late into the evening monks could be seen clustered around the globe with flashlights and little balls trying to work out lunar and solar eclipses. They’re just lapping everything up and it’s such a joy to teach such interested pupils. Zimey Rimpoche, the head Lama and principal, is young, charming and brilliant. He keeps me running to my books with his intelligent questions on satellites, sound-waves, splitting the atom, etc. Who said Tibetans were resistant to Western science and learning? I spend hours curled up on a rug in his room – speaking Tibetan and English and teaching him but, best of all, learning from one of the most learned Tibetan scholars in India!",

It was not that he was actually deformed, but merely that his body seemed to be shrivelled and shrunk and squeezed of its juices like that of an old man. He may have been fifteen or sixteen years old, though there were times when he seemed younger.

What Shepherd understood – like Edward Thomas, and like so many of the other people in this book – was that landscape has long offered us keen ways of figuring ourselves to ourselves, strong means of shaping memories and giving form to thought. Like Thomas, she thought topographically, and like Thomas she understood herself to be in some way thought by place. On the mountain, she wrote, moments occur at which ‘something moves between me and it. Place and a mind may interpenetrate till the nature of both is altered. I cannot tell what this movement is except by recounting it.’",

However, the quenoa (a rare high-altitude tree) flourishes hereabouts and while I got the tent up Rachel, being very hungry, did her fuel-gathering bit with alarming enthusiasm. Once I looked around to see her two-thirds of the way up a tree that overhung a fifty-foot drop; she was breaking off dead branches and throwing them into the rocky gully beneath. So we have had the rare luxury of a fire on the puna – if you can call it a luxury. Because of the altitude we had great difficulty a) lighting it and b) cooking our noodles. Despite a steady wind I had to blow continuously to keep the water boiling and nothing was hot when served up; but we weren’t in a fussy mood. When Rachel crawled into the tent it was already stiff and glistening with frost. Then I had to strip naked in the icy wind to put on my high-altitude underwear. There’s no room in our tent for such manoeuvres, but though it may be cramped it’s very efficient. While writing this I have thawed and am now all set for a comfortable night.",

The bird was so beautiful, and we had enough food here in the village. It would be wrong to kill it. But masculine pride and the need to be admired by my peers won out. I took a shot. The bird fell silently into the river. The current was strong, and as the bird began drifting away, I noticed that it was still alive, trying to fight the current. I was dismayed that it might simply vanish in the water. It would be a shame to have killed it for nothing. I took off my clothes and dove in. The bird saw me and sensed that I was coming after it. It ceased struggling and gave itself up to the current as if it preferred drowning to the ignominy of death at human hands. I swam after it in the swift waters. I was nearing the point where the Asriamas emptied into the Tuichi when I caught the bird by one wing. It pecked fiercely at my hand and let out a strangled screech, but I didn’t let go. I kicked my feet and used my free hand to make it back to the riverbank. I climbed out of the water and dropped the bird on the shore. It lay there bleeding profusely. I ran back to get the shotgun and bashed its head with the butt. The soft ground cushioned the blow, and the bird writhed in pain. I put a rock under its head and brought the butt down again. This time the bird was still.",
