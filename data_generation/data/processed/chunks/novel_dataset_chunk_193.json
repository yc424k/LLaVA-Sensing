The posters, maculated with filth, garnished like tapestry the sweep of the curbstone. The trade in afternoon papers was brisk, yet, in comparison with the swift, constant march of foot traffic, the effect was of indifference, of a disregarded distribution.

It seemed to him that he had been thinking of her without stopping, and it was absurd not to know anything at all about a person one thinks of as much as that, except her name and that her husband was dead. It was of course a great stride from blank knowing nothing; and that her husband should be dead was such a relief to him that he couldn’t help thinking he must be falling in love. All husbands should be dead, he considered–nuisances, complicators. What would have happened if George had been alive? Why, he simply would have lost her, had to give up at once–before, almost, beginning. And he was so lonely, and she was–well, what wasn’t she? She was so like what he had been dreaming of for years–a little ball of sweetness, and warmth, and comfort, and reassurance and love.",

Even if I were able to get them off, I would never have been able to put them back on, so I just left them on my feet, mud and all. I emptied out the rubber bag and cautiously, gently, inched it over my feet, up to my knees. I spread one of the mosquito nets out upon the fronds, wrapped myself with it, and pulled the other over me, tucking the edges in under my body. I arranged the poncho so that it covered me from head to toe, protecting myself from both the wet, muddy earth beneath me and the water dripping from above. I put the hood over my face as usual. My hands were wet, my body covered with wounds, scratches, rawness, and rash. I tucked my hands in the pits of my arms, where there was a little warmth.",

There's no need telling me that kind of thing. Let's get to the point. What can you do? What have you done? Can I depend on you to do everything that's necessary?\" So, as she walked briskly down the hall, thoughts too sharp and quick for definition were darting across the surface of her mind like flicks of light upon a pool.",

Copra was the export - husk and shell of the coconut removed, the meat was dried in the sun and shipped abroad to make coconut oil. For decades, tons and tons of the stuff were shipped off-island to the US, ending in the 1930s when coconut oil went out of favor and the San Pedranos turned to the fishing industry. (Tourism still wasn’t on the radar - the first tourist hotel would open a few decades later. Celi McCorkle would open her Holiday Hotel with only five rooms in 1965.)",

Shortly after crossing into South Australia in midafternoon, I found myself entering rolling hills of orange groves. It was so startling I got out and had a look. On one side stretched arid emptiness—a plain of stretched burlap spattered with clumps of mallee. But before me, filling the view to the distant horizon, spread a biblical-looking promised land—citrus groves and vineyards and vegetable patches in every lush shade of green. As I pushed on, the balance between orchards and vineyards tipped increasingly in favor of the latter until eventually there was nothing but vineyards and I realized I had reached the Barossa Valley, a quite spectacularly pretty corner of Australia, with rolling hills of abundant green that gave it, literally and metaphorically, a Mediterranean air.",

At dusk teenage girls swarmed out like mosquitoes to forage among the truckers. For them to reckon ‘It can’t happen to me’, when it has already happened to at least 26 per cent of this town’s married women, seems suicidal. But then of course they know nothing about these statistics. This aspect of the epidemic was troubling me increasingly. In Iringa Dr Makwetta had assured me that Tanzania ‘keeps to the UN rules about AIDS and human rights’. This means that no one knows which individuals in sentinel towns such as Mafinga test positive. But is it ethically admissible to test people – even anonymously – without their consent? Arguably such testing is necessary to determine the rate at which the virus is spreading. Yet what practical purpose does that serve? How does it help infected communities? Statistics are of absorbing interest to the countless academics now so profitably riding on the AIDS industry gravy-train, but how does their collection help Africans? Is there not something intolerably paternalistic about this refusal to treat the infected as responsible human beings, entitled to know the worst and make appropriate decisions? The husbands of those infected Mafinga mothers may well develop AIDS first, causing some of their wives to sleep around to earn money to buy alleviating medicines – or witch-doctors’ ‘cures’. What right do experts have to reduce individuals to statistics, using their tragedies as ‘research material’? Does this happen in the West? Were it discovered that 26 per cent of pregnant women in some English town were HIV+ would all agree that they should have been tested without their knowledge and should not be given the opportunity to respond to their condition as they judge best? Is this choice not a human right?",

Economic equality remains invisible, away over the horizon: whites will continue to enjoy lives of luxury, joined by more and more successful blacks, but the average shack-dweller does not expect soon to have adequate schooling and medical care, four-bedroomed houses, good jobs, Toyota Corollas. (Only in the Macassar squatter camp did I meet a few recent arrivals from a remote Transkei village who cherished such illusions.) Those ‘unrealistic black expectations’, so often pinpointed as ‘the main threat to future stability’, are yet another urban legend.",

In this frame of mind, though without strong feeling, he had strolled up the alley and into High-Place Hall by the postern at which Elizabeth had so nearly encountered him. He had gone on thence into the court, and inquired of a man whom he saw unpacking china from a crate if Miss Le Sueur was living there.

Before me rose mighty pillars (some fallen), broken balustrades, the sturdy remnants of Justinian’s fortifications, the soaring walls of roofless churches or temples, isolated archways, stairs leading nowhere and an immense flight of half-exposed semi-circular steps – all Roman, Byzantine or early Ottoman. At a little distance, around a hillock, were the half-sunken remains of a later village or town; a few millstones remained in some of the tiny rooms and what might have been a wine and/or oil press was hewn out of the rock. The archaeologists who worked here before the Occupation had provided short plank bridges over awkward spaces. A Tel Aviv University research paper notes sadly, ‘There are multi-seasonal excavations at Mount Gerizim, Nablus, that have produced only limited topical reports.’ In general, Palestinians have been indifferent to their archaeological wonderland. During the 1930s 266 main sites were listed in the Nablus district; most have since been destroyed.",

Cheryl assumed that she had gone to the reef to find me, but a short time later heard the dolphin blowing and came out to look. Honey swam slowly toward Caribee behind a submerged orange-and-brown ball-like object. Curiosity got the best of her and she donned her snorkeling gear and jumped in. Honey guided a large Hawksbill sea turtle toward Cheryl, apparently meant to be used as a plaything for the two of them. She herded the turtle in circles around the boat for half-an-hour, several times bringing it close enough for Cheryl to touch, before she finally tired of the game and let it escape.",

After the trip, all of us would return to Denali for a second season. For Gabe and me, beyond that was anyone’s guess. I’d always thought—insisted, a few years back—we’d return to western Montana.

Still sponging them and trembling slightly she turned and explained in the high-pitched voice of nervous excitement: ‘Alfred Perrott says I’ve promised to marry him, and I say I never did. Sinclair says he’ll shoot himself if I don’t marry him, and I say, “Well, shoot yourself!” But of course he doesn’t—they never do. And Sinclair got hold of me this afternoon and began bothering me to give an answer, and accusing me of flirting with Alfred Perrott, and told me I’d no heart, and was merely a Siren, oh, and quantities of pleasant things like that. So at last I said to him, “Well, Sinclair, you’ve said enough now. You can just let me go.” And then he caught me and kissed me—the disgusting brute—I can still feel his nasty hairy face just there—as if he’d any right to, after what he’d said!’",

    "target_paragraph": "Even in ideal circumstances the path around Big Butt would have required delicacy and care. It was like a window ledge on a skyscraper, no more than fourteen or sixteen inches wide, and crumbling in places, with a sharp drop on one side of perhaps eighty feet, and long, looming stretches of vertical granite on the other. Once or twice I nudged foot-sized rocks over the side and watched with faint horror as they crashed and tumbled to improbably remote resting places. The trail was cobbled with rocks and threaded with wandering tree roots against which we constantly stubbed and stumbled, and veneered everywhere with polished ice under a thin layer of powdery snow. At exasperatingly frequent intervals, the path was broken by steep, thickly bouldered streams, frozen solid and ribbed with blue ice, which could only be negotiated in a crablike crouch. And all the time, as we crept along on this absurdly narrow, dangerous perch, we were half-blinded by flying snow and jostled by gusts of wind, which roared through the dancing trees and shook us by our packs. This wasn’t a blizzard; it was a tempest. We proceeded with painstaking deliberativeness, placing each foot solidly before lifting the one behind. Even so, twice Katz made horrified, heartfelt, comic-book noises (“AIEEEEE!” and “EEEARGH!”) as his footing went, and I turned to find him hugging a tree, feet skating, his expression bug-eyed and fearful.",

The warmth of the fire had passed out of her veins, and she told herself that she must not sit long in the penetrating dampness which struck up from the wet asphalt. But her will-power seemed to have spent itself in a last great effort, and she was lost in the blank reaction which follows on an unwonted expenditure of energy. And besides, what was there to go home to? Nothing but the silence of her cheerless room – that silence of the night which may be more racking to tired nerves than the most discordant noises: that, and the bottle of chloral by her bed. The thought of the chloral was the only spot of light in the dark prospect: she could feel its lulling influence stealing over her already. But she was troubled by the thought that it was losing its power – she dared not go back to it too soon. Of late the sleep it had brought her had been more broken and less profound; there had been nights when she was perpetually floating up through it to consciousness. What if the effect of the drug should gradually fail, as all narcotics were said to fail? She remembered the chemist’s warning against increasing the dose; and she had heard before of the capricious and incalculable action of the drug. Her dread of returning to a sleepless night was so great that she lingered on, hoping that excessive weariness would reinforce the waning power of the chloral.",
