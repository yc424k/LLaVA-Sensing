Their long, shiny, pale green leaves glinted in the sun, making sparks of silver light all over the summit, and through the enormous silence came the faint, fairy-like chiming of the wind in those leaves. There is an overwhelming integrity about the silence of such places; in its purity and power it differs utterly from the noiselessness of even the remotest inhabited regions. This afternoon’s silence seemed no less tangible than the crags around us.",

Many wide windows displayed only a few pairs of shoes, or one length of fading curtain material, or a few saucepans, or two bras and a pair of briefs. In Sloane Street this use of space sends a certain would-be subtle signal, in Calle Martí the signal is different. Numerous young men were wearing brand new shoes – totally unsuitable, heavy brogues – which meant a supply had recently arrived; new imports are ipso facto coveted. Perhaps, I thought, this also explained the many skin-tight T-shirts, seeming several sizes too small. Aida later confirmed that the sloppy model is no longer trendy and the latest fashion much prized because it emphasises well-developed biceps and torsos. In one tienda baseball caps were marked CP11.50 to CP14.80 and an Adidas track-suit CP66. All garment departments catered for the Cubans’ addiction to vibrant colours which somehow don’t look garish when worn by them. I had to settle for a pair of khaki trousers (male): it was that or scarlet slacks with orange and blue vertical stripes. I didn’t waste time seeking a new watch-strap; even in Havana such a luxury proved unobtainable. But a cobbler to mend my disintegrating sandal was spotted down a side street, sitting on his doorstep fixing a high-heeled slipper. A ten-minute job cost NP5.",

Black woods pressed in on the road from both sides. Here and there in clearings there were shacks, usually with large numbers of black youngsters in the yard, passing footballs or riding bikes. Occasionally there were also nicer houses – white people’s houses – with big station wagons standing in the driveways and a basketball hoop over the garage and large, well-mown lawns. Often these houses were remarkably close – sometimes right next door – to a shack. You would never see that in the North. It struck me as notably ironic that Southerners could despise blacks so bitterly and yet live comfortably alongside them, while in the North people by and large did not mind blacks, even respected them as humans and wished them every success, just so long as they didn’t have to mingle with them too freely.",

Reaching either involved an ocean crossing, and since we have a strong affinity for downwind passages in the trades, the Pacific was the clear winner. I’d always been drawn by the allure of the South Seas—the most exotic of all cruising locales, to my mind—and since neither of us likes cold weather, that essentially ruled out Europe except maybe on a seasonal basis. Of course going to the Pacific meant we would have to transit the Panama Canal, about which I had mixed emotions. Mainly I didn’t much like the idea, having heard horror stories over the years about yachts being crushed like eggshells in the locks after big ships smacked them against the concrete lock walls, and similar unhappy events. But we decided that that (the canal transit) was just part of the deal and we would take it as it came. After all, at least dozens of boats made the transit each year without incident.",

The group’s reign of terror came to an abrupt end in 1992 when its charismatic leader, who went by the nom de guerre Presidente Gonzalo, was discovered living above a ballet studio in Lima. “There was a long period of time when guys like Mateo and Julian had to work on their farms during the day and hide in the bush at night,” John said. “The Shining Path moved after dark and it wasn’t safe to be caught sleeping in your house.” John had heard that pockets of militants were still based in the area, trafficking cocaine.",

A few early Africans became substantial landowners; one family moved to Maryland and named its seventeenth-century holding Angola.",

In his rough shooting clothes, with the glow of exercise under his fair skin, he looked extraordinarily light-hearted and happy. Darrow, with a quick side-glance, noticed this, and perceived also that the glow on the youth's cheek had deepened suddenly to red. He too stopped short, and the three stood there motionless for a barely perceptible beat of time. During its lapse, Darrow's eyes had turned back from Owen's face to that of the girl between them. He had the sense that, whatever was done, it was he who must do it, and that it must be done immediately. He went forward and held out his hand.",

Mongolia is so far inland that no sea moderates its climates. No island of clouds breaks the gauzy blue of the sky. No afternoon shower drops its curtain in the distance.

At one point we passed a tug trailing nine barges, each of them twice the length of ours; and later on, the bright speck of a steamer twinkled in the distance. It expanded as it advanced until it towered high above us, and then dwindled and vanished. Deep quarries were scooped out of the banks between the starlit villages that floated downstream. There was a faint glimmer of towns and villages across the plain. Even travelling against the current, we were moving more slowly than we should; the engineer didn’t like the sound of the engine: if it broke down altogether, our little procession would start floating chaotically backwards and downstream. Files of barges were constantly overtaking us. As dawn broke, amid a shaking of heads, we tied up at the quays of Bonn.",

Grudgingly a small room with smelly bedding and no bathroom was allocated: expensive at £5 a night. Even more grudgingly payment was deferred to the morrow; outside Zambia its kwatcha are waste-paper. The sour woman receptionist commanded, ‘By 9 a.m. you must pay, our banks open at 8.30.’ I was again feverish and dizzy and couldn’t imagine myself getting to a bank, or anywhere else, within twenty-four hours – except perhaps to the grave hinted at by my lugubrious companion. But tomorrow was another day. I explained that I had malaria and asked for drinking-water. The receptionist sneered. ‘At this season we all have malaria, it is not important, we work on.’ True enough; many malarial Blacks do keep going until they either recover or drop dead.",

A girl called Karma, or Universal Law—the sister, it mysteriously appeared, of the Lakers-loving official in Calcutta—quietly checked us into the “Lotus Garden of the Gods.” And then we were outside, in a Druk Air minibus (its only decoration, a sticker for Thai Air), and alone in a soundless world.",

But the visitor to Bali was handed a gift-wrapped parcel of paradise the minute he arrived. After that, he had only to lie back and let the idyll present itself to him, demanding nothing in return. It was not just tropical fruits that were brought to tourists on a plate by slim, smiling dryads, it was the whole Bali package: massages, temple dances, the heart-stopping radiance of the local children. Every room came equipped with sunlight and birdsong. Every lane brought smiles. Extraordinary sunsets were shown every night on Kuta Beach, and free of charge.",

A young officer, with his cap set at a jaunty angle on his head, walked past, but no one seemed to notice them.",

Struggling against the currents, hauling all manner of impossible loads, these river rogues endured conditions that in but a generation had broken the spirit and shattered the bodies of every native pressed into service, work that no mestizo would even dare undertake. Fortified by freedom and blessed by their gods, zambos not only thrived as bogas, they triumphed as free men who, in their physical trials, made a muse of the river, offering up rhythms, melodies, and eventually songs that, in time, became the musical score of a new land. This was, in part, the genesis of cumbia, the heartbeat of Colombia and its singular gift to the world.",

    "target_paragraph": "Deepening economic gloom was accompanied by increasing concern about social issues. By the time I visited the Sinterklaas event, the Netherlands had one of the higher overall crime rates in Europe. Statistics showed that the proportion of people who said they felt unsafe was growing. Pim Fortuyn had been assassinated in 2002, followed by Theo van Gogh in 2004. In 2009, there had even been a terrorist attack on the Dutch royal family, during which a man rammed the royal convoy in his car, killing several bystanders. In 2012, European authorities reported that Amsterdam, ostensibly the most liberal city in Europe, was the continent’s fourth most murderous metropolis, thanks partly to violence between foreign criminal gangs. In 2015, the city saw six gangland assassinations in the space of just two months. Less dramatically, the growing influx of stag parties and drunken tourists in search of a night they’d never remember had caused problems with petty crime and alcohol-related violence. In parts of the country there were also tensions with immigrant communities, particularly the large Turkish and Moroccan Muslim community. Tolerance, it seemed, had not insulated the country from change but merely delayed it, and made it all the more jarring.",

It was\nhidden behind an old rose-red brick wall in a lane, and it was only by\nstanding up in the motorcar that they caught sight of its long line of\nred-tiled dormer windows.

She had just been for a row on the river, and the sun that netted the little waves with gold seemed to have caught her in its meshes. Across the warm brown of her cheek her blown hair glittered like silver wire; and her eyes too looked lighter, almost pale in their youthful limpidity.
