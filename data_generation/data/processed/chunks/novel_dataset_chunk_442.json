Well, it contained a large bed, thin and flat with a grey-white counterpane, like a large, poor, marble-slabbed tomb in the room's sordid emptiness; one dilapidated chair on which stood the miserablest weed of a candle I have ever seen: a broken wash-saucer in a wire ring: and for the rest, an expanse of wooden floor as dirty-grey-black as it could be, and an expanse of wall charted with the bloody deaths of mosquitoes. The window was about two feet above the level of a sort of stable yard outside, with a fowl-house just by the sash. There, at the window flew lousy feathers and dirty straw, the ground was thick with chicken-droppings. An ass and two oxen comfortably chewed hay in an open shed just across, and plump in the middle of the yard lay a bristly black pig taking the last of the sun. Smells of course were varied.",

    "target_paragraph": "Bourrit’s unstable analogies – now it’s a temple, now a fortress, now a fairy dwelling – were a function of the ice’s own slipperiness; its resistance to firm description. Ice and snow have always been substances off which language slides and slithers, unable to get a good grip. But Bourrit, like many after him, found something attractive in this visual fickleness, because it meant that the ice’s beauties were bespoke. Each traveller saw what he chose to see in this visually biddable world: ‘We only have to change our situation to make it resemble whatever we please,’ he wrote. Ice could be sculpted by the sun and by the perceiving mind into almost any conceivable shape: a pagoda, an elephant, a fortress. The process could work in reverse as well – other things could resemble the ice. When Wordsworth was in the Chamonix valley one Sabbath in 1820, he watched a procession of white-robed votaries winding in slow motion between the dark and spiry pine trees, and they looked to him like a cortège of pale glacier columns, marching slowly down the valley towards the church. It is the unpredictability and inconsistency of the play of light off ice which has made it such a difficult subject for artists. The Victorian artist Silvanus Thomson declared that he was ‘never happier than when painting ice’, but spent his life being disappointed with his inability to render properly its subtle luminosities. Ice is a substance more lustrous than water and, for all its solidity, more capricious. Only photography – literally light-writing – comes close to recreating the contingent brilliancies of ice, its millions of scintillas.",

John went through a quick equipment check after breakfast and was shocked to learn that I’d only brought a single water bottle. “That’s all you’ve got for the hike to Choquequirao?” he asked. I offered to run the ten minutes back to Cachora to grab a few extras, but John dismissed the idea as an unnecessary waste of time and money. Juvenal must have guessed what we were talking about, because he walked over to Octavio’s trash bin and plucked out three almost empty bottles of Inca Kola, the neon yellow, bubblegum-sweet soda that is Peru’s national soft drink. John rinsed them out with iodine. These would meet my hydration needs until Machu Picchu. The muleteers didn’t carry any water at all. To them, drinking water was a sign of weakness.",

Terry’s indifference to the whole affair produced no effect on the irascible Italians; and as Zinnie, when roused, was a fighter, and now had a gold necklace with real pearls to defend, all Judith’s influence, and some cuffing into the bargain, were needed to reduce the trio to order; after which Boyne had to plead that they should not be deprived of their holiday. But once on the deck of the “Fancy Girl” all disagreements were forgotten. It was a day of wind and sparkle, with a lagoon full of racing waves which made the yacht appear to be actually moving; and after Beechy had drenched her new frock with tears of joy at being reunited to Chipstone, and Blanca and Zinnie had shown Lady Wrench’s presents to every one, from the captain to the youngest cook-boy, harmony once more reigned among the little Wheaters.",

Many pages are haunted by ‘those mysterious regions between the Vienna Woods and the Black Sea’, and here I was, as deep in that maze of forests and canyons as it was possible to get. The timbered slopes outside the windows, and thoughts of the snow and the winter solstice, brought these stories to mind, especially the ones about wolves, the villains and the presiding daemons of East European winter. The terrible arrival of The Interlopers, in the last monosyllabic paragraph of the story, might have taken place a few miles away; and another, The Wolves of Czernogratz, with the howling crescendo of the same dread monsters, conjured up a thousand castles to the north and the west; and I had always been struck by the broken traveller in The Unbearable Bassington, ‘a man whom wolves had sniffed at’. István was one, my host another, Gróf K a third; Transylvania was full of them. All the castles were haunted, and earthly packs of wolves were reinforced after dark by solitary werewolves; vampires were on the move; witches stirred and soared; the legends and fairy stories of a dozen nations piled up and the region teemed with everything that Goethe told the New World it was better without: ‘Useless memories and vain strifes … knights, robbers and ghost stories … Ritter und Raüber und Gespenstergeschichten …’ In the end, I stayed three nights, listening to stories of wolves and forests and reading in the library, and some of it must have found its way into the bloodstream. M. Herriot has left a consoling message for cases like this: ‘La culture, c’est ce qui reste quand on a tout oublié.’",

As Christopher was taking a photograph of me sitting in the back, a policeman stepped up and said photographing was forbidden. The driver was an Assyrian from near Lake Urmiya, and by his side sat an Assyrian schoolmistress, who was returning from a missionary conference in Teheran. She regaled us with slices of quince. They were much interested in my acquaintance with Mar Shimun, and advised me to say nothing about it in Tabriz, since there was a persecution of Christians at the moment, and Mrs. Cochran’s Women’s Club in Urmiya had been shut by the police. At the thought of this, they sang Lead, Kindly Light in unison, the schoolmistress informing me that she had taught the driver this to prevent his singing the usual drivers’ songs. I said I should have preferred the drivers’ songs. She added that she had also persuaded him to remove the blue beads from his radiator-cap; they were a superstition of “these Moslems.” When I told her they were a superstition generally practised by Christians of the Orthodox Church, she was dumbfounded. She admitted then that superstitions sometimes worked: there was a devil named Mehmet, for instance, with a human wife, through whom he had prophesied the War in her father-in-law’s parlour. She called herself a bible-worker, and wanted to know if most people in England smoked or did not smoke. Why doctors did not forbid smoking and drinking, instead of doing so themselves, she could not understand.",

Most had moved away to more private tribal areas, though a few remained to protect and look after what is an extremely important site in their mythic culture. They were making a meagre living by selling artefacts to the tourists. Uluru they called it. The great Uluru. I wondered how they could stand watching people blundering around in fertility caves, or climbing the white painted line up the side, and taking their endless photos. If it had me almost to the point of tears, how much more must it have meant to them. There was one miserably small fenced-off section on the western side which read, ‘Keep out. Aboriginal sacred site.’",

The gunman then turned to Parmenter, who was looking on aghast, and shot him. Stunned and gravely wounded, Parmenter dropped the cash box and staggered into the road in a reflexive attempt to get away. One of the robbers?it is not clear from witness accounts which it was, or even whether a third gunman now appeared?followed Parmenter into the road and calmly dropped him with a single shot in the back.

I climb to the top of Staffa, the twitchers run to the other side of the island, and I get to enjoy the view all by myself. Verra nice. The next activity is getting DOWN the stairs.

Mammola also lives very much in the present with its Museo Santa Barbara, a museum and laboratory of contemporary art that exhibits its collections in a restructured Byzantine monastic complex and an open-air park. By capitalizing on its food culture and naturalistic setting, this historically agricultural community has reinvented itself. Gastronomic festivals include the mushroom in October, ricotta affumicata (smoked ricotta) in June, and the most important, the Sagra dello stocco (Festival of stocco) on August 9th.",

Though I grew up sailing a twelve-foot boat with my father on summer vacations, I knew nothing about big vessels, and had never been “at sea.” The ferry was my introduction to the boat culture I knew would permeate Cordova, and I studied that ship as if I’d be tested when I got off. I wandered the ferry for nearly the entire seven-hour ride, along narrow hallways lined with porthole windows, up flights of stairs with textured-metal steps to prevent slippage. I leaned too far over the railing at the bow, sea spray on my face, and made myself dizzy with vertigo. Walking the uppermost deck, I imagined a plummet into the water from high up, like Jonah cast overboard, or a pirate walking the enemy’s plank. I huffed diesel fumes, flicked open and shut the empty cleats, and fingered chunky knots tied with ropes the size of my wrist. The wake off the stern was as wide as a two-lane highway.",

The shop was lit with kerosene lamps, and I could see the serving boys—wrapped up in shawls against the morning chill—wiping down the wooden tables, laying out tiny cups and flasks of clear tea, and filling cigarette-holders. As they moved around, their shadows danced larger than life against the pale cement walls. One of the older boys was standing at a table and busily sticking round balls of dough on to the red-hot sides of a charcoal stove to make naan bread. Another boy lifted the lid off a giant tin kettle that squatted heavily over an open fire and jumped back as a great cloud of steam escaped: the tea was just about to boil.",
