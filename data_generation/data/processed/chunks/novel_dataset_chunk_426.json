Instead I focused on maintaining my range of motion and not compensating my stride in ways that could lead to additional injury. I was logging over forty miles every day now and I didn’t plan to stop. My body, amazingly, seemed to have surpassed athleticism and become a machine. When I was awake, I walked. When I stopped, I slept. There was not much else. Its operation often seemed to be on autopilot. But there was a deeper meaning behind this sleep, eat, walk mechanism. It meant that it was no longer my body that was most likely to fail?only my mind could stop me now. Can it handle the loneliness, the lack of sleep, the unrelenting drive necessary to cover another thirteen hundred miles in less than a month?",

Later, more complex designs from the Mediterranean were adapted to create distinctive brick towers with four spinning sails. As the technology proved its worth, Dutch windmills proliferated rapidly. They were expensive to build, but a growing population meant that good farming land was in short supply. By paying for new windmills to be built, investors could unlock huge tracts of land for housing or agricultural use, earning a handsome return on their investment.",

He smiled sadly at his sister, as she swept past him on Lord Plymdale’s arm, looking lovely in her pink brocade and pearls, and he hardly heard Lady Windermere when she called to him to follow her. He thought of Sybil Merton, and the idea that anything could come between them made his eyes dim with tears.",

His clothes were neat but cheaply made; he wore a felt hat with a wide brim, creased, French fashion, up the sides, an overcoat with padded shoulders, cut in sharply at the waist, his trousers had a short and skimpy look, and barely covered the tops of his shoes. He wore spats, and a rather loud-coloured scarf which he knotted loosely, cravat-fashion, and which thus concealed his collar and his shirt. Finally, when he smoked a cigarette, he drew the smoke in slowly, languorously, knowingly, with lidded eyes, and a cruel and bitter convulsion of his thin lips that gave his sharp face a sinister Apache expression.",

First we climbed a ‘stairway’ of narrow, snowy, neatly-terraced fields which led to a scattering of flat-roofed dwellings set amidst the inevitable fruit-trees – some ancient and gnarled, some saplings with tender trunks wrapped in rags. Here a new mosque, built on traditional Balti lines, was by far the biggest building. Two friendly adolescents, who had joined our following, opened the main door to allow me a glimpse of an interior decorated with wood-carvings of great beauty. (Before committing this indiscretion they glanced around furtively to make sure no bigoted mullah or orthodox elder was in sight.) The developers from Pakistan grumble incessantly about the impossibility of importing modern raw materials into Baltistan, not realising that this is one of the region’s greatest advantages. Of very few countries can it be said, in 1975, that their new buildings are as pleasing as their old.",

No one had ever been cheered by the Aquarium; but the faces of those emerging quickly lost their dim, chilled expression when they perceived that it was only by standing in a queue that one could be admitted to the pier. Once through the turnstiles, everyone walked for a yard or two very briskly; some flagged at this stall; others at that. But it was the band that drew them all to it finally; even the fishermen on the lower pier taking up their pitch within its range.",

He just entered and paused for a rigid infinitesimal instant until the chief-of-staff came abreast on his right, the sabre between them now under the chief-of-staff’s left arm. Then almost in step they trod the rug’s blanched vista to the table and halted rigidly together while the chief-of-staff saluted and took from under his arm the dead sabre furled loosely in the dangling buckle-ends of its harness like a badly-rolled umbrella, and laid it on the table. And staring rigidly at nothing while the chief-of-staff verbally performed the formal rite of his relinquishment, the division commander thought: It’s true. He knew me at once, thinking, No: worse: that the old man had already known him long before anyone announced the two of them from an anteroom; that apparently he had come all the long way from that instant in the observation post two mornings back where his career died, merely to prove what all who knew the old marshal’s name believed: that the old man remembered the name and face of every man in uniform whom he had ever seen—not only those out of the old regiment into which he had been commissioned from St Cyr, and the ranking commanders of his armies and corps whom he saw daily, but their staffs and secretaries and clerks, and the commanders of divisions and brigades and their staffs, and regimental and battalion and company officers and their orderlies and batmen and runners, and the privates whom he had decorated or reprimanded or condemned, and the N.C.O. leaders and degreeless fileclosers of sections and platoons and squads whose inspection-opened ranks he had merely walked rapidly through once thirty and forty years ago, calling them all ‘my child’ just as he did his own handsome young personal aide and his ancient batman and his chauffeur: a six-and-a-half foot Basque with the face of a murderer of female children. He (the division commander) had seen no movement; his recollection on entering was that the old marshal had been holding the sheaf of papers open in his hand. Yet it was not only closed now, it was pushed slightly aside and the old marshal had removed the spectacles, holding them lightly in a mottled old man’s hand almost completely hidden inside the round tremendous orifice of an immaculately laundered cuff detachable from an old-fashioned starched white civilian shirt, and looking for just a second into the spectacle-less eyes, the division commander remembered something Lallemont had said once: If I were evil, I would hate and fear him. If I were a saint, I would weep. If I were wise, and both or either, I would despair.",

He was already trotting, back in the direction from which he had just come, treading his own tracks into the hot dust of the road beneath the May noon, back to where he would leave the road to mount the hill, and crossed the hill again and trotted down the slope to the creek. He passed the place where he would lie in the wet grass each dawn without even looking at it and turned on up the creek, trotting. It was then about two oclock Saturday afternoon. He could not have known that at that hour and day Houston, a childless widower who lived alone with the hound and a negro man to cook for them both, would already be sitting on the gallery of Varner’s store three miles away; he could not have thought that maybe Houston would not be at home. Certainly he did not pause to find out. He entered the lot, trotting, he went straight to the closed door of the shed. There was a halter hanging from a nail beside it. Perhaps he merely put his hand on the halter by chance in fumbling at the latch. But he put it on the cow properly, as he had seen it done.",

Once, out of embarrassment, her husband prevented her from going on the fire. Instantly, she was felled by a stroke and paralysed.

The following season, the husband found himself moaning Vuh vuh vuh and running to the fire. He too had been seized. The revenge of Saints Constantine and Elena perhaps? In any case, Zlata and her husband became a duo, and health and good fortune were restored. Briefly. Then he died, leaving her with six kids.",

The lungs, the liver, the kidneys were all taken out and found to bear tokens of a holy life; the bowels were likewise removed and examined, and on the fourth day after death her veins were again opened and blood flowed freely, proclaiming her miraculous state. Five days later her scattered remains were collected in a coffin, and crowds of men and women came to satisfy their “pious curiosity” by gazing upon the decomposing organs of this venerable ascetic. To their hallucinated senses these poor shreds of mortality appeared more lovely and fragrant than ever. Truly an edifying spectacle!

Got everything they want inside, fine things. Got money in the bank. Everybody’s doing very well on St Martin. But the old harmony is gone, it’s gone for good.”",

She dealt with every customer gracefully and expertly, and switched effortlessly between French, German, English and Dutch ? all with that delectable accent. I was infatuated. I freely admit it. Stuck in a line that was going nowhere, there was nothing I could do but just stare dumbly at her and admire everything about her ? the way she hooked her hair behind her ear, the way she wrinkled her nose when she looked in the phone book, the way she dialled the phone with the eraser end of her pencil. By the time I reached her window it was all I could do to keep from blurting, ‘Can we have sex a few times and then talk marriage?’ But all I did was shyly ask for a hotel room somewhere in the northern hemisphere. She found me one in Haarlem.",

The electricity had been cut and the machine had juddered to a halt. One of the workers went outside to start up a small generator, and after a few moments the press slowly coughed its way back to life. Though the power source in Rangoon is more reliable than elsewhere in the country, the electricity still cuts out daily—sometimes for a few minutes, but more often for a few hours. In some parts of town, such as Golden Valley, a wealthy neighbourhood north of the city centre where many of the generals live, the electricity supply is fairly constant. Elsewhere in Rangoon power comes on for only a few hours each night. For most businesses, private energy supplies are a necessity, and outside the big hotels and condominiums you can see generators the size of houses growling loudly throughout the day and night.",

Everything else goes out of our heads. It’s worse than last year. There are more fields, more farmers—Mennonites, Colombians, settlers moving in from elsewhere. The government looks away, a socialist government with a hatred of American consumerism but a heady desire for progress. Slashing and burning is illegal, but not controlled. So the new farmers set new fires, even when the old ones are put out. And we’ve got more animals. Our firebreak is there, so that’s good, we don’t have to cut it anew, but where last year it was Wayra, Katie and Sama at risk . . . now we have Iskra, her new enclosure built merely two hundred metres from the break. Amira the jaguar, somewhere between Wayra and Iskra. Leoncio, the male puma, not too far from Sama. Perhaps it was stupid to build on that side of the road, but even though we’ve got almost a thousand hectares of land, most of the land behind camp floods more than waist high in wet season. So what do you do? Where do you put the cages? The feeling of being squeezed, the panic of it, the horrible feeling of not being able to breathe . . .",

I thought of the little white hand-painted signs I had walked past. ‘Be Careful. You Are Now Entering Slide Area’.",

Monitor was steering perfectly, but he knew that sometime in the hours ahead that he would need to put the second reef in the main. He was torn. The old adage about putting a reef in was: if you think you should, then you should have done it earlier. He decided he still had to keep the speed up while he could. The reef could be put in later, but he wasn’t relishing the thought of having to go up on the foredeck to do it. What the hell, he thought, it would be an excellent time to test out the new ‘D’ ring that he had sewn into the forward webbing strap on Baby Dink. His harness had a long hook-in carabiner and a short one. The short one attached to the new ‘D’ ring would now give him the ability to work with both hands. Something that was desperately needed when he was trying to work with halyards and reef lines.",

All these times the air fairly tingled with him; he seemed to beat out of himself and spread around him the throb of violent and overpowering life. And in the evenings towards sunset they walked together in the fields, and Mary followed them, lagging behind in the borders where the sharlock and wild rye and poppies grew. When she caught up with them she heard them talking.\nOnce Mamma said, \"Why can't you always be like this, Emilius?\"\nAnd Papa said, \"Why, indeed!\"\nAnd when Christmas came and Mark and Dan were back again he was as cruel and teasing as he had ever been.",

In front of me are shelves stacked with crumpled cigarette packets, potato chips and old, dusty spirits, the labels faded. Through a doorway I see a patio.

The ‘bridge’ was a single, narrow, slippery tree-trunk, about thirty feet long and some fifty feet above a flooded river-bed crowded with hideous-looking boulders. A single slip could mean nothing but death and after one horrified look I said, ‘No, thanks – perhaps in my reckless youth but certainly not now’. The Tibetans were tickled pink by such cowardice and several of them at once volunteered to carry me across on their backs; but I emphatically declined this terrifying though noble offer and while they all trooped over without a second thought I investigated alternatives. There were none. So I despairingly sat astride the damn thing and cautiously propelled myself across, which device had the Tibetans literally rolling on the ground with mirth. But it did get me safely, if slowly, to the other side.",

Next we put our trust in God, mighty and powerful, and placed our fate in His hands. We set out from al-Jurjānīya on Monday, 2 Dhu al-Qa‘da 309/4 March 922. We stopped at a ribāt called Zamjān, which is at the Gate of the Turks.35 Then we set out on the following morning and reached a place called Jīt. A great deal of snow fell, so that the camels were floundering in it up to their knees. We stayed at this wayside station for two days and then we entered the land of the Turks, marching on across this flat, desert-like steppe without ever turning aside from the road or meeting a soul. We journeyed for ten days, suffering from endless difficulties, from exhaustion, intense cold and the constantly falling snow. Compared to this, the days of cold in Khwārazm were like summer days. We forgot all that had happened to us in the past and almost perished.",
