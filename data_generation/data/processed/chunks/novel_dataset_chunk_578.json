I went on more single-girl trips with Sasha, to China and Tibet, where the mountains, monks, and clay warriors were amazing and the men were too small and hairless, and to Spain, where I tussled with a Barcelonan who turned out to be wearing black panties that were identical to my own and who wanted to know if I liked things “a little bit strange.” (He meant butt stuff. I do not.) I almost slipped back into relationshipland when I spent a New Year’s Eve in the mountains of Canada making out with a good friend. For years he had been saying inappropriate drunken things about his hopes for us if only we were both single. He said I made him wonder what being with someone like me would feel like—meaning someone he could talk to, as opposed to his usual diet of inappropriately young waitresses. Then we finally were single, and kissed on a dance floor in Canada, but he promptly disappeared when we got back home, later explaining, “We really could have had something if you weren’t so successful.”",

He saw the box-garden with the hornbeam arbour where they had gone to drink coffee, old M. Gantier ceremoniously leading the way with Mrs. Belknap; he saw Mme. Gantier, lame and stout, hobbling after with Mr. Belknap; a little old aunt with bobbing curls; the round-faced Gantier girl, shy and rosy; an incredibly dried and smoked and aged grandfather, with Voltairean eyes and sly snuff-taking gestures; and his own friend, the eldest of the four brothers. He saw all these modest beaming people grouped about Mme. Gantier's coffee, and Papa Gantier's best bottle of \"Fine\"; he smelt the lime-blossoms and box, he heard the bees in the lavender, he looked out on the rich fields and woods and the blue hills bathed in summer light. And he read: \"Not a house is standing. The curé has been shot. A number of old people were burnt in the hospice. The mayor and five of the principal inhabitants have been taken to Germany as hostages.\"",

    "target_paragraph": "That Askar incursion took place on 9 August 2003 when the IDF were under orders to goad Palestinians into breaking a three-month ceasefire announced on 29 June. On 12 August two maverick suicide-bombers from Askar (cousins of Ahmed) killed two Israelis though at that date all Palestinian organisations were under orders to keep the ceasefire. On 14 August the IDF killed Mohammad Sidr, an Islamic Jihad leader in Hebron; assassinations are a favourite ‘stone on the line’ when Israelis wish to derail Palestinian moves towards a just peace (as distinct from ‘peace’ on Zionist terms). Sidr’s death provoked a Hebron suicide-bomber to blow up a Jerusalem bus on 19 August, killing 20 Israelis, 6 of them children, and seriously wounding more than 100. End of ceasefire. Two days later five Israeli missiles eliminated Ismail Abu Shanab in Gaza City. Abu Shanab was among Hamas’ most thoughtful and widely respected leaders, therefore detested and feared by Sharon. He had been hoping to negotiate a fifteen-year hudna (truce); his followers were encouraged to believe that by the end of that calm period a permanent peace might be within reach.",

From discord, from hatred (I despise dabblers in imagery—I resent the power of Percival intensely) my shattered mind is pieced together by some sudden perception. I take the trees, the clouds, to be witnesses of my complete integration. I, Louis, I, who shall walk the earth these seventy years, am born entire, out of hatred, out of discord. Here on this ring of grass we have sat together, bound by the tremendous power of some inner compulsion. The trees wave, the clouds pass. The time approaches when these soliloquies shall be shared. We shall not always give out a sound like a beaten gong as one sensation strikes and then another. Children, our lives have been gongs striking; clamour and boasting; cries of despair; blows on the nape of the neck in gardens.",

    "target_paragraph": "Soon after his return to Alexandria, the city was to fall to the Persians. Briefly recovered by the Byzantines, it fell again in 641 A.D., this time to the Muslims. Islam has held it – and most of the rest of the Middle East – ever since. The Christian population that Moschos knew and wrote about – the monks and the stylites, the merchants and the soldiers, the prostitutes and the robber chiefs – all the strange and eccentric characters who wander in and out of the pages of The Spiritual Meadow, were conquered and subjugated, their numbers gradually whittled down by emigration, intermarriage and mass apostasy. With occasional intervals of stasis, such as the early Ottoman period, that process has persisted ever since, greatly accelerating in this century. It is a historical continuum that began during the journeys of Moschos and the final chapter of which I have been witnessing on my own travels some fourteen hundred years later. Christianity is an Eastern religion which grew firmly rooted in the intellectual ferment of the Middle East. John Moschos saw that plant begin to wither in the hot winds of change that scoured the Levant of his day. On my journey in his footsteps I have seen the very last stalks in the process of being uprooted. It has been a continuous process, lasting nearly one and a half millennia. Moschos saw its beginnings. I have seen the beginning of its end.",

Everything sparkled with unaccustomed brilliance; the land was refreshed—swept clean; the sea alone remained discoloured to a dingy brown. Truly, as the Commissioner—once more a sound Protestant—remarked in later years: \"The old rotter came up to the scratch that time.\" So clear and pleasant was the air that it seemed as if the wind had actually veered to the north. But no. It still blew from the other quarter—the old familiar sirocco. Which proved that the shower of ashes had not been \"carried elsewhere,\" as the youthful teacher of mathematics had prognosticated. It had not been carried anywhere. It simply ceased to fall, the volcano having momentarily run out of its stock of objectionable materials.",

He has blue eyes (or perhaps they are grey), tawny hair (or perhaps it is sandy, or perhaps just fair) and a fawnishness to his looks. He smells of tweed, peat and tobacco. He has large pockets tailored into his jackets, to carry maps, books and apples. He walks with a stick; hazel, sometimes ash, but holly best of all. He dislikes wearing a wristwatch. He walks usually with one-inch maps, which he consults by tucking his stick under his arm, spreading the map over his large hands, then refolding it and striding on, ‘aware of some completely invisible track’. He tends to walk silently, even in company. His friend Eleanor Farjeon, who for years quietly loves him, says that after following a path with Thomas ‘you would not walk [it] again as you did before. You would know it in a new way.’",

    "target_paragraph": "CHAPTER LXXV\nLATE AT NIGHT I sneak downstairs. Groggy with sleep, I tiptoe to the landing on the basement stairs so I can watch my mother sewing. I watch her as if I am watching a TV show—never taking my eyes off the screen. She’s hunched over a quilting frame that takes up much of our basement. Under the light of a single bulb she’s making the tiniest of stitches. Almost everything she does is by hand. There will be tens of thousands of stitches before she’s done. She’s making the bedspreads, pillow shams, and curtains for my room.\nFrom the stairs I can see only the back of her head and the smoke from her cigarette, which rises like a signal to warn the tribe. She never knows I’m there. Never hears me or sees me, and I don’t dare disturb her. If I do, she’ll send me back to bed. She works into the night. My mother began quilting when we moved into the house I grew up in. I was three years old. She’ll finish when I enter middle school. This task will occupy most of my childhood. When I leave for college and my parents move into the city, she throws the quilts away.\nMy mother was a gifted seamstress. She had a certificate in fashion from the Art Institute of Chicago. She had dreams of being a designer. For years she made every dress she wore. She married late—in her mid-thirties—when her own mother had given up all hope for her youngest daughter. Once she married my father, she mainly sewed Halloween costumes for her children. In my life I have been a brontosaurus, a swashbuckler, and a money tree. No princess, no fairy queen for me. I didn’t even get to be a witch. She decided what creatures I would be, what clothes I would wear to school.\nThe night I was a money tree, boys at a school party ripped off my paper bills. I walked home crying, the wind blowing through my naked branches. One afternoon our puppy teethed on the arm of an expensive chair and my mother sat on the floor, reupholstering it. She finished just as my father walked in the door. He never noticed. My mother wanted to travel. She wanted to see the world. Instead she spent six years quilting my bedspreads.\nI want to distract her. I want her to come upstairs and tell me a story, but she rarely does. She’s too impatient to sit with me for very long. She has patience only for her quilting. “These are for you,” she tells me, even as they occupy all of her time. But they are beautiful. Pink and white with a soft cottony feel, the way I imagine my mother’s skin must be. In the years I sleep in my room, they will smell of smoke and of her perfume, Replique.\nIt is my father who tucks me in. He sits at the side of my bed, making up stories about a homesick snowflake that tumbles to earth, about a brook and a nasty bridge. He sings me the Whiffenpoof song about the poor little lambs who’ve gone astray until I drift to sleep. Not my mother. She stands in my doorway, a silhouette against the doorframe, blowing me a kiss. “Did you catch it?” she asks, and I always say I did.",

They advance slowly southward, Jero Luh walking with a short hopping step, Rarung wailing in Kawi. Jero Luh pushes back the crowd, which retreats willingly. Both have pulled off their cloths and hold them in their right hands. Rarung moves south of the gong, and cradles her red cloth, talking to it like a baby. She puts it on the ground, then takes it in her arms again. Barong, with the original pair of dancers, spins and comes up behind Rarung unnoticed. Barong grabs the red cloth, turns and runs to the south, Rarung in pursuit. They face each other, Jero Luh joining in the fray, but always from safely behind Barong, hitting Barong with her cloth. Rarung grabs her red cloth back, and Barong chases them partway north before retreating to its resting place in front of the seka. It is 5 P.M.",

How beautiful they were, their pure, silvery pink gleaming so nobly, like a transfiguration, tall and perfect in that strange cradled river-bed parallel with the sea. Almond trees were in flower beneath grey Orosei, almond trees came near the road, and we could see the hot eyes of the individual blossoms, almond trees stood on the upward slope before us. And they had flowered in such noble beauty there, in that trough where the sun fell magnificent and the sea-glare whitened all the air as with a sort of God-presence, they gleamed in their incandescent sky-rosiness. One could hardly see their iron trunks, in this weird valley.",

    "target_paragraph": "Hajj Mahmūd reached at Aleppo the term of his commission, and from him also I took a most reluctant farewell. The Vāli provided me with a zaptieh whose name was Hajj Najīb, a Kurd of unprepossessing appearance, who proved on acquaintance a useful and obliging man, familiar with the district through which we travelled together, and with the people inhabiting it. We were late in starting, Mikhāil being sodden with ’arak and the muleteers unhandy with the loads. The day (it was March 30) was cloudless, and for the first time the sun was unpleasantly hot. When we rode away at ten o’clock it was already blazing fiercely upon us, and the whole day long there was not a scrap of shade in all the barren track. We followed for a mile or so the Alexandretta high road, passing a cafe with a few trees about it, soon after which we struck away to the left and entered a path that led us into the bare rocky hills, and speedily became as rocky as they. Our course was east with a touch of north. At half-past twelve we stopped to lunch, and waited a full hour for the baggage, during which time I had leisure to reflect upon the relative marching speed of the new servants and the old, and on the burning heat of the sun that had not been so noticeable when we were riding. Half an hour further we passed a hovel, Yakit ’Ades, where Najīb suggested that we might camp. But I decided that it was too early, and after we had given strict injunctions to Fāris concerning the route he was to follow and the exact spot where we should camp, the zaptieh and I bettered our pace, and without going beyond a walk were soon out of sight of the others. We rode along the bottom of a bare winding valley, past several places that were marked on the map though they were no more than the smallest heaps of ruins, and at four o’clock turned up the northern slope of the valley and reached a hamlet, unknown to Kiepert, which Najīb informed me to be Kbeshīn. Here amid a few old walls and many modern refuse-heaps we found a Kurdish camp, one of the spring-time camps in which half nomadic people dwell with their flocks at the season of fresh grass. The walls of the tents, if tents they may be called, were roughly built of stone to a height of about five feet, but the roofs were of goats’ hair cloth, raised in the centre by tent poles. The Kurdish shepherds crowded round us and conversed with Najīb in their own tongue, which sounded vaguely familiar on account of its likeness to Persian. They spoke Arabic also, a queer jargon full of Turkish words. We sat for some time on the rubbish-heap, watching for the baggage animals till I became convinced, in spite of Najīb’s assurances, that some hitch must have occurred and that we might watch for ever in vain. At this point the Kurdish sheikh announced that it was dinner time, and invited us to share the meal. One of the advantages of out-door life on short commons being that there is no moment of the day when you are not willing and ready to eat, we fell in joyfully with the suggestion.",

The ride on our primitive bikes was torture in the searing heat. The totally flat, dun coloured concrete pavement seemed to stretch for miles, and with no variation in the lush green foliage running on either side of us, it made for a mind numbingly repetitive ride. I had my head down and was around twenty feet ahead of Kirsty who was struggling gamely in my wake, when I noticed a change in the colour of the surface beneath my wheels. Occasional black stripes started to appear, which I soon realised were the tyre skid marks of the planes which used to land here. I enjoyed this link to the past, and began to visualise 1970's holidaymakers disembarking here in lurid flared trousers, large collared Hawaiian shirts and straw sun hats. As the black marks on the floor became more regular and pronounced, I looked up and spotted what I took to be a small control tower and terminal building in the distance. Puzzlingly, there was also an orange windsock hanging limply in the almost imperceptible breeze.",
