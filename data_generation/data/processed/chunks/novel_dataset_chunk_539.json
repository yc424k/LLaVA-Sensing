Baird was an accomplished publicist?one of his stunts was to place a working TV in a window of Selfridge’s department store, drawing crowds great enough to stop traffic?and that brought a rush of financing. By 1927, Baird was at the head of a company that had nearly two hundred employees. He was not a good company man and hated having to answer to a board of directors. Developing a particular dislike for Sir Edward Manville, the pompous chairman imposed on him by his principal investors, Baird had a lab built with an intentionally narrow entrance. The portly Manville, on his first visit, got stuck and had to be pushed through from behind. As Baird recalled proudly, Manville “lost several buttons from his waistcoat and dropped his cigar and tramped on it in the process”?and never visited the lab again.",

Another sign pointed the way to the various amenities, to the restaurants, and to the beach. Teresa said she had waited long enough; it was time to dip our toes in the sea. We followed a winding trail among the pools, around the cabanas, between the trees, and over a bridge or two. Somewhere we got lost, doubled-back, passed a golf course, waved at the groundskeeper, and took pictures of the full moon hanging over us. Eventually, we found a long boardwalk and heard water lapping at the shore. We had found the Red Sea. The beach, a long, narrow strip of sand, was dark, quiet, and perfectly empty. The sea, a warm, thick slurry of saltwater, brushed the beach with gentle, careful strokes. A streetlamp from the boardwalk cast our shadow over the water, and for the first time in weeks, we held hands in public.",

Our governesses teach us how pleasant and amiable an adornment is politeness, but not one of mine ever told me what I was to say when confronted by an announcement that I was to be included in somebody's prayers. If Charlotte, anxious to be polite, had said, 'Oh, please don't let him trouble,' the bishop's wife would have been shocked. If she had said what she felt, and wholly declined to be prayed for at all by strange bishops, Mrs. Harvey-Browne would have been horrified. It is a nice question; and it preoccupied me for the rest of the time we sat there, and we sat there a very long time; for although Charlotte was manifestly sorely tried by Mrs. Harvey-Browne I had great difficulty in getting her away. Each time I suggested going back to our lodgings to bed she made some excuse for staying where she was. Everybody else seemed to have gone to bed, and even Ambrose, who had been bicycling all day, had begun visibly to droop before I could persuade her to come home. Slowly she walked along the silent sands, slowly she went into the house, still more slowly into her bedroom; and then, just as Gertrud had blessed me and blown out my candle in one breath, in she came with a light, and remarking that she did not feel sleepy sat down on the foot of my bed and began to talk.",

Teresa studied our guidebook and read once more about Luxor and the Red Sea resort towns, while I stared past her, out the window at the moving terrain. The train rocked violently from side to side, and jumped an inch or two at every revolution of the wheels under our seats. Suddenly, the filthy seats and floor seemed unimportant. I worried about our car derailing. Some stretches were worse than others, and I realized that the train and its trucks were fine. It must be the rails, I thought, the extreme heat over the last few days must have buckled the steel rails. I pictured the train rolling over the buckled tracks and felt the rhythm in my skeleton. Thump, thump, thud. A moment later, the air-conditioning sputtered and spat and hissed to an unceremonious death. I closed my eyes. A drop of sweat trickled from my forehead, across my brow, down the slope of my nose, and landed on my upper lip. I wiped it away with my forearm. Another drop of sweat began its slow crawl down my face.",

At first I thought it must be a herd of alarmed goats – though this seemed unlikely – but an instant later shrieks and screams of an uncanny stridency shockingly ravaged the stillness. We were then rounding the spur – and I stopped, accusing myself of having an hallucination, for the slope ahead was apparently swarming with misshapen lions. It took me half a minute to realise my privilege. This was a herd of some two hundred Gelada (Bleeding Heart) baboons – one of the rarest of animals, which is found only in Ethiopia, and in Ethiopia only on the highest mountains. So my hallucination was understandable, for the magnificent male Gelada has a thick lionesque mane – a waist-length cape of dark fur – and to strengthen the illusion his tail is handsomely tufted.",

Following the landmarks with the contours on the chart, we were two miles away from the entrance of the harbor when the thunderstorms hit. One after the other they swarmed down, totally obscuring any semblance of wind, so I used the opportunities to scrub the decks and take a shower. All too soon, evening approached and there was no more hope for us to get in before nightfall. It was so close that I could have easily swum to shore had I not seen the enormous dorsal fin of a shark earlier that morning. Resignedly, I went about preparing myself for another night at sea, when a sailboat came out of the harbor and motored up.",

The play was so big that it has spawned a parallel “Lost Colony,” much more extensive than the historic park, including a mock Tudor theater and stockade, drama workshops, and an official historian who went by the theatrically lowercase name of lebame houston.",

This looks a little more promising, and with the construction of new highways, motels and gas stations the tribe has taken steps to lure tourists into the reservation and relieve them of their dollars. The chief beneficiaries will be the oil and automotive combines far away, but part of the take will remain on the reservation in the form of wages paid to those who change the sheets, do the laundry, pump the gas, serve the meals, wash the dishes, clean the washrooms and pump out the septic tanks – simple tasks for which the Navajos are available and qualified.",

Mimi writes that as the human procession—carrying gifts for the dead—“winds its way up the narrow road pressed between vineyards and tiny dwellings, it is itself pressed hard against the road walls to permit the automobile procession passage. . . . Every one hundred yards or so a new family group emerges from some tiny doorway and melts into the praying walkers, so that the procession grows to about fifty people by the time it finishes its half-hour walk to the cemetery's entrance.” Fortunately the dead themselves, who are believed to be present, do not contribute to the crush.

At the far end of the field, he could see an enormous hump around which the English and their allies were gathered. It was Mont St. Jean and they were getting ready to defend it gallantly. It wasn’t quite finished, however, and swarmed with grips, property men, set dressers, carpenters and painters.",

Stop! Dont raise it!” and even reaching for the screen, but too late; old Meadowfill, standing now, leaned the rifle beside the window and put both hands on the handle and jerked the screen up. Then the light sharp vicious spat of the .22 cartridge from the peach tree; his uncle said he was actually looking at the rising screen when the wire frayed and vanished before the miniature blast; Charles himself seemed actually to hear the tiny pellets hiss across old Meadowfill’s belly and chest as the old man half-leaped half-fell backward into the chair which rushed from under him, leaving him asprawl on the floor, where he lay for a moment with on his face an expression of incredulous outrage: not pain, not anguish, fright: just outrage, already reaching for the rifle as he sat up.",

At first we circle around the oncoming throngs. Soon we tire of serpentining far out of our way and decide to wade through them instead. This is a total gamble, as there’s equal likelihood we’ll emerge on the other side as there is of being swept by the human current in their opposing direction. When we squeeze shoulder to shoulder with thousands of vacationing Chinese in the Forbidden City at the Square’s north end, we realize the crowds near the mausoleum were meager.",

In any case, I thought she was lovely and the miracle was that she appeared to find a certain charm in me. She and the other girl, Trudi, grew swiftly drunk and loquacious and spent half the time talking in Swedish, but it didn’t matter. I sat with my chin in my hands, just gazing at this Swedish fantasy, hopelessly besotted, stirring to my senses from time to time just long enough to suck back drool and take a sip of beer. Occasionally she would lay a hand on my bare forearm, sending my hormones into delirious turmoil, and once she glanced over and absently stroked my cheek with the back of her hand. I would have sold my mother as a galley slave and plunged a dagger into my thigh for her.",

The balls of ice gathered in the roof until it ripped and dumped a ton of frozen water on the occupants. It was back to Kurt’s, and gradually the pressure began to build again. He complained continually that there was no money left so I decided to get a job a few nights a week at a restaurant in town. It was disgusting work but it meant I was once more relating to humans and cracking jokes in the kitchen with real people. It also meant that I was overtired at work the next day. Kurt had become increasingly truculent and lazy, leaving most of the running of the place to me which I now found I could do quite capably. It suited me because I didn’t have him breathing down my neck.",

Five days after my grandfather died, my three-year-old son and my five-year-old daughter reached the summit of their first true hill, Darling Fell, near Loweswater in the Lake District. The final slopes of that fell are sheep-cropped grass, into which previous walkers have imprinted a series of deep and distinct footmarks. My children went on ahead of me to climb that last slope, fitting their feet into the marks, following the invitation of the print-trail. I watched them go, and thought of having been one of those children myself, watched by my parents, and of my mother having been one of those children in turn, watched over in turn by my grandparents. When the summit had been reached, we all sat together, drank cups of sugary tea and looked across at the mountain ridges receding into the distance, too many to count.",

    "target_paragraph": "We eventually got Lou to the tonga, the tonga to the horse, and the horse to the hospital. There followed an hour the likes of which I hope never to have to go through again. The hospital was a filthy place and smelt of urine and incontinent Uigurs. It reminded me of archive photographs of field hospitals on the western front in 1916. Men lay groaning on camp beds. Muffled shrieks echoed down the corridors. As I carried Louisa in, two tonga-driving ambulance men carried a corpse out. Then Louisa ran out of strength. She sat slumped forward on a chair while I tried to explain the problem to a Uigur doctor. He took very little interest, partly I think because he spoke no English and partly also because ten Uigur women were trying to explain their problems to him at the same time. In the middle of my explanation he simply turned heel and walked off. It was over an hour before we were finally ushered into a surgery. Here a Chinese doctor ordered Lou to bare her arm. He then disappeared behind a curtain and emerged carrying an enormous syringe. It was an antihistamine dose about ten inches long by two inches wide. Ordering a Uigur nurse to hold Louisa still, he jabbed the needle into her bared upper arm. He did this with such violence that Louisa sobbed with pain. Then, rather than giving the injection in one go, he delivered the dose in short bursts over a period of five minutes, during which time the needle remained firmly stuck in Louisa’s flesh. She was beginning to have difficulty breathing: frightened, exhausted and in considerable pain, she became hysterical. She started screaming, and was sick all over the doctor, a bucket and the floor. The injection over, she collapsed onto a bed on the far side of the surgery, where she fell into a deep sleep. When she awoke three hours later, her swellings were down. By the time I got her back to Chini Bagh all the blotches and weals had completely disappeared, but she was still very weak and it was clear that she would not be able to move from her bed for several days.",

From this he drew the strength which Rimbaud denied himself. The French poet was of a different order of bravery, for he was on the run from the Hound of Heaven …",

They’ll ask, “Who is That Quiet Girl in the Back of the Temple, always scrubbing the floors, down on her knees? She never speaks. She’s so elusive. She’s so mystical. I can’t even imagine what her voice sounds like. You never even hear her coming up behind you on the garden path when she’s out walking…she moves as silently as the breeze. She must be in a constant state of meditative communion with God. She’s the quietest girl I’ve ever seen.”",
