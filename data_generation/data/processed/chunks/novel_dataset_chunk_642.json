Snow is the disguise artist of the mountains. It can rock benignly down through the air in flakes as big and soft as duck down, or be fired from the clouds in shotgun-pellets of hail. It can lie in neat windrows, or in irregular waves. Spindrift is one of the most charismatic features of snowy mountains. Climbing a lee-slope in a big wind, you can look up to see sheets of spindrift flaring out over the ridge, or it can undulate over the surface of hard snow like a supple second skin. As ice, it can coat objects in glistening shellac, or form a tracery of icicles which stretches out across a rock face. Once, ascending a glacier 15,000 feet up in the Himalaya, I glanced up from my plodding feet to see acres of frozen ice slopes stretching away from me on either side, as smooth, hard and bright as china.",

And twice we’d seen those cargoes being led around the town centre, looking slightly weary and more than slightly bemused as their guides ‘sold’ them the Revolution in broken English. We never saw them elsewhere; presumably that town centre tour was it – they had done Baracoa. Safely back in their hotel, they could splash in the pool’s familiar chlorine-scented water, recline with daiquiris on the terrace and photograph sunset over the bay before packing up in readiness for an early departure and the next two-night stand. Masstourism’s rate of increase is disturbing on several counts, not least because it reduces people and places to consumer items.",

It’s hard, now that such journeys have become commonplace, to reconstruct how exciting the approach to Moscow was. From the looks of it, Russia was all trees. Sheremetyevo Airport, Moscow’s venue for international flights, appeared from the window to be in the middle of an endless, deeply green forest. The plane landed and sat on the runway for a while. Finally it came up to the terminal and the door opened. The mobile ramp that extended out to the plane door met it about a foot too high. We had to duck our heads and step up to get off the plane.",

The kids give most trouble, for they have to be caught – much against their will – and then secured in quartets by means of leather thongs knotted around their kicking forelegs. The other stock, who have sense enough not to wander after dark, are simply driven on to the open space between the high-blazing fire and the cliff above the river. When the two cows had been milked into gourds the milk was shared with me and I was offered dabo and roasted barley, but as both were in short supply I feasted instead on tinned mackerel and raisins.",

According to Amnesty International, throughout the 1990s Beijing shut down mosques and Koranic schools, tightened control on the Islamic clergy, and executed political prisoners for crimes as slight as hanging a banned flag on a statue of Mao. (This suppression intensified tenfold after September 11, 2001, but that’s another story.)",

Standing on the crest in warm sunshine, we faced an invigorating wind and noted the virtual disappearance of our path. The configuration of the landscape allowed an illusion of being on top of the world; there were no higher mountains nearby, only vast widths of puna bright beneath an infinite blue arc. One felt a sense of achievement none the less satisfying for being rather absurd. The clarity of the light gave a magical distinctness to every distant boulder and clump of spiky ichu grass. The quality of the silence was holy and healing. The purity of the air made one tingle with energy, as though one ran on electricity. Somehow that place and time induced an elated awareness of freedom. Everything that might tie one to the superficial and superfluous had been shed like a snake’s skin and nothing mattered but the immediate moment.",

These were thumping their chests with all their strength, like angry gorillas, while gazing fixedly at the tattered banners and lamenting their murdered heroes. Many were naked from the waist up, though the temperature was still below freezing point, and already their chests were bruised and reddened. (The average Balti torso is as white as a northern European’s, without even the Latin swarthiness.) Frequently the leading mullah halted the procession to declaim passionately and then the entire crowd – some 200 men, the majority quite young – breast-beat zealously, as though each were trying to prove that he could thump harder than his neighbour. We were standing on a rock-slab some ten yards from the edge of the track, where we could see all without getting in the way, and as the procession passed at a funeral pace no one even glanced in our direction though normally every Balti we meet stares at us intently.",

    "target_paragraph": "July 12, 1954, was a hot day in a time of drought. The woods of the greater Chatsworth area were “loaded with fuel,” as foresters put it, for there had been no large fires in that section for some years. The Chatsworth Fire, as it eventually came to be known, started in a cedar swamp nine miles southwest of the town. Eddie Parker saw it at 4:04 P.M. and called it in. In a short time, twenty-five men had reached the cedar swamp. They had back tanks and other portable equipment, and also three four-wheel-drive trucks carrying two-hundred-gallon water tanks. When the men arrived, only three acres had burned. At 7:30 P.M., they reported the fire under control. The ground was so dry, however, that the fire was burning down into the turf of the swamp. By morning, it had spread over about twelve acres, and had gone so deep that it could not be put out. It was surrounded by firefighters, but sometime in the forenoon of July 13th it escaped. The flames began to move east before brisk winds. The strategy and number of the firefighters had to expand with the fire. By 3 P.M., fire lines were being plowed and backfires set in an effort to contain the destruction within an area of six hundred acres. Winds grew in force and began to shift. Spot fires from flying embers appeared all over the woods downwind. By midnight, new lines had been established and the new area of containment was five thousand acres. A forest fire moves in a V, like the wake of a ship. The point of the V is called the head fire, and if it gets up into the tops of the trees it is also called a crówn fire. The sides of the V, which burn slowly outward, are called lateral fires, and they have to be fought by men with back tanks and shovels, for if lateral fires get far enough out to catch a wind of their own with fresh fuel in front of them, they can become new head fires. At 8 A.M. on July 14th, a fire warden named William Phoenix flew over the fire in a light plane and reported that it seemed to be pretty much under control. That afternoon, however, winds even higher than those of the two previous days came up, and, before them, several new head fires developed, in broadly separated places. These new head fires jumped the previous lines of containment. They crowned, and, like warships converging, they moved toward Chatsworth. By this time, some two hundred fire trucks had come from all over central and southern New Jersey, and even from Pennsylvania. The United States Army had arrived. Many women in Chatsworth packed what they could and left the town. People buried things. A man who lived in the woods north of Chatsworth buried his refrigerator.",

As friends and acquaintances died he shook his head with the melancholy hypocrisy of old men, saying: ‘They’re all going, one by one. Ah, Lord!

Quite a lot of people waved to me in the suburbs, so I suppose the fashion interview had been broadcast. As the suburbs gave way to country again I noticed that an unusually large number of monumental masons had set up their businesses along this road, and two or three of the showrooms I passed had notices urging customers to buy their graves now while stocks lasted. The other specialty of the region seemed to be yokan (sweets made of bean jelly), but for weight-conscious tourists a sign suggested live stag beetles as alternative souvenirs. Most of the time, the older road I was marching along ran parallel to the new expressway, and several people I stopped to talk with complained that the expressway had killed off their livelihoods. Towns like Ochiai were dying, they said. Perhaps the monumental masons had anticipated the demise.",

Late-summer heat, a dry year, a lightning strike, and the skies grow apocalyptic with ash and plume, a dirty glow visible from miles away.

He came at landscapes diagonally, always trying to find new ways to move in or through them. ‘Tramping is a straying from the obvious,’ he wrote, ‘even the crookedest road is sometimes too straight.’ In Britain and Ireland, ‘straying from the obvious’ brought him into contact with landscapes that were, as he put it, ‘unnamed - wild, woody, marshy’. In The Gentle Art he described how he drew up a ‘fairy-tale’ map of the glades, fields and forests he reached: its network of little-known wild places.",

She must see Mr. Langhope first, must clear Amherst of the least faint association with her act or her intention. And to do this she must exaggerate, not her own compunction—for she could not depart from the exact truth in reporting her feelings and convictions—but her husband's first instinctive movement of horror, the revulsion of feeling her confession had really produced in him. This was the most painful part of her task, and for this reason her excited imagination clothed it with a special expiatory value. If she could purchase Amherst's peace of mind, and the security of his future, by confessing, and even over-emphasizing, the momentary estrangement between them there would be a bitter joy in such payment!",
