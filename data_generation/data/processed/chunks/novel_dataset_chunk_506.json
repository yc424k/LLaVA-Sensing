It was straightness and emptiness of course; the symmetry of a corridor; but it was also windows lit up, a piano, a gramophone sounding; a sense of pleasure-making hidden, but now and again emerging when, through the uncurtained window, the window left open, one saw parties sitting over tables, young people slowly circling, conversations between men and women, maids idly looking out (a strange comment theirs, when work was done), stockings drying on top ledges, a parrot, a few plants. Absorbing, mysterious, of infinite richness, this life. And in the large square where the cabs shot and swerved so quick, there were loitering couples, dallying, embracing, shrunk up under the shower of a tree; that was moving; so silent, so absorbed, that one passed, discreetly, timidly, as if in the presence of some sacred ceremony to interrupt which would have been impious. That was interesting. And so on into the flare and glare.",

This entrance is normally flat even under storm conditions. The skies turned a very threatening grey black and then a fine mist began to fall. We headed into the cabin and turned on the VHF and instruments. You could hear and feel the panic of the boaters on the VHF radio. The last official message from the government weather radio was that Ivan had increased to a Category 5 hurricane, 150 mph plus. The eye was predicted to pass several miles south of our location. Then the radio went silent. The government radio mast had blown away. We were in the worst scenario possible, the north quadrant of a Category 5 hurricane. The recording barometer on board Quest had been dropping steadily since the morning. It now took a nose dive. It was well below 1000 millibars. The wind was up to 45 mph. I cooked a light lunch and then just waited. By 2:30 the wind was up to 60 mph and the docks were rocking so violently that no one would consider walking on them. By 3 PM the wind was holding steady at 90 mph. I mean steady. The wind anemometer seemed stuck at 90. I asked Wendy to get the manual for the instrument. Sure enough 90 mph was the maximum speed that could be displayed. The wind held above 90 mph for about an hour. Around 4:00 the wind dropped down to 60. Just around that time we heard a knocking on our deck. A knocking on the deck? I looked out the companionway and the marina manager was standing there buffeted by the storm.",

    "target_paragraph": "By autumn 1944, basic supplies in the Netherlands were running desperately low. With gas and electricity cut off, some residents had resorted to pedalling on stationary bicycles to generate power. The American newscaster Walter Cronkite, parachuted into Arnhem, recorded that the Dutch were ‘near starvation … They looked like children in their parents’ clothing.’ But the worst was yet to come. While the war dragged on into December, one of the coldest winters on record descended on the country. As the survivor Henri van der Zee recorded in his remarkable book The Hunger Winter, supply routes that had been established on rivers and canals ground to a halt as the waterways froze over. Without access to fuel or electricity, people were forced to scavenge for wood to burn. Leafy parks were razed to the ground, large trees stripped of their branches, and wooden fences and benches ripped up. Amsterdam’s Vondelpark was closed to the public after enterprising locals repeatedly attempted to auction off its trees, promising home delivery of harvested wood at exorbitant prices. According to van der Zee, the Dutch Bible Society was dismayed to discover that a sudden increase in sales of the good book had occurred not because of an outpouring of religious faith, but because black marketeers were selling bible pages for use as cigarette paper. Even walking became problematic due to a shortage of shoes. City dwellers conducted excursions into the countryside by bicycle, trading – if they were lucky – jewellery and cutlery for milk, eggs and potatoes. If they were luckier still, they might find a horse killed by bombing and take home steak for dinner.",

Gertrud and I put a coat between us in place of the abandoned tea-basket, and settled in with an appreciation of our comforts that we had not had before. Gertrud, indeed, looked positively happy, so thankful was she to be safely in the carriage again, and joy was written in every line of August's back. About a mile and a half off lay Lauterbach, a little straggling group of houses down by the water; and quite by itself, a mile to the left of Lauterbach, I could see the hotel we were going to, a long white building something like a Greek temple, with a portico and a flight of steps the entire length of its façade, conspicuous in its whiteness against a background of beechwoods. Woods and fields and sea and a lovely little island a short way from the shore called Vilm, were bathed in sunset splendour. Lauterbach and not Putbus, then, was the place of radiant jelly-fish and crystal water and wooded coves. Probably in those distant years when Marianne North enjoyed them Lauterbach as an independent village with a name to itself did not exist. A branch railway goes down now to the very edge of the sea. We crossed the line and drove between chestnut trees and high grassy banks starry with flowers to the Greek hotel.",

If De Soto was the son of the sun, he replied, “let him dry up the great river and he would believe him.” As for De Soto’s demand that the chief cross the river to give obeisance, the Indian declared that “he was not accustomed to visit anyone.” Rather, all paid homage to him.",

Cornish perceived affinities between phenomena that one would never usually think to connect. He pointed out similarities between the movement of steam quitting a chimney, the arrangement of water-weed tresses in a stream, the way fallen leaves drift before the wind, the composition of quicksand, the rippled cloud effect called ‘mackerel’ sky, the body-shapes of fish and cetaceans, the wings of birds, and the cahots or undulating tracks that were made by the procession of sledges or carriages over snow or mud. His curiosity was exemplary. Why, he wanted to know, did flowing water create transverse ripples of sand, hard under foot, like the ridges in a cassock? He developed his own esoteric vocabulary for describing his wave forms: he named the ‘entrance’ and the ‘run’ of wave-drifts of snow or sand, terms he took from naval architects’ language for the swelling fore-part and narrowing after-part of a ship. He was particularly interested by what he called the ‘eddy-curve’ - the complex form of drift, with a blunt head and a fine tail, that was produced in snow, sand or any other non-liquid particular matter by the effect of a current moving against a fixed obstacle.",

The shooting motor cars, more like spiders in the moon than terrestrial objects, the thundering drays, the jingling hansoms, and little black broughams, made her think of the world she lived in. Somewhere up there above the pinnacles where the smoke rose in a pointed hill, her children were now asking for her, and getting a soothing reply. As for the mass of streets, squares, and public buildings which parted them, she only felt at this moment how little London had done to make her love it, although thirty of her forty years had been spent in a street. She knew how to read the people who were passing her; there were the rich who were running to and from each other’s houses at this hour; there were the bigoted workers driving in a straight line to their offices; there were the poor who were unhappy and rightly malignant. Already, though there was sunlight in the haze, tattered old men and women were nodding off to sleep upon the seats. When one gave up seeing the beauty that clothed things, this was the skeleton beneath.",

Again he felt the gold and sapphire loveliness of a Saturday in May, and drank the glory of the earth into his heart, and heard in lucent and lyrical air the heavy shattering ‘baugh’ of the great ship’s whistle, as it spoke gloriously, of springtime, new lands and departure. Again he saw ten thousand faces, touched with their strange admixture of sorrow and joy, swarm past the openings of the pier, and again he saw the flashing tides that girdled the city, whitened around the prows of a hundred boats and gleaming with a million iridescent points of light. Again the great walled cliff, the crowded isle, the fabulous spires and ramparts of the city, as delicate as the hues of light that flashed around them, slid away from him, and one by one, the great ships, with the proud sweep of their breasts of white, their opulent storeyed superstructure, their music of power and speed, fell into line at noon on Saturday. And now, like bridled horses held in leash, with princely chafe and curvetings, they breach the mighty harbour, nose the narrows, circle slowly to brief pauses at the pilot’s boat, and then, like racers set loose from the barriers, they are sent away, their engines tremble to a mighty stroke, the ships are given to the sea, to solitude, and to their proper glory once more.",

After our pleasant interview with Signor Donati, an ice cream, a stop for Ed to buy a shirt at his favorite store, Sugar, and one for me to buy hand towels at my favorite shop, Busatti, we come back to the car and find the big 40 (104°) flashing over the car. The door handles appear to be on fire. The heat inside slams into us. We air out the car and finally get in. My eyelids and earrings are hot. Ed touches the steering wheel with his thumbs and index fingers. My hair seems to be steaming. Stores are closing; it’s the hottest part of the hottest day of the year. At home, I lower myself into a cool bath, wet washcloth over my face, and just lie there until my body takes on the temperature of the water.",

On several occasions during the shameful period of his enthralment he had seen her--sent for by Fanny to bring her something, a handkerchief or something, always at the most bitterly disappointing moment for him, or coming out of the dining-room where she had been arranging flowers for one of the frequent dinner-parties. But on the last dreadful day of all--the recollection positively skinned him--she came out of it just as he was stumbling down the stairs, his face wet with tears, and in his heart only one prayer left, that he might get out of the house without being seen. And there she was standing and looking at him. And the recollection of the terrible moment, he was shocked to find, still was able to pull all his skin off. Out of the past it surged up again, hot and flaying, when he heard her name. There was to be a dinner-party that evening, and Manby, whose gift for arranging flowers had long been discovered and made use of, had just finished setting out the results of her work on the dining-room table, and she came out into the hall at the very moment when he was stumbling down the stairs.",

Perhaps what actually moved them were the accounts of the conscripted levee gangs, mixed blacks and whites working in double shifts against the steadily rising water; stories of men, even though they were negroes, being forced like themselves to do work for which they received no other pay than coarse food and a place in a mudfloored tent to sleep on—stories, pictures, which emerged from the shorter convict’s reading voice: the mudsplashed white men with the inevitable shotguns, the antlike lines of negroes carrying sandbags, slipping and crawling up the steep face of the revetment to hurl their futile ammuntion into the face of a flood and return for more. Or perhaps it was more than this. Perhaps they watched the approach of the disaster with that same amazed and incredulous hope of the slaves—the lions and bears and elephants, the grooms and bathmen and pastrycooks—who watched the mounting flames of Rome from Ahenobarbus’ gardens. But listen they did and presently it was May and the warden’s newspaper began to talk in headlines two inches tall—those black staccato slashes of ink which, it would almost seem, even the illiterate should be able to read: Crest Passes Memphis at Midnight. 4000 Homeless in White River Basin.

Undoubtedly they were aggressive-drunk and a white who got in their way might well have been killed. The cause of the unrest, according to a Coloured teacher, was an abortive funeral. Following the death near Cape Town of a 40-year-old local black woman, many Vosburgers now living in Nyanga returned for the burial – which didn’t happen. The corpse was missing, the family couldn’t pay the fee for ten days in a deep-freeze mortuary. As family members may be hard to contact, and then need time to collect fare-money, high ‘cold storage’ fees are common. If these go unpaid, the authorities cremate the unclaimed body and the spirit never rests – or not until some reliable sangoma has calmed it, which also costs money. A grim example, this, of blacks on Third World incomes being trapped by a First World society able expensively to freeze corpses.",

In particular, middle-class Republicans believed in their guilt. Senator William Borah of Idaho, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, said “it would be a national humiliation, a shameless, cowardly compromise of national courage, to pay the slightest attention to foreign protests,” which he called “impudent and willful.”",

Most of the stores seemed to be trendy boutiques, across whose windows were splashed New Wave Japanese T-shirts and pretty sundresses in Miami Vice turquoise and pink. Surfaris. Tropical Climax. Cherry. Mariko. An American Werewolf in London was playing at the local cinema. The Narnia. Frenchy. Pancho’s. The Pub. A few Men at Work songs were pouring out of cassette stores opened to the street, only to be drowned out by the roar of Suzukis erratically ridden by local boys in leopardskin shirts. Fatty. The Beer Garden. Depot Viva. The Duck Nuts. “Marijuana and hashish,” whispered one man to me. “Hashish and cocaine,” muttered his friend. Joe’s. Lenny. Jerry. Elly’s. Elice’s. I walked back to my guesthouse—Van Morrison had now replaced Vivaldi on the system—and a couple of the boys there invited me to sit down over some guacamole and give them my opinion of Michael Landon and John McEnroe.",

Most of the other businesses along the street were given over to live sex shows, and I was interested to note that the photos of the artistes on display outside were unusually ? I am tempted to say unwisely ? candid. In my experience, places such as these always show pictures of famously beautiful women like Christie Brinkley and Raquel Welsh, which I dare say even the most inexperienced sailor from Tristan da Cunha must realize is not what he’s likely to encounter inside, but at least they leave you wondering what you are going to find. These pictures, however, showed gyrating women of frightfully advanced years ? women with maroon hair and thighs that put me in mind of flowing lava. These ladies must have been past their best when the Beatles were playing. They weren’t just over the hill; they were pinpricks on the horizon.",

The population seemed to be concentrated in a dozen shacks, similar to Mother Stoughten’s, strewn around paths in the immediate greenery. Since there was a Magistrate, protocol demanded a visit. The Magistrate lived in a large bare house on a bare hill and was a black doctor who had trained in Scotland. He was poor in furniture but rich in lithographs of shaggy mountain goats or maybe sheep and bluebells, labelled Glen Nevis, and views of Edinburgh Castle and group photographs of himself as a young man, wearing a Scotch tam o’shanter among white friends in kilts. His sitting-room cried aloud homesickness for that distant cold country.",

His owner guiltily enjoyed an excellent supper – six ounces of tinned cheese with half a pound of raw prunes, eaten by brilliant starlight. Here the sky arches like some exotically decorated Emperor’s tent above all those square ambas, curving crests, triangular spires and jagged ridges that tonight form the boundaries of my world. Level with this ledge, on the other side of the valley, I can see a few little fires – companionable red dots in the darkness – and occasionally I hear the distant howling of dogs. At least I hope it is the howling of dogs, and not of hyenas; undoubtedly this is hyena country, which worries me slightly. Yet the lighting of a fire might attract human marauders, so instead I’ll tether Jock near me – a precaution that will restrict his grazing. Fortunately hypothetical hyenas cannot destroy my pleasure in this superbly beautiful ‘Night on the Bare Mountain’ – where the air feels like cool velvet and cicadas are serenading me from the valley and the still majesty of the mountains looms all around.",

I woke in a garden, with a blow on the nape of my neck, a hot kiss, Jinny’s; remembering all this as one remembers confused cries and toppling pillars and shafts of red and black in some nocturnal conflagration. I am for ever sleeping and waking. Now I sleep; now I wake. I see the gleaming tea-urn; the glass cases full of pale-yellow sandwiches; the men in round coats perched on stools at the counter; and also behind them, eternity. It is a stigma burnt on my quivering flesh by a cowled man with a red-hot iron. I see this eating-shop against the packed and fluttering birds’ wings, many feathered, folded, of the past. Hence my pursed lips, my sickly pallor; my distasteful and uninviting aspect as I turn my face with hatred and bitterness upon Bernard and Neville, who saunter under yew trees; who inherit armchairs; and draw their curtains close, so that lamplight falls on their books.",

What sadness,” and _Star_ finds the “Days eternal, till Thursday.” And yet they often choose rather prosaic pseudonyms. Here is _Sahara_ who “suffers from your silence,” while _Asthma_ is “anticipating one endless kiss,” and _Old England_ observing, more ir sorrow than in anger, that he “waited vainly one whole hour.”\nBut the sagacious _Cooked Lobster_ desires, before commiting himself further, “a personal interview.” He has perhaps been cooked once before.\nLetters and numbers are best, after all.
