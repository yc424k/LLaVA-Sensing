Now and then he turned his eyes from the girl’s face to that of her partner, which, in the exhilaration of the dance, had taken on a look of almost impudent ownership. Denis Eady was the son of Michael Eady, the ambitious Irish grocer, whose suppleness and effrontery had given Starkfield its first notion of “smart” business methods, and whose new brick store testified to the success of the attempt. His son seemed likely to follow in his steps, and was meanwhile applying the same arts to the conquest of the Starkfield maidenhood. Hitherto Ethan Frome had been content to think him a mean fellow; but now he positively invited a horse-whipping. It was strange that the girl did not seem aware of it: that she could lift her rapt face to her dancer’s, and drop her hands into his, without appearing to feel the offence of his look and touch.",

Faced with a sheer wall of seven feet, he let himself hang by his arms before dropping blindly to the next ledge. This shook him up physically: ‘the stretching of the muscles of my hands and arms, and the jolt of the Fall on my Feet, put my whole Limbs in a Tremble’. It also committed him to finding a route down. There was no way of reversing that move; a rubicon had been crossed. Coleridge kept moving down the cliff, but the situation was quickly becoming more grave – every drop ‘increased the Palsy of my limbs’.",

Did you know that Scotland produces more university students per capita than any other nation in Europe? And it has churned out a rollcall of worthies far out of proportion to its modest size—Robert Louis Stevenson, James Watt, Robert Burns, Walter Scott, Arthur Conan Doyle, J. M. Barrie, Adam Smith, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Telford, Lord Kelvin, John Logie Baird, and Charles Rennie Mackintosh, to name but a few. Among much else we owe the Scots are whiskey, raincoats, rubber boots, the bicycle pedal, the telephone, Tarmac, penicillin, and an understanding of the active principles of cannabis, and think how insupportable life would be without those. So thank you, Scotland, and never mind that you seem quite unable to qualify for the World Cup soccer championships these days.",

Cra—boom—shock!\nPi-i-i-e-e-eeuu! The other gun this time. We saw the shell burst higher up the stony hill this time. And then four booms floated to us, and, simultaneously, the enemy’s shells, which had been exploding desultorily over the line of trees nearest the city, marched out into the open desert and leaped toward us in four tremendous explosions, each nearer. More guns had wheeled into line; others filed off to the right along a diagonal of trees, and a long line of heavy trucks, plunging mules, and cursing, shouting men choked up the dusty road to the rear.\nThe unlimbered mules jingled back and the drivers threw themselves, exhausted, under the nearest chaparral.",

They chatted for quite awhile. The host returned to our table with two large plates of hot food. My shawarma was served on a long, soft roll stuffed with grilled chicken, peppers, and a tahini sauce; it was every bit as glorious as any meal I had yet to eat in Egypt. The fries were massive slabs of potato, crunchy on the outside and steamy soft inside.

Nikita Khrushchev denounced the wrongs and excesses of Stalinism in his famous speech at the Twentieth Party Congress in February 1956. The following year, after winning a struggle for power with fellow Stalin-era holdovers among the party leadership, Khrushchev did not have his main rivals shot, as Stalin would have done, but instead made Vyacheslav Molotov ambassador to Mongolia and sent Georgi Malenkov to head a Siberian electrical-generating plant. In the later years of the Soviet Union, and certainly after its fall, one heard less often about enemies of the government being sent to Siberia. And yet in 2005, when President Vladimir Putin brought down the politically inclined oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky on charges of bribery, theft, and fraud, the defeated billionaire was sent not to some minimum-security jail in greater Moscow, but to Penal Colony Number 10, southeast of the Siberian city, of Chita. That city, many miles east of Lake Baikal, was where Tsar Nicholas I had sent the most dangerous of the Decembrists—or rather, those he had decided not to hang.",

One slightly blurry film recorded in some detail the Allies’ shameful refusal to put the whole Auschwitz complex and its rail links out of action though they were bombing targets only five miles away. Both Roosevelt and Churchill coldly emphasised their one objective: the total defeat of Nazi Germany. No side-issues could be taken into account. Those crematoria a side-issue …? Significantly, Churchill had always cheered for Zionism. To my universalist Jewish friends, Zionists ‘are among the worst anti-Semites’. Back to terminology – one measure of the reach and power of the hasbara machine may be found in Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (1961, reprinted 2002) where anti-Semitism is defined as ‘opposition to Zionism: sympathy with opponents of the state of Israel’. Truly this is immoral – to equate anti-Semites with those who seek justice for the Palestinians.",

I lay flat on the bank, rolled up my sleeve, and reached down to the bottom of the stream, where the water was weaving and unweaving the light, and picked a white stone, hooped once round with blue. I sat on the bank, holding the stone, and tried to list to myself the motions that were acting upon it at that moment: the earth’s 700-miles-per-hour spin around its axis, its 67,000-miles-per-hour orbit about the sun, its slow precessional straightening within inertial space, and containing all of that, the galaxy’s own inestimable movement outwards in the deep night of the universe. I tried to imagine into the stone, as well, the continuous barrage of photons - star photons and moon photons and sun photons - those spinning massless particles which were arriving upon the stone in their trillions, hitting it at 186,000 miles-per-second, as they were hitting me, and even with the stone still solid in my hand, I felt briefly passed through, made more of gaps than of joins.",

Her legs were fine when she climbed down from the train and she did not need to hold on to the blood-smeared railings; they were fine as she stood for the three-hour drive to Nsukka in a bus so crowded she could not reach out to scratch her itching back. But at the front door of Odenigbo’s house, they failed. So did her bladder. There was the melting of her legs, and there was also the wetness of hot liquid running between her thighs. Baby discovered her. Baby had walked to the front door to look out, asking Ugwu when Mummy Ola would come back, and then cried out at the crumpled form on the steps. Odenigbo carried her in, bathed her, and held Baby back from hugging her too tightly. After Baby fell asleep, Olanna told Odenigbo what she had seen. She described the vaguely familiar clothes on the headless bodies in the yard, the still-twitchy fingers on Uncle Mbaezi’s hand, the rolled-back eyes of the child’s head in the calabash and the odd skin tone? a flat, sallow gray, like a poorly wiped blackboard?of all the corpses that lay in the yard.",

One morning, not long after moving back into the van, the pain gets so bad that he can barely breathe. So we drive straight to San Jose (the capital), and I call around trying to figure out how to see a doctor. It’s intimidating to make phone calls in Spanish to large hospitals, with no clue as to how the health system works here, but we eventually figure it out. We stay one night in a hotel next to a hospital and John sees an orthopedic surgeon, a physical therapist, and an osteopath. The first two are no help, but the osteopath cracks him like a glow stick and runs electricity through his back. She’s a miracle worker, and John feels ready to move back into the van that night.",

Now joy and hope have revived again in the hearts of millions of people, they breathe the air again with hunger, their movements are full of life and energy. The mark of their summer’s suffering is still legible upon their flesh, there is something starved and patient in their eyes, and a look that has a child’s hope and expectation in it.",

Here, in 1974, a vanguard group of settlers arrived, led by the infamous Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, then aged eighty-four. Among their supporters was General Ariel Sharon, on his way from military glory to political prominence. When confronted by Major-General Yona Efrat, the regional military ruler, Rabbi Kook said, ‘Bring a machine gun and shoot me.’ Instead, the Major-General ordered his men to remove the settlers because they lacked government approval. This temporary setback became a valuable recruiting device. Enlarged press photographs of soldiers manhandling unarmed, kipa-wearing youths significantly increased support for the embryonic Gush Emunim. When I asked Mr Ishaq if he remembered any of this he replied, ‘I remember how soon they came back and stayed.’",

Desperation kicked in and at the next hotel I pleaded with the owner, whose idea of air conditioning was a window that faced a brick wall. It was now more than two hours since the driver had made the fateful move of engaging with two people who had, so far, managed to rack up a spectacular run of bad luck travelling together. However, if his internal pedometer was clocking up the distance, he was due a hefty donation towards his work. Gasping for air, water and release from our clasp, the man dragged round his rickshaw and took us back to the first hotel.",

Like many lonely places in Russia, it had weathered its share of drunken vandalism. Tiny pieces of liquor bottles that had been thrown hard against the stones gave a holiday sparkle to the ground. Memorial busts had been smashed, their noses broken off. Flower vases had been tipped over and cracked. Some of the grave markers bore enameled photo portraits of the deceased set into ovals in the stone. A picture of a woman named Elena featured those intense, empathetic dark eyes you sometimes see in young Russian women. She had been born in 1957 and had died at the age of thirty-six. Lots of the people in the cemetery had died in their thirties. At the foot of one marker, centered neatly on its broad stone base, sat a Russian military cap. It had a shiny black bill and one of those extrahigh fronts with an emblem on it—the kind of hat formerly seen on the heads of generals reviewing a May Day parade. I wanted to pick it up and examine it, but I let it be.",

In New York, during the previous winter, after he and May had settled down in the new greenish-yellow house with the bow-window and the Pompeian vestibule, he had dropped back with relief into the old routine of the office, and the renewal of this daily activity had served as a link with his former self. Then there had been the pleasurable excitement of choosing a showy grey stepper for May's brougham (the Wellands had given the carriage), and the abiding occupation and interest of arranging his new library, which, in spite of family doubts and disapprovals, had been carried out as he had dreamed, with a dark embossed paper, Eastlake book-cases and \"sincere\" arm-chairs and tables. At the Century he had found Winsett again, and at the Knickerbocker the fashionable young men of his own set; and what with the hours dedicated to the law and those given to dining out or entertaining friends at home, with an occasional evening at the Opera or the play, the life he was living had still seemed a fairly real and inevitable sort of business.",

It was useless wearing anything beneath the gear because it would have been stupid to jeopardize the precious dry clothes by wearing them outside, where they’d be soaked in seconds. I fastened the hood around my salty head, which was matted into itchy, sticky clumps of hair and crying out to be washed. Practically the only kind of shower I had been able to provide myself during the last month at sea was the occasional unexpected wave that crashed over me, increasing the sodium level on my skin. There was not a drop of fresh water on board to spare for the luxury of a wash. Even though I sprinkled myself liberally with talcum powder, my skin pinched up from the salt and my bottom was covered with sores from sitting on damp cushions for so many weeks. The cold, salt-encrusted lining of the foul-weather gear rubbed against my naked skin like broken glass, and I had to step into it at least ten times a day.",
