In the glare of the peculiarly searching light theatres turn on to their departing and arriving patrons he was struck by the fatigue on her face. The music was too much for her–she looked worn out.",

My cousin had been bitten all over (if by mosquitoes, then malaria might easily find us less than half-way through the forest). I had a rash over my back and arms like the rash of chicken-pox. I didn’t feel so well: perhaps I had drunk too much whisky. There did seem to be an air of sickness about the prospect; Amedoo’s lung and Van Gogh’s fever contributed to it. After dinner I went out to the last pail-closet I should see before Monrovia; the wooden seat, of course, was swarming with ants, but I realized by this time that it was luxury to have a closet at all. We had discovered we hadn’t enough lamps with us. The boys needed both lamps while they were washing up the dinner things, which meant that we must sit in the waning light of our two electric torches. The mosquito-netting over the windows and door was broken, and anything came in, large horse-flies, cockroaches, beetles, cockchafers, and moths. Now and then to save light we sat in darkness. It was a grim evening and our nerves were rather strained. Big spiders dashed up and down the wall, the filter in the corner slowly and regularly dripped, a tom-tom was beating somewhere some message, probably about the President’s coming, and a big black moth the size of a bat flapped against the walls. The only thing to do was to go to bed early and sleep well.",

John Burroughs, the official chronicler of the trip, was feeling a bit out of sorts. At sixty-two, he was accustomed to life at his “hermit’s retreat” in the Catskill Mountains. This was his first trip not just to Alaska but west of the Mississippi. Burroughs was not a great traveler, prone to seasickness and melancholy. He is a likely suspect as the anonymous perpetrator who nicknamed the ship the George W. Roller at the first sign of turbulence. Muir, whose cabin was nearby, was only a year younger but retained his boyish enthusiasm for adventure. The two men were perhaps America’s leading nature essayists and knew each other well. They were sometimes paired together as “the two Johnnies,” and in one photograph from the trip, their matching long beards give the impression of Father Time looking into a mirror. The two also shared an appetite for teasing with some bite. Muir once reacted to a letter from Burroughs explaining that current circumstances would not allow him to join a voyage to Europe by telling another friend that “the ‘circumstances’ are his wife.” In the Harriman Expedition’s official history, Burroughs noted, “In John Muir we had an authority on glaciers, and a thorough one?so thorough that he would not allow the rest of the party to have an opinion on the subject.”",

It was a first-floor walkup in a six-story 1930s art deco apartment building on the corner of Fifteenth and Sixth, across the street from a small park dedicated to the memory of John Lennon, the Beatle whose image once had been prohibited by the revolutionary government. A statue of Lennon by Arturo’s friend José Villa Soberón sat on a park bench, where it was photographed by tourists. The life-size bronze wore a pair of Lennon’s classic round wire-rim eyeglasses that were stolen several times. The government then stationed a security guard to watch the statue all day, holding on to the glasses. When a tourist was ready to snap a photograph, he’d put them back on Lennon’s nose.",

She seemed intent on toppling the tree onto the fence. So with composure regained, and with thoughts about not wanting to have to pay to have the fence repaired, I walked to within two meters of her, waved my hands and firmly shouted, “Don’t do that.”",

But then a man grabbed her legs from behind, and as he attempted to pull himself onto the cooler, she panicked. María Victoria lunged for the edge of the cooler, hoping to keep from being yanked off, but her rough movement caused the whole box to tip over. People who’d been holding on lost their grip and tumbled on top of her. Arms and hands clawed and tugged, and in the confusion, in the desperate attempt to survive the unthinkable in the lightless open sea, in that night that had started so innocently before veering off into tragedy, María Victoria felt her only son slip silently off her back.",

Hewet was staring at the roof with his legs stuck out in front of him, for as he had never tried to make the service fit any feeling or idea of his, he was able to enjoy the beauty of the language without hindrance. His mind was occupied first with accidental things, such as the women’s hair in front of him, the light on the faces, then with the words which seemed to him magnificent, and then more vaguely with the characters of the other worshippers. But when he suddenly perceived Rachel, all these thoughts were driven out of his head, and he thought only of her. The psalms, the prayers, the Litany, and the sermon were all reduced to one chanting sound which paused, and then renewed itself, a little higher or a little lower. He stared alternately at Rachel and at the ceiling, but his expression was now produced not by what he saw but by something in his mind.

But I arrived in Cambridge feeling fresh and untaxed and entitled to nothing. Worse still, presuming that the walk would be more challenging than it was and that I might arrive late, I had booked a room in the University Arms Hotel in the expectation that it would have the requisite blazing fire, the hearty viands, and something of the air of a senior common room. In fact, as I discovered to my quiet dismay, it was an overpriced modern block and my gloomy room was lamentably at odds with its description in my guidebook.",

Any other man would go back to his business, or whatever he wanted to go back to and perhaps called business, and no female relation would dare try to stop him. This was the punishment for years of softness, of giving in, of shirking the moment which most growing-up children must reach, when they either have to beat off their relations or be smothered. So much worse, so much more painful all round, to beat people off when they were comfortably settled into thinking they had got hold of you for ever. Worse for them, and worse for you too, thought James anxiously, for you were so far more aware of the hurt you are going to inflict, and you knew what you didn’t know in your early youth, that patience and lovingkindness are of greater value, in the long run, than a freedom that is got only by smashing one’s way out.",

In some stalls of the bazaar goods from down-country – films, biscuits, toothpaste and the like – are on sale, but they all look excessively fly-blown and cost the earth because of air-freight charges. The townspeople strike me as a surly lot – not impolite or in any way unpleasant, but lacking the frank friendliness which so impressed me in Afghanistan and Pakistan proper. In fact, from the human society point of view it’s rather like being back in Persia, except that these people are more uncouth than the Persians – and by uncouth I don’t mean spitting on the street or squatting in public, but something deeper inside that governs a man’s attitude to others. The actual town has nothing to distinguish it and but for its surroundings would be slightly depressing. Now (10 p.m.) I’m going to bed early in preparation for tomorrow’s trek up the valley.",

This strip of coarse brown sand, between a bank of loose stones and the water’s edge, in no way resembles Cuban beaches as depicted on postcards. To the east, a high, steep, wooded promontory concealed three small all-inconclusive tourist hotels; to the west a short chain of mangrove cays extended from the shore. As we undressed beneath a grotesquely gnarled tree bearing strange fruits, two kind young men left their chess game in the park to warn us against swimming near the cays, an area of powerful undercurrents.",

At that price breakfast should be included, but I quickly move off that moot point after calculating one night’s stay would chew up my budget for the week. After slogging up the monumental hill out of Tobermory, the road turns right past the Isle of Mull Cheese shop. From here, the road to Glengorm is not a luxury road. I ride by a massive sewage treatment plant which must enchant the hotel guests. Most small communities have septic holding tanks. The puzzle as to where these are emptied has now been solved. Glengorm Castle is slightly above sea level. Yet the road to Glengorm is mostly uphill. I do not understand it. (I understand it even less when the road back is mostly uphill as well). Further along is a communications complex with towers poking out everywhere. Scenic it is not.",

Instead, he sat in the aisle, on the top of the stairs, just below my feet. The driver cursed Burly Man and Burly Man cursed the driver and several other passengers cursed everyone.

The Koolau Gap may be faithfully reproduced, just as it impinged on the retina of the camera, yet in the resulting picture the gigantic scale of things would be missing. Those walls that seem several hundred feet in height are almost as many thousand; that entering wedge of cloud is a mile and a half wide in the gap itself, while beyond the gap it is a veritable ocean; and that foreground of cinder-cone and volcanic ash, mushy and colourless in appearance, is in truth gorgeous-hued in brick- red, terra-cotta rose, yellow ochre, and purplish black. Also, words are a vain thing and drive to despair. To say that a crater- wall is two thousand feet high is to say just precisely that it is two thousand feet high; but there is a vast deal more to that crater-wall than a mere statistic. The sun is ninety-three millions of miles distant, but to mortal conception the adjoining county is farther away. This frailty of the human brain is hard on the sun. It is likewise hard on the House of the Sun. Haleakala has a message of beauty and wonder for the human soul that cannot be delivered by proxy. Kolikoli is six hours from Kahului; Kahului is a night's run from Honolulu; Honolulu is six days from San Francisco; and there you are.",

So now he discovered what a lot of people have: how difficult it is to find one; how you lived in the duplex for ten years before you discovered that the late-sleeping ladies next door were not night-shift telephone girls. At last that occurred to him which the veriest yokel seems to inherit with breath: he asked a taxi-driver and was presently set down before a house a good deal like the one he lived in and pressed a button which made no audible response though presently a curtain over the narrow window beside the door fell a second before he could have sworn someone had looked out at him. Then the door opened, a negro maid conducted him down a dim hallway and into a room containing a bare veneered dining-table bearing an imitation cut-glass punch bowl and scarred by the white rings from damp glass-bottoms, a pianola slotted for coins, and twelve chairs ranged along the four walls in orderly sequence like tombstones in a military graveyard, where the maid left him to sit and look at a lithograph of the Saint Bernard dog saving the child from the snow and another of President Roosevelt, until there entered a double-chinned woman of no especial age more than forty, with blondined hair and a lilac satin gown not quite clean. “Good evening,” she said. “Stranger in town?”",

Somewhere among them was the hidden city of Long Tien, the US/Hmong army headquarters, founded in 1962 by the CIA and soon the second biggest city in Laos, with 20,000 inhabitants – yet never marked on any map and only referred to by its code name ‘Alternate’. Its amenities included all-weather airfields, the most modern communications equipment and a US-style hospital. Nearby was a resettlement area run by USAID for hill tribes (60 per cent Hmong) who had fled from the bombing. By mid-1971 USAID reckoned they were looking after 150,000 displaced people, incorrectly referred to by them as ‘refugees’. These unfortunates were running away from the USAF but American propaganda used their migration south to ‘prove’ that the Communists were ‘hated and feared’. Their concentration in area one also had another use, as Professor Alfred McCoy explains:",
