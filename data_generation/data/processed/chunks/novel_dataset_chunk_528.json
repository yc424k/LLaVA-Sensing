It was Denham who, having parted from Sandys at the bottom of his staircase, was now walking to the Tube at Charing Cross, deep in the thoughts which his talk with Sandys had suggested. He had forgotten the meeting at Mary Datchet’s rooms, he had forgotten Rodney, and metaphors and Elizabethan drama, and could have sworn that he had forgotten Katharine Hilbery too, although that was more disputable. His mind was scaling the highest pinnacles of its alps, where there was only starlight and the untrodden snow. He cast strange eyes upon Rodney, as they encountered each other beneath a lamp-post.",

For as the Colony threw over its imperial ties, it was coming more than ever to resemble a sweet-and-sour version of the capital of the modern world. Like New York, in its way, the orphan city was full of the street-smart bravado of a strutting young man in a hurry, a rags-to-riches Seventh Avenue shark who takes the world on, but only on his own terms. Like New York, “Chinatown East” valued volume and velocity; people moved quickly through the streets, and with purpose, pushing for space, shoving, struggling to get a step ahead. Like New Yorkers, Hong Kongers seemed to pride themselves on their rudeness, their impatience with the slow or sentimental (“Am I being courteous?” said the badge worn with black irony by the conductor on the Peak train who barked out orders and trampled on children as he kept the turnstiles spinning). Like New York, above all, Hong Kong seemed to prize energy before imagination and movement more than thought. The place had a one-track mind—and it was decidedly the fast track. Hard-driving and fast-talking, it ran on hard cash and quick wit, hard heads and quick kills. In Hong Kong, even Maxim’s was a fast-food joint.",

Through and beyond father she saw doors flying open, walls falling flat, and herself running unhindered down the steps, along Gower Street, away through London, across suburbs, out, out into great sunlit spaces where the wind, fresh and scented, rushed to meet her, and the birds, and the stars, and those glorious vague beings in the Bible called sons of the morning, sang together for joy. Father, provided for; she, with a clear conscience, free; the twelve years during which youth had been ebbing away, the years shut up in the back diningroom at a typewriter, with no hope that anything would ever be different and no thought of anything but sticking to her promise and taking care of the helpless, gifted man, finished and done with—what did they matter now? Not a jot, thought Jen, her wide-open eyes shining with the reflection of what she saw through and beyond father. She could feel the wind—she could feel it, the scented fresh wind, blowing up her hair as she ran and ran …",

The pine-look desk in front of me was replete with Pret-a-Manger sandwiches and burgundy Costa Coffee take-out cups. A colleague in modern 'Telco-casual' office attire of jeans and an open necked blue shirt, was taking us through a Powerpoint slide deck on budget gap closure, conflicting KPI's and customer-led sales incentives. Around half the twelve people in the room were surreptitiously flicking their phone screens, as if checking for an important email, but were more likely on Twitter or Facebook. As was often the case, my mind was seven thousand miles away. This time I was back on the dusty, rutted roads of Malawi. Reliving the tense moments when we were surrounded by a large herd of skittish elephants. Revisiting my decision to drive forward, rather than reverse when faced with the charging female. Pondering on what would have happened had we chosen to risk crossing the riverbed with the rogue bull elephant. The behaviour of the animals still puzzled and troubled me. I picked up my phone and googled 'Elephant attack Majete.'",

Rebecca and I set out to find Peter’s priest, leaving Emma and Matt melting by the overheated Ambassador. Emma’s stricken with shock and Matt stands beside her, his face set in a grimace; infuriated by the bedlam, he curses “Jesus Christ” as we abandon them.

The remaining brush of scraggly hair, the watery eyes, the ancient teeth, seemed oddly out of tone with the gayety of the costume. Mr. Button, however, was obdurate—he held out his hand. \"Come along!\" he said sternly.",

The questions that nature triggers are persistent and subtle, and they arise in any place: when does the sun rise? When does it set? Which birds come in spring, and leave in fall? How much does it rain in July? November? Which plants are edible? Is it cold for this time of year? Will a tomato grow in the windowsill? Is the pond frozen enough to cross, or should we walk around? Through questions and tasks and endless figuring, authenticity sneaks up on you, and perhaps by unnoticed accrual is the only way it can, because authenticity comes not from trying, but from being. Witness my first months of trailwork: I longed to be a “real traildog,” but mostly, I felt like a poser. Once I had become a real traildog, I didn’t think about it anymore.",

One spot in particular I remember, where we started a stone the size of a horse. It began the descent easy enough, rolling over, wobbling, and threatening to stop; but in a few minutes it was soaring through the air two hundred feet at a jump. It grew rapidly smaller until it struck a slight slope of volcanic sand, over which it darted like a startled jackrabbit, kicking up behind it a tiny trail of yellow dust. Stone and dust diminished in size, until some of the party said the stone had stopped. That was because they could not see it any longer. It had vanished into the distance beyond their ken. Others saw it rolling farther on—I know I did; and it is my firm conviction that that stone is still rolling.",

Mr. Spencer Rollitt's nephew, Harry Craven, had been there, and the two Acroyd girls from Renton Lodge, and Norman Waugh.\nHarry Craven's fawn face with pointed chin; dust-white face with black accents. Small fawn's mouth lifting upwards. Narrow nostrils slanting upwards. Two lobes of white forehead. Half-moons of parted, brushed-back hair.\nHe smiled: a blunt V opening suddenly on white teeth, black eyes fluttering. He laughed: all his features made sudden, upward movements like raised wings.\nThe Acroyds. Plump girls with pink, blown cheeks and sulky mouths. You thought of sullen, milk-fed babies, of trumpeting cherubs disgusted with their trumpets. They were showing their racquets to Harry Craven, bending their heads. You could see the backs of their privet-white necks, fat, with no groove in the nape, where their hair curled in springy wires, Minna's dark, Sophy's golden. They turned their backs when you spoke and pretended not to hear you.\nShe thought she would like Maurice to know that Harry Craven and she had beaten Minna Ackroyd and Norman Waugh. A love set.\nAfterwards—Harry Craven playing hide-and-seek in the dark. The tennis net, coiled like a grey snake on the black lawn. \"Let's hide together.\" Harry Craven, hiding, crouching beside you under the currant bushes. The scramble together up the water-butt and along the scullery roof. The last rush across the lawn.\n\"I say, you run like the wind.\"\nHe took your hand. You ran faster and faster. You stood together, under the ash tree, panting, and laughing, safe. He still held your hand.\nFunny that you should remember it when you hadn't noticed it at the time.\nHands were funny things. His hand had felt like Mark's hand, or Roddy's.\nYou didn't think of it as belonging to him. It made you want to have Mark\nand Roddy back again. To play with them.",

    "target_paragraph": "ONOMICHI IS FROM THE SEA a very Chinese-looking city, the houses emptying directly onto the water. The view is one of backdoors, windows, garbage cans, blinds, shutters, steps, ladders. This waterfront looks like a long line of untidy people all facing in the other direction, all with things hanging from their back pockets.\nJust behind this façade, this row of rears like a flat of scenery, is a fishing-village-like street: ropes, old women with cloths on their heads, old men carrying fish, children holding cats, small stores selling crackers and fishing line, men with caps and bicycles making bargains with sandaled men in loincloths.\nAnd directly beyond this is the front of the city proper, the main street. Very citified this, with stone building and automobiles and banks and women in clean print dresses and parasols. There is a kind of arcade that stretches the length and beyond it, as the city rises to the mountains, to the nicer section: coffee shops, department stores with mannequins in Tokyo poses, little boutiques, jewelry stores. Beyond the main street is the railway line, the station, the mountains. One layer is laid over the other like scenery in a toy theater. It is a very narrow city.\nAnd a very long one. Since there is no space between shore and mountains the city has stretched along the shore. It winds like a snake in its narrow nest. Always lengthening, always growing, it seems five miles long now and is still extending itself.\nThis kind of city is exhausting. Shimabara in Kyushu, though pretty enough, will kill you if you try to walk the length of its main street. After miles and miles, there is still no end to it. The main street is the town; there are no side streets.\nOnomichi has the bus station at one end and the boat station at the other. Hence perhaps all the bicycles. No one would walk this length. It is wide enough to have side streets, however—and to hide its extensive night-town.\nThe places where you have fun after dark in Japan are always hidden. The unknowing foreigner walks along Tokyo’s Ginza or along Kawaramachi in Kyoto, lonely, little knowing that just a few blocks over are lanes of bars and blocks of cabarets. Even in the smallest hot-spring towns the main street is primly closed by ten. One would think everyone asleep. In back of the main street, however, are the liquor, the gambling, the girls.\nOnomichi’s night-town is not hidden too well. Corners of it spill out in broad daylight. This is because the area is so large—the biggest I have ever seen for a town this size.\nOne of the reasons is that Onomichi is the main port for the middle reaches of the Inland Sea. Another has to do with its history. The place was traditionally the home of pirates. Here they had their fortress and made their homes. The location was right. Directly in the middle of this inland sea, the harbor sheltered by big Mukaijima just across the strait, the water lying like a narrow river between. The place was also equipped with escape routes so that beleaguered pirates could run off in either direction. Here also complacent pirates could keep homes and through their numerous lookouts remain appraised of what was coming. There were also caves in which to keep the looted treasure.\nThe caves were where the night-town now is. This is fitting because I would guess that this warren of bars, cabarets, Turkish baths, pinball parlors, and, probably, whorehouses surely holds more money than the winding caverns of the pirates could have ever contained.",

Yes, English nature is too green, and that green too monotonous in shade and outline; it is (‘entre nous’) a salad landscape; you may find pretty vignettes of the sugar-water type, but London alone is picturesque in the large sense of the word–London and Newcastle-on-Tyne.",

Sometimes he and Helen would sleep the night in the copse at the end of their garden, lying on their backs at roosting hour and watching the patterns made overhead by the birds in flight. At first Thomas tried to help Helen remember the names of the constellations, but she had no desire to learn them, content for the night sky to remain an effect of pure design. When good weather came they would leave the children with a neighbour, put down their work, take their sticks from beside the back door and head off on foot into the countryside. Sometimes they would walk over to Gilbert White’s parish of Selborne; sometimes they caught the train to Canterbury and walked the Pilgrim’s Way back to Winchester. Once they went to Wiltshire for a fortnight and saw the White Horse at Uffington. Helen thrilled to the atavism of what she called ‘the ancient ways’, the sense of being connected by footfall to ‘history and tradition’. Thomas taught her how to walk differently: ‘with [her] body, not only with [her] legs’, feeling the landscape as she moved over it.",

I removed my boots and shirt and followed slowly, testing the river-bed with my stick. Then we wandered down the gorge for an hour and a half and never have I walked on a more exhausting surface: either round loose stones – very large – or deep soft sand. But that was a low price to pay for the austere magnificence all around us. On our right rose 2,500 foot cliffs of bare rock and vividly red earth. On our left were those brown, scrub-covered mountains, too close for their summits to be visible. And ahead was space – an infinity of blue sky. (The rain clouds were behind us, and dispersing.)",

However, my reversal speed would obviously be slower, and it was unlikely I'd be able to maintain the 20mph needed to outrun a charging tusker for long enough to escape. I had to make a split-second decision, and gambled on being able to accelerate forward quickly enough to evade being rammed from the side. I put my foot down and we hurtled forward, bouncing out of ruts in the road surface which slowed us initially and made it appear that the elephant was going to win this dangerous race. With a final stab of the accelerator, and with the rear end of the vehicle fish-tailing in the dust, we sped forward to pass around ten feet ahead of the tusks of the enraged, trumpeting animal. I glanced in the rear-view mirror and saw that she hadn't given up. We bounced along the road with the elephant in hot pursuit for around two hundred yards, until she disappeared into the red dust cloud churned up by our wheels.",

    "target_paragraph": "The Cairngorms are a landscape on which both history and snow – perhaps the two substances my grandfather loved most – lay thickly. Climatically speaking, the Cairngorms are Britain’s Arctic. In winter, storm winds of up to 170 miles per hour rasp the upper shires of the range, and avalanches scour its lee slopes. My grandparents saw the tremble of the aurora borealis from the north windows of their house: billowing curtains of green or, more rarely, red light. In places on the summit plateaux of the massif, the wind blows so hard and insistently that vegetation exists in bonsai form: pine trees grow to just a few inches high; there are dwarf willows; and a miniature creeping azalea called Loiseleuria procumbens – which became one of my grandfather’s favourite alpine plants – forms mats barely an inch high among the pebbles, keeping its head down, staying prostrate (procumbens). The massif is a terrain shaped by what Nan Shepherd once called ‘the elementals’. Mountain landscapes appear chaotic in their jumbledness, but they are in fact ultra-logical landscapes, organized by the climatic extremes and severe expressions of gravity: so hyper-ordered as to seem chance-made.",

The nature-worshipping eurythmics in a barn and the country-dances in which the Major led both staff and children, were a shade bewildering at first, because everybody was naked.

Today he runs a model farm—a four-acre outburst of verdant plenty in the midst of a dry, bare valley. He grows peas, tomatoes, bananas, pineapples, passion fruit, mangos and much else. Only sweet potatoes have been a failure: some livestock broke through a fence and gobbled them up.",

Then Farfrae tried to get hold of the other side of Henchard’s collar, which was resisted by the larger man exerting all his force in a wrenching movement, and this part of the struggle ended by his forcing Farfrae down on his knees by sheer pressure of one of his muscular arms.

Zinnie appeared to be sharply and completely-American—as American as Beechy and Bun were Italian, and much more so than the three elder Wheaters, who were all so rubbed down by cosmopolitan contacts. The “steps,” in fact, had the definiteness of what the botanists call species, whereas Judith, Blanca and Terry were like exquisite garden hybrids. The harder Boyne stared into the problem the more obscure it became.",

Meanwhile an almost full moon – fitfully bright between speeding shreds of cloud – was giving that secluded, overgrown corner the atmosphere of a sacred grove. Patiently Costin built a little grass wind-shield – then stood with folded hands and bowed head, gazing down at the wavering flames. By this reverent act of ancestor-worship – not allowing death to loosen the bonds of gratitude and affection – he was conferring on his grandfather the only sort of immortality in which I can believe.",

We walk through countless rooms; on many wood-beamed ceilings frescoes are being restored to their original splendor; acres of parquet floors are being mopped (no harm is done to their soft waxy luster, the patina of years). I see a bicycle made of ash, modeled after a Leonardo design; and (lust rises in my acquisitive heart) seashells collected over the centuries by the Borromeos, each unique, each with its own magnificent geometry, each with its own history. Paul Valéry said: “A shell stands out from the usual disorder that characterizes most perceptible things. [It is a] privileged form that [is] more intelligible for the eye even though more mysterious for the mind than all the others we see indistinctly.” I want to fondle seashells, not to play with disordered ideas.",

    "target_paragraph": "To use the pelelintangan, the two character descriptions must be combined with the bintang to form the final judgement of the personal characteristics of a person born on that day. Some days will have the same pair of character descriptions, but they will differ in bintang. For example, bintang Lembu, the bull, which falls on Coma Wage, and bintang Kuda, the horse, which falls on Anggara Umanis, both have Laku Api and Wisesa Segara as their character descriptions. Both tend to get angry and have terrible tempers — dictated by their \"as fire\" and \"powerful sea\" personality characteristics. But the bintang Lembu makes for a person who, though he or she angers quickly, also cools down quickly. And the inherent calmness of bintang Kuda attenuates these fiery personality characteristics — once angry, however, the bintang Kuda is difficult to calm.",
