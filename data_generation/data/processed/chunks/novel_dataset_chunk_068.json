    "target_paragraph": "Suddenly a motor stood there: Vance remembered piling into it with Upton, Bunty Hayes, and some other fellows; they sat on each other’s laps and on the hood. A girl who laughed very much and had blown-back hair, dyed red, was at the wheel. Where were they going? Who was she? Vance didn’t care. As the motor began to move the wind stirred in his own hair, driving it back like the girl’s, and life flowed through him again. He began to laugh, and tried to light a cigarette, but couldn’t, because there wasn’t enough elbow-room for a sardine. The others laughed at his ineffectual attempt, and another girl, perched somewhere behind him, lit a cigarette and leaned forward to push it between his lips. They were going to the Crans’, and he found out, he didn’t know how, that these two were the Cran girls--Cuty with the dyed hair at the wheel, and the younger, ‘Smeralda they called her, sitting behind him on the hood between two fellows, so that his head rested against her knees, and he felt, through his hair, the warm flesh where her scant skirt had slipped up. Once or twice, after they had left the state highway, the overloaded motor nearly stuck in the deep ruts of the country road, and everybody laughed and cheered and gave college yells till Cuty somehow got them going again. Ah, how good the cool drinks were when they got to the Crans’! It was at the back of the house, he remembered, under an arbour of scarlet runners that looked out on a long narrow yard where clothes were drying. Some of the clothes were funny little garments with lace edgings and holes for ribbon, and there was a good deal of joking about that, and he remembered Cuty Cran crying out: “No, it ain’t! No, I don’t! Mine are crepp-de-sheen. . . . Well, you come upstairs and see, then. . . .” But Cuty was not the one he fancied; and anyhow, since Floss he’d never . . . and he had young Upton to look after. . . .",

Small, colorful fishing boats line the coastline. Narrow alleys off the single, cobbled street lead up and down stone staircases to the old houses and the sea. A few antique, noble residences mix with the simpler structures, many transformed into restaurants and lodgings. Wandering in the lovely quarter, I have seen weathered fishermen working on their nets, an elderly woman hanging out strips of orange peel to dry, and even someone throwing trash into the sea from an upper window.",

He liberally smeared caulking around all the stanchions and possible leakage points on deck, while I cleaned up after him and raced around on a moped, buying charts, supplies, parts and provisions.

The river was banked against flooding and all of it was wooded, so branches dappled the path and the river’s edge with shadows all the way. Thistledown fluff from the willow-herb span across the water and diving frogs marked almost every step. Reeds and tall clumps of bullrushes sheltered families of moorhens, and purple dragonflies hovered and settled among the yellow flags. When I sat down for a smoke, an abrupt movement gave away an otter; he looked about, then ran along the root of a willow and slipped in with a plop which stirred the backwater with spreading rings. There was plenty of food for him: fish gleamed in the clear water and, a little further upstream, two boys were busy with long reeds and cork floats. Their catch was strung through the gills inside a hollow tree and we had scarcely exchanged greetings when there was a silver flash and another was whisked leaping out of the current. When I said ‘Eljen!’ – Bravo! I hoped – they offered to give it to me but I felt shy about turning up at my next halt like Tobias. Cattle gathered under the branches and waded knee-deep while flocks, filling every inch of shade in the fields, hid from the noonday as still as fossils.",

As his motorcade proceeded toward the Mall, Lindbergh waved occasionally but mostly stared opaquely at the crowds. Many of those lining the sidewalks wept as he passed?“they knew not just why,” reported the writer and explorer Fitzhugh Green (who was also editor of Lindbergh’s 1927 book, We). At the Washington Monument, a sea of heads covered the entire visible landscape and young boys filled the nearby trees like Christmas ornaments. At the foot of the monument stood a canopied platform on which President Coolidge and all the members of the cabinet but one were gathered. The lone missing figure was Herbert Hoover. He was stuck in Gulfport, Mississippi, still dealing with the Mississippi flood, which was as bad as ever but almost completely forgotten now by those who weren’t directly affected by it. Even Hoover’s tireless PR operatives couldn’t keep it on the front pages with Lindbergh in the country.",

He was a wild youth, famed for once smashing all the windows in the headquarters on a drunken spree. One day, Sawada was invited to the residence of Naohi, the old Mother Goddess of Oomoto, and as he sat there talking, he had a cigarette. When he was finished, he looked around for an ashtray and found none. Luckily, nearby was a floor hearth, just like the ones he had grown up with in his village, so he stubbed his cigarette out in it. ‘Don’t you realize that is a tea-ceremony hearth?’ scolded one of the other guests. Sawada was so ashamed of his ignorance that he decided to learn tea ceremony just to get the better of the man who had scolded him. Today, he is one of the famed tea masters of the Kyoto area.",

Leading off it to the south-east was a steep little ice couloir, only twenty or thirty feet long, curved up at either edge, and sheeny with clear ice. It led down to a saddle and a small lower top. I sat down and heeled my way to the rim of the couloir, then luged down it, using my feet as brakes, striking ice chips with them, and feeling the cold black air crack against my face as I slid, so that it seemed as though I were passing through shattering plates of ice, until I slowed to a halt. Then I cleared some space among the rocks of the outcrop, pitched my bivouac, and tried to sleep.",

There was a look in Dicky's face she did not care for. But Rickman—as Maddox had testified—was a perfect little gentleman when he was drunk, and at the sight of Pilkington, chivalry, immortal chivalry, leapt in his heart.\nHe became suddenly grave, steady and coherent.\n\"I was just going, Miss Grace. But—if you want me to stay a little longer, I'll stay.\"\n\"You'd better go,\" said Miss Grace.\nHer eyes followed him sullenly as he went; so did Pilkington's.\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I suppose that's what you wanted?\"\n\"Yes, but there's no good overdoing the thing, you know. This,\" said Pilkington, \"is a damned sight too expensive game for him to play.\"\n\"He's all right. It wasn't his fault. I let him drink too much champagne.\"\n\"What did you do that for? Couldn't you see he'd had enough already?\"\n\"How was I to know? He's nicer when he's drunk than other people are when they're sober.\"\nHe looked at her critically. \"I know all about him. What I'd like to know is what you see in him.\"\nPoppy returned his look with interest. Coarseness in Dicky Pilkington's eyes sat brilliant and unashamed.\n\"Would you? So would I. P'raps it's wot I don't see in him.\"\nNow subtlety was the last thing Dicky expected from Poppy, and it aroused suspicion.\nWhatever Poppy's instructions were she had evidently exceeded them. Poppy read his thoughts with accuracy.\n\"I only did what you told me. If you don't like it, you can finish the job yourself. I'm tired,\" said Poppy, wearily coiling up her hair.\nShe was no longer in spirits.",

The guilt Abhayraj carries for his father’s flogging of Kanakchand, not public school material in the final analysis, is only the guilt of turning a high-spirited boy into a revolutionary. And all the cruelty of India is magicked away in textbook Western phrases which are as empty as that quivering: the narrator sees his father denying ‘basic rights’ to ‘the people’, he talks of the ‘collective wish of the people’. Nowhere do I see the India I know: those poor fields, those three-legged dogs, those sweating red-coated railway porters carrying heavy tin trunks on their heads. ‘The mountains were rainwashed, the sky was a bright blue and the air was stiff with the scent of pine and flowers and charged with an almost electric silence broken by the sharp warnings of the rickshaw pullers.’ It is so the rickshaw puller appears, beast of burden more degrading than degraded: unseen, the source only of a holiday sound, part of the atmosphere of a Simla romance. This is the Indian withdrawal and denial; this is part of the confusion of Indian Anglo-India.",

The star-patterns, the grandiose slosh of the Milky Way. Jupiter, blazing low to the east, so brightly that it laid a lustrous track across the water, inviting us to step out onto its swaying surface. The moon, low, a waxing half, richly coloured – a red-butter moon, setting down its own path on the water. The sea was full of luminescent plankton, so behind us purled our wake, a phosphorescent line of green and yellow bees, as if the hull were setting a hive aswarm beneath us. We were at the convergence of many paths of light, which flexed and moved with us as we headed north.",

Third, Glenn liked my drop-knee cutback. It was a cold-water maneuver, practically unknown in Hawaii, and if I had been systematically shedding my mainland style it would have been one of the first moves to go. But I was apparently still doing it, and my idol, Glenn, actually saw some grace, or at least some novelty, in it. That settled it—the drop-knee stayed.",

A founding member of the nonaligned movement, it was also the first to quit, charging that the body was no longer innocent of politics.

Another fifty feet on, where the water rose over our waists, the waves were breaking.

That was disquieting, for we had already marched for more than two hours, but nothing would induce me to stay. It wasn’t only the unfriendly chief and the bugs in the hut; I was still planning my journey by European time: the listlessness, the laissez-faire of Africa hadn’t caught me. I had planned to reach Duogobmai that night and to fail to reach it seemed to put back everything. I wasn’t confident enough to see the journey as more than a smash-and-grab raid into the primitive…. There was a dream of a witch I used to have almost every night when I was small. I would be walking along a dark passage to the nursery door. Just before the door there was a linen-cupboard and there the witch waited, like the devil in Kpangblamai, feminine, inhuman. In the nursery was safety, but I couldn’t pass. I would fling myself face downwards on the ground and the witch would jump. At last, after many years, I evaded her, running blindly by into sanctuary, and I never had the dream again. Now I seemed to be back in the dark passage: I had to see the witch, but I wasn’t prepared for a long or careful examination.",

As he stood there other perfumes stole to him: the purple burden of lilacs, the warm drip of white laburnums, and that haunting syringa smell which was like the noise of bees on a thundery day. On the fluctuations of the breeze they came now from one corner, now another, of the deserted shrubberies, waylaying Vance with their loveliness.

I loaded my sleeping gear, little green bookbag and logbook and greeted my co-driver. Coach had a bald pate with a gray rim of hair around his head, revealing the maturity of his years. I could tell he stood shorter than me when he walked by on the way to his own car. Oddly enough, most male truck drivers I met were shorter. At 5’10” in sneakers I stand at about the average height of an American man. So about half the guys I meet are shorter anyway. But about three out of four guy truckers stood 5’9” or less. I mused about Napoleon complexes and the size of semis, while setting my things in the top bunk. I drove out and Coach sat up with me to see how his rookie co-driver handled the truck. While we talked I soon discovered that Coach approached life from a completely different perspective than Buster. Clearly an intelligent man with a quick wit, I found Coach to be a well-adjusted dude – no complexes.",

And the Vesuvia was making a test run.",

Young Dalyrimple had very keen gray eyes, a mind that delighted the army psychological examiners, a trick of having read it—whatever it was—some time before, and a cool hand in a hot situation. But these things did not save him a final, unresigned sigh when he realized that he had to go to work—right away.",

I walked up and down the street half a dozen times before I found the modest entrance to the building, tucked away between a restaurant and a boutique. The door was locked ? it was dusty and looked as if it hadn’t been opened for weeks, perhaps years ? and no one answered the bell, though according to the tourist brochure it should have been open. It struck me as odd that nowhere in the town had I encountered any indication that Einstein had ever lived there: no statue in a park or square, no street named in his honour, not even his kindly face on postcards. There wasn’t so much as a plaque on the wall to tell the world that in one year, 1905, while working as an obscure clerk in the Swiss patent office and living above this door, Einstein produced four papers that changed for ever the face of physics ? on the theory of Brownian motion, on the theory of relativity, on the photon theory of light and on the establishment of the mass-energy equivalence. I have no idea what any of that means, of course ? my grasp of science is such that I don’t actually understand why electricity doesn’t leak out of sockets ? but I would have liked to see where he lived.",

She led us first to the Monastery of Saint George. “It’s a convent now,” she said. Teresa wanted to peek inside, but a custodian waved us away. Teresa didn’t mind. “This way,” she said. A paved path led us around the ancient district, just inside the enclosure walls. We next found a beautiful cemetery, which I wrongly assumed were Coptic. Teresa, guidebook in hand, said that it was Greek Orthodox. Flowering trees and perfectly coiffed shrubbery decorated the trail between the graves. A garden for the living who walk among the dead, I mused. I counted dozens of altar tombs and mausolea. Most were adorned with elaborate engravings, and many were topped with crosses, statues, planters, obelisks, and framed photos of the dearly departed.",

Mazhar does not doubt that this method of arranging marriages is best and the behaviour of young Western couples revolts him. In the tones of one who has witnessed some peculiarly depraved orgy, he described a boy and girl he had seen walking on the street in Pindi with their arms around each other’s shoulders. ‘This is all right behind curtains,’ he said, ‘but in public it offends every Muslim. It is a sight that makes us sick with disgust. How can civilised people behave like this when children and young people can see them? We do not understand.’ Poor lad!

This is a large airy house, simple and tasteful, with pretty engravings and water-colour drawings on the walls. There is a large bath-house in the garden, into which a pure, cool stream has been led, and the gurgle and music of many such streams fill the sweet, soft air. There is a saying among sailors, \"Follow a Pacific shower, and it leads you to Hilo.\" Indeed there is a rainfall of from thirteen to sixteen feet annually. These deep verandahs are very pleasant, for they render window-blinds unnecessary; so there is nothing of that dark stuffiness which makes indoor life a trial in the closed, shadeless Australian houses.",

Bryan paused as he shut the door, and said, with studied casualness, “Let’s call it an era.” Ten miles down the road, the Falcon’s temperature gauge swung back to Hot.

Afterwards he took me in his car to the centre of town, to a small hotel that may once have been grand but was now full of bare light bulbs and run by a man in an undershirt. The man led me on a long trek up flights of stairs and down hallways before abandoning me at a large bare-floored room that contained within its shadowy vastness a chair with a thin towel on its back, a chipped sink, an absurdly grand armoire and an enormous oak bed that had the warp and whiff of 150 years of urgent sex ground into it.",
