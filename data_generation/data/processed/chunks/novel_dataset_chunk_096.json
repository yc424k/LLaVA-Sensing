Bayard shut the door behind him, upon the bright cold, and warmth and rich, stale rankness enveloped him like a drug. A woman bent over the hearth replied to his greeting diffidently. Three pickaninnies became utterly still in a corner and watched him with rolling eyes. One of them was a girl, in greasy, nondescript garments, her wool twisted into tight knots of soiled wisps of colored cloth. The second one might have been either or anything. The third one was practically helpless in a garment made from a man’s suit of wool underclothes. It was too small to walk and it crawled about the floor in a sort of intense purposelessness, a glazed path running from either nostril to its chin, as though snails had crawled there.",

Acosta, according to nearly all accounts, had broken his collarbone, though he later said he didn’t feel any pain at the time. The others entirely escaped injury. They straggled ashore and almost immediately encountered a youth on a bicycle on the coast road, but he fled at the sight of four strange men entering France from the sea. Dripping and cold, they went from house to house but could not make anyone understand who they were. Noville, still unable to hear, unnerved villagers by shouting at them in poor French. At length they came to a lighthouse on a hilltop about half a mile inland from the beach. Marianne Lescop, daughter of the lighthouse keeper, recalled later that the family had already been woken once by the droning of the plane?an unusual sound in Ver-sur-Mer?and had looked out the windows but seen nothing in the dark. “About three o’clock,” she went on, “we were woken again by hammering on the door. Father saw four figures down below. One of them shouted, in French, ‘Airmen America!’ Four exhausted men came in. They’d knocked in vain at many other doors. They were queerly dressed, soaking wet, ragged, covered in mud. We were rather suspicious.”",

John Burroughs observed how the scenery grew more extreme as they advanced up the coast. Devil’s Thumb, a dramatic spike of dark granite that rises like a mile-high smokestack, stood in the distance behind Patterson Glacier, the first serious ice seen from the Elder. Muir, eager as always to assert his knowledge of glaciology, shared the story of his twenty-mile hike to find its source. When Burroughs became overwhelmed by “the vast panorama of the encircling mountains,” he lowered his eyes to water level, where the views were more in tune with his pastoral sensibilities. A row of seven eagles, “like Indian chiefs,” regarded the Elder with indifference, he wrote. “Many whales are seen blowing, their glistening backs emerging from the water, turning slowly like the periphery of a huge wheel.”",

An excellent suggestion, Gennarino.”\nEven as a small Italian town would be incomplete without its piazza where streets converge and commercial pulses beat their liveliest measure, so every larger one contrives to possess a public garden for the evening disport of its citizens; night-life being the true life of the south. Charming they are, most of them; none more delectable than that of old Messina—a spacious pleasaunce, decked out with trim palms and flower-beds and labyrinthine walks freshly watered, and cooled, that evening, by stealthy breezes from the sea. The grounds were festively illuminated, and as I sat down near the bandstand and watched the folk meandering to and fro, I calculated that no fewer than thirty thousand persons were abroad, taking their pleasure under the trees, in the bland air of evening. An orderly, well-dressed crowd. We may smile when they tell us that these people will stint themselves of the necessities of life in order to wear fine clothes, but the effect, for an outsider, is all that it should be. For the rest, the very urchins, gambolling about, had an air of happy prosperity, different from the squalor of the north with its pinched white faces, its over-breeding and under-feeding.\nAnd how well the sensuous Italian strains accord with such an hour and scene! They were playing, if I remember rightly, the ever-popular Aida; other items followed later—more ambitious ones; a Hungarian rhapsody, Berlioz, a selection from Wagner.",

    "target_paragraph": "Following the success of the Beemster scheme, investors looked for money-making opportunities elsewhere. These included draining large areas of land in Amsterdam, where concentric circular canals were dug and ringed with tall townhouses, creating another tourist attraction and a perennial hazard for cyclists wobbling home after too many Heinekens. Narrow streets radiated outwards from the central Dam Square like the spokes of a bicycle wheel, crossing the canals via dozens of picturesque bridges. A sequence of locks enabled the entire network of canals to be flushed regularly with water from the Amstel, keeping the canals relatively clean. Because the reclaimed land was so soft, new buildings often had to be built on top of long wooden pilings. Amsterdam’s Central Station, for example, was built atop nearly 9000 poles, propping it up above soggy soil that was previously open water. Having paid for such elaborate foundations, developers had a strong incentive to increase their profits by adding extra floors to the buildings, much to the annoyance of later generations forced to struggle up ladder-like staircases with heavy bags of shopping. Such projects even helped shape the country’s political system, with the need to coordinate the construction and maintenance of flood defences creating the famous ‘polder model’ of government, which depended on intense negotiation between numerous political parties. In the Netherlands coalition governments were the norm, as were mutually agreed policies that (critics said) left no one completely happy.",

    "target_paragraph": "Beyond Lundy Foot’s from the shaded door of Kavanagh’s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson’s all times ticking watches and Henry and James’s wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt, smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Hesseltine and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C., From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Farnell looked intently. In Fownes’s street, Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal’s first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy’s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C, agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby’s corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E. L. Y.’S., while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott’s music warerooms Mr Denis J. Maginni professor of dancing &c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost’s wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My girl’s a Yorkshire girl.\nBlazes Boylan presented to the leaders’ skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the cortège:\nBut though she’s a factory lass\nAnd wears no fancy clothes.\nBaraabum.\nYet I’ve a sort of a\nYorkshire relish for\nMy little Yorkshire rose.\nBaraabum.",

The short May night was illuminated by destroyed planes burning fitfully among the olive-trees and during these hours of respite, I couldn’t stop thinking of this strange coincidence. Chaos broke out again at dawn; and, all through the mortal blind-man’s-buff of the next eight days, I thanked my stars that we were loose, as it were, in different parts of the wood, for battles had degenerated during the last eighty-seven years. No chance now, like Cardigan and Radziwill recognizing each other from London ballrooms, of exchanging brief and ceremonious greetings through the smoke of the Russian guns. Again and again, in those whistling and echoing ravines, where a new and unknown smell was beginning to usurp the scents of spring, my thoughts flew back to the winter of 1934 and the tunes and jokes and guessing games, the candlelight and the scent of burning pine-cones when nothing was flying through the air more solid than snowflakes.",

The elements metamorphosed into one another, disregarding their natural states and interactions, and complicating the human relationship with matter. The hierarchy of the elements was reordered – the hot sun had no purchase on the ice, which remained defiantly solid before it. ‘Up there’, the transparent wind became visible: once filled with ice crystals or snow flakes, its billows and contours were given dramatic visual expression. The air, too, was clearer, and thinner; and the blue of the sky an entirely different hue and texture, more like tinted porcelain, from the overcast serge of a lowland sky. And ‘up there’ waterfalls could flow upwards, in disobedience of gravity.",

It was the sulkiest hour of the day. Mr. Heard noticed a slender young Indian and a blond-haired fellow—probably a Scandinavian. They were arguing about cigars with a rosy-cheeked old reprobate whom they called Charlie. An adjoining apartment, the card-room, contained a livelier party, among whom the bishop recognized Mr. Muhlen. He had lost no time in making himself popular. He must have found congenial spirits here.",

    "target_paragraph": "WE SURFED. The swell was remarkably consistent for the first week or so. The brilliance of the wave seemed only to increase. It was ridable at all tides. It never seemed to blow out. There was a little reverse current running out to sea from the bottom of the bay that helped keep the surface groomed in all conditions. Paddling out was absurdly easy. You walked to the point, beyond the wave, slipped through a keyhole in the reef, and arrived in the lineup with hair dry. Except for being a world-class right, it was the categorical opposite of Kirra. There was no demonic current to fight. If every surfer within five hundred miles had been out at the same time, there would still have been no crowd. And where Kirra’s essential quality was breathtaking compression, the wave on Nias felt like pure expansion. It invited you to move farther up, get in earlier, take a higher line, pull in deeper. The takeoff was steep but straightforward. You just had to get over the ledge and be on the wave when it jacked. There was no time to carve big turns on the main wall. It was a run-and-gun wave, with a glorious tube if you took a high line and timed it well on a wave that opened up. It wasn’t a top-to-bottom barrel—it was what is known as an almond-shaped barrel—although it broke hard enough to snap boards. The wave wasn’t extremely long, like Tavarua, but neither was it dangerously shallow. And the wave on Nias had an extraordinary grace note. The last ten yards of the main wall, just before it hit deep water, stood up extra-tall. The face there was, for no obvious reason, often several feet taller than the rest of the wave. This great green slope, particularly the top third of it, begged for a high-speed flourish, a maneuver to remember, a demonstration of both gratitude and mastery.",

I feel like a land-ship and make myself sail-like big while the wind blows at my back. The other reason a headwind is soul destroying is the relentless howling of wind in your ears. There is some primal trigger that activates fear and stress. The converse is that when the wind is blowing from behind, it is silent and peaceful. The sun comes out in a few places and plays over the water in the lochs. I stop at a cemetery to see who is there. The stones are very interesting in that 90% of the inhabitants are over eighty years old. I’d heard the people of Mull were long-lived which this cemetery confirms. I navigate the stretch of “potential ferry traffic death road” at a time when the ferry has not landed or imminently leaving. The one lane road is empty. The wind behind starts pushing me so fast that I have to use the brakes. The bike performs flawlessly, thank you Oban Cycle (I am willing to overlook the 120dB squealing sound because at least the brakes now work). The ride is a great success.",

It had two bookstores, a picture gallery, a gift shop, a movie-house. People on the sidewalk smiled at me as I passed. This was beginning to worry me. Nobody, even in America, is that friendly. What did they want from me? Up at the far end of the street there was a BP service station, the first one I had seen in America. Feeling vaguely homesick for Blighty, I walked up to have a look at it and was disappointed to see that there wasn’t anything particularly British about it. The guy behind the counter wasn’t even wearing a turban. When he saw me looking in the window he smiled at me with the same strange, unsettling smile. Suddenly I realized what it was – it was the look of someone from outer space, that odd, curiously malevolent B-movie smile of a race of interplanetary creatures who have taken over a small town in the middle of nowhere as their first step towards becoming . . . Earth Masters. I know this sounds improbable, but crazier things have happened – look who was in the White House, for Christ’s sake. As I strolled back to the motel, I gave everyone I passed that same eerie smile, thinking I ought to keep on their good side, just in case. ‘And you never know,’ I remarked to myself in a low voice, ‘if they do take over the planet, there might be some openings for a guy of your talents.’",

The charge for a single room in the main building is 42/–, and I’m paying 18/– for a cell (in the annexe) which is furnished only with twin beds and has a low tin roof, mud walls, a stone floor and a tiny unglazed window – anywhere else in this country a similar room would cost 3/–. However, the profits are spent on the drought victims of Lasta and during recent years the regional ills would have been even worse but for the Seven Olives Hotel.",

It was a clear summer day, with big clouds in the sky and a cool wind blowing. The view from the top of the hill was spacious, and unbroken pineland reached away for miles, streaked with dark lines of cedars. “I hope I don’t start to cry,” Smith said. “This is a planner’s dream. From this elevation, we could move right out onto the central-business-district platform—two hundred and forty acres of stores and plazas and high buildings in the middle of the city, for pedestrians only. The parkway goes under the platform, and there is parking space down there for twenty thousand cars. Battery-operated taxis and battery-operated scooters are permitted on the platform. The sidewalks move, too. Even outside the platform, underpasses and bridges make it possible for you to walk from any part of the city to any other part without crossing a street. This area of the pinelands simply begins to jump out at you if you’re going to go for urbanization. It’s magnificent. It’s just magnificent. I can see those goldarn structures now, surrounded with green.”",

He went straight to work, fighting Indians in Panama, and quickly won renown as a ruthless warrior: the go-to guy for brutal raids against natives.

Keen to take part, we scooped up our robes and raced over, as entry was forbidden even five seconds into the meditation hour. Stragglers were running across the bridge to the pyramid, designed deliberately across a stretch of water to remind people to leave their minds on one side before going in. Just as we reached the door, Perm stepped out from the shadows and, like a Power Ranger, crossed both arms in the air to show that we were no longer allowed in. Spotting another door at the end of the corridor, Ed ran down, wrenched it open and, before she had time to react, we slipped inside.",

Her regiment was passing my house, at the non-U end of the bazaar, when she noticed me sitting on my doorstep doing nothing – a satisfying occupation now known to too few Europeans. At once she stopped to stare, as though I were a singularly repellent phenomenon on par with regional odours; then she called after a friend – ‘Betty, look! Do you suppose she lives there?’ And ever since I have been consumed by a desire to know the content of Betty’s inaudible reply.",
