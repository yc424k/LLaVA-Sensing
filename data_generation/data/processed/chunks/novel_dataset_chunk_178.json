Silent adults motor to and from work at regular hours; one never sees or hears neighbours chatting or children playing. During weekends the unnatural silence – unnatural where so many dwell together – is occasionally broken by the excruciating scream of gadgets used to manicure miniature lawns. When I go shopping on foot – the characterless commercial centre is a mile or so away – I meet only a few black servants who, if greeted, go into shock. Here whites don’t walk – and carrying heavy bags too! – nor, it seems, do they acknowledge the presence of blacks. In these suburbs, as in the dorps’ residential areas, apartheid still hangs in the air like a poisonous cloud left over from chemical warfare.",

Resistant to the summer heat, the citruses are protected from the strait’s strong winds by banks of coastal pines, the same trees that provide Calabrian beachgoers cool shade for their August picnics. Blossoms appear in April and the fruit is harvested between November and March. The bergamot is round, slightly larger than an orange and not as yellow as a lemon. The skin is thin and has a delicate fragrance while the interior is quite bitter; thus, the bergamot’s principal use has been through its essential oil, which is obtained by pressing the skin. 90% of the bergamot oil on the world market comes from the province of Reggio Calabria, and France is its biggest importer.",

Decoud and Nostromo heard the loud churning of her propeller diminish and die out; and then, with no useless words, busied themselves in making for the Isabels. The last shower had brought with it a gentle but steady breeze. The danger was not over yet, and there was no time for talk. The lighter was leaking like a sieve. They splashed in the water at every step. The Capataz put into Decoud’s hands the handle of the pump which was fitted at the side aft, and at once, without question or remark, Decoud began to pump in utter forgetfulness of every desire but that of keeping the treasure afloat. Nostromo hoisted the sail, flew back to the tiller, pulled at the sheet like mad. The short flare of a match (they had been kept dry in a tight tin box, though the man himself was completely wet), disclosed to the toiling Decoud the eagerness of his face, bent low over the box of the compass, and the attentive stare of his eyes. He knew now where he was, and he hoped to run the sinking lighter ashore in the shallow cove where the high, cliff-like end of the Great Isabel is divided in two equal parts by a deep and overgrown ravine.",

Pastoral scenes unfolded in light-hearted colours across ceilings that were enclosed in a studiously asymmetrical icing of scrolls and sheaves; shells and garlands and foliage and ribands depicted myths extravagant enough to stop an unprepared observer dead in his tracks. The sensation of wintry but glowing interior space, the airiness of the snowy convolutions, the twirl of the metal foliage and the gilt of the arabesques were all made more buoyant still by reflections from the real snow that lay untrodden outside; it came glancing up through the panes, diffusing a still and muted luminosity: a northern variant (I thought years later) of the reflected flicker that canals, during Venetian siestas, send up across the cloud-born apotheoses and rapes that cover the ceilings. Only statues and skeleton trees broke the outdoor whiteness, and a colony of rooks.",

His son – the same height as Rachel – was equally likable though less cool in a crisis. And Juana made sure that this was a crisis. Antonio and son didn’t use the Chavín device of tying legs to tail and my function was to hold the head-collar and administer comfort and admonition, as appropriate. Unfortunately neither had any effect. Juana tolerated the removal of the old shoes with only a few token kicks. But when knives and nails came into the picture she grew more and more resentful, rearing up and pawing the air every other moment – which caused the crowd and the smiths to scatter rapidly, leaving me as heroine, centre-stage. Rachel hugely enjoyed the whole circus, squealing with laugher every time Juana stood on her hind-legs. A fascinated crowd had followed us from the Plaza and was now augmented by – apparently – all the residents of the nearby street, some of whom brought placatory Alf offerings (purloined no doubt from their cuys) which Juana rudely spurned. When Antonio decided to bandage her eyes and ears I assured him that this would only aggravate her ill-temper, and it did. She raged around in circles, almost jerking my arms from their sockets, until the bandages were removed. I then insisted on hobbling and tail-tying and at last progress was made – though slowly and hazardously, with many sudden lunges despite the inhibiting ropes. When we left Talavera at noon I knew how people felt after a day on the rack.",

Bryan and I had grown up in a Southern California where most beach towns, and beach cops, loathed and harassed surfers. My high school would have expelled us before they supported us.

To each of the two chief openings on opposite sides a winding road ascended, and the level green space of twenty or thirty acres enclosed by the bank was the site of the fair. A few permanent erections dotted the spot, but the majority of the visitors patronized canvas alone for resting and feeding under during the day of their sojourn here.",

Bill told us how Gabriel walked into Pat O’Brien’s bar in 1938 and, without being hired, began to wait on tables. Soon he was onstage, tapping his aluminum tray with coins, thimbles, and lively fingers, entertaining audiences for the next sixty-seven years.\n\nEldridge Gabriel died in 2006. I was among the last to see him onstage.",

I had often walked that way on Sundays, and knew that the solitary roof showing through bare branches near the bottom of the hill was that of Frome’s saw-mill. It looked exanimate enough, with its idle wheel looming above the black stream dashed with yellow-white spume, and its cluster of sheds sagging under their white load. Frome did not even turn his head as we drove by, and still in silence we began to mount the next slope. About a mile farther, on a road I had never travelled, we came to an orchard of starved apple-trees writhing over a hillside among outcroppings of slate that nuzzled up through the snow like animals pushing out their noses to breathe. Beyond the orchard lay a field or two, their boundaries lost under drifts; and above the fields, huddled against the white immensities of land and sky, one of those lonely New England farm-houses that make the landscape lonelier.",

Not long afterwards, St Augustine, sitting in Hippo in North Africa, records that he was profoundly moved by a story he heard that two secret policemen from Trier (now part of Germany), having read The Life of St Antony, decided to leave their comfortable posts to become monks in Egypt. A century later monasticism was flourishing all over the West, and had become especially popular in Italy and southern France. By 700 it had reached even the Highlands of Scotland: around that time an image of St Antony under a palm tree was sculpted by Pictish monks on the windswept promontory of Nigg near Inverness, hundreds of miles beyond the Roman Empire’s northernmost border.",

Slides from the past couple of winters at Ocean Beach were being shown, and most of the surfers featured were on hand. “That can’t be you, Edwin. You hide under the bed when it gets that big!” Mark convened these gatherings quasi-annually. “This was the best day last winter,” he said, projecting a shot of huge, immaculate Sloat that elicited a deep general groan. “But I don’t have any more pictures of it. I paddled out after taking this one, and stayed out all day.” Mark’s voice had the nasal, waterlogged quality it got after a long session. In fact, he’d come in from the surf—its steady thunder from across the Great Highway was supplying a bass line for the entertainment—only an hour before. “The moon rose just as it got really dark,” he’d told me. “I went back to Sloat. All those kooks were gone. It was just Peewee and me. It was great.” I found this scene hard to picture. It wasn’t that I didn’t believe him—his hair was still wet. I just couldn’t imagine how anyone could surf by moonlight in waves as big as those that were pounding Sloat at dusk. “Sure,” Mark said. “Peewee and I do it once every winter.”",

Bejeweled matrons led their pedigreed dogs past Charles Jourdan and Guy La Roche, and private-school kids shuffled home in blue blazers and tartan skirts. Riding-school girls with Benetton bags buzzed up to ninth-floor gold-paneled apartments, and eight-year-old boys strode along with rolled-up umbrellas—all of them graced with the thoroughbred, golden-skinned confidence of future dance-school graduates. The nearest disco was called Snob, and a shop down the street was Connoisseur Snob. Buenos Aires, in fact, was the first place I’d ever visited where I always felt underdressed: when I went to a tearoom, my first afternoon in town, at three o’clock on a weekday, every single male in the place—but me—was wearing a tie. Only a few years before, men had been arrested for wearing shorts in the street.",

Lately Nona had been struck by his ruddiness, and the vigour of the dark waves crisping about his yellow-brown temples; but now he had turned sallow and autumnal. “What people call looking one’s age, I suppose—as if we didn’t have a dozen or a hundred ages, all of us!”",

There would have been no justice for her—not from that quarter. He would probably have forbidden the child to be moved out of his jurisdiction, pending the progress of a trial which might never end. Nor could the English Court, with its obsolete provisions on this head, have regarded Muhlen otherwise than as her legal husband—the child of her later union as illegitimate. Bastardy: a taint for life! How well she had done to put herself beyond a rancorous letter of the law; to protect her child and family according to the immutable instincts of mankind!",
