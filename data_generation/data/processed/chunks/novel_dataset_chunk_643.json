While Rachel went to visit Farida, her local ‘best friend’ – a ten-year-old Gilgiti girl, daughter of Baltistan’s Chief Engineer – I returned to the bazaar and bought a five-pound tin of Belgian ghee for Rs.32 (the same amount of Pakistani-made ghee costs Rs.65), and a large handleless tin frying pan, which was sold by weight and cost Rs.4.75. When Sadiq saw this he said ‘NBG’ – or words to that effect in Balti – and produced from Hallam’s stable a heavy iron griddle coated with horse-droppings. I managed to remove most of the manure and then put it over the heat, whereupon the residual dung gave off a pungent odour which Rachel likened to incense. I thought the simile far-fetched, and not flattering to incense, but I forbore from arguing the point.",

I was going through the Park last Sunday, and close by the Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people listening to some vulgar street-preacher. As I passed by, I heard the man yelling out that question to his audience. It struck me as being rather dramatic. London is very rich in curious effects of that kind. A wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill, hysterical lips – it was really very good in its way, quite a suggestion. I thought of telling the prophet that Art had a soul, but that man had not. I am afraid, however, he would not have understood me.’",

The bed was a lavish, canopied affair with crimson hangings; the floor was covered with a thick crimson carpet, completely noiseless to the tread; there was a sensually fat sofa and several fat chairs covered with fat, red plush and painted with gilt, a great gilt-rimmed mirror above the mantel, a wash-bowl of deep and heavy porcelain with glittering nickel fixtures, a lavish bidet, the inevitable provision of a French woman’s needs, and curtains of a fat, silk, quilted material whose sensual folds were now closely drawn together, completing the effect of bordello secrecy and luxury previously described.",

And those babies had other babies; and the other babies had – adenoids. The word recurred; but it now suggested nothing. He was sinking; he was falling under their weight; the name in his pocket even was fading. Could nothing be done about it? he asked himself. Nothing short of revolution, he thought. The idea of dynamite, exploding dumps of heavy earth, shooting earth up in a tree-shaped cloud, came to his mind, from the War. But that’s all poppycock, he thought; war’s poppycock, poppycock. Sara’s word ‘poppycock’ returned. So what remains? Peggy caught his eye, where she stood talking to an unknown man. You doctors, he thought, you scientists, why don’t you drop a little crystal into a tumbler, something starred and sharp, and make them swallow it? Common sense; reason; starred and sharp. But would they swallow it? He looked at Hugh. He had a way of blowing his cheeks in and out, as he said tut-tut-tut and chew-chew-chew. Would you swallow it? he said silently to Hugh.",

Sometimes she took up one of the books and read a page or two, letting the beat of the verse lull her throbbing brain, or the strong words of stoic wisdom sink into her heart. And even when there was no time for these brief flights from reality, it soothed her to feel herself in the presence of great thoughts—to know that in this room, among these books, another restless baffled mind had sought escape from the \"dusty answer\" of life. Her hours there made her think less bitterly of Amherst—but also, alas, made her see more clearly the irreconcilable difference between the two natures she had striven to reunite. That which was the essence of life to one was a meaningless shadow to the other; and the gulf between them was too wide for the imagination of either to bridge.",

She was good at clothes; I remember her dress as one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. It was the classical Chinese model, never bettered anywhere, of black velvet. The little buttons that close these gowns from collar to knee are usually made of silk braid; hers were button-size diamonds. She said she had ruby and emerald buttons too. Sapphires were out because they didn’t really show. I can’t have been suffering too much or I would remember more.",

(I had given up purifying my intake and after four months of drinking whatever came my way, with no ill-effects, I wonder if the contamination of Africa’s water supplies, about which we hear so much, is not perhaps exaggerated?)

There were both Alices, several Coloured Fairy Books, Struwwelpeter in the original, which I’d never seen, and the illustrated couplets of Wilhelm Busch: Max und Moritz, Hans Huckebein and so on. There was plenty of French: Becassine, I remember, and the innumerable volumes of the Bibliothèque Rose. All these books were inscribed in childish writing with the names ‘Minka’ and ‘Alix’, and here and there the same hands had brushed in the outlines of the black-and-white illustrations with bold swirls of water-colour. They were my host’s two beautiful daughters, both by his first marriage, and already familiar from the photographs on his desk in the library. I was only to discover years later and long after the War, when we met in France and became friends, that I had an odd link with these girls – the addiction, that is, to saying things backwards. This habit is first engendered, I suspect, by the sight of the words rumpled across the bathroom floor when learning to read, and then by deciphering and while gazing out of the windows of restaurants and cafés. At first single words are formed, then whole sentences and, by the time they are spoken fast enough to sound like an unknown language, this useless accomplishment has become an obsession. When I had run out of material for recitation on the march I would often find myself, almost without knowing it, reciting, say, the ‘Ode to a Nightingale’ in this perverse way:",

    "target_paragraph": "At noon today there was a marathon row in the street below my window. It began when one young woman accused another of having an affair with her husband – accompanying the accusation with a blow across the face. Then, within moments, an excited crowd of about a hundred and fifty mysteriously assembled, and I was looking down on a sea of bobbing black umbrellas, beneath which men and women were furiously arguing and gesticulating, each trying to shout or scream more harshly than the rest. Personally I should have thought this an exclusively family matter – but possibly these hundred and fifty protagonists did all belong to the three families involved. The argument continued for some forty minutes, and then the husband vigorously whacked both women on the back with his rolled umbrella and told them (if one may judge by his tone and expression) to go to the Hindu equivalent of Hell – or, perhaps, to become worms in their next incarnation. In Nepal a man is not expected to pretend to be faithful to his wife (though she is required to be very discreet about her own infidelities), so this should have concluded the argument. But instead of accepting their chastisement with womanly humility these two shrews promptly declared a truce and united to attack the husband with their hastily rolled umbrellas – at which point they were seized by several men, on whom they lavished kicks and scratches before being partially subdued and frogmarched away out of sight. Now I noticed that the original dispute had sparked off a variety of subsidiary quarrels among the crowd, all of whom were enjoying themselves enormously. Clearly this sort of ding-dong battle is the Nepalese peasant’s favourite recreation, and one can’t help wondering if the apparent lack of civilisation revealed by such scenes is not in some respects healthier than our repressive over-civilisation, in which sedatives and tranquillisers are necessary to so many.",

There will be also the warm coarse limy smell of chickens, the strong coddy smell of cold fish and oysters; and the crisp moist cleanliness of the garden smells – of great lettuces, cabbages, new potatoes, with their delicate skins loamy with sweet earth, the wonderful sweet crispness of crated celery; and then the melons – the ripe golden melons bedded in fragrant straw – and all the warm infusions of the tropics: the bananas, the pineapples and the alligator pears.",

Slowly I walked uphill, with broken glass underfoot, passing smelly piles of household refuse. Around the first corner – a hairpin bend – half-a-dozen men were animatedly discussing an aged car missing one wheel. My arrival silenced them; their expressions showed more hostility than curiosity. Then a middle-aged woman appeared in her doorway and sharply questioned me. I apologised for speaking only English and hastily displayed my passport to avoid being mistaken for a compatriot of Tony Blair. Interestingly, that lessened the tension, though not enough for me to be welcomed. The woman retreated, slamming her door. The men turned back to the moribund car. As I walked on five small boys gathered at a corner, the sort who might be expected to beg from a tourist. Instead, as I drew near they took refuge amidst mounds of rubble.",

London’s odor, too, was mixed of many things and yet was definite. The first and all-prevailing odor was a smell of fog, touched numbly with the faintly acrid smell of soft-coal smoke. Infused in this a malty reek of bitter beer, the faint nostalgia of tea, the faintly sweet aroma of an English cigarette, and all this mixed with morning, fumed with the smoked, slightly acid pungency of grilled sausages, bacon, and a kipper, and filtered through the old-gold bronze of a befogged yet not entirely conquered sun—and you had something like the smell of London.",

    "target_paragraph": "Because Australia is so vast and arid and difficult a landscape to study, and because the modest population base produces comparatively few scientists for the amount of ground to be covered, and because, above all, the animals within it are so often small, furtive, nocturnal, and sometimes mysterious, even now nobody really knows quite what is out there. Any list of Australian wildlife is arrestingly punctuated with qualified comments like “possibly extinct” or “thought to be endangered” or “may survive in some remote areas.” The difficulties are well illustrated, I think, by the uncertain fate of the oolacunta, or desert rat kangaroo. Nearly everything that is known about this interesting creature is owed to two men. The first was a nineteenth-century naturalist named John Gould, who studied and described the animal in 1843. It had, according to Gould, the shape and manner of a kangaroo but was only about the size of a rabbit. What particularly distinguished it was that it could move at very high speeds for unusually long distances. Since that one initial report, however, the oolacunta had not been seen. Enter Hedley Herbert Finlayson.",

Everything was gone: everything was wasted from him: the face was drawn tight and bony as a beak, the skin was clean, tinged with a fatal cancerous yellow, and almost delicately transparent. The great thin blade of nose cut down across the face with knife-like sharpness and in the bony, slanting, almost reptilian cage-formation of the skull, the smallish cold-grey-green eyes were set wearily, with a wretched and enfeebled dullness, out across the great space of the city which swept away and melted at length into the sun-hazed vistas of October.",

These matters, along with the beauty of the faҫade, survive quite well in the lee of the monument—a confectioner’s typewriter, some call it; and down in back there was always the Forum, a quarry and cow pasture, lazily creating its own derangement of the senses.",

I can see the citizens of Esztergom aligning candles on their window-sills – wicks which, added to the tapers in the hands of a myriad watching peasants, were to surround the procession, later on, with a twinkling forest; and, peering up at the Basilica, I can float inside and along the vistas of acanthus-leaves and through the darkening criss-cross of mezzotint shading into the vast sacristy where the tiers of presses and the rows of treasure-chests have disgorged their silk and their brocade, all unfolded now, and their sacred instruments and their vessels. Mitres are clicked open, copes spread, the jewelled gloves and the pallium laid ready, candelabra and monstrances and crosiers set forth. In the Pannini-like emptiness under the dome, pale armfuls of new and unlit candles are pricked in tall palisades across the gloom. An unrolling carpet ascends the shallow steps under the Archbishop’s canopy and the bell-ringers in their loft are getting thirsty.",

    "target_paragraph": "We arose before dawn and tried to find a truck to take us on from Khotan to Keriya, the next oasis. Of ten trucks in the han courtyard, four were broken down and five were returning to Kashgar. That left only one to choose from. Its driving cabin was full and we had to sit on an enormous mound of coal slag in the back. We climbed up, at once regretting the decision to wear our brand new white kurta tops from Lahore. But such concerns were soon dwarfed by much greater worries. Accompanied by loud judderings and crunching of gears, the lorry crawled out of the han and made its way up the middle of the main street of Khotan. Lou and I, exposed to the world on top of our coal tip, kept our heads down to try and avoid unwanted police attention. We need not have bothered. The truck trundled up the principal thoroughfare, turned left and headed straight for the police station. We parked directly outside the main entrance. The driver waved at us and went in to fetch a permit. We scrabbled around in the coal trying to dig ourselves into foxholes, covering our heads with jerseys in an effort to pass off as sleeping peasants, well aware that our clothes and rucksacks must have screamed out to every passing Public Security officer. Yet no policeman emerged from the Public Security Bureau and after a few minutes the driver returned proudly bearing the new permit in his hand. He got back into the cab and turned the ignition. The truck coughed, coughed again and died. We held our breath while the driver tried a third time. Nothing happened. Into our foxholes we dived, pulling our jerseys back over our heads. For twenty minutes the driver and his friend hammered away at the engine, until eventually it spluttered grudgingly back to life. At half its previous speed the truck crawled out of the police station and headed at walking pace into the main street. We were overtaken by a man on a donkey. Then, suddenly, we were in the desert. On all sides the shale flats stretched off into infinity. It was difficult to believe that anything could move slower, yet we again managed to cut our speed by half when, soon after Khotan, the tarmac road gave out and was replaced by a gravel track, pockmarked with boulder-sized potholes. It took a great effort of imagination to believe that we were travelling along the fabled Silk Route, one of the most famous highways in the world. In Scotland I have travelled along many more imposing footpaths.",

They have a variety of cages – smaller enclosures for keeping babies, a medical area for sick animals, and enormous, expansive enclosures where the monkeys can run and climb freely. They’ve built a system of wire tunnels about ten feet off the ground that the monkeys use to travel around the entire property. These tunnels go over the walking trails, past the river, near most of the other animals’ cages, even through the humans’ living room in the main house. This allows the monkeys to get used to being near other creatures if they are comfortable doing so, and provides them the option to be near humans if they prefer (since many used to be pets). Whenever I enter the house, there is always one particular capuchin monkey sitting by the front door in one of the tunnels, reaching out his arm for a handshake, even though his tunnel extends all over the reserve. Lisette explains that he was a pet, kept in a small cage for a long time, and they doubt he’ll ever be released back into the wild.",

James and I were obliged to dance with everyone, and they even made us do the cueca, the national dance (now rather hackneyed), despite our total ignorance of its steps. The general idea was evidently to imitate a cockerel and wave a hanky. Much later, most of us adjourned to the community hall, where a six-piece band was playing an exuberant blend of rock and folk music and there was a bottle of pisco on each table. The only tense moment in an otherwise delightful evening came a couple of hours later when our waiter friend told James that he was a very bad dancer; but we got over that. Almost the whole village had turned out for this occasion, and they were still making the most of it when we crept off at four-thirty and knocked up the crusty proprietor of the Yasna, who emerged in his pyjamas to unlock the door, unmoved by our New Year’s greetings.",

Perhaps the Novosibirsk Mega-Ikea is bigger than most malls—with its hallways as wide as airplane runways, etc.—and its customers correspondingly smaller-seeming and more scattered. Perhaps the Mega-Ikea’s background Muzak is more bizarre—unthreatening American country songs, in a style that might be called shopping country. Considering that this is a mall in the Siberian taiga, I found “On the Banks of the Ohio” (sung in English) a confusing tune. The only part of the mall I really liked was right at the door, in the rush of heated air that pushed back against the exterior cold. Mixed with that air, a strong scent of Russian diesel blasted a muscular alternative to the retail atmosphere.",

The dream was becoming almost impossibly beautiful to us who for so long had seen naught but the restless, salty sea. Charmian reached out her hand and clung to me—for support against the ineffable beauty of it, thought I. But no. As I supported her I braced my legs, while the flowers and lawns reeled and swung around me. It was like an earthquake, only it quickly passed without doing any harm. It was fairly difficult to catch the land playing these tricks. As long as I kept my mind on it, nothing happened. But as soon as my attention was distracted, away it went, the whole panorama, swinging and heaving and tilting at all sorts of angles. Once, however, I turned my head suddenly and caught that stately line of royal palms swinging in a great arc across the sky. But it stopped, just as soon as I caught it, and became a placid dream again.",

When the Sherpas come, the surly guards root through everything, even the rolled tents, on the lookout for stolen religious objects, so they say: they would doubtless confiscate valuable objects from a Tibetan or a Bhote, whether or not the man was the rightful owner. Even a bystander dares to pick through my belongings, and I snatch something from his hand with an oath for all to hear; at this, Tukten shakes his head in warning. When the man rides off on a horse, Tukten explains that this nosy fellow is a police official. (This same official was to turn up again at the next check post, closer to Jumla, and intervene there on behalf of the Westerner who had been so rude to him at Muni, commanding his minions to let us through at once. It is hard to adjust to the intricate hostile deference of Hindus, so many of whom—even the children—seem to be frowning.)",

Outside the small cocoon of the colonial district, and at many points within it, Santo Domingo resembled capitals across the developing world: a desperate and chaotic mess. About a quarter of the D.R.’s nine million people crowded in and around the city, many of them occupying slums like those I’d passed while driving from the airport. Guards with shotguns stood before every bank. Anger over power blackouts and soaring prices periodically erupted in general strikes, street protests, and barricades of burning tires.",
