The tourists went away, hotels and houseboats closed, and in their dark, small-windowed rooms the Kashmiris wrapped themselves in blankets and idled over charcoal braziers until the spring. The spring brought sun and dust and fairs, colour and noise and exposed food. Nearly every fortnight there seemed to be a fair in some part of the Valley. Each was like the other. In each might be found the picture-seller, his stock spread out on the ground: thin wall-scrolls with violently coloured drawings of Indian and Arabian mosques, objects of desired pilgrimage, flattened out of perspective; photographs of film stars; coloured pictures of political leaders; innumerable paperbacked booklets. There were stalls of cheap toys and cheap clothes; there were tea-tents and sweet-trays. A Hindu holy man of terrifying aspect sat in the dust behind his small dry vials that contained charms of ‘eye of newt and tongue of dog’. And always there was amplified music. On the lake, too, the playground now not only of the tourists but also of the people of the town, there was music: from the doongas, smaller unpainted houseboats, hired complete with kitchen-women and pole-man. He walked slowly back and forth past the cabins, now carrying his pole, now leaning on it, separate from the revelry within but seemingly content; a woman, possibly his wife, bundled in dirty skirts and heavy with silver jewellery, sat solitary at the high stern, steering with a long paddle. It was movement for the sake of movement. The doongas went nowhere in particular and were never beyond shouting distance of gardens or houses; they called here, moored there for the night. A doonga party could last for days; people might get off at some point to attend to their affairs on land and might rejoin the boat later at another point. A dull, strenuous entertainment it seemed to me; but my winters were full. The fair in the grove at Ganderbal, a few miles to the northwest, climaxed the season. All the doongas and shikaras made their way there and moored for the night: movement for the sake of movement, crowd for the sake of crowd, noise for the sake of noise.",

Jeremiah. 12”’ I can’t say that I understood the meaning very well, unless it was a warning against Brighton races, but perhaps the ambiguity was the attraction.

In this immoral atmosphere the Assistant Commissioner, reflecting upon his enterprise, seemed to lose some more of his identity. He had a sense of loneliness, of evil freedom. It was rather pleasant. When, after paying for his short meal, he stood up and waited for his change, he saw himself in the sheet of glass, and was struck by his foreign appearance. He contemplated his own image with a melancholy and inquisitive gaze, then by sudden inspiration raised the collar of his jacket. This arrangement appeared to him commendable, and he completed it by giving an upward twist to the ends of his black moustache. He was satisfied by the subtle modification of his personal aspect caused by these small changes. “That’ll do very well,” he thought. “I’ll get a little wet, a little splashed—”",

Noticing a broken window in a separate, one-storey restaurant-cum-dance-hall I peered in and saw sheets of the hardboard ceiling hanging loose. At that stage a young woman appeared, stared at me incredulously, then ran away giggling. As I returned to the street a young man arrived. He conveyed that the hotel was booked out (all those teachers?), then pointed me towards an unmarked guesthouse not far from the bridge.",

In the National Museum of Fine Arts, the first floor is all Rodin, Monet, and Degas; the second floor, astonishingly, features some accomplished, but utterly uninflected, Argentine copies of Monet and Degas, right down to pictures of twilight haystacks in Provence. The Alvear Palace Hotel in Recoleta boasts the almost smothering glass-and-gilt opulence of a mock Versailles; yet Paul McCartney Muzak is piping through its corridors. Even the zoo here is rich with replicas of the Venus de Milo and with animal houses that are done up like pagodas, columned Egyptian pavilions, and Russian Orthodox churches; but its tattered empty cages are taken over now by stray cats. It is this kind of grandiloquence that moved V. S. Naipaul, for one, to rage against the assumed sophistications of the place—and, even more, its belief that money can buy sophistication. Its air of civility, he wrote, in his devastating, if entirely unfeeling, essay “The Return of Eva Perón,” was merely a cover for barbarism; Argentina was “a simple colonial society created in the most rapacious and decadent phase of imperialism.”",

Then I poked my head out of my aptly named flea-bag to see by firelight our host churning Tibetan tea in a hollowed-out tree-trunk. The Baltis add a little milk as well as rancid butter, salt and bicarbonate of soda, but the result is much the same. Although we had enough rice left over for breakfast, the old couple insisted on my sharing their tea and tsampa. For themselves they poured four cups of tea, two for mixing with their satu and two to be taken straight. As an Instant Food tsampa wins; apart from its convenience it is much more palatable and very much more sustaining than rice. The despised (by conservative foreigners) butter-tea is also sustaining on its own, and extraordinarily warming; it has an almost whiskey-like effect on one’s inside. But unfortunately Rachel’s adaptability breaks down when it comes to food. She is one of the conservative foreigners who won’t touch Tibetan tea or tsampa, bored as she is by the monotony of our diet.",

I am thinking of Stephanides, the wine-merchant’s son with his battered grin and pocket comb, of Kallias, of that fat ruffian Joanides, of Spiropoulos and Grikos and Aletraris … It cost me something to hold them in check. Yet they were an easygoing and polite lot of youths, no better and no worse than their counterparts in Europe, and all bedevilled by the national dream. Handsome Leonides, for example, who stayed behind one day and asked me whether I would assist him in writing to a pen-pal in Glasgow. Her letter and photograph were pro­duced after much blushing and scraping of the floor with his toe. It was an odd letter from a factory-hand who was dying to know about the world and thought that a pen-pal was the best way to find out. She asked Leonides whether everyone was black in Cyprus and wore nightshirts. These questions did not hurt so much as astonish him. ‘I thought such an advanced race as the English would know this sort of thing. If I, a Greek, know that they are white in England and only wear nightshirts in bed, how is it that she … ?’ I answered these questions as best I could, and drafted a reply or two for him, leaving one or two of his characteristic mistakes; but here again I noticed in his draft the word ‘dote’ which proved that he had somehow been in contact with the Girls’ Sixth. When I accused him of it he blushed and grinned. ‘It is Aphrodite,’ he admitted at last, over­coming a formidable resistance. ‘We ride home together on our bicycles. We are doted on each other, sir.’",

This domineering tumour on Cetatuia Hill can be seen from almost everywhere in Cluj and seems perfectly to symbolise forty-five years of Communist bullying. Hundreds of broken concrete steps ascend the steep slope – partially wooded, densely littered – and noisome fumes from the hotel garbage, slowly smouldering nearby, become increasingly apparent. Halfway up there is a visual assault, the sort of mindless, soulless ‘decoration’ (always concrete) for which I was fast developing a pathological hatred. Four Soviet coaches were parked outside the entrance. In one of them, Rumanian-made lavatory bowls occupied every seat – each labelled with its new owner’s name.",

Most of the houses are high above the track though one large group of dwellings stands beside it; many Balti settlements should really be described as scatterings of hamlets, rather than villages. Only one man was visible, driving two black dzo across the whiteness from the river, and when I called out to ask if there was a ‘chota hotel’ he came hurrying towards us. He was elderly and bare-footed, wearing a tattered shalwar-kameez under a once-fashionable scarlet lady’s coat. His big grin revealed crooked, broken teeth. In response to my question he indicated a small building standing on its own amidst apple-trees and I at first mistook this for a Rest House. Red-coat delightedly appropriated us, leading Hallam into the orchard, tethering him to a tree and helping me to unload. When he pointed to a half-open door I entered the building and recognised an abandoned school, put up before the keen young Pakistani government had learned that school-buildings solve nobody’s educational problems. If the doors and windows were ever glazed all the glass has long since been removed and the roof leaks so badly that one-third of the earth floor is at present under water. The Urdu alphabet is still faintly legible on a wall-blackboard – the only item of furniture.",

    "target_paragraph": "Our rooms were in a tower. From the windows one looked across the brown tiled roofs to where, on its hill, stood the cathedral. A hundred feet below was the street, a narrow canyon between high walls, perennially sunless; the voices of the passers-by came up, reverberating, as out of a chasm. Down there they walked always in shadow; but in our tower we were the last to lose the sunlight. On the hot days it was cooler, no doubt, down in the street; but we at least had the winds. The waves of the air broke against our tower and flowed past it on either side. And at evening, when only the belfries and the domes and the highest roofs were still flushed by the declining sun, our windows were level with the flight of the swifts and swallows. Sunset after sunset all through the long summer, they wheeled and darted round our tower. There was always a swarm of them intricately manoeuvring just outside the window. They swerved this way and that, they dipped and rose, they checked their headlong flight with a flutter of their long pointed wings and turned about within their own length. Compact, smooth and tapering, they seemed the incarnation of airy speed. And their thin, sharp, arrowy cry was speed made audible. I have sat at my window watching them tracing their intricate arabesques until I grew dizzy; till their shrill crying sounded as though from within my ears and their flying seemed a motion, incessant, swift and be-wilderingly multitudinous, behind my eyes. And all the while the sun declined, the shadows climbed higher up the houses and towers, and the light with which they were tipped became more rosy. And at last the shadow had climbed to the very top and the city lay in a grey and violet twilight beneath the pale sky.",

According to a British clergyman, writing in the July 1898 Calcutta Review, in the course of Sir Ashley’s 1863 visit, one Bhutanese “took a large piece of wet barley meal out of his tea-cup and, with a roar of laughter, rubbed the paste all about Mr. Eden’s face. He then pulled his hair, slapped him on the back, and indulged in several disagreeable practical jokes.”)",

But I couldn’t take any more shot-by-shot accounts of killing springbok. And the tedium of South African racism is getting to me. In Northern Ireland, and certain multiracial parts of Britain, the prejudices can be as extreme (among extremists!) but the monotony is less. Individuals make more of an effort to explain or excuse their prejudices and one can be surprised into thinking about a centuries-old bias or conflict from some new perspective. However, the South Africans’ mind-numbing uniformity of attitudes may prove healthy in the long term. Their prejudice often seems impersonal, something inherited, imposed, carefully fostered by the Unholy Trinity. When white supremacy collapses completely, all these programmed volk may be jolted into thinking for themselves. And then, just as plants have adapted to the Karoo, even the worst racists may mutate quite quickly if racism is seen to be hindering instead of promoting the well-being of individuals, families, businesses. Or is this my optimism running wild?",

The sun was shining, but not too hot, and it would probably have been an alright day for something like this, had my pack actually fit right. A few minutes down the trail the right strap began eating into my shoulder. Loosening this, the pack weight shifted left. Soon the left strap began troubling me. Loosening this as well, the pack began to hang backward. Now the strap that ran across my chest began cinching my shirt up, pressing its collar into my neck and choking me slightly. The dangling pack shifted back and forth, jerking me off balance.",

    "target_paragraph": "He was almost a mile from his horse. What with the vain quartering of the pasture, he had already walked twice that distance, and he was boiling with that helpless rage at abstract circumstance which feeds on its own impotence, has no object to retaliate upon; it seemed to him that once more he had been victim of a useless and elaborate practical joke at the hands of the prime maniacal Risibility, the sole purpose of which had been to leave him with a mile’s walk in darkness. But even if he could not actually punish, hurt, the idiot, at least he could put the fear, if not of God, at least of cow-stealing and certainly of Jack Houston, into him, so that in any event he, Houston, would not leave home each time from now on wondering whether or not the cow would be there when he returned. Yet, mounted at last and in motion again and the cool wind of motion drawing about him, he found that the grim icy rage had given way to an even more familiar sardonic humor, a little clumsy and heavy-footed perhaps, but indomitable and unconquerable above even the ruthless grief: so that long before he reached the village he knew exactly what he would do. He would cure the idiot forever more of coveting cows by the immemorial and unfailing method: he would make him feed and milk her; he would return home and ride back tomorrow morning and make him feed and milk again and then lead the cow back on foot to where he had found her. So he did not stop at Mrs Littlejohn’s house at all. He turned into the lane and went on toward the lot; it was Mrs Littlejohn who spoke to him from the dense moon-shade beside the fence: “Who’s that?”",

Here and there a fair-haired Basque studied his hand meantime, waiting without protest. No native of Costaguana intruded there. This was the Italian stronghold. Even the Sulaco policemen on a night patrol let their horses pace softly by, bending low in the saddle to glance through the window at the heads in a fog of smoke; and the drone of old Giorgio’s declamatory narrative seemed to sink behind them into the plain. Only now and then the assistant of the chief of police, some broad-faced, brown little gentleman, with a great deal of Indian in him, would put in an appearance. Leaving his man outside with the horses he advanced with a confident, sly smile, and without a word up to the long trestle table. He pointed to one of the bottles on the shelf; Giorgio, thrusting his pipe into his mouth abruptly, served him in person. Nothing would be heard but the slight jingle of the spurs. His glass emptied, he would take a leisurely, scrutinizing look all round the room, go out, and ride away slowly, circling towards the town.",

I tend to think of life as bleak when I can’t find a parking space at Sainsbury’s, but imagine what it must have been to be an Italian in the fourteenth century. For a start, in 1345 it rained non-stop for six months, turning much of the country into a stagnant lake and making planting impossible. The economy collapsed, banks went bust and thousands died in the ensuing famines. Two years later the country was rocked with terrible earthquakes ? in Rome, Naples, Pisa, Padua, Venice ? which brought further death and chaos. And then, just when people were surely thinking that things had to get better now, some anonymous sailor stepped ashore at Genoa and said, ‘You know, I don’t feel so hot,’ and within days the great plague was beginning its long sweep across Europe.",

Indeed, surfing is one of the most difficult and complex sports in the world with elements such as wind, time of the day and swells affecting the waves differently. It was challenging but enjoyable too. The hardest part about surfing, by far, was paddling out, not surfing in. Carrying the board, getting back into the water, paddling through the waves, waiting for the next set. It was exhausting and I realized that surfers expend far more time and energy doing this exercise than on the surfing itself. I learnt that to surf you have to have courage because you are battling an ever-changing environment, and everyone needs to go at their own pace. Some of my teammates got the hang of it right away, while others needed several hours, or days even. I managed to get up after a few hours but never managed to stay on the board for long; I needed much more practice and through this experience, I gained a new-found respect for professional surfers.",
