    "target_paragraph": "When the zuilen began to crumble in the 1960s and 1970s, a new generation rushed to reject the conservatism of their parents. Amsterdam became the magisch centrum (‘magical centre’) of Europe’s hippy movement. The city’s Dam Square and Vondelpark were turned into massive campsites, while John and Yoko enjoyed a ‘bed-in’ at the Hilton. The 1960s also saw the birth of the ‘Provos’, an anarchist group that took its name from the Dutch word provoceren, meaning ‘to provoke’. The group became most famous for their ‘White Bicycle Plan’, a proposal to close the whole of central Amsterdam to motorised traffic and create a free bicycle-sharing scheme, using bicycles that had been painted white. In July 1965, a group of young Provos met at Amsterdam’s Spui square, where a small crowd watched as they slopped white paint on three bicycles and announced they would be left on the streets for anyone to use. The Amsterdam police quickly seized the bicycles, a heavy-handed response that only drew more attention to them. The small ceremonies at which people would donate bikes to the scheme became more like political rallies, with Provos setting off fireworks, lighting bonfires, vandalising statues and brawling with the police.",

They’re leaning into the baby’s face, making noises, praising the baby. “In my next life,” Ed tells me, “I want to come back as an Italian baby.” He steeps in the piazza life: the sultry and buffed man pushing up his sleeve so his muscles show when he languidly props his chin in his hand; the pure flute notes of Vivaldi drifting from an upstairs window; the flower seller’s fan of bright flowers against the stone shop; a man with no neck at all unloading lambs from his truck. He slings them like flour sacks over his shoulder and the lambs’ eyeballs bulge out. Every few minutes, Ed looks up at the big clock that has kept time for so long over this piazza. Finally, he takes a stroll, memorizing the stones in the street.",

Boon was yelling something, he could not tell what; he could see Lion still clinging to the bear’s throat and he saw the bear, half erect, strike one of the hounds with one paw and hurl it five or six feet and then, rising and rising as though it would never stop, stand erect again and begin to rake at Lion’s belly with its forepaws. Then Boon was running. The boy saw the gleam of the blade in his hand and watched him leap among the hounds, hurdling them, kicking them aside as he ran, and fling himself astride the bear as he had hurled himself onto the mule, his legs locked around the bear’s belly, his left arm under the bear’s throat where Lion clung, and the glint of the knife as it rose and fell.",

For a second, immense surprise was alone visible on it: so visible that she half turned to her step-son, with a faint smile for his refuted suspicions. Why, she wondered, should Owen have thought that Darrow had already guessed his secret, and what, after all, could be so disturbing to him in this not improbable contingency? At any rate, his doubt must have been dispelled: there was nothing feigned about Darrow's astonishment. When her eyes turned back to him he was already crossing to Owen with outstretched hand, and she had, through an unaccountable faint flutter of misgiving, a mere confused sense of their exchanging the customary phrases. Her next perception was of Owen's tranquillized look, and of his smiling return of Darrow's congratulatory grasp.

We all broke out our cameras and made our way to the bow, snapping photos and taking video as the four spotted dolphin rode our bow-wake, playing, rolling and jockeying each other for position, spraying us and our cameras with their wet dolphin-breath.\nWe dropped sail after a brilliant orange and magenta sunset and soon turned due east into the channel leading to Ft Pierce. I was concerned about entering a strange inlet at night, but Eddie was confident and I was third-in-command in a three-person crew. As Eddie steered us through the inlet I scanned the dark water for buoys while standing at the bow with a spotlight, although for the most part the channel was lit up like a Christmas tree and the passage into the Ft Pierce Marina was an easy one. Eddie pulled us up alongside fuel dock #2 and we tied off and got a full night's sleep in preparation for our crossing of the Gulf Stream the next day, about which I felt a bit of apprehension. The Gulf Stream is a strong ocean current and has a reputation for becoming extremely rough when the wind blows against it.",

This marble is of many soft colours – pink, white, green, yellow, fawn – and discovered amidst the glory of the surrounding heights and depths it is intoxicatingly lovely. Then I found myself walking between the houses on shiny marble paving-stones, instead of the usual rough paths, and – most striking of all – I saw, on the ledge below, roofs of multicoloured thin marble slates, glowing with a gentle lustre in the clear air.",

So I have no idea when I am going to be able to satisfy my addiction. In the morning I shoot out of my sleeping bag and run down the hill, hoping for the first decent cup of coffee in a month. I discover: IT IS OPEN! THE COFFEE IS GOOD! At an outside table, I cradle my lovely cup of coffee in my hands, soak in the view and the warm sun. Wonder of wonders, it is a lovely day. Jittery with my first caffeine injection, I roam into Hillbillies. Why would you name a bookstore “Hillbillies?” It’s quite the independent bookstore. One of the best for the diversity and uniqueness of the offerings. A treasure that I purchase is, The Prisoner of St Kilda. Shamelessly I will let you read the blurb because it is what grabbed me, at the bookstore and beyond:",

Nothing in there, he thought as the operator said something unintelligible to the nearby security guard who picked up his bag and motioned him to an inspection table at the end of the conveyor. The security guard opened the bag and reached into the internal pocket and pulled out a pair of navigational dividers (used to measure distances on nautical charts).

Far above us on the left, the gorge walls extended upwards hundreds of metres to a strip of sky as defined and narrow as a runway. Far, far down below, the Indus glittered like polished steel. It took its colour from the glacier waters that fed it; a shade of grey-green I had never seen before. The Indus was half a mile wide, but from where our bus crawled along, it looked no wider than a goat track.",

    "target_paragraph": "We left Kabul at 7 a.m. in perfect cycling weather with a brilliant, warm sun, a cool breeze behind us and the air crisp and clear. Beyond a doubt today’s run up the Ghorband valley was the most wonderful cycle-ride of my life. Surely this must have been the Garden of Eden – it’s so beautiful that I was too excited to eat the lunch my hostess had packed for me and spent the day in a sort of enchanted trance. High hills look down on paddy-fields and vivid patches of young wheat and neat vineyards; on orchards of apricot, peach, almond, apple and cherry trees smothered in blossom, and on woods of willows, ash, birch and sinjit, their new leaves shivering and glistening in wind and sun. Lean, alert youths, their clothes all rags and their bearing all pride, guard herds of cattle and nervous, handsome horses and donkeys with woolly, delicately tripping foals, and fat-tailed sheep with hundreds of bounding lambs, and long-haired goats whose kids are among the most delightful of young animals. At intervals there are breaks in the walls of sheer rock on either side and then one sees the more distant peaks of the Hindu Kush rising to 18,000 feet, their snows so brilliant that they are like Light itself, miraculously solidified and immobilised. The little mud villages remain invisible until you reach them, so perfectly do they blend with their background, and the occasional huge, square, mud fortresses, straddling hilltops, recall the cruel valour of this region’s past and have the same rigid, proud beauty as the men who built them. The ‘road’ – narrow and rough – alternately runs level with the flashing river and leaps up mountainsides to give unimpeded views for miles and miles along the valley. This is the part of Afghanistan I was most eager to see, but in my wildest imaginings I never thought any landscape could be so magnificent. If I am murdered en route it will have been well worth while! Not that I think there’s much chance of that; the seventy-eight miles of my route today were patrolled by armed soldiers in pairs, apparently for my special protection as the last pair went off duty when they had led me, at dusk, to the home of the Provincial Governor in this village. I should think that if solitary travellers do get killed here it is because they’ve not told the police, as requested, where they are going and when. It seems to be beyond dispute that Afghanistan has slightly more than its share of bandits, yet almost everyone who travels through is favourably impressed by the treatment they receive and it’s high time the silly nonsense about the extreme dangers of this land were ‘exposed’ as exaggeration.",

In contrast, the Hashmonaim settler type is at least outwardly normal, wouldn’t dream of uprooting olive groves, burning mosques or emptying chamber-pots on passing Palestinians. Enjoying lucrative careers, they function as conventional cogs in Western society. Yet on a Zionist whim – not of necessity – they make aliyah as part of a merciless ongoing Nakba. They pay no heed to those dirty deeds that must be done to create space for all illegal settlements. How to interpret this detachment from the realities around them? It looks like arrogance, old-fashioned colonial racism; having conquered the territory, you needn’t consider the natives. Yet one couldn’t meet anyone less arrogant on the surface than Judith and her jogging friends. There’s something else going on here, not explained by colonial racism.",

I wrote to see if he had ever received the payment for his car. He replied from an address in northern Idaho. Yes, the cash had found him. We became correspondents. He was driving trucks—long-distance semis—and working on a novel. On a trip to visit his family in California, he stopped in Santa Cruz. He brought Max with him. It seemed she was living nearby, over the hill in San Jose. Her live-in boyfriend there was a successful pornographer, according to Bryan. That was correct, Max said. She looked, if possible, even more wickedly amused and attractive than she had on Maui.",

But there is what may be called the send of the sea. The water in the overtoppling crest does move forward, as you will speedily realize if you are slapped in the face by it, or if you are caught under it and are pounded by one mighty blow down under the surface panting and gasping for half a minute. The water in the top of a wave rests upon the water in the bottom of the wave. But when the bottom of the wave strikes the land, it stops, while the top goes on. It no longer has the bottom of the wave to hold it up. Where was solid water beneath it, is now air, and for the first time it feels the grip of gravity, and down it falls, at the same time being torn asunder from the lagging bottom of the wave and flung forward. And it is because of this that riding a surf-board is something more than a mere placid sliding down a hill. In truth, one is caught up and hurled shoreward as by some Titan's hand.",

For a while she took Cicely on her daily rides; but she soon wearied of adapting her hunter's stride to the pace of the little girl's pony, and Cicely was once more given over to the coachman's care.",

It was a comfort, if not a concern, that after 20 years the trains looked no different. Limp curtains shielded the windows, miniature cockroaches flitted across the seat backs and the fan still blew ineffectual wisps of air. A sign on the wall stated that between the hours of 9 pm and 6 am bunks must be put down for the comfort of others and passengers soon began to obey the rules. Paper bags of bedding were shaken out, sheets stretched and tucked in, and cardigans pulled on. Ladies jammed cotton wool into their ears and men stripped down to singlets. They flipped off the lights and soon began to snore. Passepartout, extending his role to valet, had made up my bed for me by the time I picked my way back from the toilet clutching a packet of Sainsbury’s wet wipes. Clambering up the ladder, I rolled the covers up to my chin and lay back, staring at the ceiling as the blanket itched my face. A part of me had feared that I would board the first train and instantly regret my decision. What if I hated it? Four whole months within these blue walls lay ahead. My body rocked gently from side to side as a reassuring ‘da-dum … da-dum … da-dum …’ began to lull me to sleep. It was so peaceful.",

It travelled fast, its dry scales sounding like a distant swarm of bees, and I just had time to observe that it was olive-green, with brown markings, before it poured itself into a crevice between two boulders. When I came out of the river I looked – cautiously – into the crevice and it was still there, doubtless saying to itself that it didn’t know what the world was coming to, with all these dangerous humans clumping about, disturbing an innocent reptile’s sunbathe.",

Slowly, a black hand with a leather-glove palm, pulled back the bush and a huge head appeared a foot away from my chest. If I'd extended my hand, I would have patted his nose. I'd pulled up my hood to protect me from the cloud of flies which accompanied my new acquaintance, and as he observed me with a thoughtful, slightly tilted head, my hood suddenly felt somehow inappropriate, almost impolite, and I tugged it off, so he could get a proper look at me. Under the watchful eye of the young gorilla's father and a nervous tracker with a gun and prominent teeth, we eyeballed each other for maybe thirty seconds. He no longer seemed threatening, but curious. A teenager playing at being a man. He wrenched a handful of leaves from the bush, turned and ambled away, taking his thousand-strong fly swarm with him.",
