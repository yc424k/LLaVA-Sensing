    "target_paragraph": "In 1988 several Hebron University architects, concerned about the Old City’s deterioration, formed the original HRC with limited resources. Then in August 1996, two and a half years after the Goldstein murders, Hebron’s dire needs inspired the PA to undertake rehabilitation in a big way. This new HRC is mainly sustained by the Saudi Development Fund and the Arab Economic and Social Development Fund, with smaller contributions from various European countries. It strives to preserve the Old City’s architectural integrity (an impossible task, given the IDF’s unstoppable bulldozers), to provide basic social services, to reconnect the Old City to the rest of Al-Khalil and to restrict the settlers’ horizontal expansion by encouraging Hebronites to return to abandoned homes. Its initial efforts won the 1998 Aga Khan Award for Architecture, presented biennially to the Islamic world’s most successful new project. Then the pace slowed, as proliferating Military Orders (MOs) banned all work on buildings near settlements. Bulky construction material can’t be smuggled and every Palestinian motor vehicle entering the Old City needs a special hard-to-get permit; this alone enables the military to curtail rehabilitation. Some returning families were arrested en masse, despite being able to prove residence in the Old City for six or eight generations. Craftsmen qualified to repair ancient archways, domes and walls have been indefinitely detained without charge but much interior work continues to be done furtively, using tools and materials smuggled into buildings behind IDF backs. By March 2009 almost 5,000 had returned to 900 discreetly renovated homes.",

    "target_paragraph": "Suki was the final destination of the wabi of Kyoto. Typically, art movements go through three phases: ‘early’, characterized by strength and simplicity; ‘classical’, when all elements reach harmonious maturity; and ‘baroque’, distorted and elaborate. Wabi followed a similar pattern. In its early period, it could not have been simpler, the purest wabi composition being Murata Juko’s tea garden (circa 1500) in the temple of Shinju-an in Kyoto: a little strip of moss running along a temple verandah, with three rocks, five rocks, seven rocks. That is all. Later, when tea ceremony came into its own in the seventeenth century, wabi entered a classical period, resulting in dramatic creations like the Katsura Detached Palace, where villas and tea pavilions stretch over acres of artificial hills and ponds. The scale is large and the designs are complex – alternating squares of blue and white paper pasted onto sliding doors, rock pathways inset with a mixture of long rectangles and small squares.",

The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of “Simon Called Peter,” and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog-biscuits—one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door.",

There were runways now, and hangars, and no audience to see the midnight landing of a plane or a dawn take-off; no Kikuyu youths to watch Ruta at his wonderful and mystic tasks. All was commonplace now. Adventure for Nairobi came in celluloid rolls straight from Hollywood, and adventure for other parts of the world went out from Nairobi in celluloid rolls straight from the cameras of professional jungle-trotters.

    "target_paragraph": "We took a bus there. The village was several miles from a paved road. There was a miniature sugarcane railway running under burnt brown hills. Mangroves grew in dull profusion along a waveless coast. The bus stopped under a breadfruit tree. “Nabila,” the driver said. The village was hot, silent, sleepy. There seemed to be nobody around. We climbed a big hill that rose behind the village, slowly winding past thatch-roofed, mud-walled huts into which surprised-looking children scampered. They didn’t see a lot of tourists here. The trail was dusty and very hot. A few hundred feet up, we came to a good lookout spot. We turned and trained our binoculars on the tiny island across the channel. We were looking straight into the wave. It was coming from the northwest, having wrapped nearly 180 degrees. It was a long, tapering—a very long, very precisely tapering—left. The walls were dark gray against a pale gray sea. This was it. The lineup had an unearthly symmetry. Breaking waves peeled so evenly that they looked like still photographs. There seemed to be no sections. This was it. Staring through the binoculars, I forgot to breathe for entire six-wave sets. This, by God, was it.",

He had never been here before, the scene was strange and haunting as a dream, and yet it was instantly and intolerably familiar. It was, somehow, he thought, like a street he had been to in some small town in the hot South at the faded end of summer – a South Carolina town, he thought it must be, and he was sure that he would hear the sound of familiar, unknown voices, the passing of feet, the rustling of quiet, tired leaves. And then he saw again how strange it was, and could see the tired waiter racking chairs and tables for the night, and in the café tired lights and emptiness, and the white, tired light upon the old dusty street, the huge haunting boles of the great trees; and he knew that he had never been along that way before.",

He cannot think that he has ever lived there in the far lost hills, or ever left them, and all his life seems stranger than the dream of time, and the great train moves on across the immense and lonely visage of America, making its great monotone that is the sound of silence and for ever.

There were the three girl-friends who pass along the streets of life for ever. One had a cruel and sensual face, she wore glasses, and her mouth was hard and vulgar. Another had the great nose and the little bony features of a rat. The face of the third was full and loose, jeering with fat rouged lips and oily volutes of the nostrils.

According to Dinu, the same pair return to the same nest year after year and storks bring good luck; so this was a particularly fortunate village, with more than twenty nests up and down the long street. The migrants had arrived only recently and, having put their nests in order, were now standing on those unwieldy-looking piles of twigs gazing soulfully at one another for hours on end. Everyone was amused by my interest in the colony; Ireland being storkless confirmed their suspicion that it suffers from permafrost.",

Among the goods that natives offered sailors was “a kind of dry leaf that they hold in great esteem.” This mysterious plant reappeared on other islands, where Columbus finally recognized its use. Men and women carried “a half-burnt weed in their hands, being the herbs they are accustomed to smoke.” The herbs were rolled inside a leaf to form tubes the natives called tabacos. Before long, tobacco would hook Europeans and become one of America’s most profitable exports.",

It was a fox, an animal rarely spotted in Chile, and it stood on the road with a hare in its mouth, silhouetted in front of a snowy mountain bisected by a thin waterfall. We entered rainforest soon after that, and the Queulat national park, where we got out to walk down a steep and muddy cliff path to the Padre Garcia waterfall, spectacular even by Chilean standards and exuding a thick jungular smell of wet and rotting vegetation. It felt good. Droplets clung to the burnt orange trumpets of the waterfall flowers like to a car after rain, and humming birds skated over the bamboo.",

Back of his flamboyant brilliance stretched his cohort; the fat and greasy Bellandeau who shared Jacques’ apartment and had matured in the brawls of Montenegro; the Corse, a gloomy romantic, intent on his own desperation, who flew his plane so low along the beach in the hope of killing himself that the bathers could have touched the wings; the tall, immaculate Paulette followed continually by the eyes of a wife out of Marie Laurencin. Rene and Bobbie protruded insistently from their white beach clothes and talked in undertones of Arthur Rimbaud. Bobbie pulled his eyebrows and his feet were flat and silent butler’s feet. He was older and had been in the war and his eyes were as grey and desolate as the churned spaces about Verdun—during that summer, Rene painted their rainwashed shine in all the lights of that varied sea. Rene was the artistic son of a Provencal avocat. His eyes were brown and consumed by the cold fire of a Tintoretto boy. The wife of an Alsatian chocolate manufacturer furtively brooded over the cheap phonograph and pandered loudly to her daughter Raphael, burned black to the bone of her unforgotten, southern, sentimental origin. The white tight curls of two half-Americans in the early twenties, torn between Latin curiosity and Anglo-Saxon caution, hovered through the gloom like a cherub detail from a dark corner of the Renaissance frieze.",

Out came a sliced white pan loaf, wafers of shiny, orange-coloured processed cheese, a jar of Nescafé, a box of Nestlé Coffeemate sachets, a tub of Singaporean jam, a carton of butter substitute allegedly good for the health but certainly containing some menacing mixture of chemicals to create that buttery illusion. I commented on the food industry’s over-packaging – another billion-dollar scam. Each of the ten cheese wafers was separately sealed in a triple plastic envelope and contained in a transparent box almost needing a hacksaw to break it open. Juan saw such precautions as ‘absolutely essential for hygiene in this dusty country’. I retorted that all market foods are exposed to maximum amounts of dust – especially in windy places like Xam Nua – yet everybody survives. ‘They don’t,’ Juan asserted grimly. ‘Gastric infections kill millions.’",

Shoot em! Shoot em!’ and then Tug himself trying it: ‘Papa, papa, Captain Lendon and Crack here both belong to it,’ and old man Nightingale yelling, ‘Shoot them then. Shoot all the blue-bellied sons of bitches,’ and Tug still trying, saying, ‘Papa, papa, if I dont join now, when they pass that draft they will come and get me anyway,’ and still that little maniac hollering, ‘Shoot you all! Shoot all you sons of bitches!’ Yes sir. Likely Tug could join the German army or maybe even the French or British, and had his blessing. But not the one that General Lee betrayed him to that day back in 1865. So he threw Tug out. The three of us got out of that house as fast as we could, but before we even reached the sidewalk he was already in the room that was evidently Tug’s. He never even waited to open the door: just kicked the window out, screen and all, and started throwing Tug’s clothes out into the yard.”",

We thunked and crashed for fifteen minutes and finally came out at the tributary stream. Our approach flushed a ptarmigan, willow ptarmigan; and grayling—at sight of us—shot around in small, cold pools. The stream was narrow, and alders pressed over it from either side. We drank, and rested, and looked up the slope in front of us, which must have had an incline of fifty degrees. The ridge at the top looked extremely far away. Resting, I became aware of a considerable ache in my legs and a blister on one of my heels. On the way uphill we became separated, Hession angling off to the right, Fedeler and I to the left. We groped for handholds among bushes that protruded from the flaky schist, and pulled ourselves up from ledge to ledge. The adrenalin was gone, and my legs were turning to stone. I was ready to dig a den and get in it. My eyes kept addressing the ridgeline, far above. If eyes were hands they could have pulled me there. Then, suddenly, from far below, I saw Jack Hession lightly ambling along the ridge—in his tennis shoes, in his floppy cotton hat. He was looking around, killing time, waiting up for us.",

The boisterous crowds spilling out of the riverside bars were dressed more for Fresher’s Week than for an ancient religious celebration. I saw bananas, bridesmaids and ninja turtles, bishops bearing crosses, jockeys, an Elvis, a pair of skinny Shreks. One group of men had come as multicoloured Tetris blocks, their unwieldy cardboard outfits slotting neatly together when they posed side by side for photographs, but causing serious problems when they tried to enter a bar with a narrow doorway. A woman carrying a fake baby in a sling passed by, followed by a man carrying a real one, who looked terrified in a tiny green frog costume. I saw a convincing old man, in flat cap and baggy cardigan, being pushed across the bumpy brick street in a wheelchair by an even more convincing policeman in uniform. Then I realized it was actually a real old man, being assisted by a genuine helpful copper. My bright orange tiger suit had turned out to be the perfect camouflage. It clearly met the two basic requirements of any decent carnival costume: it was warm, and it looked ridiculous.",

Walking around the corner from the Grace Clinic, I parted with $2 just to enter the hotel’s darkened basement. Inside was a coffee shop of sorts, but it was unlikely to be mistaken for Denny’s. For although the entire room had the All-American look of a high school cafeteria with the lights turned out and three jukeboxes blasting simultaneously, goodies were the last thing on sale here. On every side of the room sat girls of every shape and size, in miniskirts, leather pants, bulging sweaters and tight jeans. Some wore sun glasses in the near pitch-dark, some flashed smiles with gold teeth. One wore a T-shirt that said, quite simply, “Man.” And the girls did nothing except sit around. They smoked and smoked. They chatted without interest. They paced and listlessly prowled. They banged buttons and pounded knobs at an electronic game called Video Hustler. And all around them circled schools of men, mostly Arab, some in djellabas, some in threadbare jackets, some in shirts cracked open to the waist. Many were aged, or rheumy-eyed, or ill-smelling. One was a hunchbacked dwarf wearing huge, black-rimmed spectacles. All eyes were open for a smile. Nobody was drinking coffee.",

The southern walls abut an older, crumbling, mortuary temple built for Mentuhotep II, an Eleventh Dynasty pharaoh.

Melk was the threshold of this unspeakably beautiful valley. As we have seen by now, castles beyond counting had been looming along the river. They were perched on dizzier spurs here, more dramatic in decay and more mysteriously cobwebbed with fable. The towered headlands dropped sheer, the liquid arcs flowed round them in semicircles. From ruins further from the shore the land sloped more gently, and vineyards and orchards descended in layers to the tree-reflecting banks. The river streamed past wooded islands and when I gazed either way, the seeming water-staircase climbed into the distance. Its associations with the Nibelungenlied are close, but a later mythology haunts it. If any landscape is the meeting place of chivalrous romance and fairy tales, it is this. The stream winds into distances where Camelot or Avalon might lie, the woods suggest mythical fauna, the songs of Minnesingers and the sound of horns just out of earshot.",
