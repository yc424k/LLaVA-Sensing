I worried, with ample reason, that I might step blindly off the top of a serac and end up at the bottom of the Witches Cauldron, a vertical half mile below. When I finally arrived on the frozen plain of the ice cap, I found that my tracks had long since drifted over. I didn’t have a clue as to how to locate the tent on the featureless glacial plateau. Hoping I’d get lucky and stumble across my camp, I skied in circles for an hour—until I put a foot into a small crevasse and realized that I was acting like an idiot—that I should hunker down right where I was and wait out the storm.",

There was a man with a megaphone; it was a dancing contest and they did not even know it; the music crashed and ceased, the lights flared on, the air was filled by the bellowing megaphone and the winning couple moved forward. “I’m sick again,” she said. Once more he waited for her—the putty face, the indomitable eyes. “I washed them off again,” she said. “But I cant drink anymore. Come on. They close at one oclock.”",

He stood there for a few moments, letting the lights and the eyes concentrate on him, as if lending himself to the display with a certain distant tolerance; then he began to move toward one of the exits. But half way he stopped, turned with his dogged jerk of the shoulders, and made for a gangway leading up to the balcony.",

Granny and I are to share sheepskins tonight so it’s likely that by morning my already considerable stock of vermin will have acquired companions. Happily lice and bugs don’t discommode me to any great extent, but dearly as I love the Tibetans it is impossible to get accustomed to the nauseating odour of that rancid butter with which they lavishly oil their hair and anoint their bodies. When used on the hair this repulsive unguent is alleged to deter lice and when applied to the body it keeps out the cold; yet however practical its uses may be no one save a Tibetan could ever become resigned to its stink. I’m sitting beside a wood fire now, writing by flame-light with wood smoke tears streaming down my face – but at least this acrid smoke does something to obliterate the butter stench. Even the babies’ almost bald heads have been plastered with the ghastly stuff. In all these camps Tiblets’ heads are similarly treated and, having had scores of them laid on my bosom within the past few days, my shirt is now so saturated with grease that even when walking through the wide open spaces I cannot get away from the stink.",

Or maybe it was a dialectic since as far as he knew only he had watched it out and since only he in waking had watched it out, to all the others still in slumber it still obtained, like the tree in darkness being no longer green, and since he who had watched it out still didn’t know where it had gone, for him it was still night too. Then almost before he had had time to begin to bother to think that out and so have done with it, a bugle blowing reveille confounded him, the sound (that sound: who had never heard it before or even heard of it: a horn blowing at daybreak on a forward aerodrome where people did not even have guns but were armed only with maps and what Monaghan called monkeywrenches) even getting him up onto his feet: that greater condition’s abrogation which had now reabrogated. In fact, if he had been a cadet still, he would even know what crime whoever found him sitting there would charge him with: not shaving: and, standing now, he realised that he had even forgot his problem too, who had sat there all night thinking that he had none evermore, as though sitting so long within that peaceful stink had robbed olfactory of its single sense or perhaps the sidcott of its smell and only getting up restored them both. In fact, for a moment he toyed with the idea of unrolling the sidcott to see how far the burning had spread, except that if he did that and let the air in, the burning might spread faster, thinking, with a sort of peaceful amazement hearing himself: Because it’s got to last; no more: not last until, just last.",

When the armies of the First Crusade marched through Turkey only twenty years after Manzikert, they found that many of the Empire’s most fertile theme (provinces) were already waste.

He and Mari both were quite shy, and their romance could hardly be described as whirlwind. In 1990, more than a decade after they’d met in the chapel, they finally were married in a ceremony there. He formally adopted her son, Virgilio, and moved his few belongings into the house on Corralfalso. Theirs was not a typical marriage. When Román left on a sea voyage lasting months, they’d stay in touch by ship-to-shore radiograms. But because they were not authorized to send personal messages, they kept their conversations brief and eventually developed a language of their own. “How are things in your department?” he’d ask. It was their code for news about home.",

Everyone listed on government staff rosters had to sit an exam which posed thirty-three questions about the current state of affairs in Burma. Anyone who answered the questions incorrectly was sacked, forced to resign, or transferred to some distant inactive posting in the countryside.",

Very soon cycling became impossible; I simply walked through a sort of submarine world in which the cold rain falling around me seemed no less in volume than the knee-deep, earth-warmed torrent through which Leo was being dragged. At one point we had to re-cross a river – for all I know the ubiquitous Seti again – that earlier had been ankle-deep but was now breast-high and positively dangerous. Then, incredibly, from a slight hill I saw through the curtain of falling water an aeroplane parked under a tree; and that vision could only mean that I had – as might have been predicted – lost the Pokhara track and inadvertently found Pardi. But between us and the airfield lay wide, flooded paddy-fields of such soft mud that I sank in to my knees at every step and could not possibly get Leo through. I was determined to make for that aeroplane in a straight line, lest we might find ourselves behind one more low, green hill, so I painfully carried Leo along half a mile of the narrow, slippery ditches that intersect paddy-fields, frequently falling into three feet of muddy water and feeling rather like a drunken tightrope walker. Then, as we crossed the airfield at 6.15 p.m., the rain stopped and a startling gleam of sunshine lightened the valley.",

Whenever we sailed together, there was the constant pressure of watches, the constant dread of losing each other, and now that it was over, it was as if a heavy burden had been lifted.

Everything is still closed with the exception of the store and one small eatery, a takeaway. I decide to test the expensive meals/less bread theory. Although inside seating is available, the air is so thick with Fryolater fat that I choose to eat in the cold rather than become encrusted. I order carrot-coriander soup with bread and a bacon roll for lunch. For a third of what I paid for brown soup and garlic linguine, I get fantastic homemade soup, a giant slab of bread and butter, and a bacon roll (to make up for the fat deficiency of oatmeal). Revitalised, I ride off to Castle Tioram waiting to see how the day evolves.",

The old woman had prepared a good meal for them: a thick rich soup, chopped chicken livers, chicken, cake, and a strong sweet wine: she served them but would not sit and eat with them: she came in briefly and shook hands shyly and awkwardly, mumbling incoherently a mangled jargon of Yiddish and English. Suddenly, however, as if she had briefly mastered herself by a strong effort, her old and sorrowful face was twisted by a convulsion of powerful and incurable grief, and a long, terrible, savagely wailing cry was torn from her throat: she turned blindly, and with a movement of natural and primitive sorrow, she suddenly seized the edges of her apron in her gnarled and worn hands and flung it up over her head and rushed toward the door at a blind, lunging, reeling step. She was like one demented by sorrow: the old woman began to beat her withered breasts and pull at her wispy grey hair, meanwhile running and stumbling blindly round her kitchen in a horrible and savage dementia and drunkenness of grief. Abe followed her out, and Eugene could hear his voice, low, urgent, and tender, as he spoke to her persuasively in Yiddish, and her long wailing cries subsided and he returned. His face was sad and weary-looking and in a moment he said: ‘Mama’s breaking up fast. She’s never been able to get over my brother’s death. She thinks about it all the time: she can’t get it off her mind.’",

The contrast between her past and present sounded through the tumult of her thoughts like the evil laughter of temptation.

For years it had been the haunt of Bali’s artists from abroad and at home; the Dutch painters Hans Snell and Arie Smit had put down their roots in this tropical Big Sur many years ago and, more recently, the place had attracted such contemporary heroes of the arts as Iggy Pop and David Bowie (not to mention, as the ad for one hotel eccentrically boasted, Koo Stark). Electricity had come to Ubud only in 1975, but, within a decade, the place had filled up with artists’ cooperatives run by craftsmen from Switzerland and New Age settlers from Seattle. Ubud was the place where students of Bali came to learn the gamelan or master the steps of the legong dance or acquire some other precious talent that would go down well back home in Marin.",

She talked the way she looked and dressed and acted, the way she was: a speech fragile, empty, nervous, brittle, artificial and incisive as one of the precious bits of china, the costly, rare, enamelled little trinkets that filled up her house, her life, her interest.",

The road weaves back and forth with the railroad track, never physically crossing it because of bridges and tunnels. Small train stations materialise along the way. I stop at the Prince’s Cairn, the finding of which reconfirms this is a better day since I found it. The cairn is on Loch Nan Uamh on the Sound of Arisaig. It marks the spot where Bonnie Prince Charles departed Scotland in 1746 leaving his supporters to the mercies of the English, who were not well pleased he had escaped. Three hours later I find myself, tired and cold, in Arisaig. The sign gives both the English spelling (Arisaig) and Gaelic spelling (Arasaig). Was it worth the $500 in additional signage costs to share that?",

The virtually landlocked harbor must have held more than a hundred anchored boats, mostly sailboats of one type or another, and most of them seemed to have people living aboard. This looked like it was going to be an interesting place. We anchored in an open space toward the eastern end of the harbor and flagged some people in a passing dinghy, asking for local information. We learned that the place to access shore was a bar and dinghy dock called Dockside Lounge, which catered to cruisers and liveaboards, and where you could not only dock your dinghy and buy a drink but take a hot shower, park a bicycle (or a car), take on water, drop off garbage and even receive mail and phone messages. This was years before mobile phones of course. Dockside, we were told, was a funky open-air joint on the waterfront and was the center of an active social scene, a watering hole for sailors, a place to meet and hang out with like-minded people who were living the life we were only sampling.",

The process wasn’t helped when the United States’ primary negotiator, Secretary of State William Seward, was attacked and brutally stabbed, along with five other members of his household (plus one who was pistol-whipped), as part of the same assassination plot in which John Wilkes Booth shot and killed Abraham Lincoln. None of the victims at Seward’s house died. According to Harvey, the would-be assassin’s blade may have been thwarted by a neck brace. “If Seward hadn’t been run over by a carriage he wouldn’t have been covered in casts,” Harvey said. “That accident saved his life.”",

Our room was made entirely of hardboard, the bathroom locked on the outside and we had to unscrew the bulb to turn the light off.

She immediately answered, with great warmth and friendliness, that she minded not at all. George received this information with considerable relief, and took a packet of cigarettes from his pocket and was on the point of joining his unknown companion in the luxury of a smoke when old Fuss-and-Fidget rattled his paper viciously, glared sourly at the elegant young man and then at George, and, pointing to a sign upon the wall of the compartment, croaked dismally:",

Thence they have issued a communication to us, the Goths and Paralytics of the Amarilla Club (who have our own committee), inviting us to come to some provisional understanding for a truce, in order, they have the impudence to say, that the noble cause of Liberty ‘should not be stained by the criminal excesses of Conservative selfishness!’ As I came out to sit with Nostromo on the cathedral steps the club was busy considering a proper reply in the principal room, littered with exploded cartridges, with a lot of broken glass, blood smears, candlesticks, and all sorts of wreckage on the floor. But all this is nonsense. Nobody in the town has any real power except the railway engineers, whose men occupy the dismantled houses acquired by the Company for their town station on one side of the Plaza, and Nostromo, whose Cargadores were sleeping under the arcades along the front of Anzani’s shops. A fire of broken furniture out of the Intendencia saloons, mostly gilt, was burning on the Plaza, in a high flame swaying right upon the statue of Charles IV. The dead body of a man was lying on the steps of the pedestal, his arms thrown wide open, and his sombrero covering his face—the attention of some friend, perhaps. The light of the flames touched the foliage of the first trees on the Alameda, and played on the end of a side street nearby, blocked up by a jumble of ox-carts and dead bullocks. Sitting on one of the carcasses, a lepero, muffled up, smoked a cigarette. It was a truce, you understand. The only other living being on the Plaza besides ourselves was a Cargador walking to and fro, with a long, bare knife in his hand, like a sentry before the Arcades, where his friends were sleeping. And the only other spot of light in the dark town were the lighted windows of the club, at the corner of the Calle.”",
