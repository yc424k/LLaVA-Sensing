One of the men was her husband, a pale skinny twenty-one-year-old with carroty hair; he was trying hard to grow a beard to make himself look older. They had a two-month-old son; it had been a shot-gun wedding. ‘You sell me anti-bebi pills?’ Lilia pleaded wistfully. I tried to explain that anti-bebi pills without medical guidance (or even with it) are dangerous; but Lilia’s English wasn’t equal to that … She was however eager to work at communication and her companions had a lot to say about the new feeling in northern Moldavia, where most people have relatives beyond the Prut. The possibility of eventual reunion with an ex-Soviet Moldavia was of much more interest than the day-to-day machinations of politicians in distant Bucharest. Yet here too Iliescu was much admired.",

For a moment she resented the passage of time and the accidents of life which had swept her away – from all that, she said to herself. And a scene came before her; Maggie and Renny sitting over the fire. A happy marriage, she thought, that’s what I was feeling all the time. A happy marriage. She looked up as she walked down the dark little street behind the others. A broad fan of light, like the sail of a windmill, was sweeping slowly across the sky. It seemed to take what she was feeling and to express it broadly and simply, as if another voice were speaking in another language.

They turned in a flurry, heading for the underbrush and sailing downhill in great arcs until all their white rumps had vanished in turn; and, as they took flight, a russet stag, unseen till then, looked up with a sweep of horn that was spread far wider than the antler in my hand; and while the does were curvetting past, his antlers swung out of profile into full face like a ritual separation of twin candelabra. His wide eyes were severe but unfocused, white flecks scattered the back of his tawny coat, and his hooves were neat and shining. Turning aside, he took one or two sedate and strutting paces, trotted a few more with his head and its scaffolding well back, and leaped down the slope after the does.

The copy of Lagos Life was still on her bed; she picked it up, and looked at the photo of her and her mother, on page five, their faces contented and complacent, at a cocktail party hosted by the British high commissioner. Her mother had pulled her close as a photographer approached; later, after the flashbulb went off, Olanna had called the photographer over and asked him please not to publish the photo. He had looked at her oddly. Now, she realized how silly it had been to ask him; of course he would never understand the discomfort that came with being a part of the gloss that was her parents’ life.",

My whole life, including my own teeter-tottery business, feels every bit as precarious. Tomorrow is my train journey south with my Thai exporter colleague, Soo. My trusty old suitcase is more ready than I am. I’m reminded of one of those cartoon characters who wanders off a cliff. They keep walking into thin air until they look down. I think that’s where I am – about to look down. It’s only when they do look down that they plummet – and not all at once. First the boots go, elongating the legs, which pull down the torso, and then the head, followed by chattering teeth, bugged out eyeballs, and lastly the shocked eyebrows and fright wig. Then, after the long fading whistle, there is a thud and a distant little puff of dust.",

Sitting on the rolling deck with my toolbox and Swiss Army knife, we played with the old half-broken forestay that had been replaced in Port Sudan, and used it in place of the totally broken one. We threaded the wire through a hole on the masthead, pulling it through, and then, with an arrangement of wire clamps at the opposite end, we attached it to the turnbuckle on deck. All this was relatively easy now on a calmer sea. Climbing to the top of the mast to thread the new forestay was a little nerve-wracking, as the boat swayed from side to side, but after an hour it was over. Olivier was back on Akka and we were on our way again, bundled up in sweaters and socks. I remained wide awake until dawn; even the twinkling lights of far off ships set my heart to racing.",

The year was 1991, and what was going on in Russia then dazzled her. “It was like a huge treasure chest had opened,” she later told the Anchorage Daily News. “History was changing before my very eyes.”",

The glorious sunrise had given way to leaden clouds and arctic wind by the time I reached the 6,200-foot mountain, fourteen miles from where I’d slept. I shivered in my sundress and kept stubbing my frozen toes on roots, cursing with pain every time. Finally, in the spruce forest near the summit, I stopped to don my paltry layers. Most of my body fat had already been sacrificed to the rocks, mud, and miles of the Appalachian Trail, so there wasn’t much left to keep me warm as the weather transitioned resolutely toward the equinox. A few days before I’d been suffering in the heat and humidity of a mid-Atlantic summer. Now, I was shivering in my shoes. I wondered if I’d be able to keep warm crossing the Great Smoky Mountains—the highest part of the entire trail.",

There was even a new business park with fluttering pennants, spindly new trees, and an impressive brick gateway on what was clearly reclaimed ground. The main street, Station Road, had been smartly pedestrianized and its many shops appeared to be doing a reasonable trade. It was obvious that there was not a great deal of money in Ashington—most of the shops were of the Price Busters/Superdrug/Wotta Loada Crap variety, their windows papered with strident promises of special offers within—but at least they appeared to be thriving in a way that those of Bradford, for instance, were not.",

Based on the map in our book, two of the paths seemed to be heading in totally the wrong direction, so we discounted them immediately. One path seemed to be heading upwards, whereas our route was supposed to head to lower altitudes, so I felt fairly confident that I'd identified the correct route, and we set off along a thin, winding track heading in a vaguely downhill direction.",

If this doesn’t work, he thought, looking at the portrait of a nobleman with a crimson cloak and a star that hung luminous in front of him, I’ll never do it again. Then he braced himself to talk to the virginal girl who sat beside him. But he had to reject almost everything that occurred to him – she was so young.",

I am almost whole now; and see how jubilant I am, bringing into play all that Neville ignores in me. I feel, as I look from the window, parting the curtains, “That would give him no pleasure; but it rejoices me”. (We use our friends to measure our own stature.) My scope embraces what Neville never reaches. They are shouting hunting-songs over the way. They are celebrating some run with the beagles. The little boys in caps who always turned at the same moment when the brake went round the corner are clapping each other on the shoulder and boasting. But Neville, delicately avoiding interference, stealthily, like a conspirator, hastens back to his room. I see him sunk in his low chair gazing at the fire which has assumed for the moment an architectural solidity. If life, he thinks, could wear that permanence, if life could have that order—for above all he desires order, and detests my Byronic untidiness; and so draws his curtain; and bolts his door. His eyes (for he is in love; the sinister figure of love presided at our encounter) fill with longing; fill with tears. He snatches the poker and with one blow destroys that momentary appearance of solidity in the burning coals. All changes. And youth and love. The boat has floated through the arch of the willows and is now under the bridge. Percival, Tony, Archie, or another, will go to India. We shall not meet again. Then he stretches his hand for his copy-book—a neat volume bound in mottled paper—and writes feverishly long lines of poetry, in the manner of whomever he admires most at the moment.",

Walking; I had impressed that on him: not to run, but walk, as forlorn and lonely and fragile and alien in that empty penitentiary compound as a paper doll blowing across a rolling mill; still walking even after he had passed the point where he couldn’t come back and knew it; even still walking on past the moment when he knew that he had been sold and that he should have known all along he was being sold, not blaming anybody for selling him nor even needing to sell him because hadn’t he signed—put his cross, his mark; he couldn’t read and write—that same promissory note too to breathe a little while, since his name was Snopes?",

    "target_paragraph": "IT’S STILL COLD in Jerusalem, but there are tiny flowers growing in the cracks in the stones, because it’s also almost spring, and outside the Old City, the almond trees are like brides again.\nSpring is that in-between time, between the long bare nights of winter and the long hot days of summer, between blossoming trees and parched earth. And spring is many things—renewal, hope, a little blooming, and as the sun gets warmer and higher in the sky, we know that the long, dry days of the dusty summer stretch before us.\nI’m thinking about this while I munch on a piece of fresh bread with the Mukhtar of the Syrian Christian Orthodox community.\n“My father was Ottoman Turkish, so I am Turkish. I was born under the British mandate and my birth certificate has Queen Elizabeth’s father’s name on it,” he says. “In 1948 when I was thirteen, I became a citizen of Jordan. I still have my passport. In 1967, I became an Israeli resident. They won’t give me citizenship but I am a resident. And I am a Palestinian.\n“I am like the mayor,” he says proudly. “And in 1967 when Israel took over all of Jerusalem, Mayor Teddy Kollek came to my store to see me. We became friends, and he used to visit all the time, and he told his secretary that if I ever came to his office she should kick down the door and let me in, even if he was in the middle of a meeting with the Prime Minister!”\nHe smiles, and arches his eyebrow.\nHe has a huge photo of himself with Teddy Kollek in front of his shop, and he beams.\n“Now he was a real mayor,” he says.\nHis eyes are gleaming, and he purses his lips, and I know he is too much a gentleman to say something nasty about the current mayor.\nThe Mukhtar of the Syrian Orthodox Church is also a tailor, and he’s been working in this little shop with the yellow walls since the 1950s.\n“I was here under Jordanian rule, and I am here under Israeli rule, but all that matters to me is God’s rule.”\nHe has silver hair brushed with Brylcreem, and he wears a natty maroon vest over a pinstriped shirt, and black slacks. While he stitches and measures, he listens to music in Aramaic—it’s his first language, and the one Jesus would have spoken while he walked the same streets where I drink my coffee, and where the Mukhtar buys his bread.\nOnce, he tells me, his hair was blacker and shinier than the sewing machine he would work over, stitching mantels and scarves and suits, dressing the people of the Old City—Christians, Muslims, and Jews. He still does, but he also sells souvenirs, including a linguistic tree of the Semitic languages.\n“I did my hair just like Elvis, and all the women of Jerusalem used to come to admire my hair,” he winks. “Some of them still do.”\nHe looks hopefully out the window.",

One night, after snowshoeing a good distance at thirty below zero, he stopped at a cabin, tired. He said he would sleep on the floor, but the people insisted that he sleep in a bed with their children—a small boy and a small girl. The boy wet the bed all night. His sister kept warning him he was going to get spanked. Jim just lay there between them, floating on his back in a lake of urine, saying nothing. “It beggared description” is what he says now. “In effect, it was enough to pale the Pope.” He uses exactly the same terms to summarize his experiences on the higher levels of bureaucracy.",

I always listened to local advice, and almost always heeded it, but I had heard nothing from anyone else about bandits in this part of the country. I did not want to give myself an excuse not to do this. Something stubborn in me wanted to walk on the Karakoram Highway. I had hitch-hiked huge distances by myself for months all around Australia, and then for three months around the coast of Ireland. I had learned to be streetwise, and I had kept myself safe by carefully judging risks: did this driver seem overly sleazy as he rolled down the window (almost 99 per cent of my lifts were with solitary male drivers), or did that one have a smell of alcohol on his breath, or why was it that particular one made me feel uneasy and thus refuse the lift? Of course every country and situation was different, but I honestly did not believe I would be putting myself in any real danger by walking for a couple of days along the Karakoram Highway. I decided I would take the risk.",

The Lut is truly exceptional and full of contradictions. From the sweltering heat of the mega-dunes to the icy cold nights in the valley of the Kaluts?with sandcastle-like rock formations?from the salt plains, cracked by the fierce sun, to the sand storms blasting through the meteorite craters, the desert kept me captivated during this epic crossing by its raw beauty and versatility.",
