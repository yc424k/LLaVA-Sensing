When my eyes had begun to adjust to the light, I saw that the walls were covered with mahogany cabinets full of old leather-bound books; the remaining space was filled with woodcuts of eighteenth-century Highland lairds, including one without a head which was labelled Lord Lovat’s Ghost. Around the room, among piles of lumber, stood a great mountain of shoe boxes. I walked in and lifted the lid of the topmost box.",

It was, I reflected briefly as I stopped to gasp for breath, wonderful snow. Plumes of it whipped up and danced in mid-air, choreographed by the strange swirls and vortices of wind that filled the corries.

Dressed in a ragged blue uniform, a rifle over his shoulder which wouldn’t have fired even if he’d had the rounds, with all his belongings in a little tin pail, he dropped behind at the first village we reached. He was called Tommie and he had a brazen boyish charm. He knew the way, but he had no intention of walking at our rate. He started each day well, but after half an hour he would slip aside into the bush and not catch up again until the midday halt. By that time he was usually a little drunk. Because he wore a uniform he could rob any village he passed of palm wine, fruit and vegetables.",

His spirit was as steady as a rock, as enduring as the earth, and like the flash of a light, the sight of his good, grey ugly face could always evoke for Eugene the whole wrought fabric of his life in the city, the whole design of wandering and return, with a thousand memories of youth and hunger, of loneliness, fear, despair, of glory, love, exultancy and joy.\n \nRobert Weaver appeared suddenly one night about seven o’clock as Eugene was sitting in the lobby at the Leopold: he had not seen Robert since their arrest. His visit to the hotel was the result of a sudden impulse on Robert’s part: immediately, without greeting or any preliminary whatever, he began to ask all sorts of questions about the Leopold – How long had Eugene been there? Did he have a good room and how big was it? How well did he like living at the hotel? Then insisted that Eugene show him his room. Eugene got his key at the desk and took him up: at the sight of the small room with its piles of books and stacks of student themes Robert burst out laughing. Then he began to ask all manner of questions in a serious and earnest tone – Where was the bathroom? – Eugene showed him – Did they give him plenty of towels? – Eugene told him – How much did he pay? – Eugene said the rent was twelve dollars a week.",

He had fallen into a shallow flower pit and he scrambled out and tried to stand and fell again, while nausea swirled in him. It was his knee, and he lay sick and with drawn, gasping lips while his trouser leg sopped slowly and warmly, clutching the garment and staring at the dark sky with wide, mad eyes. He heard voices in the house, and a light came on behind the window above him and he turned crawling, and at a scrambling hobble he crossed the lawn and plunged into the shadow of the cedars beside the garage, where he lay watching the window in which a man leaned, peering out; and he moaned a little while his blood ran between his clasped fingers. He drove himself onward again and dragged his bleeding leg on up to the wall and dropped into the lane and cast the pole down. A hundred yards further he stopped and drew his torn trousers aside and tried to bandage the gash in his leg. But the handkerchief stained over almost at once, and still blood ran and ran down his leg and into his shoe.",

In a small hotel near the Mekong embankment a young man lay on a battered settee beside the reception desk; there was no one else around. His hands were clasped behind his head, his eyes were closed and he looked unwell. I woke him gently and asked for the cheapest room (US$10). He sat up and seemed worried. Unlike 99 per cent of his compatriots, he spoke a little English. ‘For $10 no air-cold, you too hot!’ He consulted the register (an exercise book), then announced, ‘For tonight we have little people, I give you cold room for cheapest rate.’ Picking up my rucksack, he winced with pain. Six days previously he had had his appendix removed, yet it was difficult to persuade him that he must not haul a heavy weight up two steep flights of stairs. My room was clean, with a cold shower (the water supply fickle) and a squat-over loo. But the ‘air-cold’ was so loud I had to switch it off at night.",

Juan was there the following morning, before the metal had cooled. When, some years later, as part of his deal with César Gaviria, Escobar revealed the location of his clandestine labs, Juan was one of twenty journalists invited to report on the druglord’s operations at the Río Perancho in Chocó. He recalls a surreal moment as they all arrived, damp with sweat, and had to turn on the heaters normally used for processing cocaine to dry their clothes. They toured three immense laboratories, each assembled in the jungle at a cost of $1 million. The drugs had been dispatched by boat down the Río Atrato or by floatplane from bases hidden away in the wetlands.",

Here the Danube followed a winding corridor which expanded without warning to giant circular ballrooms and closed again just as abruptly; and for leagues on end this widening and shrinking ravine was empty of all but a cottage and a barn or two and a scattering of castles and lonely towers and hermitages, all crumbling to fragments. They broke through the forest mass, disintegrating on vertiginous spikes of rock high overhead. As I climbed the hill-path, the ruins fell level and then dropped below and the mountains opposite changed from a wall of branches into a maze of moraines and clefts and buttresses with a ripple of meadows and solitary hamlets along their crests, all of them invisible till now and basking in the sunlight which was denied the lower world. Increasing height laid bare new reaches of the river like an ever-lengthening chain of lakes, and for those rare stretches where the valley ran east and west, the sunrise and the sunset lay reflected and still and an illusion lifted each lake a step higher than its predecessor until they formed gleaming staircases climbing in either direction; and at last the intervening headlands lost touch with the other shore and the watery stairs, now far below, cohered in a single liquid serpent.",

Time and salt had turned everything a faded pink, and when you walked down the steps to the harbour, as ancient holidaymakers had done, the centuries-old name of the town still rang beautiful and true: Midye. In 1960, the government decided that Midye sounded too un-Turkish, and renamed it to Kiyiköy: Village of the Shores.",

Then she removed the meat from the pot and began trickling blood from the seal slowly into the boiling water, stirring constantly. She added enough blood for the soup to thicken, then removed the pot to let the liquid cool. After eating the slabs, they sipped at the dense, rich, tangy blood soup, which—even though one of their fellow crew members lay dead on the ground less than a hundred yards away—was warming and deeply satisfying.",

She was not afraid for herself; she knew the Hyatts would not be likely to trouble her; but she was not sure how they would treat a “city fellow.”",

A fatigue that is like a hatred of art, or of any order in human affairs, any effort at reality, rolls down on you from some small mosaic (or suppose it were a large one, of the Tree of Life) or a badly timed glimpse of the Palatine; it is as though all the fountains had gone dry. Or the Tiber. A strange river, in many ways less like water than anything else in Rome; it does nothing for the buildings along it, not like the Seine anyway, no fishermen, no bookstalls; sometimes looking at it from a bridge you feel like a fish staring into a flowerpot; with all the mud it dumps at its mouth it has pushed the shore line out seven or eight miles since the Empire. Oh mud, father mud, to whom the Romans pray.—You go away, for six weeks, six months; anything clear and straight is better: a chalet in Switzerland, a café in Paris, a subway in New York. Or you might at this moment consider retreating from the world.",

    "target_paragraph": "Our flea-infested Hotel del Sol is another brash, anomalous post-‘quake building, tinged with plastic – one feels chrome and strip-lighting may happen any day now. It has delusions of grandeur and is comparatively expensive: 180 soles for a cramped and filthy single room with a glazed window that won’t open. True, we haven’t washed for a month (apart from that effort in Conchucos) and our clothes are stinking; but other people’s filth is something else again … Today Rachel is so flea-bitten she looks like an acute measles case and I’m not much better. The waiters are welcoming and well-meaning but the food is repulsive. For supper last night we had luke-warm God-knows-what soup and half-cooked spaghetti with (in Rachel’s opinion) minced motor-tyres. In despair I went out and bought a bottle of vino (good: rosé) for 300 soles. Today we ate among friendly campesinos in the covered market – a run-down Mercado, designed for more prosperity than Huari now enjoys. We each had five delicious meals (our camel trick again) for the price of one in the hotel. At almost every stall we passed, someone insisted on my sharing their gourd of fiesta chicha. I must by now have accumulated a representative selection of campesino bacteria; but for Rachel, there would be little point in ‘pilling’ our drinking-water.",

In one field the harvest had already taken place and the meadows were filled with gleaners, faces lowered towards the stubble, amid a scattering of beehive hayricks. Ahead of them a last solitary reaper was bent over his scythe; it was like a marginal illustration from a Gothic psalter, or a ‘Season of the Month’ on the misericord of an abbey quire.

A publisher was a figment of the romantic imagination, an agreeable fiction conceived by young men writing their first book in order to tide them over their darker moments! But seriously to believe now, in the cold light of reality, while his appalled eye rested on the huge pile of his completed manuscript, that such a creature as a publisher really existed—that a publisher could be found who would publish this leviathan—no, it was too much! It was impossible! To believe that a publisher actually lived and moved and had his being somewhere in the canyoned precincts of the mighty city was like believing in ghosts and fairies! Such a creature and the whole world he moved in was a myth, a fable, and a legend.",

He had seen himself triumphant, unquestioned, appeased, the idol of the soldiers, weighing in secret complacency the agreeable alternatives of power and wealth open to his choice. Alas!

That rogue of a doctor had to come out with his information. That was clear. It would be of no use to him—alone. He could do nothing with it. Malediction! The doctor would never come out. He was probably under arrest already, shut up together with Don Carlos. He laughed aloud insanely. Ha! ha! ha! ha! It was Pedrito Montero who would get the information.

The vine is now stretched taut, fading from ochre to silver, then a deep burnt brown. The path to her cage has had to move to avoid the dead tree. I trail my eyes along its trunk, smelling of decay. Tiny white and yellow fungi burst out of the rifts.

Two Italian ladies walked in, placed a boombox on the table, inserted a cassette tape and pressed PLAY, the entire operation performed to the accompaniment of a jackhammer. The school’s main entrance had been blocked off that morning and the work was being carried out directly under our classroom. I looked around for the candid camera, but all I saw were the strained faces of my fellow applicants. The day before, one of the women had set up a tiny, electric space heater near my chair after I had inquired as to whether the building had heat. So after a minute, I took it upon myself to point out the absurdity of the situation. They looked at me a bit quizzically as if ambient noise was part of the listening experience, but finally decided to move to another room and start from the top. After the oral interviews, we were told that classes would begin the following morning. Ten students were accepted into the program, satisfying the number required for the school’s operational funding, and unfortunately including the aforementioned Ukrainian with whose shenanigans we would be burdened until the bitter end.",

Past the refugio, past the little stone restaurant where I had had dinner the night before, past the college, and finally into an industrial area that was waist-high in grass.\n\nThe yellow arrows cheered me on. I walked under an overpass just as a tour bus rumbled across. I wondered whether my group was on it, singing camp songs and having a jolly time.",

I felt headachey and bone-sore, and walked around the Ring looking for any explanation of the night’s screams. None. A white chalk path spooled away east-south-east over high downs, so I followed it along Bramber Bank, a sloping shoulder of turf which dips gracefully into the upper valley of the River Adur. For half a mile of the bank, the path was littered with thousands of striped snail shells, Helix nemoralis, over which I crunched. In one field, ragwort seethed with cinnabar-moth caterpillars. Another field was pink with bursts of mallow, thrust up from the turf like magician’s sprays of false flowers. Tractor tracks swooped and arced between them. The sun was already hot by the time I reached the medieval church of Botolphs, where my friend Rod Mengham – a Downsman by birth and upbringing, and a poet, archaeologist and writer by practice – was waiting in the shade of the tower to walk a few miles with me. I was very happy to see him.",

There was a board on a tree, bearing a merchant’s name above the legend Jefferson 4 mi, drawing up and then past, yet with no semblance of motion, and he moved his feet slightly and braced his inside elbow for the coming jerk and gathered and hurled himself feet foremost out of the moving surrey, snapping his arm and shoulder forward against the expected jerk but too late, so that even as his body swung out and free of the wheel his head slipped down into the V of the stanchion which supported the top and the weight and momentum of his whole body came down on his vised neck. In a moment now he would hear the bone, the vertebrae, and he wrenched his body again, kicking backward now toward where he believed the moving wheel would be, thinking, If I can just hook my foot in them spokes, something will have to give; lashing with his foot toward the wheel, feeling each movement of his body travel back to his neck as though he were attempting, in a cold fury of complete detachment, to see which would go first: the living bone or the dead metal. Then something struck him a terrific blow at the base of his neck and ceased to be a blow and became instead a pressure, rational and furious with deadly intent. He believed he heard the bone and he knew he heard the deputy’s voice: “Break! God damn it, break! Break!” and he felt the surge of the surrey and he even seemed to see the sheriff leaning over the seat-back and grappling with the raging deputy; choking, gasping, trying to close his mouth and he could not, trying to roll his head from beneath the cold hard blow of the water and there was a bough over his head against the sunny sky, with a faint wind in the leaves, and the three faces. But after a while he could breathe again all right, and the faint wind of motion had dried the water from his face and only his shirt was a little damp, not a cool wind yet but just a wind free at last of the unendurable sun, blowing out of the beginning of dusk, the surrey moving now beneath an ordered overarch of sunshot trees, between the clipped and tended lawns where children shrieked and played in bright small garments in the sunset and the ladies sat rocking in the fresh dresses of afternoon and the men coming home from work turned into the neat painted gates, toward plates of food and cups of coffee in the long beginning of twilight.",

I cannot gag down the chips. I have reached the point where I never want to see another chip. The beer is very fine, though. The barkeep tells me how she has travelled to Korea, China, Cambodia, Laos, India, France, and many other places working as an English teacher. She has just landed here for the tourist season.

Past a small concrete modesty wall, a lush poolside landscape of baby palms and frangipani trees opened up, framed by clusters of two-storey bungalows. Naked middle-aged men lazed around the pool, their bodies spread out on deckchairs. They looked up at me sleepily. I was wearing a t-shirt and shorts, but I had never felt so clothed in my life. A couple of men wore one-inch-on-the-hip speedos, but everyone else went nude. Penises were every where. And these penises weren’t just attached to humans, but also appeared as sculptures and decorations: penis-shaped ashtrays and cement water features in the shape of erect phalluses. Timidly, I smiled and politely waved.",
