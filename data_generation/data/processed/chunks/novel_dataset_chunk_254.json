The immense contempt he felt for Sotillo steadied him, and he said oracularly, “No doubt it is well concealed by this time.”",

They had a shack on the edge of the settlement, which was near a paved artery called the Queens Road, making it feel more like a little highway town than a traditional subsistence village. And yet the kava ceremony proceeded much as it did anywhere else. It started in the late afternoon. We would head over there after the surf blew out. We sometimes stumbled back to camp at midnight. The regulars at the kava shack were fishermen who kept their boats in a cove just west of the dunes, but other men from Yadua also came. The only woman around was the wife of a guy named Waqa. She helped prepare and serve the grog. People were curious, of course, about the camping palagis—kaivalagis, in Fiji—but they were also remarkably cool, I thought, with us, letting us explain ourselves at our own pace, or not.",

The same fossil fuels that pay for everything are the primary contributor to the changing climate that is already hitting Alaska harder than any place else in the United States. Strictly from an economic point of view, rising temperatures are likely to cause billions of dollars in damage. Alaska had just recorded its warmest spring on record. For the second consecutive year, the city of Anchorage needed to import a trainload of snow from Fairbanks for the start of the Iditarod sled dog race. Highways and building foundations constructed on permafrost were now buckling throughout the state as the ground thawed. Coastal erosion was threatening to dump villages into the rising sea; Natives who hunted on sea ice were increasingly cut off from traditional food sources that are a large part of their diet. Alaska has a state task force assigned to deal with moving coastal settlements to safer ground, an extremely expensive process. The cost of each relocation is estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars.",

But while Mrs. Manford thought all this—in fact, in the very act of thinking it—she remembered that Cardinal Ravello, Venturino’s uncle, had been mentioned as one of the probable delegates to the Roman Catholic Congress which was to meet at Baltimore that winter, and wondered whether an evening party for his Eminence could not be organized with Amalasuntha’s help; even got as far as considering the effect of torch-bearing footmen (in silk stockings) lining the Manford staircase—which was of marble, thank goodness!—and of Dexter Manford and Jim receiving the Prince of the Church on the doorstep, and walking upstairs backward carrying silver candelabra; though Pauline wasn’t sure she could persuade them to go as far as that.",

Lindbergh seriously looked as if he might die. Seeing his anguish, the airfield manager had a car brought around to the hangar’s back door. Relieved and grateful, Lindbergh leaped in and sped off, narrowly averting an unendurable encounter with twenty cheerfully adoring young women.",

Where it used to take one person to investigate you, it now takes two to four. The state spends too much. If a tree blows down, two guys from the state come with a chain saw. The state has sold the state out. To the unions. To the oil companies. The oil companies have more power than the legislature. The capital move is a lot of talk. That’s all it is, a lot of talk. What we need is not a new capital but better legislators than we have. I’d say leave the capital where it’s at. The state can’t afford it. There is no economy. They’re dreaming about all this oil money. You do more good with a letter into Juneau than going there, anyway. Up here, we have the severest winters this side of the range. This is no place for a capital. If it does move, the proper place for it is in Anchorage.”",

In recognition of all the publicity he was generating with his trip, the state of South Dakota presented him on his birthday with a cowboy outfit and horse. Named Kit, the horse was charitably described as “spirited.” It was in fact all but untamed. The president, who was by no means a horseman, was prudently kept well away from it. Instead his delighted attention was focused on his other main present?a cowboy outfit consisting of a ten-gallon hat, bright red shirt, capacious blue neckerchief, chaps, boots, and spurs. Coolidge retired to put it all on and emerged clankingly, and a little clumsily, in the full regalia a few minutes later. He looked ridiculous, but very proud, and posed happily for photographers, who could not believe their luck. “Here was one of the great comic scenes in American history,” wrote Robert Benchley in The New Yorker that week.",

The reply came quickly and was unexpectedly heartening. Ryan could build the plane in sixty days for $6,000, plus the expense of the engine, which it would install at cost. Ryan, it turned out, needed the work as much as Lindbergh needed the plane.",

    "target_paragraph": "Even the wide saltmarshes of the Essex coastline, however, cannot cope with the rising tides of climate change. Over the past century, sea levels have increased by an average of eight inches worldwide. This creep is primarily due to the thermal expansion of the world’s ocean water, warmed by an atmosphere heated by carbon emissions from aviation, industry and energy production. Under pressure from the rising tides, the saltmarshes of the Essex coastline have been in steady decline since the 1970s. At present, around a third of a square mile of saltmarsh is lost each year along the Essex coastline alone: it is anticipated that half the world’s saltmarsh area will be lost within seventy-five years. And after the saltmarshes have gone, the sea will be freer to advance inland. The pattern of land-loss occurring in Essex has its parallels across the soft coasts of Britain and Ireland, and across the world.",

I trundle crosstown with a bag emitting grey fumes and make it to the laundry just before exhaustion sets in. Next door is a butty shop where I introduce myself to the joys of a bacon butty, a white bread roll spread thick with butter and stuffed with bacon, fat on. The fat and salt content of one bacon butty is one month’s nutritional equivalent. It is my new comfort food. I munch one and read a trash magazine about what all the Royals are up to, the Scots thinking that the English have many strange sexual proclivities. I munch a second butty, read on, and tend to agree.",

Outside the country you can read inch-thick human-rights reports recording in encyclopedic detail atrocities perpetrated by the current regime, such as the arcane torture methods used on political prisoners or the estimated number of people who have died in forced-labour projects. The authorities keep a stranglehold on news that enters the country from the outside world. Government censors deal with imported magazines and newspapers by simply tearing out the bits they don’t like. I once flipped through a copy of Time magazine in a hotel lobby and found pages 63-6 missing. On the contents page, which had not been ripped out, I saw that the missing pages had contained a piece about an exiled doctor treating Burmese refugees who had fled to refugee camps in Thailand.",

The land diminishing, details slipping away, Lewis thinning from cliff to band to line to nothing. The boat, an open boat, has left the sight of known marks. In a low wind on a single bearing in an open boat, time stretches, expands. There are hours for everything, it feels. An unhurriedness seeps into you. So we sailed happily on, into the long northern dusk, telling stories as we went, up and down the hills of water, past porpoises and under kittiwakes making their cat’s cradles of flight, and at last into a darkness that seemed to lift from the sea rather than falling from the sky, starting as a black dye upon the surface and then wicking upwards into the cloudless air.",

To show me just how dangerous it could be to let high-powered craft race around in this kind of crowded environment, the park warden pootled the launch out into the middle of the lake, told me to hang on—I smiled at this: Listen, I do ninety on the motorways—then opened the throttle. Well, let me say this: Forty miles an hour in a boat is nothing like forty miles an hour on a road. We took off with a velocity that snapped me back in the seat and had me clutching on for dear life with both hands, and bounced across the water like a flat stone fired from a gun. I have seldom been so petrified. Even on a quiet morning out of season, Windermere was clogged with impediments. We shot between little islands and skittered sideways past headlands that loomed up with alarming suddenness, like frights on a fun fair ride. Imagine sharing this space with sixteen hundred other similarly dashing craft, most of them in the control of some potbellied urban halfwit with next to no experience of powered craft, plus all the floating jetsam of rowboats, kayaks, and the like, and it is a wonder that there aren’t bodies all over the water.",

For years the three hundred thousand coffee trees on the Carlota estate yielded an annual harvest worth more than one hundred thousand US dollars. A cafetale cost much less to establish and run than an ingenio; less land was needed, and fewer slaves and livestock, and simpler buildings and machinery. Thus coffee enabled a minority of creoles, some starting with few resources, to enjoy a patrician lifestyle on tastefully landscaped garden-farms providing an agreeable setting for ‘cool and shady mansions … floored with marble, furnished with rich deep-hued Indian woods’ each surrounded by ‘its village of thatched huts laid out in a perfect square’. Levi Marrero noted that cafetales were designed as ‘centres of civilisation and gracious living for their owners and invited guests’.",

Every other signpost or milestone uses a different measure and to add to the confusion English is now being replaced by Hindi, a move which has been universally acknowledged as a specially pure form of lunacy. Almost everyone who can read Hindi can also read English and most citizens can read neither – so why take it out on the unfortunate foreign traveller? It seems absurd that both scripts can’t be used, as Pakistan uses Urdu and English and as we use Gaelic and English. The Government intend soon to replace English by Hindi as India’s official language and this is bound to worsen the already formidable chaos of Indian bureaucracy. Even in the military sphere it will have a disastrous effect on communications, which by all accounts are shaky enough already – rumour has it that the proposed change delights the Chinese! And, when a large proportion of the people’s democratically elected representatives are no longer able to understand one syllable of their country’s language, proceedings in the Lok Sabha will degenerate from the present tragi-comedy to undiluted farce.",

There wasn’t a lot to see. The odd kingfisher, egret, and heron. Every so often, signs of modern Colombia: a new highway bridge, sleek and elegant in design, or, at one place, industrial power lines crossing the river, strung between giant towers that marched to the horizon. The sun was high and hot, and there was little movement along the shore. Most of the homesteads were simple thatched huts planted on the riverbanks higher than the flood line, yet as close to the water as prudence would allow, along with railed enclosures for livestock and small gardens of papayas, edible palms, and mango trees. Zebu cattle clustered in the shade of the few trees that still stood along the shore. At every landing on both sides of the river, small children slipped in and out of the water with the ease of river otters.",

We halted and waited for the traffic to clear. Then our driver disappeared, taking the ignition key. It was useless to look for him: that would only have meant groping about in the dust. We sat in the jeep and occasionally sounded the horn. Half an hour later the driver returned. His eyelashes, moustache and oiled hair were blond with dust, but his smile was wet and triumphant: he had managed to buy some vegetables. It was late afternoon when we got on to the embankment; and the sun was setting, converting the dust into clouds of pure gold, so that each person walked in a golden aura, when we arrived at the village. No terror attached to the land now, no surprise. I felt I knew it well. Yet some anxiety remained: the village held Ramachandra.",

By contrast, the wives of pillaging nomads, draped in their tattered wool, have a quickness of gait which is almost athletic. They are perhaps the only women in Africa who know how to walk with pride. The poor cloth that veils their nudity seems to be of a piece with their bronzed architecture. When the lashing wind reduces them, plastering their tunics against their muscular legs, their outlines against the coppery skies and the paleness of deadened earth are like those of lanky she-wolves. You’d say they were as old as time, convinced that they no less than the males bring back to the lair their full share of booty.",

    "target_paragraph": "His mind wandered away to the question of what May's drawing-room would look like. He knew that Mr. Welland, who was behaving \"very handsomely,\" already had his eye on a newly built house in East Thirty-ninth Street. The neighbourhood was thought remote, and the house was built in a ghastly greenish-yellow stone that the younger architects were beginning to employ as a protest against the brownstone of which the uniform hue coated New York like a cold chocolate sauce; but the plumbing was perfect. Archer would have liked to travel, to put off the housing question; but, though the Wellands approved of an extended European honeymoon (perhaps even a winter in Egypt), they were firm as to the need of a house for the returning couple. The young man felt that his fate was sealed: for the rest of his life he would go up every evening between the cast-iron railings of that greenish-yellow doorstep, and pass through a Pompeian vestibule into a hall with a wainscoting of varnished yellow wood. But beyond that his imagination could not travel. He knew the drawing-room above had a bay window, but he could not fancy how May would deal with it. She submitted cheerfully to the purple satin and yellow tuftings of the Welland drawing-room, to its sham Buhl tables and gilt vitrines full of modern Saxe. He saw no reason to suppose that she would want anything different in her own house; and his only comfort was to reflect that she would probably let him arrange his library as he pleased—which would be, of course, with \"sincere\" Eastlake furniture, and the plain new bookcases without glass doors.",

Outside some of the houses you can still see olive presses – round basins with a stone funnel leading into a lower tub for the pressed oil – standing as if ready for this year’s olive harvest.

The great Jove from Otricoli is there, the deep-bearded bull-like bust, five hundred years old in Hadrian’s time, shown in all the raging fullness of his power as Michelangelo would have done it, with his hair like the sides of a cavern and the middle of his forehead thrust out so far with the power he has over the world it is nearly bursting; no sculptor was turning out anything like that any more; divinity has dribbled away—you can see it in the room—among the emperors, everywhere, and the Emperor himself is the chief loser. Who will now be father to him? Certainly not the people; he has been turned loose among the horrors of infinite possibility, everything depends on a mere trick of disposition. And there is the terrible strength of Roman women, the good and the wicked, beginning with frigid Juno: no romance there, nothing at any rate for the anguished mind of these times to look to. It seems that this sad ponderous image of Antinous was what had to be created; it has the same dead weight of inevitability about it as Augustus; and he is undoubtedly handsome, even if the statues are not.",
