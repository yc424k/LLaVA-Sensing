Next to me, an elderly veteran in a sailor’s cap stroked his tremendous grey moustache while his small granddaughter played with his shoelaces. Behind them, a bearded man with holes in his shoes removed his baseball cap and stared solemnly at the ground.",

For she supposed that he had gone upstairs to work. Yet he looked so desolate; yet she would feel relieved when he went; yet she would see that he was better treated tomorrow; yet he was admirable with her husband; yet his manners certainly wanted improving; yet she liked his laugh—thinking this, as she came downstairs, she noticed that she could now see the moon itself through the staircase window—the yellow harvest moon—and turned, and they saw her, standing above them on the stairs.",

From the lineup at Cliffs, you could see the whole south coast of Oahu, from the Waianae Mountains in the west, beyond Honolulu and Pearl Harbor, to Koko Head, which was a sort of second-rank Diamond Head—another parched-looking crater at the water’s edge—in the east. The city filled a plain between the coast and the Ko‘olau Range, whose steep green peaks were usually buried in clouds and mist under brilliant, billowing thunderheads. The mountains sent rain clouds out to water the city, though most burned up before they reached the coast. Rainbows littered the sky. Beyond the mountains was the Windward Side, and somewhere out that way was the fabled North Shore.",

I thought I had better get out while I could. Nobody knew when a plane might come, they simply told me to wait at the airstrip and see, so I walked there, passing four farmers engaged in the consumption of ñache, a popular dish consisting of freshly drawn lamb’s blood, lemon juice and vegetables. I waited for six hours, and a plane did land, eventually, and later it took me back to Cañete and a very amused Gloria.",

    "target_paragraph": "A new style of feeling about altitude was taking hold, and the popularity of Hill’s hill was one of its many expressions. ‘What are the scenes of nature that elevate the mind in the highest degree, and produce the sublime sensation?’ asked Hugh Blair, lecturing in Edinburgh in the 1760s. ‘Not the gay landscape, the flowery field, or the flourishing city, but the hoary mountain … and the torrent falling over the rock.’ What really elevated the cultivated mind in the second half of the century was elevation. More and more people began to expose themselves to the pleasures – and the dangers – of height, and the notion of a summit as a goal in itself began to emerge. One sweltering summer afternoon in Cumbria, late in the century, Samuel Taylor Coleridge climbed to the top of a peak, and was rewarded as dusk fell with the view of an electric storm moving across the Lake District: jagged blue filaments of lightning flicking on and off, and the thunder like distant timpani. It was, he wrote exultantly when he got back down, ‘the most heart exciting of all earthly things I have beheld’. In the Alps, Mont Blanc was ascended by the Frenchmen Michel-Gabriel Paccard and Jacques Balmat on a cold day in 1786: Balmat waving his hat from the summit to the villagers of Chamonix so many miles below, and Paccard unable to write down the temperature on the summit because his ink froze before it reached the paper. The very next year an efficient young English officer called Mark Beaufoy scaled Mont Blanc with a minimum of fuss. Asked why he had done so, he replied, as though it were a truth universally acknowledged, that he ‘was moved by the desire everyone has to reach the highest places on earth’. Summit fever was catching.",

The Buckner Building, built in the 1950s as housing for a thousand enlisted military personnel, was known as “The City Under One Roof” because it included a movie theater, a bowling alley, a shooting range, a bakery, and even a jail. When the military pulled out of Whittier, in 1960, the Buckner was abandoned to Whittier’s notorious weather, which is terrible even by Alaska standards: an average of sixteen feet of snow on top of all the rain and winds that frequently top fifty miles an hour. The abandoned Buckner now looks like a set from a postapocalyptic movie, filled with graffiti and water and toxic sludge. It’s a favorite of urban explorers and the backdrop to countless hours of poorly lighted GoPro footage. Some skiers shot a slick Warren Miller?inspired movie of themselves slaloming the Buckner’s snowy stairwells and jumping out of its broken windows. When I walked past, two excited European tourists were taking pictures of each other as they slipped through a hole cut in the flimsy chain-link fence.",

I passed a classic Abaco sailing dinghy anchored in Cook's Cove and took some photographs. I passed a local man working on a boat in a driveway and we waved to each other, a great smile on his face, no doubt wondering what I was up to on my strange craft, backpack lashed down in front of me.\nThe wind and the waves increased as I rounded the point and faced the ocean, and I pressed on for deeper and hopefully calmer waters. Coral was everywhere beneath me, in front of me, behind me. This was a vast reef. I continued until I was about a mile offshore and in about 30-40 feet of water, where I dropped anchor over sand. Swells lifted and dropped my craft; current pulled the anchor rode tight.",

He stopped a few yards away, greeted us shyly, then expressed concern: he had come to warn us against the ravenous swamp-based mosquitoes. We were invited to join his fishermen’s camp, they would be keeping an anti-mosquito fire smoking all night. Thanking him effusively, Rachel explained that the niños were too tired to move on, then showed him our homeopathic insect repellent. He nodded, looking unimpressed, but said no more.

Though the court is freshly marked with white lines, long cracks have riven the asphalt surface.

All day, while the sun describes a horseshoe around the margins of the sky, the light is of the rich kind that in more southern places comes at evening, heightening walls and shadowing eaves, bringing out of things the beauty of relief. It is ten-thirty, and about time for bed. Everything burnable—and more, too—has long since gone into the fire. We burn our plastic freeze-dry bags and we burn our Swiss Miss cocoa packets. If we have cans—devilled ham, Spam—we burn them, until all hint of their contents is gone. This is in part tidiness. Everything the fire does not consume is later put into bags that will go with us all the way through and out of these tens of thousands of square miles of wilderness. Nothing is buried. Also, the burning of the cans is an expression of regard for bears. The scent of the food is scorched away. It is not necessary for us to string up our meat high in the air. What meat we have is either dried or canned, and is presumably without odor. I can think of places where all these foil-lined packets and plastic containers might be an affront to the woods, but in Alaska their advantage is great. They are a way to move through bear country without drawing bears. More accurately, I should say “without in all likelihood drawing bears.” Unopened cans of sardines have been found in the scat of grizzlies.",

When they were alongside the Kiwi boat, Donald grabbed its toe rail and began to pound on the hull with his fist, which set off a commotion of headbanging and swearing below deck.
