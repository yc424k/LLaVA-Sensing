My dad walked me there and left me, as requested. Later I found out that he didn’t leave at all, he settled himself around the corner with a packet of biscuits and a flask of hot tea. But I’d curled up in my sleeping bag with the alien scent of mud and moss in my nose, the hot thrill of fear coursing through my blood. I lasted ten minutes before I ran back home crying, my sleeping bag trailing under my arm, firm in the belief that the trees that crackled and brushed above my head were full of monsters.",

To console her, I came up with the excuse that it was probably just a reflection from the light that I was shining from the other side. I didn’t believe that and neither did she. The strength of this argument got undercut even further when I went back into the bedroom and tried to make the light shine on the other side of the house. It didn’t work.",

The engineer was employed by the General Electric Company and his job was to install the new machines for the electric works. He spoke very highly of the work that Aufschnaiter had already done. The mechanic, Nedbailoff, was a White Russian who had been wandering about Asia since the Revolution. He had finally landed in our internment camp at Dehra-Dun and in 1947 was about to be repatriated to Russia. In order to save his life he had fled to Tibet but was rearrested on the frontier. Finally it was decided to let him remain in Sikkim as he was a skilled mechanic. From there he was summoned to Lhasa to repair the machines of the old electric plant, but a few months after his arrival the armies of Red China invaded Tibet and he had to flee once more. I believe he finally ended up in Australia. His life was one continual flight. He was a natural adventurer and seemed proof against danger and hardship.",

A cold and calculating man, Philip was described by one of his own ministers as having ‘a smile that cut like a sword’. Centralising power in the hands of trusted Spanish officials, he stepped up persecution of those who questioned the authority of the Catholic Church, sending Spanish mercenaries to the Low Countries with orders to threaten, kill and torture his opponents.",

The mulberries descended in an endless shower and the air was full of a soft pattering. There were mulberries everywhere; round every tree there was a depression scooped out to receive them and the ground was swept clean with brooms for the windfalls. They were on the road too, little drifts of them like newly-fallen hail. They were on the roofs of the houses, spread out to dry in the sun, alternating with piles of apricots, a staple food to be exported out of the valley or else stored for the winter, much appreciated in a place where sugar is a luxury that is rarely available and never used in tea.",

Bennie, for instance, shared while we were walking that he would just as soon the fence was removed and the elephants were allowed to roam freely in Sabie Park. The majority of homeowners would never let this happen, of course, since it would result in landscape changes and possible damage to their homes. But the fact that he shared this information with me gave a fuller insight into Bennie and his love for the bush and its inhabitants.",

It was 7 pm and we had had nil-by-mouth since around midday at the temple, swigging two warm 7Ups and a bottle of water. Dinner would not arrive for another two hours at least and I was beginning to get nervous as Passepartout was starting to scrunch his toes, a sign of restlessness, which normally stemmed from hunger. In the last hour the train had barely stopped for more than a few minutes at each desolate station, so hopping out for a packet of Magix cashew biscuits was not on the cards. Suratgarh was the next station and a growing crowd was jostling to get off, so there was a high possibility that this was a bigger, food-stacked stop. A thud brought the train to a halt, but we stayed put and allowed the shoving on both sides of the carriage door to pass. Passepartout pushed back the torn curtain, cupped both hands against the window and peered into the murkiness. Every few metres crooked street lamps cast down spotlights that did little more than to light up the base of the lamppost, making it impossible to gauge the extent of activity on the platform.",

Seasonally it changed hands – being held in the dry season by the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese, in the wet season by the RLA and ‘General’ Vang Pao’s Hmong troops. When the shooting started the RLA Lao Lum usually and very sensibly ran away, leaving the Hmong to do the killing and be killed. Mrs Bounyong had described Xieng Khouang as ‘our victim province’ and quoted a Lao proverb: ‘When the buffalo fight the grass is flattened.’ It is hard to believe that this was once a self-sufficient region where large cattle herds thrived and French planners dreamed of colonists happily settling here to grow tea in the cool climate on the fertile soil. I passed a few dejected-looking Hmong resettlement bans and a Swedish conifer plantation covering miles of hillside. A notice on the wire fence said: REGENERATION PROJECT, 1992. If only regeneration were so easy!",

Through a glass wall taxis were visible but 3.15 seemed an inhumane hour to set out for our casa particular. Rose sought a loo but quickly returned looking non-stoical; it was too awful to pee in … For this unfortunate introduction to Cuba’s normally hygienic public lavatories Hurricane Wilma was responsible; the local water supply had been wrecked a week previously. When Rachel and Rose hastily took off for the great outdoors Zea went into a sulk because she hadn’t been invited to accompany them and Clodagh complained of (psychosomatic?) dehydration. This prompted me to explore and discover a small bar in a far corner where two Customs officers and four Immigrations officers were grumbling about our delayed flight which had required them to do overtime.

    "target_paragraph": "Europeans touched their lips or the wet ends of their cigarettes, and cooked their food or shook hands with other people afterwards without having washed. Smoking was a filthy habit, he considered, and when I remarked that many high-class Hindoos had contracted it, he agreed that this was unhappily true, but at any rate they washed. But Europeans had no care over such important matters; look, for example, at their disgusting custom of afternoon tea! The strainer they used! On account of it, though he had sometimes consented to drink tea with Europeans, he had never once accepted a second cup. What happened? When the cups were refilled, frequently without having been emptied of their dregs and rinsed with clean water, the mixture composed of new tea, dregs, and sputum would rise and touch the strainer, which would then be transferred to the next person’s cup, and so on! Ice too! This was often put into a glass from which a man had already drunk, and so carelessly that the spoon was permitted to touch the polluted liquid and then the same spoon was used again for somebody else’s glass! Or even if it did not actually touch the liquid, the falling ice might splash up drops on to it! Disgusting! He had sent ice away in these circumstances, And the custom of the ‘loving-cup’ of which he had heard, he thought unspeakably revolting; nothing could induce him to drink from another person’s glass. He spoke very forcibly; but I said that although when I considered it I understood the danger of germs and disease, it seemed to me that only by ceasing to breathe could one escape from it, and that I did not think about people’s mouths in such a way.",

We had to stop work in frustration at least once every hour so that I could go shoo boats away from our anchors. I was fighting a losing battle, and in truth I saw their point; we were now taking up an inordinate amount of space considering the number of vessels arriving on the scene. All that formerly empty space was chock-a-block with boats. In the end I just gave up, even assisting some of the latecomers with anchoring, in a form of managed retreat. I tried to position the smaller, less potentially damaging boats closest to us before bigger ones could move in, hoping to prevent an undesirable situation from becoming catastrophic. By Sunday morning there were more than two-dozen vessels of various categories and sizes anchored, some quite poorly. Squally feeder bands lashed the harbor as the Johnny-come-latelies and the engine block boys poured through the cut, adding a whole new layer of jeopardy to the already-anchored boats. The situation had become a fiasco.",

They were imbedded in an elastic body of a monotonous pallor throughout. There was no perceptible motion in the air, not a visible drop of water fell upon a leaf of the beeches, birches, and firs composing the wood on either side. The trees stood in an attitude of intentness, as if they waited longingly for a wind to come and rock them. A startling quiet overhung all surrounding things – so completely, that the crackle of the waggon-wheels was as a great noise, and small rustles, which had never obtained a hearing except by night, were distinctly individualized.",

    "target_paragraph": "This strategy had certain repercussions for Thomson, as at the time the Maasai cattle were dying in great numbers, and his hosts demanded that he use his magical powers to save them before they would let him leave. He wrote of the terrible distress of the people and he feared for his life if he was unable to save them. He resolved his predicament by repeating the tooth trick at hourly intervals, and convincing them that his magic cure would only take effect after ten days, and when he was no longer in their neighbourhood.\nBack in the 1960s, the parents of one of my friends farmed at Thomson’s Falls. They were gentle, kind people who had built their house with their own hands. It was wood panelled and parquet floored, elegant, with ancestral paintings on the walls and great log fires at night. They cared for their labour force and there was no strife. They provided medical care, housing and education for their workers and their families, and they loved their land and the country of Kenya.\nUnder the post-Independence Land Settlement Act their farm was compulsorily purchased and divided into small farms for African farmers. I think it broke their hearts, because they moved to England and were both dead within three years.\nMy friend and I went back two years later to visit the farm. It was a sad sight. The windows were papered over; charcoal fires burned on the parquet; the wood panelling had been removed and used for firewood. Goats and chickens wandered through the desolate rooms. Outside, where coffee had grown in orderly rows, there were patches of maize and bananas, but most of the land had returned to uncultivated bush. A few people waved to my friend and called out to her, but mostly they sat around with a despondent air, as if wondering what they were meant to do with their windfall. What they needed was the knowledge of how to make best use of the land; without it, they were lost.\nThomson’s Falls is now known as the slightly-difficult-to-pronounce Nyahururu. What we saw of the town centre was neat and orderly, remnants of its colonial past evident in many of the buildings. It’s the highest town in Kenya at over 7,500 feet – a favourite place for Kenyan marathon runners to train as well as being a centre for a thriving floricultural and horticultural industry. The area seemed prosperous, the people well-dressed, smiling, noisy. It looked very different from the slightly dozy little place I remembered.\nDedan owns a dairy farm there, and he had arranged to stop off briefly to meet his family outside Barclays Bank.\nBy this time we had begun to know our guides well, particularly Dedan as he was the guide we travelled with most frequently. He was the more serious of our four guides, his humour drier, his smile understated. He had a rather majestic and laid back demeanour, and if I was asked to describe him in a single word, it would be ‘cool’. On that morning, we saw another side to him, as he hugged his elegant wife Rose, their cute, shy little boy of seven, and their daughter, a stunning teenager carrying the family’s latest member, a baby boy. Dedan introduced them all, and they obligingly posed for family photos. In two days’ time, Rose’s father would be buried. I offered her my condolences, and she was quite pragmatic.\n‘My father had diabetes for 20 years,’ she said. ‘It was his time to go.’",

At the crest of the hill stood a broad green, with an obelisk and flagpole, and beside it an old cemetery. A zephyr wind teased the flag. Down the hill, across a broad valley, a series of pale green and brown hills rolled away to the horizon, like the swells of a sea. Below me the church bell tolled the hour, but otherwise there was not a sound. This was as perfect a spot as I had ever seen. I had a look at the obelisk. COMMEMORATING PEACHAM SOLDIERS 1869, it said, and had names carved in it, good New England names like Elijah W. Sargent, Lowell Sterns, Horace Rowe. There were forty-five names in all, too many surely for a mere hamlet in the hills. But then the cemetery beside the green also looked far too large for the size of the town. It covered the hillside and the grandeur of many of the monuments suggested that this had once been a place of wealth.",

He could! By Jove! who couldn’t? And you must remember he was a finished artist in that peculiar way, he was a gifted poor devil with the faculty of swift and forestalling vision. The sights it showed him had turned him into cold stone from the soles of his feet to the nape of his neck; but there was a hot dance of thoughts in his head, a dance of lame, blind, mute thoughts — a whirl of awful cripples. Didn’t I tell you he confessed himself before me as though I had the power to bind and to loose? He burrowed deep, deep, in the hope of my absolution, which would have been of no good to him. This was one of those cases which no solemn deception can palliate, where no man can help; where his very Maker seems to abandon a sinner to his own devices.",

Achnasheen has a hotel and hostel, a train station, and a major road junction. That’s it. Sadly, to get to Achnasheen, I need to follow one of the major roads (A832) to Inverness. A cycle path heads out of Kinlochewe and ends abruptly, forcing me onto the main road which has no verge. A wire guardrail has been installed so that I can’t pull over. The first four kilometres are straight up. If it weren’t for the trucks, caravans, and rental cars speeding by, this might be a lovely route. Part way up a small 0.5m tarmacked edge gives the illusion, to automotive drivers, that cyclists have sufficient room. Thus, they neither slow nor move over. A viewing point on the left provides a safety oasis. I stop and look back over Loch Maree, one of the most beautiful views in Scotland. The clouds are getting darker, the wind continues to increase. It is also blowing right in my face. The next ten kilometres are going to be a real joy. This joy is foreshadowed by a speeding construction truck that swerves to avoid a car entering the viewing point. The truck bed misses my head by a hand’s breadth. I mean to give the driver the finger except I am ready to topple over. Survival wins out.",
