Smiling, though evidently exhausted, he laid aside his rifle, took off his wide-brimmed hat, mopped his face, and shouted in Swahili, ordering somebody to bring in something. He was tall and lean and handsome in his elderly way—he was about forty—with white hair and a military mustache. In reply to the shout, an African man carried in a dead antelope to show us. It seemed Ron had just shot it. The boys asked Ron where he'd found it and where the bullet had hit it, and all that, while the African, who had been along with Ron on the outing, stood stiffly at attention. Nobody spoke to him, which suprised me a little. I hadn't exactly expected to be formally introduced to the Walkers' domestics, but this complete ignoring of a man's presence was disconcerting. Though I wasn't a newcomer to Africa, I felt something alien in this part of the country—a cool little wind, blowing between the life I'd known in the forest and that of the eastern plains. Here, without conscious intent or malice, Africa seemed to be kept out-of-doors, at far more than arm's length. The attitude of the Walkers and their friends was never put into words. I don't suppose they could have expressed it in words. It just existed.",

    "target_paragraph": "STOP BUILDING GOLF COURSES\nDespite their long-standing association with beach resorts, golf courses are an enemy of beachfront health. A single golf course uses hundreds of thousands of gallons of water every day, often in a place where water supply is a problem. Remember that when the Four Seasons’ golf course opened on Nevis, it used more water than the Caribbean island’s main town. In addition, at courses near a beach, the fertilizer used to keep the greens so very green inevitably runs off into the nearby ocean, the nitrogen and phosphorous contained in it causing algae blooms that smother coral reefs, cause coral disease, and wreak havoc on the ecosystem.\nA typical course takes up something in the range of 100 to 150 acres of land. In places where beachfront space is limited, this can seem like an egregious misuse to those who live nearby, as expressed by the jet-ski operator in Barbados who saw the golf courses as a major reason locals were being squeezed out.\nAs the Earth continues to get warmer, many popular beachfront vacation spots will become so hot that a round of golf will no longer be a comfortable proposition. This is a particular concern in places like Portugal’s Algarve, with its dozens of golf courses, and Spain’s Costa del Sol, with sixty or so. Both popular beach destinations are warming faster than the global average, exacerbating the issue.\nFor all of the above reasons, resort areas should reconsider giving coveted acreage over to golf, a sport which by many indications is already on the decline.",

Before I left Bangkok, I had spent one long day with Ead, hearing about her life as we wandered through the city one still and brilliant Sunday. Early in the morning, we had met at Wat Saket, the golden temple that stands on a hill above the city, and together we had climbed to the top and looked out across the gilded pagodas in the cloudless morning calm. Ead had gone off to pray at a shrine, put in a coin for a kind of Buddhist lottery and then returned with a smile: for the first time ever, she explained, she had received the number 1, the highest token of good fortune. Afterwards, we had joined the city’s families in the zoo, watching the bears and tapirs in the bright holiday sunshine; and that evening, we had gone together to a program of classical Thai dance. Next day, Ead came to my hotel to accompany me to the “well-wisher’s lounge” at the airport.",

Flat summits allowed views over vast spaces, the low distant hills a subdued yet glowing blue, the nearer slopes occasionally mottled with patches of cultivation beside grey huts set in circles of bare red earth. But this region is sparsely populated, because of the Terror as well as the terrain. Its hamlets still bore the marks of arson and shelling and several isolated shambas had been abandoned, the dwellings burned, the rich soil lying fallow.",

If any especially riveting disclosures emerged during the day?that, for instance, Ruth Snyder on the night of the murder had received Judd Gray in a blood-red kimono?special editions were rushed into print, as if war had been declared. For those too eager or overcome to focus on the words, the Mirror provided 160 photographs, diagrams, and other illustrations during the three weeks of the trial, the Daily News nearer 200. For a short while, one of Gray’s lawyers was one Edward Reilly, who would later gain notoriety by defending Bruno Richard Hauptmann in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping trial, but Reilly, who was a hopeless drunk, was fired or resigned at an early stage.",

Pages in silk longyi pad softly around the marble floors, and Western businessmen in smart suits stride purposefully about with copies of the International Herald Tribune tucked under their arms. Ko Ye had called me a few days earlier to tell me that the Foreign Exchange Certificate (FEC) was about to be removed from circulation. The FEC was used by the government as a method of shoring up reserves of US dollars. One FEC was equivalent to one dollar, and tourists had to exchange 300 dollars for FECs on arrival at Rangoon’s airport. Though both FEC, and dollars could be used at hotels and for large purchases, the kyat was still the most common currency in use in Burma. When Ko Ye called, I counted up my remaining FECs. I had twenty left—enough for afternoon tea at Traders, we reasoned.",

Through the blue skies were arriving fieldfares, mistle thrushes, redwings, starlings, rooks, lapwings, coming in from Siberian river deltas and Finnish forests. They arrived with the Arctic trapped in their feathers, landing in gusts on the newly ploughed fields, or flying overhead in chattering companionable groups. Raptors came too, singly or in pairs: sparrowhawks, peregrines, leaving their boreal roosts, moving south as the Arctic coasts became too cold for them, and the polar sea began to grow its bark of ice. As I walked home one day, a sparrowhawk came past me at a low glide, then rose up to the branch of a glossy laurel tree across the road. It perched there for perhaps half a minute - barred tigerish chest, airman’s helmet of grey-blue feathers, burnt-yellow eyes - then pushed off the branch and sculled out of sight, leaving the laurel tree shivering.",

The meadow was on a level with Jacob’s eyes as he lay back; gilt with buttercups, but the grass did not run like the thin green water of the graveyard grass about to overflow the tombstones, but stood juicy and thick. Looking up, backwards, he saw the legs of children deep in the grass, and the legs of cows. Munch, munch, he heard; then a short step through the grass; then again munch, munch, munch, as they tore the grass short at the roots. In front of him two white butterflies circled higher and higher round the elm tree.",

His friends may still be at his side around a table still graced by an open bottle – but they are mute and recumbent; they no longer finger their glasses, they no longer mutter about the vicissitudes of life, nor sing the joy of living it. They are silent, limp, or lachrymose, and in their midst sits Blix the Unsinkable – a monument of miserable sobriety, bleak as a lonely rock jutting from a lonely sea.

Within, they built a two-storey bomb shelter, then tried to conceal the entrance with a high stone wall. For almost a year they lived there, emerging at night to cultivate their fields, but reconnaissance planes spotted the entrance in February 1968 and, allegedly, the American military commanders suspected that here was a Pathet Lao hospital. On 8 March, at sunrise, two T-28 fighter-bombers took off from the Udon Thani airbase in Thailand to attack Tam Phiu. The defensive wall was demolished by the first rocket. The second rocket penetrated to the back of the cave before exploding. No one survived.",

I always will give you certainly always everything you want that I got in me. I take anything you want now to give me. I don’t say never Melanctha it don’t hurt me, but I certainly don’t say ever Melanctha it ought ever to be any different to me.” And the bitter tears rose up in Jeff Campbell, and they came and choked his voice to be silent, and he held himself hard to keep from breaking.",

We hadn’t brought tents as they were not suitable for such hot weather, instead, we planned to sleep under the stars on the rudimentary wooden beds already at the camp. After a quick dinner consisting of pasta, a cabbage salad and warm bottled water, we prepared to sleep on our camp beds for our first night under the stars. The heat was oppressive and I found myself dripping with perspiration as I lay motionless on my thin camp mattress. I thought about the day ahead and wondered what it would bring. I tried to feel more excited about discovering the landscapes in daylight and beginning our challenge across the Danakil Depression, but the hot and humid conditions made it difficult to relax and get comfortable, casting a pall over my initial elation at finally being here.",

They plowed through blizzards and temperatures plunging to −50ºF, camping on the ice and sometimes building igloos. He made it as far as Fort Conger, the barracks and base Greely had established at Lady Franklin Bay on northern Ellesmere Island almost twenty years before. But by the time he reached those long-abandoned dwellings, his feet were severely frostbitten, and as they thawed in the warmth of the wooden shelter, they became gangrenous. After a time, he realized his feet would not improve, and he ordered his men to lash him onto a sled and return to the Windward, two hundred miles to the south.",

In 1900, on the cusp of full-blown modernity, Joseph Conrad’s Lord Jim had to go as far as Borneo to find somewhere ‘beyond the end of telegraph cables and mail-boat lines’. Towards the end of the 1800s in both Britain and North America, calls were made (as one writer put it) ‘rigidly to economize the regions of dream’ – to conserve the world’s remaining wildernesses from the intrusions of industrial modernity. ‘The case for the safeguarding of natural beauty,’ wrote the mountaineer F. W. Bourdillon,",

    "target_paragraph": "Stimpfle had always wanted to be a diplomat; many of his father’s patients were diplomats in Washington. Thus, Stimpfle took great interest in the first stirrings of Russian-American amity that began shortly after he moved to Nome. When Lynne Cox swam the strait, Stimpfle managed to be among the party accompanying her to Big Diomede, and there, with the help of Alaskan Natives in the group, he made a lot of contacts among Russian natives, and those led to communications with Soviet mayors and other officials. Stimpfle wrote letters to people across the strait and to officials in D.C. and received some replies. A man he knew in the U.S. State Department said Stimpfle was having more luck getting through to the Russians than official U.S. channels had achieved. The “Friendship Flight” to Provideniya was largely Stimpfle’s doing. In 1988, he made a rousing speech before top management at Alaska Airlines on the subject of why they should begin flying to the Russian Far East. The airline decided he was right. (So, in a sense, it had been because of him that I had happened to move to Missoula.)",

The sail was lowered, and we wrestled it back from the wind and rolled it, so that it could be laid flat along the deck and taped down.",

Humdrum, everyday rites, practised by millions of people. Sometimes the collection was for a purpose: my father had specialised in making reed boats, and hours of my childhood had been spent on riverbanks and lake shores, constructing these craft, often to elaborate specifications - catamarans with pebbles for ballast and hazel leaves for sails, pinned in place with hawthorns or blackthorns - before setting them sailing in ones, pairs, flotillas.",

In 2012, just as the conflict began to wane, Héctor founded Hijos del Folclor, Sons of Folclor, a nonprofit that serves as a bridge between children and elders, with the goal of celebrating the maestros and ensuring that the musical traditions of tambora are sown in the hearts of the young. Héctor thinks of music as a seed, a universal language with a range of dialects. His father, a schoolteacher, loved cumbia. An older brother became a master of gaita, the instrument of the wind. Héctor and his three other brothers, by contrast, were drawn to tambora. Like so many of his generation in Colombia, Héctor yearns to move on, which for him means using music as a vehicle for peace.",
