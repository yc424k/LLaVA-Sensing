At twelve o’clock the rain began to fall, small and steady, commencing and increasing so insensibly that it was difficult to state exactly when dry weather ended or wet established itself.

I had never seen lightning in a snowstorm. Murmuring, ‘Oh, sweet Jesus, where am I?’, I climbed back into bed and buried myself deep in the covers. I don’t know what time I woke, but I dozed and tossed for perhaps an hour in the dark until it occurred to me that it never was going to get light. I got up and looked out of the window. The storm was still raging. In the police-station car park below, two squad cars marked POLITI were buried in drifts almost to their roofs.",

At once the ANC protested against a private company’s appropriation of State property ‘just before a democratic government takes over’. Said André Odendaal, ‘The intention is not to demolish it but there is a need to contextualize it’, (ANC spokespersons are woefully addicted to such jargon.)

    "target_paragraph": "With a curious physical sensation, as if she were urged forward and at the same time must hold herself back, she made her first quick decisive stroke. The brush descended. It flickered brown over the white canvas; it left a running mark. A second time she did it—a third time. And so pausing and so flickering, she attained a dancing rhythmical movement, as if the pauses were one part of the rhythm and the strokes another, and all were related; and so, lightly and swiftly pausing, striking, she scored her canvas with brown running nervous lines which had no sooner settled there than they enclosed (she felt it looming out at her) a space. Down in the hollow of one wave she saw the next wave towering higher and higher above her. For what could be more formidable than that space? Here she was again, she thought, stepping back to look at it, drawn out of gossip, out of living, out of community with people into the presence of this formidable ancient enemy of hers—this other thing, this truth, this reality, which suddenly laid hands on her, emerged stark at the back of appearances and commanded her attention. She was half unwilling, half reluctant. Why always be drawn out and haled away? Why not left in peace, to talk to Mr Carmichael on the lawn? It was an exacting form of intercourse anyhow. Other worshipful objects were content with worship; men, women, God, all let one kneel prostrate; but this form, were it only the shape of a white lamp-shade looming on a wicker table, roused one to perpetual combat, challenged one to a fight in which one was bound to be worsted. Always (it was in her nature, or in her sex, she did not know which) before she exchanged the fluidity of life for the concentration of painting she had a few moments of nakedness when she seemed like an unborn soul, a soul reft of body, hesitating on some windy pinnacle and exposed without protection to all the blasts of doubt. Why then did she do it? She looked at the canvas, lightly scored with running lines. It would be hung in the servants’ bedrooms. It would be rolled up and stuffed under a sofa. What was the good of doing it then, and she heard some voice saying she couldn’t paint, saying she couldn’t create, as if she were caught up in one of those habitual currents which after a certain time forms experience in the mind, so that one repeats words without being aware any longer who originally spoke them.",

A man on horseback in such a landscape could hardly help but dream of women, power, and war—and, indeed, many former travelers here probably had. For hours at a time the land was so empty and unmarked that it was almost possible to imagine we weren’t moving at all, and I often had trouble staying awake. Lenin himself had declared this a land “with a great future,” but what I saw resembled more the blankness of eternity. And yet it was not like other flat places I’ve seen. The Great Plains of America tend to undulate more than this steppe does, and when the Plains are flat-flat, as in southwest Texas, they’re also near-desert hardpan with only stunted brush and trees. On the Barabinsk Steppe, by contrast, stretches of real forest appeared here and there, intruding into the flatland like the paws of a giant dog asleep just the other side of the horizon.",

That champagne last night was so wonderful. You really were generous with that, you know. You made a lot of people happy.” Which is the truth, and it makes me feel good to say it. James looks at me.

With Loch Seaforth on my left and, further along, mountains on both sides with me in the valley, it is a very nice ride, ending with a screamer of a descent down into Ardhasaig and a store that sells ice cream. Here I stop for a bit, praying there is no more climbing today because I am pooped. It’s getting late, too. I zoom down the coast road, stop briefly at Tarbert, the ferry stop from Skye and a busy little burg I will pass by for now, and head on to Drinishader eight kilometres away. It is a really long eight kilometres. First is the ascent out of Tarbert. I know all you road bikers are laughing hysterically about a climb to 100 metres being an “ascent.” I challenge you to hang twenty-six kilograms of crap off your bike and see how you feel at the end of a long day.

I could not have imagined anything so perfectly beautiful, nature seemed to riot in the production of wonderful forms, as if the moist, hot-house air encouraged her in. lavish excesses. Such endless variety, such depths of green, such an impassable and altogether inextricable maze of forest trees, ferns, and lianas! There were palms, breadfruit trees, ohias, eugenias, candle-nuts of immense size, Koa (acacia) bananas, noni, bamboos, papayas,(Carica papaya) guavas, ti trees (Cordyline terminalis), tree-ferns, climbing ferns, parasitic ferns, and ferns themselves the prey of parasites of their own species. The lianas were there in profusion climbing over the highest trees, and entangling them, with stems varying in size from those as thick as a man's arm to those as slender as whipcord, binding all in an impassable network, and hanging over our heads in rich festoons or tendrils swaying in the breeze. There were trailers, i.e., (Frey-cinetia scandens) with heavy knotted stems, as thick as a frigate's stoutest hawser, coiling up to the tops of tall ohias with tufted leaves like yuccas, and crimson spikes of gaudy blossom. The shining festoons of the yam and the graceful trailers of the maile (Alyxia Olivaeformis), a sweet-scented vine, from which the natives make garlands, and glossy leaved climbers hung from tree to tree, and to brighten all, great morning glories of a heavenly blue opened a thousand blossoms to the sun, and gave a tenderer loveliness to the forest. Here trees grow and fall, and nature covers them where they lie with a new vegetation which altogether obliterates their hasty decay. It is four miles of beautiful and inextricable confusion, untrodden by human feet except on the narrow track. \"Of every tree in thif garden thou maycst freely eat,\" and no serpent or noxious thing trails its hideous form through this Eden.",

On the stage, two chaotic conga lines of men from the right and women from the left meet in a bulging knot of pushing, pleading pilgrims.

But the lot was a valuable location; Jefferson had already begun to surround it; in fact the golf links had already moved out to the country club back in 1929, selling the old course back to Jason Compson. Which was not surprising. While he was still in high school Jason had started clerking after school and on Saturdays in Uncle Ike McCaslin’s hardware store, which even then was run by a man named Earl Triplett that Uncle Ike got from somewhere, everybody supposed off a deer-stand or a Delta fishing lake, since that was where Uncle Ike spent most of his time. For which reason it was not surprising for the town to assume presently that Triplett had long since gently eliminated Uncle Ike from the business even though Uncle Ike still loafed in the store when he wasn’t hunting or fishing and without doubt Triplett still let him have his rifle and shotgun ammunition and fishing tackle at cost. Which without doubt the town assumed Jason did too when Jason had eliminated Triplett in his turn back to his deer-stand or trot-line or minnow-bucket.",

Then he smelled supper cooking somewhere—ham and hot bread and coffee—and suddenly a hot, thin, salty liquid began to run in his mouth, though when he tried to swallow, it was so painful that he sat up, swallowing the hot salt, moving his neck and head rigidly and gingerly to ease the swallowing. Then a loud trampling of feet began beyond the barred door, coming rapidly nearer, and he rose and went to it and looked through the bars into the common room where the negro victims of a thousand petty white man’s misdemeanors ate and slept together. He could see the head of the stairs; the trampling came from it and he watched a disorderly clump of heads in battered hats and caps and bodies in battered overalls and broken shoes erupt and fill the foul barren room with a subdued uproar of scuffling feet and mellow witless singsong voices—the chain gang which worked on the streets, seven or eight of them, in jail for vagrancy or razor fights or shooting dice for ten or fifteen cents, freed of their shovels and rock hammers for ten hours at least. He held to the bars and looked at them. “It—” he said. His voice made no sound at all. He put his hand to his throat and spoke again, making a dry, croaking sound. The negroes fell completely still, looking at him, their eyeballs white and still in the already fading faces. “I was all right,” he said, “until it started coming to pieces. I could have handled that dog.” He held his throat, his voice harsh and dry and croaking. “But the son of a bitch started coming to pieces on me.”",

It was a very trying day, choked in raw fog to begin with, and now drowned in cold rain. The flickering, blurred flames of gas-lamps seemed to be dissolving in a watery atmosphere. And the lofty pretensions of a mankind oppressed by the miserable indignities of the weather appeared as a colossal and hopeless vanity deserving of scorn, wonder, and compassion.",

At some level, the two worlds live parallel identities in the same space: Tibetans, for example, walk around all the holy places clockwise, while the Chinese, out of defiance or just ignorance, walk around them sometimes in the opposite direction, as if to reverse the spell. Tourists (who are mostly from China these days) ascend the Potala from the back, and then walk down through its rooms backwards, from top to bottom; Tibetans ascend along the front of its sheer white face, following the zigzagging patterns of what they call “the pilgrim’s path,” and going from room 1 to room 2 to room 3. Besides, Tibetans visit the building in the afternoon, while tourists go in the morning. The “People’s Park” that the Chinese celebrate around the Dalai Lama’s Summer Palace is still for Tibetans the Norbulingka, or “Jewel Park.”",

En route I passed the little town of Arco, which on December 20, 1951, became the first town in the world to be lit with nuclear-powered electricity, supplied by the world’s first peacetime nuclear reactor at a site ten miles south-west of town at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. The name is misleading because the so-called laboratory covers several hundred square miles of scrubby chaparral and is actually the biggest nuclear dump in the country. The highway between Arco and Idaho Falls runs for forty miles alongside the complex, but it is lined by high fences interspersed with military-style check-points. In the far distance stand large buildings where, presumably, workers in white space suits wander around in rooms that look like something out of a James Bond film.",

The carriages were smart, fitted with soft, fabric-covered chairs that faced one direction, and were divided into only two classes, both of which were air-conditioned. The Bhopal Shatabdi was currently the fastest train on the Indian Railways, averaging a speed of 93 kmph and reaching 160 kmph. At around 8:30 pm it drew into Agra Cantonment and through the window a familiar train with gold trimming gleamed from across the tracks. The Indian Maharaja-Deccan Odyssey was in the middle of its Taj Mahal daytrip and guests behind the blacked-out blinds would now be dining on roast lamb shanks and puddings drizzled with raspberry coulis. I looked down at my foil containers of chicken and dal and wondered how Benoy the butler was faring. The Bhopal Shatabdi arrived in Delhi at 10:30 pm prompt – and at precisely that moment I realised that I had finally fallen victim to Delhi Belly.",

Ahead lay low hills, one almost concealing a motel, another – much the highest – defaced by a gigantic radio mast; but it might give me some idea of the lie of the land towards Sancti Spiritus. A gravelly path climbed around slopes where coarse yellowish grass surrounded huge lumps of limestone. Half way up I saw two men in the distance, perhaps fifty yards apart, creeping slowly through low bushes, bent in two, then suddenly lying down, completely disappearing – then moments later leaping up, gesturing wildly and yelling. Drawing closer, I passed two occupied bird-cages hanging on bushes and the centavo began to drop. Sure enough, this erratic behaviour had an avian explanation; it was an attempt to capture birds without injuring them. The men hurried to the path, curious about me, then earnestly explained that singers needed to be taken for a walk at least three times a week, hung on bushes providing their favourite leaves, so that they themselves could pluck them from the twigs, and left alone for some time to commune with relatives and friends. Unless treated thus, their trilling deteriorated.",

As we moved away from the platform, the ear picker caught my eye and shot me a smug look. Passepartout sat down heavily, tearing the bag open in desperation, causing one of his two kachoris to leap out like a billiard ball and roll into the aisle. He leant forward, grabbed the runaway and wiped it on his T-shirt, offering me the other one. I declined.

I felt that it was too early for me to probe the national sentiments of my host and I avoided comment upon this ubiquitous piece of decoration. From time to time lorries passed, or smart saloon cars, and there was not one which did not earn a greeting from my driver. He lowered his window and shrieked across the intervening space as we passed, only to lean back once more and explain, ‘That was Petro, a friend,’ ‘That was my aunt’s cousin,’ ‘That is a friend of my uncle.’ It was admirable practice for my Greek. ‘You would like him,’ he never failed to add, politely including me in the exchange of courtesies. ‘He drinks like a fish. What a drinker!’ We passed a succession of topers in this fashion, quietly finishing our own bottle of ouzo in sips and discoursing vaguely in the manner of old friends. ‘You seem to know everyone,’ I said admiringly, and he accepted my compliment with a self-deprecating smile. ‘Cyprus is a small island. I think I have relations in every one of the six hundred villages. At least six hundred free drinks,’ he added meditatively.",
