A pair of hikers saw a mother and two cubs cross a meadow in New Hampshire. Every year there were half a dozen or more reports in similar vein, all by credible witnesses. In the late winter of 1994 a farmer in Vermont was walking across his property, taking some seed to a bird feeder, when he saw what appeared to be three mountain lions about seventy feet away. He stared dumbstruck for a minute or two—for mountain lions are swift, fierce creatures, and here were three of them looking at him with calm regard—then hightailed it to a phone and called a state wildlife biologist. The animals were gone by the time the biologist arrived, but he found some fresh scat, which he dutifully-bagged up and dispatched to a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Laboratory. The lab report came back that it was indeed the scat of Felis concolor, the eastern mountain lion, also variously and respectfully known as the panther, cougar, puma, and, especially in New England, catamount.",

Often, when feeling low, he took abrupt and lengthy leaves of absence?once for three months to South Africa?without explanation or farewell, leaving his subordinates to conduct the bank’s affairs as they supposed he would were he there. At other times he vanished with his mother to Switzerland or France to attend one of the many clinics run by a small but charismatic Frenchman named Emile Coue. A pharmacist in Nancy, Coue became enormously popular in the 1920s through inventing a method of self-improvement that he called autosuggestion. Coue’s system, which he explained in a slim bestselling book called Self Mastery Through Conscious Autosuggestion, was based on the simple idea of thinking of oneself in exclusively positive terms and of repeating over and over the simple mantra “Every day in every way I am getting better and better.”*",

This last performer scored the triumph of the evening. He was apparently a great favorite of the audience, a pet-of-fashion, because they would begin to laugh even before he spoke a word, and his impersonations, which seemed to the youth to derive most of their effectiveness not from true mimicry but rather from a certain twist, an exaggeration, a kind of lewdness and vulgarity which the man contrived to give to all of his impersonations, provoked storms of applause.",

He liked saying ‘Bathsheba’ as a private enjoyment instead of whistling, turned over his taste to black hair, though he had sworn by brown ever since he was a boy, isolated himself till the space he filled in the public eye was contemptibly small. Love is a possible strength in an actual weakness. Marriage transforms a distraction into a support the power of which should be, and happily often is, in direct proportion to the degree of imbecility it supplants. Oak began now to see light in this direction, and said to himself, ‘I’ll make her my wife, or upon my soul I shall be good for nothing.’ All this while he was perplexing himself as to an errand on which he might consistently visit the cottage of Bathsheba’s aunt.",

I bought a bag of buns from a handsome young man: very tall and thin with long ear-locks and an even longer beard and pale blue eyes. He spoke American English but preferred not to chat with gentiles. As the sun gained warmth I sat on a bench breakfasting and watching settler children playing on the smooth grassy slope below the synagogue – of course verboten to Palestinian children. An elaborate mobile Border Police post had just been put in place and was blocking my view of the Tombs. Navy-blue police vans raced to and fro and four pairs of conscripts patrolled the front-line. At one point a male settler and his two little sons stopped at the nearby junction, awaiting a lift to Kiryat Arba. When an elderly Palestinian appeared, wearing a long gown and keffiyeh and carrying a bucket, the father signalled to the soldiers. At once two responded, in crouching battlefield mode, yelling threateningly. The Palestinian had to move away from his bucket and stand still, the guns steadily pointing at him, until a minibus arrived ten minutes later. I asked myself – for how much longer can this viciously grotesque Occupation continue?",

They deliberately led me astray and laughed raucously when I found myself on the edge of an impassable chasm. Then they ran away, leaving me to rediscover the right path as best I could – an exasperating delay, for the snowfall had become much heavier and there is a limit to even Rachel’s self-sufficiency. Back on the valley floor I searched for my own footsteps, but already these had been obliterated. However, I could more or less remember the route and I thoroughly enjoyed the return journey. There is nothing more solitary and soothing than a walk across a deserted landscape of undefiled whiteness, where the only movement is the silent dance of the snowflakes.",

If parts were required I wanted to order them as soon as possible. If the twenty-day limit was strictly enforced and we couldn’t repair the problem before our time expired we would be faced with sailing engineless across the Pacific, or beating back to Panama or Ecuador to make repairs. I thought the downwind sail to the Marquesas would be preferable but didn’t much fancy that either, and making repairs in French Polynesia was likely to be hellishly expensive if parts were needed.",

A man, short and slim, perhaps fifty years old, his broad back in fact his rucksack. Into net pockets on either side of the rucksack were tucked two battered plastic Coca-Cola bottles, their labels long gone. They resembled boosters on a rocket pack. A pan tied on by its handle clinked against a metal buckle with every pace. It was a long-term wayfarer’s pack: messy but efficient. I fell into step alongside him, and we began talking. He was called Lewis. His manner was calm, measured. He wore wire-rimmed spectacles. He’d left home six years previously, he said, after the death of his wife. He had sold his house and decided that he would walk. So he’d walked Britain from top to toe. He’d walked across France, through Spain and over into North Africa, and he had plans for China and the Himalayas. Mostly Britain, though. He lived on the long-distance paths. He woke each day around five o’clock, whatever the time of year, and tried to cover five miles before breakfast. He kept the Coke bottles filled with water.",

The Assistant Director, a welcoming young woman named Lily, arrived just then by Land Cruiser, its driver also smartly uniformed. When I asked about AIDS prevention programmes in the schools, presumably a concern of the Department for Primary Health Care, she cheerfully replied, ‘We’ve no schools programme yet, but maybe in September we can start something.’ With an effort I concealed the effect of her remark on a mzungu aware of the urgency of the problem. ‘There’s nothing to see here,’ she continued, ‘we wait for funding from WHO. But come with me to the hospital, meet the area Medical Director and Dr Makwetta – he runs our AIDS Control Programme and gets funding from Ireland.’",

They became another cattle-centred tribe, living frugally, sustained by Calvinism at its most rigid, using the Bible (reinterpreted) to ‘prove’ their racial superiority and being literally lawless because there was no one around to administer laws. The European mindset changed radically between 1652 and 1948; the average Afrikaner mindset changed remarkably little.",

And suddenly an idea occurred to him, and he asked the woman whether, for thirty dollars, she would have the basket carried for him that very morning to the house of a lady at Paul’s Landing. She looked still more surprised, and then amused, and after they had hunted up Paul’s Landing in the telephone book, she said, yes, she guessed she could, and Vance, delighted, pulled out thirty dollars, and his pen to write the address. She pushed a card toward him, and after a moment’s perplexity he wrote: “I thank you, Cousin Lucilla,” addressed the envelope, and walked out with a lighter step. The woman was already wrapping up the dove.",

    "target_paragraph": "As we approached the mainland, the subject of the Crescent Beach Submarine Spring came up in conversation, and we determined to try to find it and maybe dive on it. This is a unique freshwater spring in the ocean and in the past, sailors used this spring to fill their water casks. The spring was in the news recently because Miami wanted access to the water.\nWe knew the spring was a few miles off Crescent Beach, and I consulted the charts to see if I could find it. Eventually we spotted brown water on the surface and assumed this was it. Eddie convinced Liam and me to dive on it, and we got in the water. Visibility was minimal as the spring seemed to be bellowing out turbid water. I quickly felt very uncomfortable. It is amazing how fast this feeling can come over and dominate the emotions. I waved at Eddie and he brought the boat over and picked me up. There was nothing to see, but at least we tried.\nWe were almost home when Eddie informed us of an approaching thunderstorm with the potential for 60 mph winds. \"Damage to shingles, siding and the potential for downed trees\" the robot voice on the weather radio said. Our friend Brian, who saw on Facebook that we were off the coast of St Augustine Beach, texted a warning that a massive and black storm was heading our way. The horizon over Florida indeed turned black, a menacing cloud, dark grey and smooth, curved across the sky from north to south, a rounded front edge bending from top to bottom, approached quickly as Eddie and Liam furled both sails. It was my watch so I put on my life vest and rain jacket, then clipped my tether to the binnacle (a steel post supporting the steering wheel and navigation instruments). We had been heading north along the coast about three miles offshore. I moved us further out until the storm hit, then pointed us into the wind and reduced speed to 2 knots so as not to run up on the beach. The wind picked up to 15 knots, then 20, then maxed out at 37 knots, complete with a blinding rain. I had to put on my reading glasses in order to see, Eddie filmed the event from the safety of the companionway, I gritted my teeth and smiled. The adventure-level was high, peaking once again as we passed the neighborhood in which I lived, our two-week sailing journey coming to a fitting and wet end.",

She was not an expert workwoman, and it had taken her many weeks to make the half-yard of narrow lace which she kept wound about the buckram back of a disintegrated copy of “The Lamp-lighter.” But there was no other way of getting any lace to trim her summer blouse, and since Ally Hawes, the poorest girl in the village, had shown herself in church with enviable transparencies about the shoulders, Charity’s hook had travelled faster. She unrolled the lace, dug the hook into a loop, and bent to the task with furrowed brows.",

    "target_paragraph": "‘Then I went shopping with one of my aunts. Or we went to see someone, or we took a message; or we did something that had to be done—the taps might be leaking. They visit the poor a good deal—old charwomen with bad legs, women who want tickets for hospitals. Or I used to walk in the park by myself. And after tea people sometimes called; or in summer we sat in the garden or played croquet; in winter I read aloud, while they worked; after dinner I played the piano and they wrote letters. If father was at home we had friends of his to dinner, and about once a month we went up to the play. Every now and then we dined out; sometimes I went to a dance in London, but that was difficult because of getting back. The people we saw were old family friends, and relations, but we didn’t see many people. There was the clergyman, Mr Pepper, and the Hunts. Father generally wanted to be quiet when he came home, because he works very hard at Hull. Also my aunts aren’t very strong. A house takes up a lot of time if you do it properly. Our servants were always bad, and so Aunt Lucy used to do a good deal in the kitchen, and Aunt Clara, I think, spent most of the morning dusting the drawing-room and going through the linen and silver. Then there were the dogs. They had to be exercised, besides being washed and brushed. Now Sandy’s dead, but Aunt Clara has a very old cockatoo that came from India. Everything in our house’, she exclaimed, ‘comes from somewhere! It’s full of old furniture, not really old, Victorian, things mother’s family had or father’s family had, which they didn’t like to get rid of, I suppose, though we’ve really no room for them. It’s rather a nice house,’ she continued, ‘except that it’s a little dingy—dull I should say.’ She called up before her eyes a vision of the drawing-room at home; it was a large oblong room, with a square window opening on the garden. Green plush chairs stood against the wall; there was a heavy carved book-case, with glass doors, and a general impression of faded sofa covers, large spaces of pale green, and baskets with pieces of woolwork dropping out of them. Photographs from old Italian masterpieces hung on the walls, and views of Venetian bridges and Swedish waterfalls which members of the family had seen years ago. There were also one or two portraits of fathers and grandmothers, and an engraving of John Stuart Mill, after the picture by Watts.* It was a room without definite character, being neither typically and openly hideous, nor strenuously artistic, nor really comfortable. Rachel roused herself from the contemplation of this familiar picture.",

In local elections in Rotterdam, his party received a stunning 35 per cent of the vote, beating the governing PvdA (Labour Party) that had run the city almost continuously since the 1930s. A few weeks later, an official report fiercely criticised the Dutch government for its actions in Srebrenica, where thousands of Muslims had been massacred by Serbian forces while supposedly under the protection of the Dutch army. Taking responsibility for the failure, Labour Party prime minister Wim Kok resigned, triggering national elections. Opinion polls showed that votes were likely to be split across many parties, but that the LPF was among the front-runners. With the Dutch government collapsing over its failure to protect Muslims, the country’s most prominent critic of Islam was in pole position to become prime minister.",

He was gnarled, twisted, and bent with a savage attack of inflammatory rheumatism. As soon as he had recovered sufficiently to travel, he departed, under Helen’s care, for Hot Springs. Almost savagely, she drove all other assistance from him, devoting every minute of the day to his care: they were gone six weeks – occasionally post-cards and letters describing a life of hotels, mineral baths, sickness and lameness, and the sport of the blooded rich, came to add new colours to Eugene’s horizon: when they returned Gant was able again to walk, the rheumatism had been boiled from his limbs, but his right hand, gnarled and stiff, was permanently crippled. He was never again able to close it, and there was something strangely chastened in his manner, a gleam of awe and terror in his eyes.",

His bulk filled it; and the rubbing of his shoulders made a small noise as of a mouse running behind the plaster of a wall. While he remained up there the house was as dumb as a grave. Then, with the same faint rubbing noise, he descended. He had to catch at the chairs and tables to regain his seat. He seized his pipe off the high mantel of the fireplace—but made no attempt to reach the tobacco—thrust it empty into the corner of his mouth, and sat down again in the same staring pose. The sun of Pedrito’s entry into Sulaco, the last sun of Señor Hirsch’s life, the first of Decoud’s solitude on the Great Isabel, passed over the Albergo d’ltalia Una on its way to the west. The tinkling drip, drip of the filter had ceased, the lamp upstairs had burnt itself out, and the night beset Giorgio Viola and his dead wife with its obscurity and silence that seemed invincible till the Capataz de Cargadores, returning from the dead, put them to flight with the splutter and flare of a match.",

Soon after I went in and sat down and started sweating, it caught fire. I wondered if the heavy smoke coming through the wood paneling on the ceiling was part of the program. Then I heard shouts, grabbed a towel, stepped outside, and saw flames leaping up and a workman in overalls prying at the roof boards with a long crowbar. Katya appeared and told me to run and jump in the lake, as one traditionally does after a banya. I ran, jumped, and nearly seized up from the shock. Baikal is quite cold.",

Just after dusk on that day, she and some 200 members of the NLD were travelling in cars and on motor-bikes down a quiet one-lane road in northern Burma. Four or five trucks followed close behind them. In the darkness, the headlights of one of the vehicles picked out the robed figure of a monk standing in the road. The monk approached Aung San Suu Kyi’s car and asked her to stop and address some villagers who had gathered to meet her. As one of her bodyguards stepped out of the car to talk to the monk, men brandishing sharpened bamboo stakes and iron bars poured out of the trucks that had been following the cavalcade. They began smashing the car windows and dragging people off motorcycles and beating them. The NLD members were unarmed and unable to defend themselves. The air was filled with cries for help, and blood splashed on to the road. Aung San Suu Kyi was last seen sitting in her car. The rear window had been shattered, and there was blood on her face and shirt.",

He comes of generations of painters, and has inherited their craftsmen’s attitude; in fact he started by decorating pen-boxes. I asked him to do a miniature of me. Certainly, he said, if I would give him a photograph to copy. That, I replied, was just what I would not do, as my purpose in giving him the commission was to see if he could draw from life. He can. He has done a portrait, and got a likeness, quite in the Persian style. But I had to design the picture, say how the head must be spaced on the paper, and decide if the background should be plain or enriched. His pupils do the backgrounds and borders from a repertory of traditional patterns.",
