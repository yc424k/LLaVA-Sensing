He hit home runs in every park in the American League and hit more on the road than at home. (The tally was 32 to 28.) He homered off thirty-three different pitchers. At least two of his home runs were the longest ever seen in the parks in which they were hit. Ruth hit a home run once every 11.8 times at bat. He had at least 6 home runs against every team in the American League. He did all this and still batted .356?and scored 158 runs, had 164 runs batted in, 138 walks, 7 stolen bases, and 14 sacrifice bunts. It would be hard to imagine a more extraordinary year.",

They paid a dollar a month to park my baby carriage in the barbershop downstairs. They hoped to move to Levittown, the prototypical suburb, then brand-new, on Long Island—a tragic idea, in retrospect. Luckily, they moved to Los Angeles instead. My mother then had three consecutive miscarriages. One may have been a stillbirth. Single pregnant Catholic girls, dispatched by some wing of the church, looked after me. When my mother got pregnant with Kevin, she went to bed for six months. This all happened during the purported golden age.",

The well and cistern have stone walls around them. From below, the wall looks immense. It’s hard to get used to, since we liked the tumbled look, too. Like the other walls, soon it will have tiny plants growing in the cracks. Because the stone is old, it already looks natural in the landscape, if a bit tall. Now comes the pleasure of planning the walkway from the driveway around the well to the stone steps, the flowers and herbs for the border, and the flowerings and shadows of small trees along the wall. First we plant a white hibiscus, which pleases us by blooming immediately.",

I stop at three hotels (the symmetry is eerily perfect) to ask for directions. Are they hotels? They seem, in this menacing dark, to have some more sinister reason for being. At each hotel—all of them have empty, threadbare, brightly lit lobbies—different directions are given me. I turn a corner to see the black shadow of a man against a gray wall, which causes my heart to stop. Someone has painted it there—which is somehow worse than if it were a real man, but at the same time a relief. I pass another dark campo—a florist shop with sprays of Easter orchids, a confectionary shop (chocolate fish)—where three girls, lost, huddle and for my benefit feign indifference.",

They were interesting inventions, it seemed, and there were men who got into them and went from place to place – why, I never knew. It seemed such a far step away from the warmth and the flow of life and the rhythm of flowing with it. It was too much outside of the things one knew – to like, or even to believe. A man was not a bird – how Arab Maina would have laughed at that – men wishing themselves into wings! It would have reminded him of a legend.",

As we were talking he noticed one of his servants, a frail elderly man, having difficulty hauling a heavy motor bicycle on to the veranda and at once rushed out to help him. When he said ‘we’ he meant all Africans, Black and White, yet moments later he could veer to condemning all Blacks as ‘bastards’. Or even ‘randy swine’ which made me wince so perceptibly that he thought it necessary to use AIDS to justify the epithet. The virus was rampant among his work-force, most of whom were migrant seasonal labourers from remote bush villages – the main source of rural infection. Ageing prostitutes whose urban business had declined, because city men reckoned teenagers were less likely to be infected, tended to move to such places as Rudewa. It is almost impossible, Will said, to convince migrant workers that the danger is real because they have not yet seen AIDS killing within their own communities.",

Not only are geopolitical pressures and interest in its natural resources escalating, but Antarctica’s incredible biodiversity is threatened by climate change. In fact, Antarctica, the world’s largest desert, which is 98 per cent covered in ice, is melting at an alarming rate. The continent is losing large chunks of ice the size of cities from its coastline as a result of global warming, and when these icebergs melt and raise sea levels, this could have catastrophic consequences for our planet. To put this into context, although predictions for the extent and rate of sea-level rise vary greatly, if all of Greenland were to melt, it would raise sea levels by six metres, but if Antarctica were to melt, this would raise the sea level by sixty-five metres. And at this current rate, a land area housing 300 million people will be flooded annually by 2050. Indeed, this cause becomes more urgent every single day.",

It was very windy, and as the boys sang ‘Happy Birthday,’ each in his own language, a wave hit them. We moved inside to an even tinier room, where I couldn’t decide if I was drunk or seasick but feared it was both, and listened to a local in a startlingly conspicuous greatcoat rambling boringly about the differences between saltwater waves and their freshwater equivalents.

In her upstairs home, she makes the famous coconut pie and sends it down to the restaurant. This warm coconut pie with vanilla ice cream and the frozen key lime pie are on my Top 5 list of best desserts in Belize.",

Born to brick and asphalt, to crowded tenements and swarming streets, stunned into sleep as children beneath the sudden slamming racket of the elevated trains, taught to fight, to menace, and to struggle in a world of savage violence and incessant din, they had had the city's qualities stamped into their flesh and movements, distilled through all their tissues, etched with the city's acid into their tongue and brain and vision. Their faces were tough and seamed, the skin thick, dry, without a hue of freshness or of colour. Their pulse beat with the furious rhythm of the city's stroke: ready in an instant with a curse, metallic clangours sounded from their twisted lips, and their hearts were filled with a dark, immense, and secret pride.",

    "target_paragraph": "Indeed it had. Yeltsin alone had the formula for victory: money, power, and the media. Soon after the Soviet Union’s demise, a small circle of bankers and industrialists who came to be known as “the oligarchs” snatched up the nation’s state properties at rock-bottom prices and became overnight billionaires. Correctly equating media with power, one of the most notorious oligarchs—Boris Berezovsky—bought a string of newspapers, radio stations, and a large interest in the most respected TV channel, ORT. Fearing they’d lose their fortunes if Communist contender Zyuganov triumphed, Berezovsky and his fellow oligarchs put up more than $100 million and instigated a fierce media war to keep their man in office. To be sure, Russian journalists didn’t need much persuading to heap praise on Yeltsin. Worried they would lose their jobs if the censorship-happy Communists returned to power, many chucked objectivity out the window. National newspapers threw their unabashed support behind the incumbent, while the same man who ran the day-to-day operations at another major TV station—NTV— simultaneously ran the Yeltsin ad campaign. (Dan Quayle, who was visiting Russia at the time, likened that to Dan Rather running an American presidential campaign.) Newspapers reminded readers of collectivization, deportation, and purges. The TV broadcast chilling documentaries of Stalin’s reign of terror. Media simplified the presidential election: It was a choice between good and evil.",

Sunlight will not come until late morning and will be gone not long thereafter: the world is dark. Two hours ago, it might have struck me as quite wonderful that the sun will never touch this tent, where its worshiper awaits its warmth, to wash; now I allow this to become a source of anger, and such foolishness annoys me all the more—have I learned nothing? Imperturbable, Tukten observes me; I glare coldly. That crazy joy, that transport, which made me feel as I ran down the mountain that I might jump out of my skin, leap free of gravity, as I do so often these days in my dreams—was that no more than pure relief at crossing the last high pass? If so, how sad it seems to celebrate the end of precious days at Crystal Mountain. Perhaps I left too soon; perhaps a great chance has been wasted; had I stayed at Shey until December, the snow leopard might have shown itself at last. These doubts fill me with despair. In worrying about the future, I despoil the present; in my escape, I leave a true freedom behind.",

It was certainly a wonderful medley of people. Gorgeous peeresses chatted affably to violent Radicals, popular preachers brushed coat-tails with eminent sceptics, a perfect bevy of bishops kept following a stout prima-donna from room to room, on the staircase stood several Royal Academicians, disguised as artists, and it was said that at one time the supper-room was absolutely crammed with geniuses.

They were perched at the extreme tip of a flat-car, their fire built upon a pile of sand, as the train jolted and swayed along. Around them, backed against them, feet sticking out between them, was a great, inconglomerate mass of sleeping, snoring humans. The rest of the train was by this time dark; this was the only patch of light and warmth in the night. As I munched my tortilla and the old woman lifted a burning coal in her fingers to light her corn-husk cigarette, wondering where her Pablo’s brigade was this night; and the girl nursed her child, crooning to it, her blue-enameled ear-rings twinkling,—we talked.",

We puttered back through the edge of town and on around the coast to the airport. Passing the end of the runway, we creaked and groaned our way down an undulating, sandy road for half a mile until we reached Iguana Beach, which wasn’t really a beach at all but more of an outcropping of rock that jutted into the breakers. It was covered by dozens of big, scaled marine iguanas. We’d seen quite a few different species of iguanas throughout the tropics, and while none of them were what anyone would call attractive, these were an order of magnitude uglier than any we had seen before. They looked like miniature, fat dragons. Their heads were encrusted with great, horny scales and a row of spines stood straight up along their backbones, from head to tail. Long, sharp claws protruded from all four feet. They were a mottled dark brown, trending to black. They were so ugly they were almost, but not quite, cute. They seemed to have no fear of man, allowing us to approach within just a few feet before first spitting streams of seawater at us and then ambling away. We got some great photos.",

At the entrance the postcard sellers were packing up their stands, but I persuaded the custodian to let me in and I slipped off behind the palace to the lakes beyond. The gardens were as beautiful as they were unexpected. I marvelled at the care with which the park had been laid out: the winding paths and the deserted potpourri pavilions; the weeping willows, the walnuts and the corianders reflected in the lake; the lilies and lotus flowers floating beneath the flying eaves of the temples – and all shrouded in mist and smelling of wet earth and falling leaves. The dying light of autumn. As I wandered along the lake shore, I suddenly realized how long I had been travelling. Summer was gone. There is no autumn in the desert; when travelling through the great expanses of sand, one’s sense of passing time and changing season becomes numbed. It was only now, when I found myself suddenly propelled halfway to winter, that I realized for how long I had been on the move. Jerusalem and Acre seemed many weeks distant; I could barely remember a time when the day did not begin by packing a rucksack and paying a hotel bill. Now the imminent prospect of reaching my destination seemed slightly alarming. To stop moving was going to be very odd. A whole segment of life was going to end. A whole new series of responsibilities loomed: getting home, getting back to Cambridge, finals.…",

Once these were the playing-fields of Tanganyika’s Eton, when Iringa’s Teacher Training College was a boys’ boarding-school (Whites only). Here I found Jason Smith, a young English VSO lecturer who removed Lear’s back wheel and inserted the new tube as effortlessly as I would break an egg. VSO workers are provided with mountain-bikes, in lieu of Pajeros, and Jason – soon to return home – insisted on giving me one of his spare tubes and an extra set of patches. The College atmosphere was unquiet that morning. A 20-year-old girl student had died during the night while trying to abort with chloroquin, quite an effective and very popular abortifacient but too often taken in excess. It can be bought without a prescription and is also the favourite choice of suicides. Moreover, trouble had erupted a few days previously between the students and a gang of local toughs – town versus gown transposed to Tanzania. The College Director was in Dar, the police refused to intervene, the situation ran out of control and, after several students had been beaten unconscious, the gang leader’s ears were cut off.",

Makes all the difference. The city was laid out as two distinct halves facing each other across the green plain of the Torrens River, with each half fully enclosed by parks. On a map, therefore, central Adelaide forms a large, plump, somewhat irregular figure-of-eight, with parks creating the figure and the two inner halves of the city filling the holes.

In other words, it is highly probable that her death had been hastened by the moral rather than the physical shock of the noise; by disappointment; by the bitter reflection that she would never survive to learn what this new scandal, evidently an interesting one, was about.",

Turning her eyes to the window, she was not reassured by what she saw there. The movement of the blind as it filled with air and blew slowly out, drawing the cord with a little trailing sound along the floor, seemed to her terrifying, as if it were the movement of an animal in the room. She shut her eyes, and the pulse in her head beat so strongly that each thump seemed to tread upon a nerve, piercing her forehead with a little stab of pain. It might not be the same headache, but she certainly had a headache. She turned from side to side, in the hope that the coolness of the sheets would cure her, and that when she next opened her eyes to look the room would be as usual. After a considerable number of vain experiments, she resolved to put the matter beyond a doubt. She got out of bed and stood upright, holding on to the brass ball at the end of the bedstead. Ice-cold at first, it soon became as hot as the palm of her hand, and as the pains in her head and body and the instability of the floor proved that it would be far more intolerable to stand and walk than to lie in bed, she got into bed again; but though the change was refreshing at first, the discomfort of bed was soon as great as the discomfort of standing up. She accepted the idea that she would have to stay in bed all day long, and as she laid her head on the pillow, relinquished the happiness of the day.",

I’m leaning on the windowsill looking out at the blue hydrangeas, big as beach balls. The attic fan pulls in the scent of tea olive and lifts the thin white curtains. I’m playing with the screen latch, which suddenly comes undone. I remember the feel of the metal hook and the eye I almost can stick my little finger into. Next, I’m climbing up on the sill and jumping out the window. I find myself in the dark backyard. I start running, feeling a quick rush of what I now know as freedom. Wet grass, glow of white camellias on the black bush, the new pine just my height. I go out to my swing in the pecan tree. I’ve just learned to pump. How high? I run around the house, all the rooms of my sleeping family, then I stand in the middle of the street I am not allowed to cross. I let myself in the back door, which never was locked, and into my room.",

I chafed at first, and then, under the hypnotising effect of routine, gradually began to find a grim satisfaction in the life. During the early part of my stay I had been struck by the contrast between the vitality of the climate and the deadness of the community. Day by day, after the December snows were over, a blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light and air on the white landscape, which gave them back in an intenser glitter. One would have supposed that such an atmosphere must quicken the emotions as well as the blood; but it seemed to produce no change except that of retarding still more the sluggish pulse of Starkfield. When I had been there a little longer, and had seen this phase of crystal clearness followed by long stretches of sunless cold; when the storms of February had pitched their white tents about the devoted village and the wild cavalry of March winds had charged down to their support; I began to understand why Starkfield emerged from its six months’ siege like a starved garrison capitulating without quarter. Twenty years earlier the means of resistance must have been far fewer, and the enemy in command of almost all the lines of access between the beleaguered villages; and, considering these things, I felt the sinister force of Harmon’s phrase: “Most of the smart ones get away.” But if that were the case, how could any combination of obstacles have hindered the flight of a man like Ethan Frome?",
