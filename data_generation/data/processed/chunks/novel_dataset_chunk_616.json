The children were chattering loudly. Some women stood by and spoke in lower tones, their arms folded. His father kept asking Master to have some kola nut, palm wine, a stool to sit down, some water, and Master kept saying no, no, no. Ugwu wanted his father to shut up.

Shortly after his chance encounter with Waterman, Stump visited me in Seattle and remarked that “John didn’t seem like he was all there. He was acting spacey and talking some crazy shit. Supposedly he was doing this big winter ascent of Denali, but he had hardly any gear with him. He was wearing a cheap one-piece snowmobile suit and wasn’t even carrying a sleeping bag. All he had in the way of food was a bunch of flour, some sugar, and a big can of Crisco.”",

His women are in many cases not women at all. The figure of Night on the sarcophagus of Giuliano de’ Medici is a long-haired man without a penis; its breasts are afterthoughts—marble blobs like prosthetics—and its forearms and thighs are so massive and muscular as to lend credence to the theory that Michelangelo had mentally prepared a sepulcher for the bones of Dante, interred in Ravenna, and, having been cheated of the poet's remains, applied his genius to the tomb of the undistinguished Giuliano instead.",

While leaning against the window I pulled out the armrests on both sides of the passenger seat. I wrapped up in my coat and settled into the seat, trying to make myself comfortable, my little green bookbag cushioning my head against the bumps and jolts of the road. I closed my eyes and dozed. From time to time the truck’s movements awakened me when we hit a patch of rough pavement. The bookbag kept my head from hitting the unforgiving window and its metal door frame while cold wind sped by on the other side of the thin pane. I slept fitfully, sometimes roused simply by the discomfort of my desperate sleeping posture. Then for a few minutes I would look out at forests that climbed into mountains interspersed with the sparkling lights of towns.",

Beyond the tumultuous red-brown torrent rise matching vertical cliffs, all split and fissured by elemental extremes and frequent earthquakes. Higher still rise the snow-peaks of Salcantay and Huamantay – invisible today. A sparse growth of spear cactus and spiny acacia merely emphasises the savage starkness. Walking so close to the roaring, swirling power of the Apurimac, we were oddly moved to think that it rises only about 100 miles to the south-west, in the fierce mountains of Chumbivilca, and (as the Amazon) flows into the Atlantic 3,800 miles away on the far side of a continent. ‘Wouldn’t it be fun to follow it all the way?’ said Rachel. I disagreed, while wiping from my bitten face the now-familiar paste of sweat, blood and dust. I’d prefer to walk 1,000 miles on the puna than ten miles at this debilitating altitude.",

Reluctantly he relived the long wet walk back to the hotel, after a tedious hour at a cinematograph show on the Boulevard. It was still raining when they withdrew from this stale spectacle, but she had obstinately refused to take a cab, had even, on the way, insisted on loitering under the dripping awnings of shop-windows and poking into draughty passages, and finally, when they had nearly reached their destination, had gone so far as to suggest that they should turn back to hunt up some show she had heard of in a theatre at the Batignolles. But at that he had somewhat irritably protested: he remembered that, for the first time, they were both rather irritable, and vaguely disposed to resist one another's suggestions. His feet were wet, and he was tired of walking, and sick of the smell of stuffy unaired theatres, and he had said he must really get back to write some letters—and so they had kept on to the hotel...",

Every ten minutes or so I climbed outside to scan the horizon, but there was only water?calm water. Climbing back down below into the shade of the cabin, I prayed for enough wind to let us get in the next day.

The Muslim call to prayer wafts down from the nearby mosque, swifts swoop for mosquitoes and a dark canoe floats past; a small girl squatting on the bow plops a paddle and nets into the water.",

In the city centre many shops were looted and I saw several vans, belonging to firms suspected of donating large amounts to the Kenya Africa National Union (KANU), being stoned or petrol-bombed. Yet to me, comparing the vibes with Northern Ireland’s, there was an element of pretence, of fun and games, about that afternoon’s lawlessness. For hours open-backed, orange-painted police lorries patrolled the streets, pursued by gangs throwing sticks and bricks and bottles and verbal abuse. Occasionally a lorry stopped and policemen swarmed over the sides to chase the youths, who fled at Olympic speeds wearing broad grins. Meanwhile Nairobi’s élite were out on their skyscraper balconies, cups of coffee or glasses of something stronger in hand, observing the fray as an entertainment. I decided then that I do not, and never will, understand the role of violence in modern Africa.",

Beside him would be the girl who last year, after a fashion at least, had been their own and who had outgrown them, escaped them like the dead summer itself, who had learned at last to walk without proclaiming the corsets beneath the dresses of silk in which she looked, not like a girl of sixteen dressed like twenty, but a woman of thirty dressed in the garments of her sixteen-year-old sister.",

Andrew swatted at them with his leading gusts like a cat toying with dazed mice. Why had they left it until so late to seek shelter? When Stubby’s bow hit the beach we piled out, removed the motor, unloaded our gear and lugged the empty dinghy a short way up the steep hill to where the sturdy palm was rooted. We tied her painter securely to the tree, emptied our gear from the buckets and used them to carry harbor water to the dinghy, filling it completely. I wanted to weigh it down so that the wind wouldn’t have a chance to pick it up and beat it to pieces. Satisfied, we repacked the buckets and carried them and the lightweight Suzuki motor toward the concrete school building that somebody in the local hierarchy had designated a shelter. We walked past two old Bahamian men nailing thin slats of pine over the windows of a fragile wooden house. Too little, too late. The sky was darkening and the gusts were coming fast and strong as we neared the Alice Town schoolhouse.",

From there they could look across a few vacant lots and, dodging Mandel’s grocery, bathe their eyes in the liquid gold of the sunset beyond the river. “I used to think heaven was down there--on summer nights!” the boy broke out, pointing toward the budding maples by the river. In his own ears his words sounded sardonic, incredibly old and embittered; but the mention of heaven could evoke no such sensations in his grandmother’s soul. “I guess heaven is wherever we love Nature and our fellow beings enough,” she said, laying her arm about his shoulder. It occurred to neither of them to remove the mower from the path, and they parted there, casually but fondly, as the habit was in Euphoria households, Vance bestriding the machine while his grandmother, arrested by it, stood gazing after him. “Only remember that, Vanny--that Love is everywhere!” she called after him. Large and full of benediction she stood between the lilac bushes and waved farewell.",

She saw her own chances of success dwindling farther into the distance, and was surprised to see how little she cared, for a curious callousness had come over her of late. Selfish ambition—selfish, because it often persists in living when all other things are dead—seemed to have died in her at last. Had she overcome it? Or was it that she had really ceased to care? She had too much to think of to be able to settle that question just now.",

Lounging at intervals along the side streets around the station were some of the most astonishingly unattractive prostitutes I had ever seen ? fifty-year-old women in mini-skirts and black fishnet stockings, with crooked lipstick and tits that grazed their kneecaps. Where on earth they get their trade from I couldn’t begin to guess. One of them gave me a ‘Hello, dearie’ look and I was nearly crushed by a bus as I faltered backwards into the street. But within a block or two things improved considerably. I had left my city map behind in the hotel so I had no idea where I was going, but it all looked inviting in every direction. It was a warm spring evening, with dusk settling cosily over the city, like a blanket around one’s shoulders, and people were out walking aimlessly and browsing in shop windows. I was pleased to find myself among them.",

The road ran through more sand desert, and lots of sand had been blown over it, which was an advantage in a way on such a rough surface. We crossed the frontier at 7.45 a.m. and whoever said the weather in Afghanistan would be ideal for cycling was wrong because even at this hour it was almost too hot. Those 150 miles I came south yesterday have made an extraordinary difference to the temperature. However, last winter remains so vivid in my mind that I am still grateful for too much sun.",

Until the acquisition of the New Territories, twenty years before, such a movement had seemed inconceivable. Nobody then lived in Kowloon, it used to be said, except soldiers and Portuguese, and almost nobody respectable went there except to have a seaside picnic. There was nothing much to do there anyway, except for men of raffish tastes. In those days Nathan Road, the main thoroughfare, had degenerated after half a mile or so into a rutted country lane, and ended altogether at Boundary Street, marked by a bamboo frontier fence. Beyond were the mysteries of China, where superstition reigned, where bandits and tigers lurked, where ne’er-do-wells went to gamble with the natives, and unspeakable things went on in opium dens.",

Two of my roommates are older gents who have been bagging all the Munros and are like two little kids in their enthusiasm for the endeavour. We laugh hysterically when they share the latest warnings, published in three newspapers and by the government no less, telling hikers not to rely on their GPS devices as the sole means of navigation in the wilderness. Amongst other hazards, hikers have been known to get so fixated on their GPS that they walked right off a cliff. In others, hikers forget that their GPS devices, having been designed for horizontal use, are sensitive only to five metre vertical variations. Surprise!",
