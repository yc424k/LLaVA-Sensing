    "target_paragraph": "Thanks to such compromises, the renovation had been completed some five years late, the final bill running to a reported €375 million, far more than originally planned. It was, nevertheless, a triumph. The museum’s reopening had been a major national event, with the soon-to-retire Queen Beatrix walking the orange carpet and crowds lining the streets to cheer the return of Rembrandt’s ‘Night Watch’ to its rightful home. The changes had received rave reviews in the local and international media, and Museumnacht was something of a coming-out party: an opportunity for the grand old dame of Dutch art to flaunt her assets to Amsterdam’s many hipsters. For me it offered a convenient way to learn more about the Golden Age, and probably resurrect my post-carnival hangover in the process.",

Even the nicest mules have definite personal opinions and Jock feels that there is something undignified about a single animal walking over one and a half miles an hour when loose, or two and a half miles when being led; and this go-slow policy causes a certain amount of frustration as my average speed is three and a half miles an hour. However, when we are with trotting donkeys he imagines the honour of muledom to be at stake, so he canters into the lead and effortlessly averages four miles per hour. This morning he sometimes went so far ahead that I could only distinguish him by the bouncing green bucket.",

On the slippery sidewalks, old women were sweeping away a light accumulation of snow using the kind of brooms that are associated in America with witches and Halloween. The air was clear and the temperature well below freezing. From various parked cars came little welcoming chirps as their owners approached to warm them up before driving. When I crossed a cloud of car exhaust, a deep olfactory memory came over me. Maybe because Russian gasoline still used lead, maybe because Russian emission laws are less stringent, the exhaust of cars in Russia smelled like no car exhaust in America has smelled since I was a child. Not quite awake, I lapsed briefly back to Cleveland, Ohio, and 1954.",

But Ralph was conscious of a distinct wish to be interrupted, and his disappointment was perceptible when he heard the creaking sound rather farther down the stairs, as if his visitor had decided to withdraw.

No other sound came from it, and lifting his hand and advancing a step or two, Clare felt the vertical surface of the wall. It seemed to be of solid stone, without joint or moulding. Carrying his fingers onward he found that what he had come in contact with was a colossal rectangular pillar; by stretching out his left hand he could feel a similar one adjoining. At an indefinite height overhead something made the black sky blacker, which had the semblance of a vast architrave uniting the pillars horizontally. They carefully entered beneath and between; the surfaces echoed their soft rustle; but they seemed to be still out of doors. The place was roofless. Tess drew her breath fearfully, and Angel, perplexed, said –",

She didn’t want to be drawn but she talked without stopping as she poured out tea and plied me with short-cake and Edinburgh Rock from an old Huntley and Palmers tin. She had come to Vienna many years ago as a lady’s companion and they had both become converts to the Catholic faith and when her employer died, my hostess had inherited the little flat where she now gave English lessons. It was plain to see, and to hear, that she was in the throes of an acute and rather disturbing religious passion that was chiefly fixed on the church of the Franciscans hard by. She took me down a floor to draw an Indian friend who was a Syrian Jacobite Christian from Travancore. Voluminous in a mauve and gold-edged sari under a black fur coat, she overflowed from a rocking chair beside a roaring stove. From her I graduated to a flat that was decorated in white suède and corduroy and many cushions. Here a burly, golden-haired and Anglophil baron in a white polo jersey allowed me to draw him and then insisted on sketches of three cheerful and ornate young men in similar jerseys but of different colours while they put on Cole Porter records and gave me a Manhattan cocktail from a huge electro-plated shaker. The baron reminisced with enjoyment about London and parties and the Chelsea Arts Ball. As for Lady Malcolm’s Servants Ball, he declared that words failed him. It was a familiar London atmosphere, and I felt a bit homesick. Beyond the next door a terrible row was going on and I wished I hadn’t rung. A figure stamped down the hall shouting at someone in the depths of the flat. Jerking the door open, he glared at me with hatred and disgust, slammed it shut, and resumed his interrupted quarrel.",

It also was a watchhouse, for a certain old Michael Bruen, who had been a smuggler in his day, and was still the father and grandfather of smugglers, lived there, and when, after nightfall, a tall schooner crept over the bay from Roughley, it was his business to hang a horn lanthorn in the southern window, that the news might travel to Dorren's Island, and from thence, by another horn lanthorn, to the village of the Rosses. But for this glimmering of messages, he had little communion with mankind, for he was very old, and had no thought for anything but for the making of his soul, at the foot of the Spanish crucifix of carved oak that hung by his chimney, or bent double over the rosary of stone beads brought to him a cargo of silks and laces out of France. One night he had watched hour after hour, because a gentle and favourable wind was blowing, and La Mere de Misericorde was much overdue; and he was about to lie down upon his heap of straw, seeing that the dawn was whitening the east, and that the schooner would not dare to round Roughley and come to an anchor after daybreak; when he saw a long line of herons flying slowly from Dorren's Island and towards the pools which lie, half choked with reeds, behind what is called the Second Rosses. He had never before seen herons flying over the sea, for they are shore-keeping birds, and partly because this had startled him out of his drowsiness, and more because the long delay of the schooner kept his cupboard empty, he took down his rusty shot-gun, of which the barrel was tied on with a piece of string, and followed them towards the pools.",

Old photographs show that this stairway obscures a high rock wall, a cliff the Romans (or Christ) might have looked upon. Here I remembered the night in 1967 when the 700-year-old Moroccan district’s 150 families were given three hours to leave their homes. In darkness, Mayor Teddy Kollek supervised army bulldozers quickly clearing the space before the Western Wall for use as an open-air synagogue (men this way, women that). Afterwards, Major-General Chaim Herzog bragged, ‘We hadn’t been authorised by anyone and we didn’t seek authorisation.’ As Jeremy Bowen noted, ‘They were worried that if they did not act decisively it would become politically impossible to knock down the houses of so many civilians’.",

Olanna was always beside him, forcing him to eat and willing him to live. His mind wandered often. He did not need the echo of pain on his side and in his buttocks and on his back to remember his ogbunigwe exploding, or High-Tech’s laughter, or the dead hate in the eyes of the girl. He could not remember her features, but the look in her eyes stayed with him, as did the tense dryness between her legs, the way he had done what he had not wanted to do. In that gray space between dreaming and daydreaming, where he controlled most of what he imagined, he saw the bar, smelled the alcohol, and heard the soldiers saying “Target Destroyer,” but it was not the bar girl that lay with her back on the floor, it was Eberechi. He woke up hating the image and hating himself. He would give himself time to atone for what he had done. Then he would go and look for Eberechi. Perhaps she and her family had gone to their village in Mbaise or perhaps they were here in Orlu somewhere. She would wait for him; she would know he would come for her. That Eberechi would wait for him, that her waiting for him was proof of his redemption, gave him comfort as he healed. It surprised him that it was possible for his body to return to what it had been and for his mind to function with permanent lucidity.",

He said no matter where he’d have been born, he’d probably have acted so. In fact, he ventured, if he’d been born into some Nazi Aryan family, maybe he’d have been swept up in Nazism like the others. Agi was outraged by that, but he stayed cool. While she shouted bitterly about wearing a yellow star as a child, being spat at and sworn at, Andreas calmly mentioned they were still here: they survived. He stated the statistics of various huge massacres, and said that the way to get past one’s pain was to look at the bigger picture, to think of the bigger group and not only one individual. He was not the only one to suffer injustice, but he was one of the lucky few to survive.",

And indeed the air itself, which was so thick and strong it could be cut with a knife, was sufficient to drug one’s senses, and he was therefore glad when, having arrived at the end of the aisle and stared for a moment at the great carcass of the ox that was turning brown as it revolved slowly before them, Heinrich suggested that they go elsewhere.",

Its façade bore a vaguely Victorian style – a portico and clock towers stood over the main entrance – but I could only guess its age. The station and its trains might well date back to the 1850s, when the first train in Egypt – and Africa – ran from here to Cairo. We pushed through a crowd of passengers and found our way inside.

We ran down the steps and along the unlit gravel road to where the main road joined it. A few bewildered-looking civilians stood dazed in the shadows of the trees. ‘Over there,’ said a man. He pointed in the direction of the Secretariat building which was about two hundred yards down the road. The street lamps were so few that we ran in and out of pools of darkness on the fringes of the unpavemented highway. We came round the last corner abreast and walked into a wall of solid yellow fog smelling strongly of something – cordite? In the vagueness figures walked about, aimlessly, with detached curiosity, uncertain whether to go or stay. They did not seem to have any more business there than we did. There was a tidy rent in the wall of the Secretariat out of which smoke poured as if from a steam engine. ‘Dust,’ said my brother grimly, ‘from under the admin­istrators’ chairs.’ But there was no time for jests; somewhere a siren began to wail in the direction of Wren’s headquarters. A lorry load of police materialized vaguely out of the yellow coils of fog. And then another series of isolated bangs and, after an interval, a deeper growl which was followed by a sudden small contortion of the still night air. ‘The whole bloody issue is going up,’ said my brother fretfully; he had been peevish all evening about the failure of his film which had run into dif­ficulties, he said, due to a sudden wave of non-co-operation which followed hard upon a visit by the parish priest to his actors. ‘Wherever I go there’s a bloody revolution.’ He had just come back from Paraguay where they had revolted under him, so to speak. A bang nearer at hand lent wings to our purpose. ‘I must get back to my animals,’ he said. ‘The owls have to be fed.’",

There was no other place I would rather be. I climbed steadily upward, gazing down at the bright green meadows below me. An hour later I heard the music that every desert traveler longs to hear. I rounded a slight bend and saw clear, cold water streaming across the trail. Parting the upslope bushes, I saw Poison Meadow Spring gushing from the rocks. It looked nothing like its name implied. I chugged as much pure spring water as I could hold. The sun was past its peak as I set out, refreshed. The sloshing of clean water in my pack made me so happy that I didn’t even mind the added weight. A few miles ahead of me lay 11,145-foot Cottonwood Pass, which, in my mind, was the true end of the desert and the beginning of the High Sierra.",

He had two books of matches, a Boy Scout knife. He started a fire with a letter from his father, and for the first eight days he did not sleep more than two hours at a time in his vigilance to keep the fire burning. The cold awakened him anyway. Water fountained from a gap in the river ice, and that is what he lived on. His hands, which he to some extent protected with parachute cloth or in the pockets of his jacket, became cut and abraded from tearing at spruce boughs. When he spread his fingers, the skin between them would split. Temperatures were probably ranging between a high of thirty below zero and a low around fifty. The parachute, as much as anything, kept him alive. It was twenty-eight feet in diameter, and he wound it around him so that he was at the center of a great cocoon. Still, he said, his back would grow cold while his face roasted, and sparks kept igniting the chute.",

I don’t know enough of the English names, much less the Italian. One plant, shaped like a little tabletop Christmas tree, is spiked all over with white flowers. I think we have wild red gladioluses. Lusty red poppies literally carpet the hillsides, their vibrancy cooled by clusters of blue irises, now withering to an ashy gray. The grass brushes my knees.

Lying with her head lifted slightly, her chin depressed like a figure lifted down from a crucifix, she watched something black and furious go roaring out of her pale body. She was bound naked on her back on a flat car moving at speed through a black tunnel, the blackness streaming in rigid threads overhead, a roar of iron wheels in her ears. The car shot bodily from the tunnel in a long upward slant, the darkness overhead now shredded with parallel attenuations of living fire, toward a crescendo like a held breath, an interval in which she would swing faintly and lazily in nothingness filled with pale, myriad points of light. Far beneath her she could hear the faint, furious uproar of the shucks.",
