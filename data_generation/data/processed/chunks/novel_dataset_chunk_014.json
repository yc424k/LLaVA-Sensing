He doesn’t look holy—he seems small, rickety and has a bit of a stoop. But his hair is cosmic. It’s a blue-black Afro—Jimi Hendrix meets the Jackson Five. Sai Baba’s eyebrows slant strangely, his double chin quivers and his nose is reminiscent of Michael Jackson’s pre-surgery (and aged sixty years). His hands are strangely compelling. Delicate, long and almost ash-blue, they flit below the orange robe like butterflies, opening to hold the palms up, pointing and twisting, keeping time with the music and writing on the wind. He sits on his throne for twenty-five minutes, then shuffles off. The crowd stays—stunned, crying, ecstatic, mesmerized and meditating. I quietly head for the exit.",

Again there was no traffic – not even horse-traffic – for hours on end. Here the dark forest alternated with miles of bright hilly pastures, yellowed by cowslips and dotted with lone spruce saplings or pale young larch groves. The numerous shepherds’ summer huts, as yet unoccupied, were mostly new-built but in the traditional style. During a pause to relish this sunny solitude I saw, approaching me up a grassy slope, what I at first mistook for a small deer. The enormous hare either didn’t notice me or disdained humans. Slowly he walked up the slope, passing so close that I could have touched him. His fur was a white–russet mix – a glorious colour, from which I deduced that Carpathian hares turn white during winter. Crossing the road, he leaped up a steep bank into the forest just as a slightly smaller version (his wife?) appeared below me and followed him, also passing within touching distance. Usually one sees hares gracefully racing, and their awkwardness when walking is unexpected. Later I saw several others, though none so close.",

He mumbled “mistakes” and “misunderstanding” and placed the blame upon President Vilbrun Sam. But it is doubtful if Polynice heard a word. He dragged him to the sidewalk and gave him three calming bullets, one for each of his murdered sons and stepped over the dead body where it lay and strode off. The crowd followed him to the home of Etienne where they stripped it first and then levelled it to its foundation. In their rage they left nothing standing that one might say “Here is the remains of the house of Etienne who betrayed and slaughtered defenseless men under his protection for the crime of difference of politics.” His heart retched terribly as he went through the city that was weeping and washing the dead as he made his way to the French legation to see if he might not speak with General Sam. The weepers and Polynice were the survivors with the mad man and Stephen Alexis and that other one who did not die.",

On the main road seedy guest-houses-cum-bars abound, this being a popular truckers’ halt. Seediness doesn’t usually put me off but these establishments were both super-seedy and unwelcoming to the mzungu. Wandering up a dusty track, through acres of failed maize, I came upon a congenial doss-house, its façade half-smothered by a scarlet flowering creeper – a lodging for locals rather than truckers. My room had a disintegrating earth floor, like a well-harrowed field, and the door was unlockable – but that didn’t matter, so amiably reassuring were the proprietress and her teenage daughter. Having chained Lear to the bed, I went in search of food.",

There is the very powerful, bottle-green engine without a neck, all back and thighs, breathing steam.

Neville reads. London crumbles. London heaves and surges. There is a bristling of chimneys and towers. There a white church; there a mast among the spires. There a canal. Now there are open spaces with asphalt paths upon which it is strange that people should now be walking. There is a hill striped with red houses. A man crosses a bridge with a dog at his heels. Now the red boy begins firing at a pheasant. The blue boy shoves him aside. “My uncle is the best shot in England. My cousin is Master of Foxhounds.” Boasting begins. And I cannot boast, for my father is a banker in Brisbane, and I speak with an Australian accent.’",

A queue of forty or so – three-quarters of them men – edged into a large room with three small rooms opening off it. No notice was taken of my arrival; evidently Jinja had had its fill of ‘interested’ foreigners. The staff – a young male doctor and two older nurses – all wore starched white coats. One small room was for testing; another for giving the news of test results; the third for dispensing to those with full-blown AIDS whatever alleviating medicines were available.",

The causeway rises steeply, and many of the steps are narrower than the sole of an ordinary shoe, so the climb with boots and full pack was slow and sometimes precarious. Halfway up, it grew too precarious, and I stood my pack against one of the giant cypress trees that tower over the narrow steps and continued up unhampered. In the little glades beside the causeway the sun shone hot, and as the climb grew still steeper the rich Shonai Plain unfolded far below me, lime green with rice. Beyond the plain, lifeless in the summer haze, the Sea of Japan lay blue and silver – the first sea I had glimpsed for fourteen days.",

    "target_paragraph": "In 2012, a story took me to Australia. It was the first time I had been there since Bryan and I ducked out of Darwin. I was writing about a China-driven mining boom, and a mining magnate named Gina Rinehart. She was the richest person in Oz, floridly right-wing, and something of a national obsession. My reporting was partly in Sydney and Melbourne but mainly in Western Australia, where the iron ore and Rinehart were. I found Australia changed, less cheeky, less “Jack’s as good as his master,” more preoccupied with its billionaires—or maybe that was only because I was writing about one of them. I looked up Sue, my old pal from Surfer’s Paradise, who was living on the coast south of Perth. She, at least, was as cheeky as ever, bless her larrikin soul. She was a besotted grandmother now, living in a house full of books on a gorgeous bay. “Bet you never thought I’d make a quid,” she said, which was true. She had somehow turned an abalone license into a comfortable life. She advised me to remember that Rinehart, who impressed me as a paranoid bully, was the only woman in the man’s world of mine bosses, which I tried to do. Sue’s son, Simon, who lived nearby, loaned me a board and wetsuit and gave me directions to a beachbreak called Boranup. It was a country spot, with cold, clear turquoise water, white sand, big, brushy hills with no buildings in sight, and a scatter of surf trucks parked on the beach. The waves were four-to-six, peaky and clean, the wind offshore. I surfed for hours, slowly figuring out the bars. My last ride felt like a reward for effort: a long, smoking overhead left all the way into the shallows.",

Jang-bu seems wary in the Lama’s presence, whereas Tukten is calm and easy and at the same time deferential; for the first time since I have known him, indoors or out, he doffs his raffish cap, revealing a monk’s tonsure of close-cropped hair. Tukten does most of the translation as we show the Lama pictures from our books and talk animatedly for several hours. Lama Tupjuk asks about Tibetan lamas in America, and I tell him about Chögyam Trungpa, Rinpoche (rinpoche, or “precious one,” signifies a high lama), of his own Karma-pa sect, who left Tibet at the age of thirteen and now teaches in Vermont and Colorado. For GS, he repeats what he had told me about the snow leopard and the argali, pointing across Black River at the slopes of Somdo.",

Extracting strands of hay and the clinging barley, we tidied Safta and Ileana’s plaits disordered by all this rough and tumble, and set off hand in hand with them for the river, István and I on tiptoe. ‘Poor feet,’ they murmured. After goodbyes we dived in and started the long swim back, turning many times to wave and call to those marvellous girls and they waved and answered until they were out of earshot and then, after a bend in the river, out of sight as well.",

A man walking on the dike spotted a cradle floating, Moses-style, in the raging flood waters, with a cat balanced precariously on top of it. He rescued the cat and then found, to his astonishment, a baby snuggled safe and dry inside the basket. Locals declared the incident to be a miracle, and rechristened the dike the kinderdijk, or ‘child’s dike’.",

When he had trekked into the Thai jungle, he told me with pleasure, the hill tribesmen, though conversant with no dialect but their own, had greeted his group by spelling out “Welcome” with the tops of Coke bottles. And in nearby Chiangmai, a quiet center of tribal handicrafts, there was little doubt that the West was coming through loud and clear. Teenage girls sat on the hoods of muscle cars on the town’s main drag, while Nike-shod jocks revved up their Yamahas. Singers in hot-pants were lip-synching Top 40 tunes on screens in the Video 83 store, and across the street from Burger House, a neon sign advertised a bowling alley. A local Christian girl invited me to dinner, then sat at the table reading Maupassant. And early one evening, as dusk began to fall, a lazy-eyed rickshaw driver gave me a guided tour of his hometown. “Ah,” he said as we bounced past a fallen hut where a wanton was combing her thick black hair, “no good place. Suzie Wong.”",

One of several campesinos descending with unloaded burros confirmed that we are still on the Camino Real. Crossing a stream – tributary of the tributary – we watered Juana and filled our container. This was a toughish uphill walk, again on sand and stones, and I was sweating hard long before starting the real climb. There was no pueblo but where the valley narrowed we passed a dozen scattered dwellings, causing alarmed small children to flee indoors. Rachel eyed the towering mountains that now enclosed us on three sides, leaving only a slice of sky above. ‘How do we get out of here?’ she asked. ‘Wait for it!’ I replied. And not long after our path swung sharply left and leaped onto a precipice. Rachel dismounted and I advised her to lean well forward during this ascent. Up we went – and up and up and up – the path narrow and dusty between drought-sick scrub and massive boulders, some the size of barns. As the air became perceptibly thinner, I feared for the ill-fed Juana. But she plodded steadily upward, never faltering. We greeted three small groups of descending campesinos who firmly snubbed us, as though gringo mothers and children driving mules to Huamachuco were a daily and rather unwelcome apparition.",

He never called her ‘mother’; in fact, neither seemed to have a name for the other, save an impersonal and rather awkward ‘You’. Moreover, the attitude of both mother and child was marked by a quality that was hard, knowing, and cynical in its conversation: when she spoke to him her tone and manner were as cold and impersonal as if the child had been a stranger or some chance acquaintance, and this manner was also touched by a quality that was resigned and somewhat mocking – with a mockery which seemed to be directed toward herself more than toward anyone, as if in the physical presence of the boy she saw the visible proof and living evidence of her folly, the bitter fruit of the days of innocence, love, and guileless belief, and as if she was conscious that a joke had been played on both her and her child. And the boy seemed to understand and accept this feeling with a sharp correspondence of feeling, almost incredible in a child. And yet they did not hate each other: their conversations were cynically wise and impersonal and yet curiously honest and respectful. She would look at him for a moment with an air of cold and casual detachment, and that faint smile of mockery when, on one of her visits home, he would come in, panting and dishevelled, a tough and impish urchin, from the street.",

It was only when you went ashore, expecting perhaps a trim and finished colonial seaport, that you realized how crude and straggly a place it was, and how infinitely remote from home. It was more like a gold-rush town than an imperial foundation. Victoria, the main settlement, extended sporadically for about a mile along the shoreline, in a muddle of the orderly and the haphazard – here a few pleasant houses or some well-organized offices, next door a wasteland or a shambles – at one corner a Baptist church or the Catholic Chapel of the Conception, at another a sleazy pub. Untidy mat-shed structures were all over the place. Camps and depots were deposited wherever the military authorities felt like it. Queen’s Road, the settlement’s main thoroughfare, was hardly more than a rough track still, in dry weather thick with dust, in wet ankle-deep in mud, and its spasmodic grandeur was interspersed with warehouses, mat-sheds and knock-about seamen’s taverns.",

Harney at first had been rather lukewarm about the trip. He declared himself ready to take her to Nettleton, but urged her not to go on the Fourth of July on account of the crowds, the probable lateness of the trains, the difficulty of her getting back before night; but her evident disappointment caused him to give way, and even to affect a faint enthusiasm for the adventure. She understood why he was not more eager: he must have seen sights beside which even a Fourth of July at Nettleton would seem tame. But she had never seen anything; and a great longing possessed her to walk the streets of a big town on a holiday, clinging to his arm and jostled by idle crowds in their best clothes. The only cloud on the prospect was the fact that the shops would be closed; but she hoped he would take her back another day, when they were open.",

It ripped the glasses off my face and they flew high and landed on the lap of a souvenir hawker below me. “Ah, signora,” he called out, looking complacently upon my distress, looking oracular, too (and also lecherous), “there must be an earthquake in Sicily.” He made this sound like an invitation to licentiousness; and there was an earthquake, in Messina, I saw it in the paper the next day.",

    "target_paragraph": "The rain had churned the snow into slush, then blasts from the mountains had frozen it into a pock-marked upheaval of rutted ice. Now, after a short warning drift, the wind was sending flakes along by the million. They blotted out the landscape, turning one side of a traveller’s body into a snowdrift, thatching his head with a crust of white and tangling his eyelashes with sticky scales. The track ran along a shelterless hog’s back and the wind seemed either to lay a hindering hand on my chest, or, suddenly changing its quarter, to kick me spinning and stumbling along the road. No village had been in sight, even before this onslaught. Scarcely a car passed. I despised lifts and I had a clear policy about them: to avoid them rigorously, that is, until walking became literally intolerable; and then, to travel no further than a day’s march would cover. (I stuck to this.) But now not a vehicle came; nothing but snowflakes and wind; until at last a dark blur materialized and a clanking something drew alongside and clattered to a halt. It turned out to be a heavy diesel truck with chains on its wheels and a load of girders. The driver opened the door and reached down a helping hand, with the words ‘Spring hinein!’ When I was beside him in the steamy cabin he said ‘Du bist ein Schneemann!’ – a snowman. So I was. We clanked on. Pointing to the flakes that clogged the windscreen as fast as the wipers wiped, he said ‘Schlimm, niet?’ Evil, what? He dug out a bottle of schnapps and I took a long swig. Travellers’ joy! ‘Wohin gehst Du?’ I told him. (I think it was somewhere about this point on the journey that I began to notice the change in this question: ‘Where are you going?’ In the north, in Low Germany, everyone had said ‘Wohin laufen Sie?’ and ‘Warum laufen Sie zu Fuss?’ – Why are you walking on foot? Recently the verb had been ‘gehen’. For ‘laufen’, in the south, means to run – probably from the same root as ‘lope’ in English. The accent, too, had been altering fast; in Swabia, the most noticeable change was the substitution of -le at the end of a noun, as a diminutive, instead of -chen; Häusle and Hundle, instead of Häuschen and Hündchen, for a little house and a small dog. I felt I was getting ahead now, both linguistically and geographically, plunging deeper and deeper into the heart of High Germany … The driver’s Du was a sign of inter-working-class mateyness that I had come across several times. It meant friendly acceptance and fellow-feeling.)",

In the tradition of Lamaism, dying lamas direct their consciousness into another body; that child is recognized as a tulku (a reincarnated lama) and brought up to continue the work. The Dalai Lama is the most famous tulku of our time. Not only is he a bodhisattva, he’s also believed to be a manifestation of the Buddha’s compassionate consciousness.

I wanted an electric orange juicer and a room ionizer and a wristwatch that would keep me in touch with my biorhythms. I wanted it all. Once in the evening I went upstairs to go to the bathroom and walked past one of the children’s bedrooms. The door was open and a bedside light was on. There were toys everywhere – on the floor, on shelves, tumbling out of a wooden trunk. It looked like Santa’s workshop. But there was nothing extraordinary about this; it was just a typical middle-class American bedroom.",
