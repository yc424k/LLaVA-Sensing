But the untouchables’ house is merely a one-roomed cottage, for they have neither livestock nor grain. Their only possessions are two battered brass cooking-pots, an earthenware mug, an axe, a bedding-roll and the garments they stand up in; this empty room makes a Tibetan tent look over-furnished. A stone fireplace about four feet in circumference lies in the middle of the mud floor, where an unintentional Yule-log some three yards long – the most spectacular I’m ever likely to enjoy! – is now burning merrily with the aid of handfuls of twigs. There is a twelve-inch opening, between the roof of stone slabs and the wall, through which the smoke escapes – and through which icy currents of air from the glaciers sweep in on the assembled company. Everyone squats around the fire while talking, cooking and eating. (Or, in the present case, writing. I’m three-quarters blind after these hours of writing by flickering firelight.)",

Weather permitting, old Bayard spent most of the day in a tilted chair in the street door, and when these patrons found him there, they went on back to the office and filled their pipes from the jars. It was a sort of unspoken convention not to take more than a pipeful at a time.

But even the talkative hostess had given them up now. One or two of them, bolder than the rest, but disseminating that same faint identical odour stood beside girls, waiting for the music to start again, but the majority of them herded near the steps, touching each other as if for mutual protection. Mr Rivers heard phrases in bad French and he joined them aware of his own fitted dinner jacket revealing his matchless linen.",

It seemed impossible that they should persist there, with great shadows wielded over them, like a menace, and gleams of brief sunshine, like a window. There was a sense of momentariness and expectation. It seemed as though some dramatic upheaval must take place, the mountains fall down into their own shadows. The valley beds were like deep graves, the sides of the mountains like the collapsing walls of a grave.

One of the largest buildings was the William Duncan Memorial Church, a replica of the original, which I’d seen in Harriman photos. The street grid was the same as Duncan had laid out. Cheery cottages of the sort you might see in a New England seaside town stood next to abandoned houses, some filled with junk to a degree that would’ve impressed the Collyer brothers. My hotel, the only one on the island, was actually half of someone’s house. I walked in the front door and was greeted by a very old man sitting in a recliner and watching Tora! Tora! Tora! In his hand he held a new-looking iPhone, which he was scrolling through searching for something; the fonts had been enlarged to the size of the letter E atop an eye chart. I asked if he knew where the manager was.",

The constant motion of the ice presented navigation difficulties as well as grave danger, but they soon developed a system. When they came to a lead, Bartlett would go in one direction along it, Kataktovik the other, both walking parallel to the open water. Whoever found a suitable place to cross first—a sturdy ice bridge or a gap narrow enough to jump across—would fire a revolver into the air; or, if the whirling snows and rising fog abated and it was clear enough, one would climb up onto an ice mound and yell and wave the other over. Often, they had to unharness the dogs and toss them across one at a time. This terrified the dogs, and sometimes they ran off and had to be coaxed back with chunks of pemmican. A few snow bridges between leads looked strong enough to cross with the sled, and they’d make a run at it, whipping and urging the dogs on. Sometimes they broke through, submerging the sled and many of the trailing dogs, and when they made it across, all their gear was soaked and the dogs would huddle and whine, their fur coated with icicles.",

They got out at this house, and the carriage waited while they walked up the path and entered a wainscoted hall and then a room full of books.

One afternoon, the sun gave a timid showing through clouds, warming the gravel bar where the rafts pulled out, shining in stripes on camp setup chores. One boat was still in the water when the sound of a plane droned overhead, a fixed-wing circling low, then lower, until a beach landing seemed imminent. Everyone looked up and a small package hurtled from the sky, landed on the beach with a bounce, and popped into the water. No one knew what it was, but delivered that way, as if chucked by the gods, it seemed important. A raft guide jumped into a boat, flipped the bowline off the mooring log, and rowed out to the package in one motion, before any one else had even thought to move. He scooped up the parcel—a brown-papered brick swathed in duct tape—and caught the tail end of the eddy that dumped him back into camp. His was a truly graceful feat, the motions instinctive and precise, but it was glossed over quickly in the excitement. The crew huddled around while Steve tore the package open. He thought maybe it was his wife, Donna, with their pilot friend. Her gift? A half-gallon container of softening chocolate ice cream. The rafter who made the quick grab became the day’s hero. The thought of that carton carried downstream by the current, never tasted, was almost unbearable. Steve tore the cardboard flaps open and Gabe brought spoons from the kitchen kit and they thoroughly chilled themselves, inhaling ice cream in the 45-degree mist.",

To a beautiful raven-haired girl soldier I whispered, ‘Will you please let me through? Promise I’ll be back by sunset!’ At once she smiled, winked and nodded. I wished we could have talked and relaxed together, but it wouldn’t do for a Balata resident to be seen fraternising with the IDF. Meanwhile, on the men’s side, a boy was being vigorously searched by two yelling soldiers. I had seen him walking ahead of me, carrying nothing. Now he was being made to stand facing a sentry-box wall with arms extended. Normally I would have lingered to observe developments but on that occasion I was in no position to annoy our military masters.",

The supplies for the listening post included state-of-the-art short distance radar, airplane transponder tracking devices, and cameras with powerful zoom lens. They had everything that a dedicated intelligence group would need to spy on their next door neighbor. The spy post could track the daily arrival of drug planes with their short distance radar. They could record the plane’s radio communications with Norman islanders. They could photograph the plane and identify the manufacturer, make and model of the plane minutes before the plane’s wheels touched the runway. With extremely accurate intelligence the listening post communicated with the FBI database, very often identifying the owner of the plane.

    "target_paragraph": "Our first day out from Sangsang passed without difficulties. Our way led through a gently rising valley. Just as the sun went down and the biting cold began to penetrate our clothing, we saw, as if we had ordered it, a black nomad tent. It was pitched in the shelter of a surrounding stone wall called a lhega. One finds these enclosures scattered over the whole of Tibet as the nomads are always moving to new pastures, and when they do, they put stone fences round their tents. The lhegas also help to protect their beasts against the cold and the attacks of wolves. As we approached the tent some dogs made for us, barking. The noise brought a nomad out of the tent. He was not very forthcoming when we asked for a night’s shelter, and flatly refused to allow us into his tent; but afterwards he brought us some dried yak’s dung with which to make a fire. We had to camp in the open, but eventually made ourselves fairly comfortable; we collected a lot of juniper branches with which we managed to keep a good fire going throughout the night.",

The hair would lose its brightness, the mouth would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old men are.

Standing at Roxanne’s side, the woman places herself next to me, hoisting her young boy onto her hip. She just about reaches my shoulder. We turn to the camera, me with my long braid coming undone, scraggles of hair catching in my mouth, and shirt already stained, she in her thin floral-print blouse and white capris, bobbed straight black hair neatly held with two red barrettes, toenails a nearly matching crimson.

Or, being wrapped, forgotten to explain? His was the cottage, furnished, and with fruit and vegetables, and only an organ to play once a week—a finnicking business compared to graves—in which, she was certain, fate had really meant her to live. And so cheap, too, compared to this one, which hadn’t a stick of furniture in it. Even if she succeeded in somehow getting round the graves, her hundred pounds the first year would have the most awful holes made in it by things like a bed, and a chair, and a kettle, and heaven knew what else besides. Why, oh why, had she been such an idiot as to forget to explain at once about that coat?",

The current also meant that we were looking only for rights, which carried one south. I was breathing too hard to argue about employment. Mark had a work schedule built around surfing, with a variety of gigs and maximum flexibility. He constantly rearranged his practice around swells, tides, and wind. So he had plenty of work, which he described as highly fulfilling, and he had no trouble paying rent. I was a convenient person to surf with partly because my schedule was flexible. His disdain for the conventionally employed was in truth mostly a joke, meant to get my goat, which he enjoyed doing.",

    "target_paragraph": "It was certainly not the moment to loiter on dunes. The horses had done enough for one day, nearly half their work having been over heavy sand, and we still had to look for our night quarters. Lauterbach had been empty; therefore, with the illuminating logic of women, I was sure Göhren would have plenty of room for us. It had not. The holidays had just begun, and the place swarmed with prudent families who had taken their rooms weeks before. Göhren is built on a very steep hill that drops straight down on to the sands. The hill is so steep that we got out, and August led or rather pulled the horses up it. Luckily the forest road we came by runs along the bottom of the hill, and when we came out of the trees and found ourselves without the least warning of stray houses or lamp-posts in the heart of Göhren, we had to climb up the road and not drive down it. Driving down it must be impossible, especially for horses which, like mine, never see a hill in their own home. When we had got safely to the top we left August and the horses to get their wind and set out to engage rooms in the hotel the guide-book says is the best. There is practically only that one street in Göhren, and it is lined with hotels and lodging-houses, and down at the bottom, between the over-arching trees, the leaden waves were dashing on the deserted sands. People were having supper. Whatever place we passed, at whatever hour during the entire tour, people were always having something. The hotel I had chosen was in a garden, and the windows evidently had lovely views over the green carpet of the level tree-tops. As I walked up to the door I pointed to the windows of the bedroom I thought must be the nicest, and told Gertrud it was the one I should take. It was a cold evening, and the bath-guests were supping indoors. There was no hall-porter or any one else whom I could ask for what I wanted, so we had to go into the restaurant, where the whole strength of the establishment was apparently concentrated. The room was crowded, and misty with the fumes of suppers. All the children of Germany seemed to be gathered in this one spot, putting knives into their artless mouths even when it was only sauce they wanted to eat, and devouring their soup with a passionate enthusiasm. I explained my wishes, grown suddenly less ardent, rather falteringly to the nearest waiter. All the children of Germany lifted their heads out of their soup-plates to listen. The waiter referred me to the head waiter. Embarrassed, I repeated my wishes, cooled down to the point where they almost cease to be wishes, to this person, and all the children of Germany sat with their knives suspended in the air and their mouths open while I did it. The head waiter told me I could have the rooms on the 15th of August—it was then the 17th of July—at which date the holidays ended and the families went home. 'Oh, thank you, thank you; that will do beautifully!' I cried, only too grateful that the families had left no corner unoccupied into which I might have felt obliged, by the lateness of the hour, to force my shrinking limbs; and hurrying to the door I could hear how all the children of Germany's heads seemed to splash back again into their soup-plates.",

There are no bridges on easement trails, but previous crews felled a tree or cobbled together a rock crossing to make some fords easier. The first creek had a log spanning the fifteen-foot channel, but de-barked and soaking wet, it was too slick to walk across upright, especially in Tufs. We shimmied across on our butts, straddling the log and mantling with our arms. Staggered along the span, we passed the power tools over our heads, trying to pivot on the seat of our Hellies without losing balance or ripping holes. Our legs gripped the log tight to counter the slip of rubber raingear against the slimy wood. Later, when I looked at the photos of this procedure, it was hard to imagine how it had ever made any sense, that lineup of people sitting two feet above the current with chainsaws hoisted in the air, raindrops sweating on the camera’s lens.",
