On the Little Isabel an old ragged palm, with a thick bulging trunk rough with spines, a very witch amongst palm trees, rustles a dismal bunch of dead leaves above the coarse sand. The Great Isabel has a spring of fresh water issuing from the overgrown side of a ravine. Resembling an emerald green wedge of land a mile long, and laid flat upon the sea, it bears two forest trees standing close together, with a wide spread of shade at the foot of their smooth trunks. A ravine extending the whole length of the island is full of bushes; and presenting a deep tangled cleft on the high side spreads itself out on the other into a shallow depression abutting on a small strip of sandy shore.",

Then I embraced Volodya and thanked him and said goodbye, and did the same with Sergei. With Sergei I even became emotional, saying what a good job he’d done even though I’d gotten angry at him sometimes. He beamed back at me, as if only happy thoughts remained. Across the lot I saw some guys disembarking from cabs at the entrance to the international building. By their bulk, their clothing, and the fact they carried fly rod cases, I guessed they were Americans. These were the first Americans I’d seen since St. Petersburg, almost seven weeks ago and more than six thousand miles away.",

To celebrate being in Free Rumania I photographed several watch-towers: most now empty. From the one occupied, two conscripts waved cheerfully – then posed with their rifles pointing towards the USSR. After all, Rumania has had a revolution, however partial or unsatisfactory. As elsewhere, most of the local garrison work on collectives; two downy-cheeked conscripts, driving a primitive wagon, obligingly reined in their horses to be photographed. Last evening, in the hotel restaurant, a young career officer shared my table and was fretting because the Front shows no inclination to treat the army seriously, rather than as an endless source of slave labour.",

Confounded, we stood at the bottom of the summit and looked at each other. This was really quite grave. We were caught between a mountain we couldn’t climb and a ledge we had no intention of trying to renegotiate.

His idea of navigation was to stop every five minutes and ask a rickshaw driver for directions, which would not only back up traffic but would lead into five or ten minutes of the standard circular Delhi/Dandi/Delhi conversation. Hovering behind Ajit, Masha and I would wait for these conversations to end so that we could get moving again, hoping to arrive to more welcoming places than the median strip of a freeway. But Ajit seemed to be stalling, buying himself some recovery time, using the scarf at his neck to mop his brow once again, puffing his lungs back to life.",

George Borrow of course, but also Laurie Lee, V. S. Pritchett, Walter Starkie, Richard Ford, Gerald Brenan and, more recently, the walking artist Hamish Fulton, who, in a campaign of chronic athleticism, has walked across Spain dozens of times, clocking up tens of thousands of miles and inscribing his routes in black marker-pen on a large-scale road atlas of the country. A former student of mine, Matt Lloyd, had walked the full Camino route one autumn, with a knapsack and a ukulele, like a latter-day Lee living off his musical skills and the hedgerows: ‘Forty days westering across the breadth of Spain,’ he wrote in a letter to me after he had returned, ‘feeling a whole country turn beneath my feet, beginning in the French mountains and ending in the Spanish sea, singing for my supper as I went.’",

Houses that had been inhabited until recently had had ceilings installed, or had been remodeled with concrete or aluminum. On the other hand, houses that had been abandoned for over ten years were run down, with listing floors and cracked pillars, beyond any hope of restoration.",

A pair of sumpter horses was tethered to a stake outside, their panniers bulbous with provisions, and three men with guns stood guard by them, peering into the accumulating gloom in an effort to keep sight of the locals, who were increasing in number with every half-hour. Occasionally, the young man whom the locals had come to see would push back the heavy canvas flap of one of the tents and take a turn about the campsite. He was swathed in the tight turban and voluminous robes of a Levantine potentate, and at his waist hung a dagger whose curve rhymed with that of his exorbitant slippers. His friend walked with him and they laughed together to see the astonished faces of their witnesses. The guards, who were already used to their employers’ quirks, said nothing, and concentrated on making sure that no prying hands slipped inside the saddle-bags of the horses.",

Was it possible Mrs. Wilkins liked her— had liked her all this time, while she had been so much disliking her herself? A queer little trickle of warmth filtered through the frozen defences of Mrs. Fisher's heart. Somebody young kissing her—somebody young wanting to kiss her. . . Very much flushed, she watched the strange creature, apparently quite unconscious she had done anything extraordinary, shaking hands with Mr. Briggs, on her husband's introducing him, and immediately embarking on the friendliest conversation with him, exactly as if she had known him all her life. What a strange creature; what a very strange creature. It was natural, she being so strange, that one should have, perhaps, misjudged her. . .",

The verandah served as a fifth room where abuelo sat in his rocking chair, dribbling slightly and wearing a vague, sad smile while his wife chopped vegetables and sifted rice, keeping one eye on the year-old who had just begun to walk and was often held up to kiss his grandfather. As the family went to and fro everyone (including the problematic Jorge) paused to greet abuelo, to check that he was sitting comfortably, to dry his chin, to ask if he needed a drink – or just to stroke his forehead.

    "target_paragraph": "Nor was Kopisch the first person to disport himself in this enchanted pool. Long ago, as the islanders will tell you, the Emperor Tiberius and the fair nymphs of his harem did the same, as is plainly proved by ancient masonry about the cave; indeed, seeing that nearly every sea-cave on Capri bears traces of old walls, all of which were built by Tiberius for bathing purposes, it may be imagined what a clean old gentleman he must have been. The only question that remains to be solved is how he entered the cavern; volumes have been written to show that the sea-level is not what it used to be in his time, and it is therefore hotly disputed whether he walked, dived, swam, drove, or flew into it. There is even something to be said for the hypothesis that he crawled on all fours. For at the back of the grotto is a mysterious and narrow passage opening westwards into the bowels of the earth, which certain sages, who have assuredly never explored it, declare to be an artificial tunnel leading from the imperial villa of Damecuta to the cool waters of the grotto. Tiberius and his frail cortege, after scrambling on their stomachs for half a league through this dank and dismal drain, certainly deserved, and perhaps needed, a bath. Let the sages decide these matters: if we do not arrive at the truth, it will not be for lack of theories. Like every one else, I have my own views on the subject, but nothing would induce me to set them down here, for I dread controversy, and there is no more fearful wild-fowl living than your historico-physico-geologist. Another of these tunnels, near at hand, is said to connect the ‘Palazzo a Mare’ with the villa of Jupiter, about three miles distant! It is nothing but an ancient cloaca, even as that at the Blue Grotto is a natural crevice supplying in former days the water which helped to erode the cavern.",

Bartlett met a host of interesting people and compelling characters at the club, doctors and writers and captains of industry and hardened Alaskan sourdoughs, but all the while, his mind was on those he’d left at Wrangel Island.",

In my mother's story of the story, Concetta, my grandmother, broke his back by forcing him to sit up when he was stricken with polio. This happened in the box room, too. It does not seem likely that my grandmother Concetta broke his back, but this fact which is not a fact has become part of the story, and if I try to move it out of the story, the story falls apart in my hands, in my mind. (This fact means: My mother hated her mother. On the day of my grandmother Concetta's funeral, my mother—whose name was Carmela, a beautiful name—wore a yellow satin dress; later that day she was matron of honor for her best friend, Alice, and she danced.) What I remember of Uncle Johnny is that he sat in a chair in front of the window looking out into the backyard. He wore red suspenders, which he allowed me to pluck. He was kind. He was buried wearing a good suit and a gold watch, two things he had never owned in life. I do not know how old he was; he could not have been more than thirty-five. On the day he died—I was five years old—my brother was born, from which I drew certain comforting conclusions.",

Karl, never content to remain idle – a talent Kevin and I were cultivating to a fine art – looked around restlessly for something to do. He gathered up Marcus’s and Kevin’s shoes, the soles of which had fallen almost completely off. He took up a hammer and nails and with great diligence pounded holes through the leather uppers and the rubber soles. He wove wire through the holes, pulling it good and tight, just like sewing. Then he looked over his own boots. The soles had been lost long before in the jungle. He went out into the village to scare up a piece of leather that he could use to make new soles. He haggled a while over the price and finally traded one of the small pocketknives that we had brought along to give to the Indians for some deerskin. He cut the skin precisely to the shape of the boot, made holes all around its edge, and finally stitched it to the boot with fishing line.",

Outside my window, three men with weed machines sound like giant bees. Domenico will be arriving tomorrow to disc the terraces, returning the chopped grasses to the soil. His tractor follows the looping turns established by oxen long ago. Cycles. Though the weed machines and the discer make shorter work, I still feel that I fall into this ancient ritual of summer. Italy is thousands of years deep and on the top layer I am standing on a small plot of land, delighted today with the wild orange lilies spotting the hillside. While I’m admiring them, an old man stops in the road and asks if I live here. He tells me he knows the land well. He pauses and looks along the stone wall, then in a quiet voice tells me his brother was shot here. Age seventeen, suspected of being a Partisan. He keeps nodding his head and I know the scene he looks at is not my rose garden, my hedge of sage and lavender. He has moved beyond me. He blows me a kiss. “Bella casa, signora.” Yesterday I found a patch of blue cornflowers around an olive tree where his brother must have fallen. Where did they come from? A seed dropped by a thrush? Will they spread next year over the crest of the terrace? Old places exist on sine waves of time and space that bend in some logarithmic motion I’m beginning to ride.",

Long-term travel isn’t about being a college student; it’s about being a student of daily life … Long-term travel doesn’t require a massive ‘bundle of cash’; it requires only that we walk through the world in a more deliberate way.”",

Serried vineyards now covered the banks of the river, climbing as high as they could find a foothold. Carefully buttressed with masonry, shelf rose on shelf in fluid and looping sweeps. Pruned to the bone, the dark vine-shoots stuck out of the snow in rows of skeleton fists which shrank to quincunxes of black commas along the snow-covered contour-lines of the vineyards as they climbed, until the steep waves of salients and re-entrants faltered at last and expired overhead among the wild bare rocks. On the mountains that overhung these flowing ledges, scarcely a peak had been left without a castle. At Stolzenfels, where I stopped for something to eat, a neo-Gothic keep climbed into the sky on a staircase of vineyards, and another castle echoed it from Oberlahnstein on the other shore. Then another rose up, and another, and yet another: ruin on ruin, and vineyard on vineyard … They seemed to revolve as they moved downstream, and then to impend. Finally a loop of the river would carry them away until the dimness of the evening blurred them all and the lights of the shore began to twinkle among their darkening reflections. Soon after dark, I halted at Boppard. It was lodged a little way up the mountainside so that next morning a fresh length of the river uncoiled southward while the Sunday morning bells were answering our own chimes upstream and down.",

The population of some fifteen thousand has since colonial times stayed almost eerily constant. To the west, a sparsely forested floodplain reaches to the river. The Magdalena flows. The clouds gather, and every afternoon the wind blows from both the central and the eastern cordilleras, spinning like a vortex. Spirits abound, and since the time of Francisco José de Caldas, who in 1770 convened a great gathering of herbalists and curanderos from all of the Alto Magdalena, the town has been known as a center of sorcery and white magic, famous for its brujas and healing arts. It is a place in balance with all the energies of existence, with fertile soils and bountiful waters, mountains and valleys, moonlight and stars.",

I had to choose a campsite quickly and get a fire going while there was still daylight. I chose a level area, cleared away the damp leaves, and replaced them with fresh, dry ones. I took out one of the mosquito nets and tied it down to four tree stumps with vines, so that it formed a long, narrow, translucent green pup tent. I looked for dry wood but didn’t find any. I gathered a few branches and tried to break them and strip them away to the dry inner parts. It was impossible without a machete. My attempts at lighting a fire only wasted the fluid in the lighter and brought me to a state of despair. Reluctantly I crawled under the tent of mosquito netting and wrapped myself in the remaining net and red poncho. I took my arsenal out of the pack: the flashlight, the lighter, the mosquito repellent, and the snakebite serum. To these I added a tin can and a spoon. If any wild animal should approach me, I would make a horrendous clatter and scare it away. So I thought.",
