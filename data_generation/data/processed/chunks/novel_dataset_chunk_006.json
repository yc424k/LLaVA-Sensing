As we descended the stairs a train could be heard approaching – whereupon everyone sprinted desperately down to the platform and leaped on board as though devils were following. Only one solitary figure was left behind – Lobsang, who crossed the platform at his usual pace and sedately entered the train a moment before the doors closed. Sitting opposite me he remarked with a slight smile, ‘It is not necessary to get worried and run to these trains. I have seen that if one goes away another comes very soon.’",

He moved with a grace and power that were incomparable. Whenever one saw him walking along the street, one got an overwhelming impression that he was weaving and “picking his holes” behind the interference, and that he was just about to shake loose around the ends in a touchdown gallop. He moved by a kind of superb pacing rhythm that suggested nothing on earth so much as a race horse coming from the paddocks down to the starting line. He paced upon the balls of his feet, as lightly and delicately as a cat, and there was always the suggestion that his powerful arms and hands were delicately pawing the air, a gesture not pronounced but unmistakable, and, like his walk, his carriage, everything about him, suggested a tremendous catlike power and speed—pent, trembling, geared for action, ready to be unleashed, like the leap of a panther.",

I waved, and one of the girls waved back, a brief encounter between representatives of two different worlds. I continued paddling against a strong wind that was trying to blow me to my right towards a secluded beach where a couple and a small powerboat dotted the otherwise empty sand. Palm trees danced in the wind, clear water and a rocky bottom passed underneath as I stroked the water with my kayak paddle while sitting on my 12-foot surfboard.\nWhen I got back on Monkey’s Uncle I pulled out Liam’s camera and started taking pictures of them as they whizzed by on their kiteboards.",

Ben in particular, had moved from mild amusement at Shadrach's incompetence, to loud complaints at his driving style, shouted abuse at every missed animal sighting, and promises to seek a refund of the cost of the game drives. Most worrying for Shadrach was the fact that it was highly unlikely he'd be receiving any tips from these clients – most safari guides receive a small basic salary, with the majority of their income coming from gratuities from satisfied customers.",

Vance had read and studied, new avenues of knowledge had opened to him, linking together many unrelated facts, and Miss Lorburn’s library was now less interesting in itself than because of the sad woman who had lived there. Sad, but not shrunken. He looked up at her, and she looked down with her large full-orbed eyes, the eyes of one who has renounced but not repined. . . . What a subject, if he could do it! He dropped again into the highbacked armchair where he had sat on that first day. “This is the Past--if only I could get back into it. . . .” She must have been lovely when she was young, with a sharp austere loveliness like Halo’s; her long thin hands full of gifts for someone, or else stretched out empty to receive. No one, apparently, had wanted to give her anything, or to receive what she offered; yet instead of withering she had ripened. Her books, and some inner source of life, had kept her warm--he wondered how? And suddenly a queer idea came to him: the idea that Halo Tarrant knew. Was the fancy suggested by some resemblance in their features, or a likeness in expression, something about the eyes and hands? Halo had those same hands, long, like her face, and opening wide when she held them out to you, as if ready to receive or give, while her eyes questioned which it was to be. Yet Halo was married, had presumably fulfilled her destiny. . . . And so, perhaps, had the other woman in her different way. That was what explained the likeness--or else made it all the more obscure. . . . The afternoon shadows wheeled unnoticed across the lawn. Vance continued to sit motionless, letting the secret forces move within him. Whenever he could surrender to his creative fervour it always ended by carrying him to the mysterious point where effort ceased, and he seemed just to have to hold his breath and watch.",

After that, for a while, everything was merged in her brain in swimming circles of heat and blinding alternations of light and darkness. All the world has to show seemed to pass before her in a chaos of palms and minarets, charging cavalry regiments, roaring lions, comic policemen and scowling murderers; and the crowd around her, the hundreds of hot sallow candy-munching faces, young, old, middle-aged, but all kindled with the same contagious excitement, became part of the spectacle, and danced on the screen with the rest.",

Quietly pushing aside the mosquito net, I rise from the bed and tiptoe through the dark to the washroom, which has a tiny window high under the thatched roof. All I can see in the window is a large eye, like that of a whale, blinking at me through the pale morning light.\nOne step at a time, I ease closer to the window until I am just below it. Then, standing on an old tea-crate cupboard, I pull myself up to the sill and see Survivor’s eye only a foot away. Long, straight lashes partially cover his pupil as he looks toward the ground searching for a fruit. Then, as he picks one up with his trunk and puts it into his mouth, he lifts his lashes and looks directly at me. He shows neither surprise nor concern, and I stare into the gray forever of an elephant’s eye.\nSuch an incident may take place in other areas of Africa, but not in the northern Luangwa Valley of Zambia. In the last fifteen years, one hundred thousand elephants have been slaughtered by poachers in this valley. Here elephants usually run at the first sight or scent of man. I want to remember always the deep furrows of folded skin above Survivor’s lashes, his moist and glistening eye, which now reflects the sunrise. Surely this will never happen to me again; the memory must last a lifetime. And I must never forget the way I feel, for at this moment I can see everything so clearly.",

Intrepid friends went first, and I watched their example. It was not straightforward. Something went awry and they had to reschedule for later in the month. But it gave me hope. More importantly, they shared their first-hand knowledge. These were very organised people who provided precise details, which was more than I could get from anyone in an official capacity. That was no one’s fault. Information was like a kaleidoscope, changing with nearly every move.",

They steamed immediately toward Point Barrow but ran into dense sea ice en route, off Icy Cape, and their progress was slowed considerably.* “The ice through which we were making our toilsome way was not so heavy as it was closely packed,” recorded Bartlett with some frustration. The wizened ice master wished he could be up in the crow’s nest helping to navigate, but he was relegated to the role of a passenger and could only stand on the deck and watch their slow progress through the mosaic of thick pack ice. Sometimes leads opened, and Cochran sped for them. “It was great to see the good old Bear charging and recharging, twisting and turning,” Bartlett wrote. “Heavy in the water she was able, with her great momentum, to smash off points and corners of the ice and make her way through it.” But as the dense pack encroached from the north, Bartlett could not help remembering the Karluk’s great difficulties with the same pack almost exactly a year ago, and he feared that the window for getting to Wrangel Island was about to slam shut.",

The doors were, in fact, quite solid; however, I was to learn that in the south of Italy the most important feature of any living quarters or workspace wasn’t the security, but the southern exposure. Between the nonexistent or inadequate heating systems and poorly insulated windows, that balmy, 50-degree, outdoor winter temperature wasn’t all that mild when experienced indoors.",

In Tsim Sha Tsui stands Signal Hill, from which until 1933 the dropping of a hollow copper ball from a mast signalled one p.m. to the ships lying in the harbour – a token of order and efficiency in an up-to-date imperial seaport. Today the signal-station is still there, with its white lattice mast beside it, but all is hemmed in and landlocked. The hillock has a quaint backwater air. Chinese boys birdwatch in the woods that have grown up around its flanks, Chinese lovers dally in the little pavilion near its summit. There are two guns on a rampart, posted to command the harbour long ago: but one of them now finds itself aligned upon the New World shopping centre, and the other, if fired, would demolish the lobby of the Regent Hotel (five-star de luxe).",

We dined on hot cheese bread, stewed eggplant, and a bottle of red wine as a unibrowed lady in a fringed floral shawl strolled about, serenading the chain-smoking, pistol-toting patrons. Then we walked to Red Square, a sight that always quieted me. St. Basil’s Cathedral anchored one end as a towering symbol of the nation’s spirituality—a structure so majestic, Ivan the Terrible gouged out the eyes of its architect so he couldn’t duplicate its beauty. The Kremlin marked the spot where Czars issued edicts, Stalin orchestrated his reign of terror, the Congress of People’s Deputies dissolved their Soviet Empire, and Yeltsin hyped his New Democracy. Across the way loomed GUM, the shopping arcade that had yielded little more than orange polka-dotted teapots and the same-size shoes in Former Times but now sold Nike, Estée Lauder, and Christian Dior. And squatting amid it all was the nation’s last remaining bastion of Soviet chic: Lenin’s tomb. Would he be there when I returned—or would he have been placed by his mother’s side, as per his dying wish?",

We bought our supplies. We traded books at the book exchange. We wandered the city knowing that it would be the last civilization that we would see for several months.

She steps her finger down the lines of the form, and at first hesitating, then with encouragement, I guess at what needs to be filled in, pointing it out to her on my passport. In short order, she’s finished. A few slams of her inked stamp and we’re cleared to go. A further cursory survey of the tightly packed goods in our trunk follows. Fifty yards separate us from Estonia. I am so eager to be there, that as I return to the car I unconsciously tilt forward, like a runner chesting toward the finish line. Bernard puts Roxanne in first gear, and we creep away from Russia to where Estonian guards lean against their barriers smoking. They are nonchalance personified. As we approach, they flick ash on the ground, give the barrier a lethargic swing upward, and wave us through without interrupting their conversation.",

Such a small hope, and it was easy to imagine the lights extinguished. Bomdi-la fell that night. Assam lay open; Mr Nehru offered the people of the state comfort which was already like helpless condolence. Tibetan refugees got off the train at Banaras. There was smiling bewilderment on their broad, ruddy faces; no one spoke their language and they stood uncertainly beside their boxes, outlandish in their bulky wrappings, grimed to khaki, their long hair, their boots and hats. The hotel was deserted: internal air services had been cancelled. The young dark-suited manager and the uniformed servants stood silent and idle in the veranda. Something of the bazaar spirit and the spirit of wartime opportunism stirred within me. I stood on the steps and haggled. Success went to my head. ‘And that is to include morning coffee,’ I said. ‘Yes,’ the manager said sadly. ‘That is to include coffee.’",

While thus engaged, said Bartlett, “The ice began to close in, and we had to turn round and steam south in a hurry.” The delay took a couple of valuable days, but with skillful ice navigating, Cochran managed to reach Point Barrow on the evening of August 21. There, they would deliver mail and take on coal and water for the journey across the Arctic Ocean and the Chukchi Sea.",

The quality and even the cleanliness appeared to have a lot to do with the age of the facility. The Fort Worth terminal’s tiny shower was in a private bathroom that appeared to be several years old. The door stood just off the sorting area for packages. The room’s toilet paper dispenser dispensed paper when it felt like it. The room felt cold in the winter and steamy in the summer. Puke colored, yellow tile covered the whole grimy looking place, but a driver could shower there.",

Several days passed us by in this southern port, as we fixed the bike and wandered aimlessly around the city. These were the last days in which we did not have to think about money. Afterwards, a rigid diet of meat, polenta and bread would have to be followed strictly to stretch our meager finances. The taste of bread was now tinged with warning: ‘I won’t be so easy to come by soon, old man,’ and we swallowed it with all the more enthusiasm. We wanted, like camels, to build our reserves for the journey that lay ahead.",

She was a child, dreaming. She stood on the nursery staircase at Five Elms; the coffin came round the turn and crushed her against the banisters; only this time she was not afraid of it; she made herself wake because of something that would happen next. The flagstones of the passage were hard and cold to her naked feet; that was how you could tell you were awake. The door of the Morfe drawing-room opened into Mamma's old bedroom at Five Elms, and when she came to the foot of the bed she saw her father standing there. He looked at her with a mocking, ironic animosity, so that she knew he was alive. She thought:\n\"It's all right. I only dreamed he was dead. I shall tell Mamma.\"\nWhen she really woke, two entities, two different and discordant memories, came together with a shock.\nHer mother was up and dressed. She leaned over her, tucking the blankets round her shoulders and saying, \"Lie still and go to sleep again, there's a good girl.\"\nHer memory cleared and settled, filtering, as the light filtered through the drawn blinds. Mamma and she had slept together because Papa was dead.",

The island earned universal critical acclaim, on all counts, from travel writers, tourists, and on-line guidebooks. Jonathan Raban, in his essay Arabia, wrote that Gezirah had “the perpetual-Sunday-morning air of very expensive suburbia.” Other writers mentioned boutique shops and fine dining and all those things fit to serve the European workers and expats who live and work on the island. Many of those foreigners lived in an affluent neighborhood called Zamalek, on the northern half of the island, where we would find embassies housed in old villas surrounded by tidy lawns and security guards. That luxurious lifestyle came with a hefty price, though. The hotels we checked were expensive, even compared to Mena House, so we settled, instead, on the Hilton, in downtown. But Gezirah was within walking distance from the museum, just across the river, and Teresa couldn’t resist the temptation.",
