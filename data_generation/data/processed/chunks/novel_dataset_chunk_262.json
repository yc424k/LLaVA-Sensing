On reaching the fresh air he was sufficiently unsteady to incline the row of three at one moment as if they were marching to London, and at another as if they were marching to Bath – which produced a comical effect, frequent enough in families on nocturnal homegoings; and, like most comical effects, not quite so comic after all. The two women valiantly disguised these forced excursions and countermarches as well as they could from Durbeyfield their cause, and from Abraham, and from themselves; and so they approached by degrees their own door, the head of the family bursting suddenly into his former refrain as he drew near, as if to fortify his soul at sight of the smallness of his present residence –",

    "target_paragraph": "We played in rapt silence. A feeling of timeless and remote seclusion hung all about us, a half-delightful, half-mournful spell which the house and our companion conspired to cast. She had taken on both of us and it was soon clear she was a brilliant player: our turns were spaced out between longer and longer breaks. All was quiet, except for the occasional squeak of French chalk, the fall of a log, a splutter of raindrops down the chimney, the occasional hiss of the siphon. Sudden gusts made the trunks of the huge trees creak ominously outside. ‘I shouldn’t be surprised if it doesn’t fetch one of them down,’ Lady Wentworth said, pausing before a difficult shot. ‘It’s been a rotten winter.’ She played the shot facing away from the table and behind her back, which she arched as pliantly as a girl’s. The balls sped unerringly to their destination and the soft clicks and the thuds on the cushion were followed by two plops. ‘Put red back, would you, Antony?’ She crossed to the other side on silent plimsoled feet. . . . The huge scores mounted up in game after lost game. The whole world seemed reduced to this shadowy room with its glowing green quadrilateral; the slow eddies of our cigar smoke under the lamps and the flickering firelight and the trundling balls. The light caught a brooch here and a locket there as our hostess moved mercilessly to and fro at her effortless, demolishing task. Tea, brought in by a housekeeper and two Irishwomen (identical twins, quite plainly), was no interruption. Lady Wentworth lifted a silver lid. ‘Oh, good,’ she murmured sadly. ‘Muffins.’ We ate them cue in hand, and the massacre went on. She looked disappointed when, night having long ago invisibly fallen, the time came to go. Why didn’t we stay and take pot luck . . .? Her slim silhouette and the anachronistic headdress were dark in the doorway and she still held a cue in her hand as she waved us goodbye. We drove away through stormy folds of woodland. The 1950s waited outside the park gates. Meanwhile, shadowy cohorts from Arabia shifted about among the soaking timber. The whites of a score of eyes flashed hysterically or gaze for a moment in the headlamps. Then with a wheel and a flounder they vanished into the dark like rainy ghosts.",

I couldn’t help noticing, though, that almost everyone in attendance was white, despite the fact that roughly half of Rotterdam’s population came from ethnic minorities. Presumably those who were most offended had stayed away. In search of a better view of the crowd, I climbed up the steps to the bridge over the Maas, where a few dozen people were standing along the railings. From above the event looked even more bizarre, with blackface characters on stilts tiptoeing through crowds of children like balletic giraffes. A family standing nearby gasped and raised their arms in unison, and I looked to see what had caught their attention. Down below us a small group of protestors – four young men and two women – were beginning an anti–Zwarte Piet protest. Standing with their arms linked, they shivered in T-shirts hand-painted with the slogan ‘Zwarte Piet Is Racisme’. A large empty space quickly formed in the crowd around them.",

It was borne in upon her how completely in running her risk she had lost her prize, lost it so entirely that she had no longer the right, in talking of Ralph, to presume that her knowledge of him supplanted all other knowledge. She no longer completely possessed her love, since his share in it was doubtful; and now, to make things yet more bitter, her clear vision of the way to face life was rendered tremulous and uncertain, because another was witness of it. Feeling her desire for the old unshared intimacy too great to be borne without tears, she rose, walked to the farther end of the room, held the curtains apart, and stood there mastered for a moment. The grief itself was not ignoble; the sting of it lay in the fact that she had been led to this act of treachery against herself. Trapped, cheated, robbed, first by Ralph and then by Katharine, she seemed all dissolved in humiliation, and bereft of anything she could call her own. Tears of weakness welled up and rolled down her cheeks. But tears, at least, she could control, and would this instant, and then, turning, she would face Katharine, and retrieve what could be retrieved of the collapse of her courage.",

On both the tomb-slabs had been carved in shallow relief an intricate design of equal-armed Byzantine crosses, some set in diamonds, others in circles. Between the crosses were carved inscriptions in clear Byzantine Greek. That on the left read ‘Sophronius’; that on the right bore the name of John Moschos.",

A tiny young beautician with a thick plait that stretches to her knees squats and painstakingly applies mehindi (a red mud-like henna) in intricate swirls and pictures on Simi’s hands; she paints peacocks, flowers and tendrils of ivy. I just can’t resist asking for a swirling pattern of circles and twirls. As I wave my new hennaed hands in the air to dry, the entire brigade of Aunties wake from their afternoon snores to check the work.",

He knew those mountains well, it was a clear path and if I kept well away from Soroa, where ecotourism was being developed, I should escape observation.",

The place has given me nine books (and counting). My rooms are as intimate as fingerprints. My husband’s wild study where a painting of Dante looks down on the chaotic desk, the cool white bedroom with the iron bed draped with linen, my new kitchen with the big blue stove, the dining room that holds many memories of feasts with friends under the faded blue and apricot fresco we discovered long ago—the house lives powerfully on its own and, so many years later, I feel powerfully alive inside its thick stone walls.",

But it was nothing like that at all. It was just flat and brown and full of remote little towns with charmless names: Swink, Ordway, Manzanola. They in turn were all full of poor-looking people and mean-looking dogs nosing around on the margins of liquor stores and gas stations. Broken bottles glittered among the stubble in the road-side ditches and the signs along the way were pocked from shotgun blasts.

I hesitated, not being a natural gate-crasher, then gave priority to thawing and crouched by the fire with outstretched hands while the men, conversing in Afrikaans, spiced their meat. All were warmly clad, with compact athletic bodies, blunt features, small moustaches and army haircuts. The scene seemed absurdly unreal: me, wrapped in my flea-bag, too desperate for warmth to accept a brush-off while the trio, completely ignoring me, went about their meaty business. They were having a problem; that gusty wind kept the wood flaming and you can’t braai over flames. Finally I suggested, ‘Why not move the caravan, to shelter the fire?’ All three stared, as though noticing me for the first time. But that was the breakthrough. When the caravan had been moved and the meat at last was sizzling they allowed me slowly to dismantle their anti-uitlander barrier, brick by brick.",

The breeze was fresh, and quite steady, filtering itself through the denuded mass of twigs without swaying them, but making the point of each ivy-leaf on the trunks scratch its underlying neighbour restlessly. Grace’s lips sucked in this native air of hers like milk. They soon reached a place where the wood ran down into a corner, and they went outside it towards comparatively open ground. Having looked round they were intending to re-enter the copse when a panting fox emerged with a dragging brush, trotted past them tamely as a domestic cat, and disappeared amid some dead fern. They walked on, her father merely observing after watching the animal, “They are hunting somewhere near.”",
