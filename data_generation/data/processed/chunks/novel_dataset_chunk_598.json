He was a genuine eighteenth-century exquisite, rather stiffer than the French, maybe, but completely in the spirit. Curious, curious children! They had a certain stand-offish superbness, and not a single trace of misgiving. For them, their \"noblesse\" was indisputable. For the first time in my life I recognised the true cold superbness of the old \"noblesse\". They had not a single qualm about their own perfect representing of the higher order of being.",

The elderly had wise, ancient faces but moved around spryly; the men were shirtless and hadn’t a chest hair among them. Ponytailed girls in flip-flops chased barefoot boys with bowl cuts.

George Vancouver called it ‘the best building in all the Spanish colonies’, and Maria Graham, a lively English-woman who lived in Chile in the 1820s, wondered in her journal (later published) if it weren’t ‘too magnificent for Chile’. Two layers of high-ceilinged rooms concealed behind arches, columns and external staircases were arranged around large courtyards stalked by presidential staff, from snappily dressed civil servants to three men in blue hats carrying a basket of watermelons. Off the first courtyard we visited the frugally decorated presidential chapel.",

The role is sometimes called \"Telek\" in other parts of Bali. The Sandar mask, a refined or alus type, is white with delicate eyes and red lips. Its closed mouth traces a faint smile. A black band with seven gold, four-lobed symbols decorates the forehead. The characteristic hat resembles a pagoda and is made of gold-painted leather, cut through with ornamentation, the lowest step hung with shiny pendants. A small white flag adorns the left side of the pagoda, and a single peacock feather dangles from the left side of the mask. The Sandar dancer wears a short-sleeved jacket and a white cloth, tied much like a pair of pants. Over these is draped a sash pinned with many long ribbons, a broad, green apron, brocaded with gold, and green-and-gold leggings. As with all dancers, the Sandars are barefoot. Each carries a constantly fluttering fan in his right hand, and over the back of each dancer is slung a kris. The Sandar's movements are graceful and feminine, although the dancers in Jimbaran are always young men. In other villages girls dance these parts.",

    "target_paragraph": "The fact is that the British have a totally private sense of distance. This is most visibly seen in the shared pretense that Britain is a lonely island in the middle of an empty green sea. Of course, the British are all aware, in an abstract sort of way, that there is a substantial landmass called Europe nearby and that from time to time it is necessary to go over there to give old Jerry a drubbing or have a holiday in the sun, but it’s not nearby in any meaningful sense in the way that, say, Disney World is. If your concept of world geography was shaped entirely by the content of British newspapers and television, you would conclude that America must be about where Ireland is, that France and Germany lie roughly alongside the Azores, that Australia occupies a hot zone somewhere in the region of the Middle East, and that pretty much all the other sovereign states are either mythical (e.g., Burundi, El Salvador, Mongolia, and Bhutan) or can only be reached by spaceship. Consider the acres of news space in Britain devoted to marginal American figures like Oliver North, Lorena Bobbitt, and O.J. Simpson, and compare that with all the news reported in any year from Scandinavia, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Portugal, and Spain and you will see what I mean. It’s crazy really. If there is a political crisis in Italy or a nuclear spill in Karlsruhe, it gets maybe eight inches on an inside page. But if some woman in Shitkicker, West Virginia, cuts off her husband’s dick and flings it out the window in a fit of pique, it’s second lead on the Nine O’clock News and The Sunday Times is mobilizing its investigative unit. You figure it.",

Her head is covered, and she is obviously strapped in place, but otherwise she looks reasonably comfortable. The photo was taken by a Daily News reporter named Tom Howard, who was present as an official witness and had sneaked in a miniature camera strapped to his shin. At the right moment, he had discreetly lifted up his pant leg and activated the shutter by means of a wire running to his jacket pocket. The edition sold out within minutes of hitting the streets. Inside, the paper provided 289 inches of coverage on the execution. Even the Times gave the story 63½ inches?over 5 feet?of detailed attention.",

    "target_paragraph": "After their first visit they went very often to Mademoiselle’s modest little apartment, Mademoiselle Duphot and her quiet blind sister were indeed their only friends now in Paris, for Brockett was in America on business, and Stephen had not rung up Valérie Seymour.\nSometimes when Stephen was busy with her work, Puddle would make her way there all alone. Then she and Mademoiselle would get talking about Stephen’s childhood, about her future, but guardedly, for Puddle must be careful to give nothing away to the kind, simple woman. As for Mademoiselle, she too must be careful to accept all and ask no questions. Yet in spite of the inevitable gaps and restraints, a real sympathy sprang up between them, for each sensed in the other a valuable ally who would fight a good fight on behalf of Stephen. And now Stephen would quite often send her car to take the blind Julie for a drive beyond Paris, Julie would sniff the air and tell Burton that through smelling their greenness she could see the trees; he would listen to her broken and halting English with a smile—they were a queer lot these French. Or perhaps he would drive the other Mademoiselle up to Montmartre for early Mass on a Sunday. She belonged to something to do with a heart; it all seemed rather uncanny to Burton. He thought of the Vicar who had played such fine cricket, and suddenly felt very homesick for Morton. Fruit would find its way to the little apartment, together with cakes and large marron glacés. Then Mademoiselle Duphot would become frankly greedy, eating sweets in bed while she studied her booklets on the holy and very austere Thérèse, who had certainly not eaten marrons glacés.\n‘Thus the spring, that gentle yet fateful spring of 1914, slipped into the summer. With the budding of flowers and the singing of birds it slipped quietly on towards great disaster; while Stephen, whose book was now nearing completion, worked harder than ever in Paris.",

We spent most of our Tuamotu time at one atoll, Kauehi. I don’t remember why we chose that particular one, farther off the beaten path I think, which is funny when you think about how remote the whole group is. We were the only cruising boat in the south end of the lagoon during our time there, though we did meet a couple of others when we moved up to anchor off the little settlement for a few days. There was a tiny store up there and we were able to add some basic staples to our dwindling provisions, but the days of juicy pamplemousse were just a memory on these arid, sandy atolls. Very little agriculture is feasible so most of what is available is brought in from off island, mainly from Tahiti. The economy is based on black pearl oyster aquaculture and some low intensity fishing. We bought onions, potatoes, eggs, milk powder, flour, sugar and of course fresh baguettes, seemingly available in even the farthest reaches of the French empire, and apparently priced at the same low rate worldwide.",

A few days of autumn cold had wiped out all trace of the rich fields and languid groves through which she had passed on the Fourth of July; and with the fading of the landscape those fervid hours had faded, too.

There are little clumps of huts, stuck away on the hillsides. The Kirdis run out to raise their right arms high in a salute and/or to scream and laugh. They seem to have no pubic hair; they must be a generally un-hairy race, the women’s legs and arms are smooth as are the men’s faces. Black penises don’t look naked, nor do female pudenda (on the contrary, very small and neat like little girls’). The women haul water and wood along the paths, but seem cheerful about it, and I doubt if they do more than the necessary each day. Men can be seen sitting or lying naked on rocks, at ease; time passes. This century has nothing to do with these people.",
