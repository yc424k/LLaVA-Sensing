Shall we never live alone, think alone, live in a house by ourselves alone? Ah! but I shall! I shall! Alone, alone and far away, with falling rain.

From our surf-mag source, we knew where to look. There was a village called Jardim do Mar—the Garden of the Sea. It sat out on a small, storybook headland. Off that headland, if the photos were to be believed, a great wave broke. The first time we checked it, the wind was wrong and the surf was small. I went exploring the coast (vertical, deserted, stunning) west of Jardim by surfboard, not expecting to find waves, while Peter and Alison hiked along the rocks. He lugged a board, just in case. At a rugged, boulder-strewn promontory called Ponta Pequena, we stumbled on a surprising setup: clean, fierce little rights wrapping into a shallow cove. Peter and I got amongst it. For chest-high waves, the penalties for falling were unusually high, and Peter left a fair amount of blood on the rocks. I had another lucky outing. Afterward, in his drawings of our first Ponta Pequena session, I saw that Peter had been once again keeping score. He got 1.5 barrels while I got 5, according to a box score included in the drawing. Also, he got hurt and I did not. All while his girlfriend watched.",

I’d driven almost an hour more before it struck me: I hadn’t paid for the chips and drink! If we had been on a regular run, I could have paid next time and was dork enough that I would have. But I kept steering down the road, hoping the profit on the fuel they’d sold would help offset the loss from an unintentional shoplifting. Not that that was an excuse.

Outside the memorial an eternal flame discreetly blazed; inside, the marble steps had just been washed, making descent perilous. The place was clammy cold. Row upon row of bronze plaques commemorated the dead of the First and Second World Wars. I descended till I reached a platform beneath which there was a large and deep well-like space, down into which I peered to see more plaques. Heavy dampness rose from the brightly lit enclosure. One doesn't walk familiarly among these dead; that is a shame, because one doesn't wish to feel like a voyeur in the company of the dead, the braided pain and pleasure of cemeteries being that one feels a tender and necessary connection between oneself and the dead. This sense of continuity, without which it is impossible to feel vivaciously alive and to comprehend and recognize one's mortality, is present in graveyards but not in such memorials. The restful dead comfort me; not here. But in this damp and dismal place I did believe that it didn't matter that the Italians were once our enemies. The dead are never our enemies; they are harmless as children.",

    "target_paragraph": "The story that pasta was brought to Italy by Marco Polo from China is so romantic and charming that it is almost churlish to refute it. Its charm derives partly from its being one of those Facts we learn in the nursery—proof that Daddy is full of delicious surprises—and so adhere to forever. But food historians tell us that fifty years before Marco Polo left Venice, Indians and Arabs were already eating noodles; they suggest that pasta reached the trading cities of Venice, Florence, and Genoa in the Middle Ages, by way of Arab lands. Food historian Reay Tannahill says that at a 1972 trade fair in Peking, the Italians tried—one hopes by way of a joke—to sell the Chinese a spaghetti-making machine in which “you put flour, water, and tomato sauce in at one end of the machine and five minutes later hot spaghetti, already prepared and with cheese sauce on top, comes out at the other end.” There could not possibly have been a domestic market for this contraption. (If it wasn't a joke, it was proof of the cynicism we are also told—and I am not yet prepared to say—also underlies Italian exuberance.)",

It was a parody of the original, referring to Madero’s payment of his family’s $750,000 war claims as soon as he became president, that spread like wildfire over the Republic, and had to be suppressed with police and soldiers. \"El Pagare\" is even now taboo in most revolutionary circles, and I have heard of men being shot for singing it; but in Jimenez at this time the utmost license prevailed. Moreover, the Mexicans, unlike the French, have absolutely no feeling for symbols. Bitterly antagonistic sides use the same flag; in the plaza of almost every town still stand eulogistic statues of\nPorfirio Diaz; even at officers’ mess in the field I have drunk from glasses stamped with the likeness of the old dictator, while Federal army uniforms are plentiful in the ranks.",

Harmony rained down on sea and shore. The mountains of St. Thomas heaved up in the moonlessness; the smoking flambeaux splashed the walking herd; bare feet trod the road in soundless rhythm and the dead man rode like a Pharaoh—his rags and his wretchedness gilded in glory.",

(They probably wished I’d go so I would quit talking about it.) In January, I still had no intention of slighting Montana by falling for a new home place, especially one as obvious as Alaska, like the high school boy head-over-heels for the prettiest cheerleader.

I checked my coat and she showed me to it. The reason I hadn’t noticed it from outside was that its floor-to-ceiling windows were obscured by condensation. I stopped short at the hot, moist air suddenly engulfing me. From the name “winter garden” I hadn’t pictured what this would be. Here in the frozen-solid center of Siberia, Russian romanticism or BAM pride or both had created a tropical oasis, with burgeoning greenery and a waterfall and a small tiled pond and birds flitting about in the upper stories.",

    "target_paragraph": "What profoundly horrified the later Victorians – as it had horrified Shelley – was the possibility that the Ice Age might come again; this time as tragedy. In 1862 the physicist William Thomson, better known as Lord Kelvin, had made public his belief that the sun was cooling without renewal of its energy. Not only was there nothing new under the sun, but the sun itself was nothing new, and was ageing day by day. Owing to the slow and irreversible seep of entropy, the solar system was condemned to what had been christened ‘Heat Death’. It was Buffon’s nebular hypothesis all over again, except that this time it was not the globe which was cooling down, but its lantern and radiator, the sun. The universe was pulsing away on a limited wattage, science had proved, and the icy earth would at some point in the future swing blind and blackening through space.",

I saw the tracks of an otter, perhaps the one we had seen, pressed into the wet sand as cleanly as a pastry cut, with a forwards fling of sand from the tip of each sharp toe-mark, showing that it had been moving at speed. I came across a set of animal bones, scattered in a rune I could not read. I picked up other things, carried them back to the broch, and laid them on its floor. A worn black stone, two inches long, shaped roughly like a seal; basalt, I guessed. A little rhomboid stone, whose grey and white strata recalled the grain of the driftwood and the sand terrace. A hank of dried seaweed. A wing feather from a buzzard, tawny and cream, barred with five dark diagonals. When I teased two of its vanes apart, they unzipped with a soft tearing noise. I arranged the objects into lines and patterns, changed their order. I would give the seal stone to my friend Leo, I thought, the seaweed to Roger, and I would keep the other objects for my storm-beach.",

And he remembered it was not many days ago that a woman in some house had said: 'It is not Red Hanrahan you are now but yellow Hanrahan, for your hair is turned to the colour of a wisp of tow.' And another woman he had asked for a drink had not given him new milk but sour; and sometimes the girls would be whispering and laughing with young ignorant men while he himself was in the middle of giving out his poems or his talk. And he thought of the stiffness of his joints when he first rose of a morning, and the pain of his knees after making a journey, and it seemed to him as if he was come to be a very old man, with cold in the shoulders and speckled shins and his wind breaking and he himself withering away. And with those thoughts there came on him a great anger against old age and all it brought with it. And just then he looked up and saw a great spotted eagle sailing slowly towards Ballygawley, and he cried out: 'You, too, eagle of Ballygawley, are old, and your wings are full of gaps, and I will put you and your ancient comrades, the Pike of Dargan Lake and the Yew of the Steep Place of the Strangers into my rhyme, that there may be a curse on you for ever.'",

In 1989 the regime renamed streets, towns and cities across Burma. Maymyo, the old British hill station that Orwell visited, became Pyin-Oo-Lwin, and Fraser Street in Rangoon became Anawyatha Lan in Yangon. Most of the old names were Anglicized Burmese names that had been used by the British colonial government, and the regime claimed that the changes were a long-overdue move to discard these colonial tags. But there was a deeper-rooted motive. The generals were rewriting history. When a place is renamed, the old name disappears from maps and, eventually, from human memory. If that is possible, then perhaps the memory of past events can also be erased. By renaming cities, towns and streets, the regime seized control of the very space within which people lived; home and business addresses had to be rewritten and relearned. And, when the regime changed the name of the country, maps and encyclopedias all over the world had to be corrected. The country known as Burma was erased and replaced with a new one: Myanmar.",

On that warm afternoon, the open French doors beckoned a pleasant summer breeze, billowing the long, lace curtains under the stately chamber’s five-meter (161/2-foot) ceiling. We were in six alongside her husband Franco and her nephew visiting from Rome with his two children. I had eaten so many wonderful meals in that room that I couldn’t say what we had on that particular day, but surely at the very least, a plate of pasta, a meat course with vegetables, potatoes and a salad, cheese, fruit and dessert, all served in abundant portions.",
