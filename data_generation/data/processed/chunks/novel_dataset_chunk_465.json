My energy stores, which had not been completely replenished after the previous day’s exertion, seemed empty by mid-day, and we still had thirty kilometres ahead! I thought we would never make it, I was running on fumes. The cold was chilling me to the core, and as soon as I stopped, I shivered uncontrollably. I started to think, ‘What the hell did I get us into?’ It was miserable, for most of the way. Yet, we kept going. I divided the day into smaller chunks of one or two hours to make it easier to get through. At least we were making progress, but by God was it hard! We cycled our hearts out, to the brink of exhaustion, and advanced across this gigantic white desert. Finally, after ten hours out in the cold, biking in single file, with just our thoughts in our heads for company, we reached our hut in complete darkness, and arrived shattered, cold and wet.",

State shop windows and shelves displayed 1990’s range of goods, the bottles and tins now dustier and rustier.",

This figure, too, was reading; but not from a book: the words which engrossed it being the inscription on Mrs. Henchard’s tombstone. The personage was in mourning like herself, was about her age and size, and might have been her wraith or double, but for the fact that it was a lady much more beautifully dressed than she. Indeed, comparatively indifferent as Elizabeth-Jane was to dress, unless for some temporary whim or purpose, her eyes were arrested by the artistic perfection of the lady’s appearance. Her gait, too, had a flexuousness about it, which seemed to avoid angularity of movement less from choice than from predisposition. It was a revelation to Elizabeth that human beings could reach this stage of external development—she had never suspected it. She felt all the freshness and grace to be stolen from herself on the instant by the neighbourhood of such a stranger. And this was in face of the fact that Elizabeth could now have been writ handsome, while the young lady was simply pretty.",

Even his baldness, which was in proportion to the rest, looked as if it received a special daily polish; and on a hot day his whole person was like some wonderful example of the costliest irrigation. There was so much of him, and he had so many planes, that it was fascinating to watch each runnel of moisture follow its own particular watershed. Even on his large fresh-looking hands the drops divided, trickling in different ways from the ridges of the fingers; and as for his forehead and temples, and the raised cushion of cheek beneath each of his lower lids, every one of these slopes had its own particular stream, its hollow pools and sudden cataracts; and the sight was never unpleasant, because his whole vast bubbling surface was of such a clean and hearty pink, and the exuding moisture so perceptibly flavoured with expensive eau de Cologne and the best French soap.",

They bought this piece of property from the government of the Dominican Republic because the president decided selling one of his country’s ecological jewels was worth the money. Their vision for the green, perfect place on the white-sand beach was “updated Athenian village.” A New Yorker article on the project explained this as a place “in which four-star restaurants and art galleries could share street space with locally-run fish shacks and pool halls.” Moby and Charlie Rose were also investors. There was going to be an “artists’ colony.”",

Hunched, half-spreadeagled, I pressed myself up the narrow steps and, sitting on the floor of the shelter-deck, an elbow clamped over the steel sill of the door, I thrust my legs into my oilskin trousers and, eventually, my feet into my sea-boots. Standing up, I was thrown against the lashed oil-drums to starboard, but in one or three moves I slotted into my oilskin jacket. Rolling aft, I thought, like a seaman, I emerged from the cowl of the shelter-deck—and was at once thrown face-first into the circular steel side of a 7-foot-high winch. I held on to a pair of protruding bolts, my fingers as committed as the suckers on a squid. A rush of sea guttered in and out of a scupper to my left—and that’s a generous scupper, I thought, because if you fell on this slippery deck that scupper would wave you through with no questions asked—so maybe not, maybe you can’t roll like a seaman if your thighs are merely average for the species and its relatives: round here you need thighs not like a chimpanzee or even a gorilla, round here you need thighs of another order altogether, like Tyrannosaurus rex.",

But no, there are only two skyscrapers. One is an extraordinary isolated monolith – apparently windowless, severe in shape but tinted a warm pinkish-gold. In fact it has hundreds of concealed windows, specially designed to ease the task of the diamond-sorters who sit within. Emeralds are precious because of their rarity; diamonds are precious only because De Beers controls most of the world’s supply. Were tourists allowed to wander along Namibia’s Diamond Coast, gem diamonds would soon lose their monetary worth – though a few odd bods might still value them for their intrinsic beauty, their mysterious storing of colour and the unpredictable vitality with which they release those shafts of light.",

A cardboard box sailed across the road ahead of me and was wafted high out over the harbour. It was intensely cold. On the exposed road out to the headland I began to wish again that I had bought the Russian hat. The wind was unrelenting: it drove before it tiny particles of ice that seared my cheeks and made me gasp. I had a scarf with me, which I tied around my face bandit-style and trudged on, leaning heavily into the wind.",

As the traditional Delhi quarries near Agra were no longer controlled by the Mughals—the road between Delhi and Agra was usually blocked by wild and hostile Jat tribesmen—the builders were forced to strip other Delhi tombs in order to gather the material for Safdarjung’s memorial. Half-way through the construction, the marble appears to have run out. Prominent strips of inlay were left unfinished; awkward patches of pink sandstone intrude into the glistening white of the dome. The effect is like a courtier in a tatty second-hand livery: the intention grand, but the actual impression tawdry, almost ridiculous.",

We happen to arrive just in time for the 10 a.m. show. The spider crawls over to an insect caught in her web, frantically wriggling. We watch in morbid fascination as the spider pulls thread from her body to wrap around the bug, and then uses her legs to carefully spin the poor bug around and around, rolling it up into an unrecognizable bundle of silvery thread. The wriggling gradually subsides to stillness. We duck under the web and continue our hike. When we hike back that same way an hour later, there is nothing left of the bug.",
