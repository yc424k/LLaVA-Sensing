Still skirting the subject that fanned their very faces with its flame, they clung persistently to other topics, and it seemed to Anna that their minds had never been nearer together than in this hour when their hearts were so separate. In the glow of interchanged love she had grown less conscious of that other glow of interchanged thought which had once illumined her mind. She had forgotten how Darrow had widened her world and lengthened out all her perspectives, and with a pang of double destitution she saw herself alone among her shrunken thoughts.",

The lute player, a dashing handsome fellow in short smock and boots, smiles at me wholeheartedly in welcome, as if I were his dearest friend on earth. Soon others come, including a man who appears to be Chirjing’s suitor. Jang-bu is playing his harmonica, and Dawa and Gyaltsen laugh indiscriminately at all they see, but the only one of the Shey party who will dance is Tukten—Tukten Sherpa, cook and porter, alleged thief, bad drunk, old Gurkha, is a dancer, too, and dancing, he smiles and smiles. The dance is a short rhythmic step well suited to small spaces, and very like Eskimo igloo dances, even to the jet-black braids and red-bronze faces and the shuffle of the soft, mukluk-like boots. Soon the dancers begin singing, and Tukten joins them but not Dawa, who has an exceptional voice but is much too shy. The songs are melodious and wistful, and as in Dhorpatan I am reminded of the mountain huainus of the Andes. A Buddhist song has the modest title “Taking Flowers to the Lama,” but there is also a song of older centuries, called “Highest Mountain”: “Even the highest mountain cannot keep me from reaching Nurpu!” Or so Jang-bu translates it, watching to see if I will laugh at this longing reference to an ancient god.",

Now, though, he wanted to cook a perfect meal, a savory jollof rice or his special stew with arigbe, to show her how well he could cook. He delayed washing up so that the running water would not drown out her voice. When he served them tea, he took his time rearranging the biscuits on the saucer so that he could linger and listen to her, until Master said, “That’s quite all right, my good man.” Her name was Olanna. But Master said it only once; he mostly called her nkem, my own. They talked about the quarrel between the Sardauna and the premier of the Western Region, and then Master said something about waiting until she moved to Nsukka and how it was only a few weeks away after all. Ugwu held his breath to make sure he had heard clearly. Master was laughing now, saying, “But we will live here together, nkem, and you can keep the Elias Avenue flat as well.”",

If we’ve failed to make this channel, that headland, by still water, by the turn of tide, we would have fled for here, or perhaps for there… He read down through his fingertips, the chart’s flat blues and greens popping up into relief in his mind. The waves here, at this time, in these conditions, will be unproblematic; but here they will stand up straight and hard like a wall. Wind-histories as well as wind-futures need to be taken into account, for the sea can have a long memory for past agitations. If a wind has blown strongly from a certain quarter for days, the sea’s motion will continue to register this even once the wind has dropped.

    "target_paragraph": "That kind of erratic infrastructure has, so far, helped to keep Vietnam relatively untouristed: 1990 was the “Year of Tourism,” my guide in the north dryly informed me, and it was also the year when the government decided to tear down all its hotels (in order to rebuild them). As a result, the country attracted exactly 187,000 visitors, or one for every twenty-five who went to smaller Thailand, next door. And the sightseer with even minimal expectations of comfort and ease may still find Vietnam more than he has bargained for: the spirit is winning, but the flush is weak. For the jaded traveler, however, who has begun to despair of ever finding anywhere fresh or unspoiled, the place may well be a revelation. Vietnam is amazingly short of amenities, but one goes to Vietnam today precisely to enjoy the qualities that the absence of such amenities encourages.",

Each time I come to altitude and fall sick, I vow that I won’t return. Once, in a hut in the French Alps, I wrote that vow down and signed it – an affidavit to a future self – but then became so disoriented that I lost the piece of paper. At 21,000 feet in the Nepal Himalaya, I walked a snow-path spattered to either side with the blood and vomit of previous trekkers, their bodies wrecked by the arduousness of the height. Old remedies for altitude sickness include soaking a cloth or sponge in urine and holding it to the nose and mouth. This is not something I’ve tried.",

On his 1879 visit to Alaska, some of the Presbyterian missionaries with whom he was traveling had cut down a pole belonging to the family of Kadachan, the Tlingit chief who was among those who guided him to Glacier Bay. (“I heard a chopping going on at the north end of the village, followed by a heavy thud, as if a tree had fallen,” Muir writes in Travels in Alaska.) In spite of having recently converted to Christianity and presumably forsaking pagan idols, Kadachan looked the missionary party’s leader squarely in the face and asked, “How would you like to have an Indian go to a graveyard and break down and carry away a monument belonging to your family?”",

Donna Kneeland is beside the fire, her legs folded straight beneath her. She adds wood. She is attempting to dry, possibly repair, a boot that has a two-inch rip near the sole. A parabola of wire crosses the top of the No. 10 can. She lifts it. With a short stick in her other hand, she tilts the bottom, pouring tea into my cup. I welcome it, to defray the chill, which neither Dick nor Donna seems to notice. Staked out in the woods around us are seven sled dogs. They, too, are on holiday.",

When we came to the Tower of Apes we set fruits before them, and they did not harm us. When we came to the Tower of Serpents we gave them warm milk in howls of brass, and they let us go by.

At an otherwise featureless stretch of riverbank, a group of hikers pointing cameras indicated that I had found what I was looking for: the Maeslantkering storm-surge barrier, a massive set of flood gates that prevented the sea rushing upriver to Rotterdam. The gates would probably have been of little interest were it not for their sheer size. Each of the two white metal structures – one on the near riverbank and one on the far – was about the size and shape of an Eiffel Tower toppled on its side. As a sign explained, whenever a storm surge was predicted, the huge girders would automatically pivot across the river like a pair of swing doors closing, sealing it against the tide. Today, the gates lay dormant on the riverbanks, an object of curiosity for passers-by. To the Dutch, however, they were a key component of what some claimed to be ‘the eighth wonder of the world’, the huge network of dams and floodgates that cobwebbed the southern Netherlands, known as the Delta Works.",

    "target_paragraph": "The tenth invited guest—Nadezhda’s childhood friend Oksana—was waiting for us in the courtyard of an apartment complex, blowing smoke rings at the stars. She was quite a sight. Her chin-length ebony hair contrasted starkly with her translucent white skin; her lipstick was so purple, it was nearly black. With her black coat, black pants, black sweater, and black shoes, Oksana could have blended with many crowds in this world—a Depeche Mode concert, an Anne Rice book signing, New York City—but the citizens of Nara weren’t among them. Like Elena, Oksana wanted very much to nab a Moscow propiska, but she had a different strategy. A local bachelor named Anton actually owned one of the coveted resident permits, and Oksana had spent the past two years scheming on how to share it with him. Anton may have drunk like a fish, had a miserable temper, and—by Oksana’s own admission—been a stumbling idiot, but as another Russian saying goes, Bez bumazhki, miy kakashki—Without papers, we are shit. In Oksana’s eyes, Anton’s bumazhki made up for the fact that he was a kakashki. So she seduced and married him and bore his child. Then she sent him off to Moscow to find an apartment and a job. Too unskilled for professional work, too proud for manual labor, and too intimidated by the black market, Anton repeatedly returned empty-handed. In time, he tired of searching for work altogether and announced he was perfectly happy in Nara. Infuriated, Oksana moved back to her parents’ one-bedroom flat with their six-month-old daughter. The couple had not spoken since.",

Sitting in the cockpit, confident that I would be enjoying a cold Coca-Cola in St. Thomas the next day, I spied a ship on the horizon and hailed it on the VHF radio just to make sure. The radio operator’s satellite fix notified me that, with our present course and position, Varuna would hit land somewhere in the middle of Puerto Rico. Shocked, not to mention a little worried about my dubious talents, I thanked him, signed off and quickly readjusted our course to the southeast.",

More padagingan must be placed inside the stone, brick, or concrete structure itself by digging or chipping a hole in the structure, placing the proper offering inside, and then filling the space with stone or mortar. The ceremony is expensive, and not taken lightly. If a shrine must be moved to another locality, the spirit of the shrine is first transferred to a daksina, a special offering, which is then placed nearby in a temporary shrine. Then the original shrine is completely destroyed. None of its components may be reused for any purpose.

The clock ticks; the woman sneezes; the waiter comes—there is a gradual coming together, running into one, acceleration and unification.

She straightened the candle and walked down the stairs. She listened as she went. There was silence. Martin was asleep. Her mother was asleep. As she passed the doors and went downstairs a weight seemed to descend on her. She paused, looking down into the hall. A blankness came over her. Where am I? she asked herself, staring at a heavy frame. What is that? She seemed to be alone in the midst of nothingness; yet must descend, must carry her burden – she raised her arms slightly, as if she were carrying a pitcher, an earthenware pitcher on her head. Again she stopped. The rim of a bowl outlined itself upon her eyeballs; there was water in it; and something yellow. It was the dog’s bowl, she realized; that was the sulphur in the dog’s bowl; the dog was lying curled up at the bottom of the stairs. She stepped carefully over the body of the sleeping dog and went into the drawing-room.",

While he told me about his qualifications we sat in a shiny crowded café – its décor aping McDonald’s or KFC – opposite the main gate of the new university campus. In the 1970s, at the age of nine, Karim and three contemporaries were arrested and held for some thirty hours beyond reach of their families. Once, having been arrested in a cousin’s house high on Mount Ebal, he was interrogated while being repeatedly kicked and beaten for forty minutes by four soldiers. They then dragged him by the legs down 162 concrete steps, flung him into an APC and sat on him, fracturing three ribs. (I knew those steps, linking two residential streets.) In a cold, damp detention centre he was left lying on the floor overnight with about thirty others. Every hour or so a pair of soldiers strolled between the prone bodies, kicking them. Eight days later, Karim was released without charge.",

    "target_paragraph": "Mark Twain was supposed to have said that any investor seeking profit should buy land, as it wasn’t being made any more. In most countries that would be sound advice, but in the Netherlands the opposite is true. Huge swathes of the country consist of land reclaimed from the sea, including the entire province of Flevoland. While England and Belgium are rough patchworks of fields and forests, the Netherlands is a man-made chessboard of straight lines and sharp corners. ‘God created the world,’ as one popular saying goes, ‘but the Dutch created the Netherlands.’ Unsurprisingly, the endless battle to stay dry has had a profound effect on the country’s history and culture. After living there for a while, I came to realise that almost every distinctive feature or cliché about the Netherlands was, in some way, a result of the country’s unique relationship with water: from the windmills that were used to pump fields dry, to the flatness of the land that was left behind, to the bicycles that travelled easily across the smooth terrain. Bricks paved roads built on dangerously soft ground; tulips thrived in the silty reclaimed soil; cows grew fat on rich, moist grass; glasses of milk and beer were safe to drink when clean water was in short supply; people grew tall from drinking all the milk; and thick wooden clogs kept farmers’ feet dry when trudging through boggy fields. Almost everything that an outsider might think of as typically Dutch could be attributed to the country’s ongoing battle against the tides.",

It was a handsome town, as handsome as any I had seen in New England, and more replete with autumn colour, with a main street of square-topped brick buildings, old banks, a movie theatre, family stores. The Cooperstown Diner, where I went for breakfast, was busy, friendly and cheap – all that a diner should be. Afterwards I went for a stroll around the residential streets, shuffling hands-in-pockets through the dry leaves, and down to the lakeside. Every house in town was old and pretty; many of the larger ones had been converted into inns and expensive B & Bs. The morning sunlight filtered through the trees and threw shadows across the lawns and sidewalks. This was as nice a little town as I had seen on the trip; it was almost Amalgam.",

She had been that morning to take up the character of a servant, ‘And, of course, at half-past ten in the morning one expects to find the housemaid brushing the stairs.’ How odd! How unspeakably odd! But she could not explain to herself why suddenly as her aunt spoke the whole system in which they lived had appeared before her eyes as something quite unfamiliar and inexplicable, and themselves as chairs or umbrellas dropped about here and there without any reason. She could only say with her slight stammer, ‘Are you f-f-fond of Aunt Eleanor, Aunt Lucy?’ to which her aunt replied, with her nervous hen-like twitter of a laugh, ‘My dear child, what questions you do ask!’",

Outside every home five-foot-high herb-beds were being watered before the sun reached them. During the dry season the ground becomes rock hard, hence these contrived mini-gardens – long wooden troughs, raised to protect them from livestock. Scores of children were cycling to school, some breakfasting as they pedalled, eating sticky rice from baskets hung around their necks. These special baskets – one side flat, to reduce bouncing – are also used when walking to the fields or the forest.",

She had, after all, done the most important things, sifted out the secretaries, corrected and copied the fifth chapter, and Minnie knew now exactly how the rooms were to be arranged. Why leave all this, and all the lovely, scented country, so gorgeous just then with August magnificently burning its way into September, because of that old Gower Street? There were other trains that day, but she wouldn’t go in them. One mustn’t overdo conscientiousness, Jen decided, resuming her digging; and she came to the conclusion that a single day, even a few hours only, would be quite enough before father’s homecoming for her to give the finishing touches to his house, and fill it with flowers.",

The year of Siren land has only three seasons: the cloudless summer of brown fields, cicada-days; the green spell of rain and storms; three months of flowery spring. Summer melts into winter by bland transition, without hectic tints of death and castings of leaves, and when, in May, the grass begins to wither, the vines take up the joyous refrain. One fact must have struck all who have spent a summer here–the difference in temperature between the cultivated and barren lands. The latter are perceptibly warmer. The coolness of Sant’ Agata is due not so much to its height above sea-level or to its exposure to the refreshing mistral as to the fact that it lies in an ocean of fruit-trees and leafy walnuts and hazels; nor is it their shade, but rather what Professor Marsh calls the “frigoric effect of leafy structure” which brings about the chill. To step from sunshine into shadow is naturally cooling, but whoever enters this cultivated zone even at midnight will shiver involuntarily.",

I’d been this way a hundred times before but found myself looking at London as if I were a tourist, fascinated by the new double-decker buses, the red phone boxes and post boxes, the black cabs and the unarmed policemen wearing helmets shaped like pen lids. After years of thinking the Netherlands was horribly overcrowded, I was surprised to find that London seemed even more so: noisy and chaotic and so packed with cars and buses and idling tourists that it was impossible to move quickly. Crossing the road in front of the British Museum, I looked the wrong way and was almost flattened by a cliché: a white builder’s van hurtling recklessly through a pelican crossing. Winding down a grimy window, the fluorescent-jacketed driver hollered a perfect London welcome: ‘Oi! Mate! Get yer eyes tested!’",

The cubs ran into the water and splashed each other playfully.

He was in the middle of the eighth course he had taken in Biblical studies. The enormous Bible was the largest he had been able to buy. He said it had cost twenty-seven dollars, and he explained that he needed large type so that he could read in the kerosene light at night. I picked up the heavy rifle and balanced it in my hands. Bill said it was a 44/40 Winchester, a model first built in 1873, and that it fired big, two-hundred-grain bullets. Unfortunately, he went on, the cartridges cost eight and a half dollars for a box of fifty, so he couldn’t use the rifle very often. When he treats himself to a box of bullets, he does not space out the pleasure. He prefers to shoot up the whole boxful as rapidly as he can. The rifle has lever action and holds fifteen shells at a time. Bill selects a target, frequently nothing more than a pine tree, and rips it with fifty bullets. Sometimes the bullets cut the tree down. For other purposes, he said, he had only used the rifle three times—once to kill a dog, once to kill a deer, and once to frighten a reporter, who drove up in a car that had the name of a Trenton newspaper on it, got out, and peered through a window into Bill’s cabin, in an attempt—Bill thought—to see how pineys live. Bill picked up the rifle, and the reporter ran to his car and drove away. “I’d have never shot to kill him,” Bill told me. “But I’d have threw lead at him if I’d been scared enough. I wasn’t scared enough.”",
