If you’ll wait in here, sir,” she continued, making another attempt to get him into the drawing-room, “I’ll go and tell the ladies.”\n\n“I’m not going to wait anywhere,” said Christopher. “I’m going up to my wife.

    "target_paragraph": "Apart from the evolutionary movement of societies towards grander, more all-encompassing forms, there is a strong argument to be made for a parallel movement in the personal psychological development of man. According to Carl Jung, there are stages in life through which every person must pass. During the first part of life, a person’s world is his family. During adolescence, a transitional period, the person prepares to leave the family and go out into the world. In the industrialized world, family and school help one prepare for this new stage; in tribal societies, rites of passage are arranged. Then, the person enters society and creates his own life. After becoming the person he was meant to become, according to Jung, man has to connect with the cosmos (or God) and place his life within the context of an even larger circle. This final step takes place during the last years of his life.",

This was the house of the Richarte family, one of Arteaga’s subtenants who had settled on the ridge between the peaks of Mount Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu. Introductions were awkward?the farmers, who had selected the site at least in part because it was an excellent place to elude nosy government officials, were surely rattled by the arrival of a six-feet-four white man with yellow hair and a military escort. Once Arteaga explained the reason for Bingham’s appearance, however, the Richartes laid a poncho across a wooden bench and invited the American to sit down. They offered their guest, who hadn’t packed a lunch, sweet potatoes and “dripping gourds full of cool delicious water.”",

He was lying in a cramped position under a low canopy, looking at the front of an unfamiliar building above which small clouds rosy with sunlight drove, quite empty of any sense. Then his abdominal muscles completed the retch upon which he had lost consciousness and he heaved himself up and sprawled into the foot of the car, banging his head on the door. The blow fetched him completely to and he opened the door and half fell to the ground and dragged himself up and turned toward the station at a stumbling run. He fell. On hands and knees he looked at the empty siding and up at the sunfilled sky with unbelief and despair. He rose and ran on, in his stained dinner jacket, his burst collar and broken hair. I passed out, he thought in a kind of rage, I passed out. I passed out.",

Sure, there were fantastic sunsets over the beaches in LA—but I was always too busy working or stuck in traffic to see them. Up here watching the progression of colors over the peaks was our evening entertainment. How had we grown so apart from this simple pleasure in our modern lives? How much more would people cherish this God-given orb if every day we paused to watch displays like these? The swelling moon rose up over the lake from between the peaks, completing the picture. Muir had called the Sierra “The Range of Light,” and I could see why. We’d earned this view climbing the Staircase, and now it seemed to me it really was a staircase to Heaven.",

Only Phu-Tsering looks happy as ever; he is actually amused. “Solu!” he says of Dawa and Gyaltsen, referring to a valley clan; they are not true mountaineers such as himself. Phu-Tsering comes from Khumbu, southwest of Everest, where most high-altitude Sherpas are born; he has accompanied expeditions that climbed Makalu (French, 1971: 27,790’) and Manaslu (German, 1973: 26,658’) and has all sorts of certificates. The cook has his own snow goggles; Jang-bu, though improvident, had borrowed a spare pair from GS; and Tukten and two of the Tamangs had sense enough to tie slitted rags around their heads, to squint through—but why didn’t all have sense enough? GS, disgusted, says he is continually astonished by the poor adaptation of Himalayan peoples to their environment.",

Here we were joined by Loizus ‘the Bear’ and Andreas ‘the Seafarer’ who were both waiting for the bus up to the village. ‘The Bear’ had been buying wood for the balcony window-frames upstairs and was pleased with his expedition. His tongue loosened under the influence of the white wine and he unbent enough to make a few gentle little jokes. But then the news came on the radio and the talk drifted round to the one subject which nagged the public mind like a toothache. ‘I’m so sick of Enosis, I really am,’ said an old beggar in the back of the shop. ‘What will we do with it when we get it?’ Loizus smiled and said: ‘Gently now. It is for our children. But there is no hurry, even the Archbishop says so; besides the British are our friends’ (touching my arm) ‘and they will see that we get a square deal.’",

The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean toward each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the Sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.",

During the time the White House was under siege, she climbed into it through a window to take pictures of the defenders inside. She also witnessed the fighting for the Ostankino TV station, where she was under fire. A New York Times photographer was shot through the lung and nearly died. “I was thinking I could not believe this,” she said. “There were a whole field of dead people out there.” Afterward, she traveled often to Chechnya to photograph the conflict there. For pictures she took in Chechnya and elsewhere in Russia she won the 1998 Leica Medal of Excellence, awarded by the camera company and Mother Jones magazine. Heidi Bradner lives in London now.

Rather than running on electricity like the autopilot, the Monitor had a rudder attached to gears connected to the tiller by a block-and-tackle system. From the stern, it steered the boat with wind power. A wooden-paddle wind vane was set into a position determined by the relative direction of the wind and a compass course.",

Then we continued on for another half-mile to the Dambudass bazaar, where three Pathan hucksters between them sell flour, rock-salt, tea, sugar, tinned milk, kerosene, cigarettes, matches, cloth and soap. (Judging by the appearance of the locals this last item is not in great demand.) Another tea-house-cum-doss-house completes the ‘bazaar’ and is run by a charming old man with a face like an elongated walnut, under a cap of gay, glass-decorated brocade. He squats on top of his mud-stove, ready to prepare chi and chapattis on request, and he refused to accept payment for the two cups of tea we drank while waiting for a merchant to provide us with a packet of tea and a tin of milk. Now we are equipped to brew tea on our own kerosene stove.",

I can understand nothing anybody says, behind a palisade of sanitary masks. I know only that I am alien to them, that they are talking about me, and I suddenly feel irretrievably separate.\nLater one of the women comes in with a thermos of hot water, which she sets down by the porcelain tea-cups on my table: a Chinese custom. Tentatively I ask about life here, and she starts to talk in a shy Mandarin.\nThe work is lonely. She earns 350 yuan a month, less than fifty dollars. She gazes at me with something between hope and anxiety, and says: ‘My face is pale, did you notice?’ She pulls off her mask.\n‘Yes.’ I do now; it is broad and strange.\n‘It’s like a Westerner’s. Someone–my grandfather’s father, I think–came from somewhere else. I’m not sure where…’\nShe sleeps in a cubicle behind a glass window: a bed, a chair, a ring of keys. ‘It can’t be helped.’ She points out her parents’ home on my map. It is a desert village eighty miles away. Then she leaves.\nBut she takes away with her my sense of alienation. Suddenly the world beyond the room no longer belongs to others, or to anyone at all. Solitude is its natural condition. Fancifully I imagine it inhabited only by the excluded: a mass of exiles.\nIn the next-door room, hours later, I am woken by a raucous argument, then somebody weeping.",

The United States from Maine to California stretches across four time zones; in Siberia there are eight. The contiguous United States plus most of Europe could fit inside it. Across the middle of Siberia, latitudinally for thirty-six hundred miles, runs the Russian taiga, the largest forest in the world.",

    "target_paragraph": "We came to the end of a pondlike pool, and Snake Eyes ran aground. Salmon were thrashing up the riffle there—backs exposed, sculling against water and stones. Toward the bottom of the rip, water collected, becoming heavy and white and two feet deep. The river then curved right—a bending chute with a cut bank on one side and an apron of gravel on the other. Over the cut bank a sweeper had recently fallen, a spruce whose trunk reached into the river. Its green boughs spread over the white water. The swiftest of the current went under the branches, so the problem presented to Kauffmann and me was to get into the kayak in fast water and then collect ourselves at once for a move around the tree. Sweepers tend to trap boats and hold them almost broadside to the current while the weight of the river rolls them over. Kauffmann and I attacked the situation with the same easy confidence we had displayed over the years on a number of analogous occasions, beginning with a near double drowning in 1955. Standing in the rain in the fast water, we settled into Snake Eyes and flew at the sweeper. In concept, we would skirt it to the right. In practice, we hit it dead center. Kauffmann was still reminding me that this was our last opportunity to save the final American wilderness when Snake Eyes bought the river. The thought occurred to me as I pitched head first into the rushing water that I had not often involuntarily overturned on a river trip, and that on almost all the occasions when I had the last thing I had seen on my way to the bottom was Kauffmann. Tact restrained me from mentioning this to him until he had come up out of the river. Meanwhile, I jumped to my feet. The water was waist deep, cold as a wine bucket. I retrieved Kauffmann’s hat. Under the gin-clear water, his head, with its radical economy of hair, looked like an onion. Snake Eyes was upside down. I wrenched it right side up, then took its painter and hurried out of the river. From the moment we spilled until I was standing on dry gravel, scarcely fifteen seconds went by. Kauffmann was soaked, but I was not. My rain gear had been drawn tight at the neck and had elastic cuffs. I was half wet—in harlequin patches, and not much on the chest or the back. A piece at a time, we floated our duffel out of Snake Eyes—sleeping bags, clothes bags. Then we dumped out the water, repacked the duffel, and got back onto the river.",

Most of the neighbouring houses were empty and one had been half-demolished by settlers in retaliation for the owner’s refusal to sell. A large sheet of corrugated iron hung loose from a freestanding gable end and when the wind rose its clattering sounded like protests reverberating through this otherwise silent street. If I leaned out of my iron-barred window I could see – within 100 yards – three separate army posts guarding the bright new settlement buildings that towered above Al-Khalil’s ancient souk.",

Daylight itself usually was tamped down under clouds and falling snow, but I was awake for only a few hours of it, my internal clock having been turned around by all the time zones I’d crossed. Unable to sleep, I put on my full cold-weather outfit and walked the city in the early hours. A bank display on Ulitsa Lenina showed the temperature to be −18° (Celsius) at 5:18 a.m.; a light wind coming down the packed-snow sidewalk reinforced the cold. Nobody was about, for good reason. In the clear sky, a thumbnail-paring of a moon sat just above the horizon. To see the Big Dipper I had to crane my neck far back. At a few degrees lower than directly overhead, the North Star hovered like the point of a pushpin.",

Before driving into Montemerano, we take a little detour to Saturnia, perhaps the oldest town in Italy if Cortona isn’t. It would have to be if, as legend has it, Saturn, son of sky and earth, founded it. The warm waterfall, legend also tells us, first poured forth when the horse of Orlando (Roland in English) pawed the ground with his hoof. A town on Via Clodia has to be older than anything I can grasp. I practice saying “I live on Via Clodia,” imagining a life on such an ancient street. The town is shady and active, not at all lost in time. A few highly bronzed people from the expensive hotel near the falls seem to be looking for something to buy but the shops are plain. They settle at an outdoor café and order colorful drinks in tall glasses.",

The contrast with the ill-clad, unhealthy Kasauli toddlers was marked; yet these Simla children, though obviously contented and cheerful, were also noticeably more subdued and disciplined – no doubt along kind but firm Western lines.

So, like his new-found fellow countryman, he too felt, beneath the extravagance and intemperance of the man's language, a certain justice in the comparison. He was aware, as indeed the other must have been, of the huge sum of all America's lacks. He knew that all, alas, was not friendship, was not freedom, was not love beyond the Atlantic. But he felt, as his new friend must also have felt, that the essence of America's hope had not been wholly ruined, its promise of fulfilment not shattered utterly. And like the other man, he felt that it would be very good to be back home again, out of the poisonous constrictions of this atmosphere--back home where, whatever America might lack, there was still air to breathe in, and winds to clear the air.",

That was a meal to remember, eaten by the brilliant light of an icy full moon with mountains looming everywhere along the horizon, like fabulous monsters that might suddenly move in the strange colourless light. And indeed they might move, literally, here. Carlos warned us that earth-tremors are frequent and we mustn’t be alarmed if the verandah shudders during the night.

    "target_paragraph": "You disembark at Siberia’s biggest station, then taxi into the third most spacious city in Russia. Space is the sterile luxury of Novosibirsk. In summer it hangs in vacant stillness over the flattened boulevards. In winter it starts to move, and howls between the islanded buildings and across the squares. The city is a claustrophobe’s dream. Its roads sweep empty between miles of apartment-blocks and Stalinist hulks moaning with prefabricated pilasters and cornices. As for the people, there are one and a half million of them, but they seem lost in space. They trickle along the pavements to work. You become one of them, reduced. The traffic, too, seems sparse and far away, meandering over a delta of stone and tarmac.\nLonging for intimacy, you avoid the 888-room Hotel Novosibirsk. But instead you find yourself in the void of Lenin Square, where the largest opera house in Russia, bigger even than the Bolshoi, crouches like a square-headed tortoise under a dome of silver scales. To reach it you have to sprint 200 yards across traffic-sprinkled space. Then you are turned away. It is closed in August.\nSo you stand, a little ashamed of your indifference–for this, after all, is Siberia’s industrial giant, its centre of heavy metallurgy and machine-tool manufacture, of international trade conferences and joint ventures–you stand on a traffic island christened by a gold-domed chapel: because here, it has been calculated, lies the geographical centre of Russia. You wait, as visitors wait in Times Square or Piccadilly Circus, expecting something to happen. But nothing does, of course. And you are alone. The streets reel away on either side. From the granite steps of the chapel you gaze miles down the main street at the shadow of a bridge over the Ob river, to where on the far bank glimmers a suburb of smokestacks and flat-blocks built in Khrushchev’s time, now misted in smog. Here the Ob, the fourth longest river in the world, moves imperceptibly towards the Arctic–dropping only two inches a mile–and downstream will fill with industrial waste and toxic oil, becoming so polluted that in winter it sometimes fails to freeze.\nSpace, in the end, may be all you remember of Novosibirsk. It is Siberia’s gift. The vacancy of the land seems to infiltrate every town, or license it to sprawl. The flat-blocks carry on for mile after monotonous mile. Railway stations, whose tracks and sidings multiply ten or fourteen abreast, lie far from their town centres. And the rivers wind in enigmatically from nowhere like sky-coloured lakes, and curl out again to nowhere. When you hunt for them on your map, you may find only blue threads, tributaries of a tributary to some distant giant. The eye is met by eternal sameness. It begins to glaze.",

He is 6 3 tall, thin and strong, with a freckled and sun-polished face, rimless glasses and a mop of curly dark hair. On the flat he moves with a bouncy lope that eats up the miles, and on the steep he moves with a steady herring-boned tread that eats up the yards. He has circumambulated Kailash four times, and he has made scores of what ecologists call ‘foot transects’: data-gathering treks, which in Jon’s case sometimes lasted months. Foot transects make possible an otherwise unattainable acquaintance with a region: the walker records and locates what he or she sees – species, scat, scrapes, weather, erosion – and the accidental encounters born of the transect’s line are part of its virtue as a method. Walking Himalayan paths again and again over twenty years has given Jon an exceptional first-hand knowledge – what in Greek might be termed metis, or in Chinese nei heng, both terms suggesting a ‘knowing through experience’ – but he wears it lightly and gives of it generously.",

A chorus of belching sounds began to fill the air, followed by a powerful stench. “It’s not a full sea lion experience until you smell them,” David said. Sea lions crowded all over the island’s lower rocks, like ants on a dropped lollipop, waddling awkwardly and shoving one another into the water. The instant they submerged, they began to swim with the grace of dolphins. As the other passengers snapped photos of a cormorant swallowing a fish that wriggled its way down the bird’s long neck, David tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Look behind you.” To the south, six whales were spouting, their spray like depth charges in the still water.",
