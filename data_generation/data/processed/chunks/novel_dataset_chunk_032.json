And stolidly he would plunge forward against the grey and frozen desolation of that place to meet him.",

The village street lay empty, blazing in the sun. Everybody was indoors at tea. James too was probably having tea, she thought, under the cedar, in his cool garden. And she remembered that she owed Alice a call, and it occurred to her that she might as well pay it now as later, and get it off her mind; and accordingly, only stopping in her cottage long enough to tidy herself a little after her immense walk, and brush the dust off her shoes, she proceeded at once to the Vicarage, using the short cut Alice had used to call on her, the short cut through the churchyard, which landed her familiarly on the lawn instead of at the front door—but if Alice could be familiar, so could she—and, arriving unseen and unannounced, she emerged straight into the Vicarage garden, and there, instead of James, found the Vicar of Benendon St. Michael, having tea under the cedar by himself, as if the whole place belonged to him.",

I want to count the seconds between flashes as this number identifies the buoy and thus its location. Time passes and the buoy continues to play hide-and-seek, but eventually I determine that it’s flashing in four-second intervals. From consulting the chart, I know that the one closest to the inlet has a six-second interval. The one I see is a few miles further to the east of the inlet.\nHours pass and the sun begins to rise; the sea changes from black to grey as the sky goes through a series of color changes – purple, red, orange, yellow, blue. The morning is beautiful, but I am weary. We are now passing to the south of the Dry Tortugas, and I can turn us to the west. The channel I seek is on the south side of the National Park, which is surrounded by shallow reef. I need to gybe, so I pull on the mainsheet and center the boom over the cockpit, then I ready the leeward jib-sheet, move myself to the leeward side of the cockpit, push the tiller away from me, and Sobrius turns west. The mainsail shifts to the other side with an audible low-pitched snap, then the headsail does the same. I slowly ease and then release the windward jib-sheet and at the same time pull in on the leeward sheet and cleat it off.\nI spot another flashing light, but it only stays above the horizon for a second or two in the waves. Eventually I can see it long enough to count six seconds between flashes. I’m getting closer.\nIn my peripheral vision, I see a bright light pointing right at us. What is this? Is there a ship approaching? I check the AIS and see no ships in the area. The light disappears, but it comes back and points at me again. It is so bright, but there is no ship in view beneath the light. My mind is tired. I consult the wisdom of the chartplotter, and the chartplotter knows the answer. The source of the bright light is the lighthouse on Loggerhead Key. I laugh at myself. My mind is running slowly.",

A variety of roadside pullouts are therefore easy for hikers to access—opportunities for trash cans, food, showers, and laundry make the trail through the park a decidedly cushy experience. Unless, of course, you are trying to hike the trail in less than sixty days.",

When I opened a coach door at random its inner panel fell off, blocking my way. Clambering over it, I groped down a corridor by a glimmer of platform light and found an empty compartment where I was still alone at 9.45. The engine then made eerie noises, setting it apart from any other engine I’ve known, and moved off at a slow walking speed. All this seemed too good to be true; silence and darkness blessed my coach, whatever its number: I could stretch out and sleep, at least until the first stop.",

Hidden streams, hardly noticed at first, were seldom out of earshot; but the waterfalls, though they were visible for miles, seemed inaudible until I was on them. I could see them cataracting from ledge to ledge, dividing and joining again, vanishing under the trees and dropping in long parabolas to the river; and all in silence, with seemingly as little motion as white horsetails swaying in the faintest of breezes. Then my path would round a spur of rock and a murmur which had been growing slowly was all at once loud as thunder. From a ledge stalactitic with icicles tons of pale liquid jadeite crashed among the rocks, and the spray of its impact loaded the branches with fans of frozen drops. A trough of boulders and a tunnel of ice and frozen bracken rushed it to the cliff’s edge and there, in a cloud of mist, flung it clear of the clustering stalactites and the tree-tops and sent it booming into the abyss and out of sight. Then the ensuing furlongs would hush the roar and slow the headlong pace to the ruffle of a faraway horsetail again.",

The trailers wouldn’t have fit in the small area that surrounded the pumps. At her suggestion I’d unhitched from the front trailer before fueling. Standing next to the pumps with the scent of diesel in the air I had felt grateful when I looked around at the unique geometry of the pumps next to the shop and tire lanes beside the guard shack at the single entry gate to the entire facility. Margie had been right. I would have gotten stuck and would have had to break down the whole rig just to get on my way. The resulting mess would have grossly inconvenienced many other drivers who needed to get to the fuel pumps or get a tire change or just drive out the gate. Margie had saved me from spectacular embarrassment and a very real, technical challenge.",

The edges of the beach have changed over the years, it’s larger than it used to be, the vines and bamboo tamed, we’ve cut down a few dead trees and there is more space to see the sky. Will I come back and will it feel small? Will it feel like a happy place or just a place where she was stuck, where we were all stuck? The sky is red now. I pick up a dark stone, split down the middle, the inside the colour of caramel and melted milk chocolate, and hold it in my palm, feeling its trapped warmth. Then I throw it, with a heavy plop, into the water, and watch the ripples spread outwards.",

But that spectacle did not affect her preoccupation. Her countenance, a natural carnation, slightly embrowned by the season, deepened on the cheeks with the beating of the rain-drops, and a portion of her hair, which the pressure of the cows’ flanks had, as usual, caused to tumble down from its fastenings, hung below the curtain of her calico bonnet; the rain began to make it clammy, till it hardly was better than seaweed.",

Neither is there any kind of a trail, so instead of cutting our way through the jungle, we waded in the river, crisscrossing from time to time. The going was slow at first. Each time we wanted to cross the river, we took off our socks and shoes. Kevin was the first to lose patience and begin crossing with his shoes on. Soon we were all following his example. It had been difficult wading across the river barefoot anyway. The water was very cold, and smooth, sharp stones cut into the soles of our feet. It was more comfortable to cross with shoes on, but we soon had blisters from walking in wet socks.",

They are webbed with the paths of eland and wildebeest and Thompson’s gazelle and their hollows and valleys are trampled by thousands of zebra.

There are no roads. There are no villages, no towns, no telegraph. There is nothing, as far as you can see, or walk, or ride, except grass and rocks and a few trees and the animals that live there.",

A great cut glass chandelier from the rectory hung dimly coruscating in the centre, reflected and re-reflected in convex gilt mirrors, topped by eagles. A great number of books had gone to make place on the white panelled walls for the mirrors, and for the fair orange and brown pictures by Turner, also from the rectory. From the rectory had come the immense scarlet and lapis lazuli carpet, the great brass fire-basket and appendages, the great curtains that, in the three long windows, on their peacock-blue Chinese silk showed parti-coloured cranes ascending in long flights—and all the polished Chippendale arm-chairs. Amongst all these, gracious, trailing, stopping with a tender gesture to rearrange very slightly the crimson roses in the famous silver bowls, still in dark blue silks, with an amber necklace and her elaborate black hair, waved exactly like that of Julia Domna in the Musée Lapidaire at Arles, moved Mrs Macmaster—also from the rectory. Macmaster had achieved his desire: even to the shortbread cakes and the peculiarly scented tea that came every Friday morning from Princes Street. And, if Mrs Macmaster hadn’t the pawky, relishing humour of the great Scots ladies of past days, she had in exchange her deep aspect of comprehension and tenderness. An astonishingly beautiful and impressive woman: dark hair; dark, straight eyebrows; a straight nose; dark blue eyes in the shadows of her hair and bowed, pomegranate lips in a chin curved like the bow of a Greek boat …",

Large locked buildings, with boarded-up windows, suggested a certain level of lost prosperity. The Haredi way of life is not conducive to commerce and most business premises seem ready to go into receivership. Along the main streets’ pavements flowed a slow trickle of shoppers – all Haredi, mainly women with broods following. It was a very windy morning and litter swirled through the air, being augmented by toddlers in pushchairs as they finished their ice-cream or ersatz fruit juice. Overhead, laundry flapped wildly on the broken balconies of square stone houses. The men all stared at me with unconcealed animosity, the women with a mix of surprise and scorn. Although seeing no trace of Mea She’arim’s original walls, I felt, unsurprisingly, ‘here is my first experience of a genuine ghetto’. It’s odd to be aware of such intense and general dislike/disapproval of oneself simply because one is not – cannot be – kosher. Usually, in hostile environments, there’s the possibility that barriers may be overcome through some chance meeting. Not so in this exclusive neighbourhood. I found myself hoping the internet soon demolishes the walls imprisoning these Haredim.",

A man wearing earmuffs gripped his nostrils between his thumb and forefinger and blew hard, throwing the contents on the floor, then pointed us towards a staircase. It led up to a landing that looked like the scene of a mass murder. Paan splashed the floors and mounted the walls, one well-aimed spurt obscuring the final ‘t’ on the Do Not Spit sign. Another sign pointed to Refreshment Room and a pair of blondes appeared from that direction and came down the staircase holding tickets. Both girls wore glittering bindis and Pushkar passports – threads around their wrists. Touts and fake priests often pounce on tourists new to the holy town, offering flowers and blessings in exchange for a few thousand rupees. In return, a sacred thread is tied around the wrist, representing a vaccination against further hassle. Pious passport-wearers preserved the thread for months after they had arrived home in Fulham, and wore it until it smelt, rotted and fell off in the shower. This was definitely the right way to the tourist bureau.",

At first I would wait for him to catch up, bitching every step of the way and pausing after each three or four shuffling paces to wipe his brow and look sourly at his immediate future. It was painful to behold in every way. Eventually I waited to see him pull into view, just to confirm that he was still coming, that he wasn’t lying on the path palpitating or hadn’t thrown down his pack in disgust and gone looking for Wes Wisson. I would wait and wait, and eventually his shape would appear among the trees, breathing heavily, moving with incredible slowness, and talking in a loud, bitter voice to himself. Halfway up the third big hill, the 3,400-foot-high Black Mountain, I stood and waited a long while, and thought about going back, but eventually turned and struggled on. I had enough small agonies of my own.",
