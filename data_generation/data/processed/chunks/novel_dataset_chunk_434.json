Sometimes it feels as if the forty miles or so that people can see across the glassy air here they can also see inside themselves, as if, in this penetrating emptiness, you are thrown down and down some inner well. Sometimes it feels as if the land itself invites you almost to see in its changing moods a reflection of your own and, in the turning of the seasons, some deeper, inner shift from light to dark.",

The world of adventure and of enterprise, dark with hurrying storms, glittering in raw sunlight, an unanswered question and an unanswerable doubt hidden in the fold of every hill. Into it you must go alone, separated from the troops of friends that walk the rose alleys, stripped of the purple and line linen that impede the fighting arm, roofless, defenceless, without possessions. The voice of the wind shall be heard instead of the persuasive voices of counsellors, the touch of the rain and the prick of the frost shall be spurs sharper than praise or blame, and necessity shall speak with an authority unknown to that borrowed wisdom which men obey or discard at will. So you leave the sheltered close, and, like the man in the fairy story, you feel the bands break that were riveted about your heart as you enter the path that stretches across the rounded shoulder of the earth.",

Osaka was so important as the seat of diplomacy that the capital was based there several times in the seventh century before finally being moved to Nara. In the process, numerous families from China and Korea emigrated to the Naniwa region, and Heian-period censuses show that its population was heavily of continental origin. In the late sixteenth century, Osaka’s harbor shifted from Naniwa to Sakai, a few kilometers south. As Chinese silk and Southeast Asian ceramics flooded into Japan, the Osaka merchants grew rich; among them was Sen no Rikyu, founder of tea ceremony. For several decades Osaka was again Japan’s window to the world, and outshone Kyoto as the source of new cultural developments. During the Edo period, the Shogunate closed the ports and three hundred years of isolation set in. But Osaka continued to thrive, its merchants establishing themselves as wholesale rice brokers and moneylenders. Certain unique occupations grew up, such as ‘runners’, who still exist even today; their job is to visit one wholesaling street and jot down prices, then dash over to the next street to report them to competitors – and then do the same thing in reverse.",

    "target_paragraph": "What could it have been, I wondered, that carried off these two little brothers just a week apart? A fever? It seemed unlikely in July. An accident in which one died and the other lingered? Two unrelated events? I pictured the parents crouched at Joshua F.’s beside, watching his life ebb, praying to God not to take him as well, and having their hopes crushed. Isn’t life shitty? Everywhere I looked there was disappointment and heartbreak recorded in the stones: ‘Joseph, son of Ephraim and Sarah Carter, died March 18 1846, aged 18 yrs’, ‘Alma Foster, daut. of Zadock and Hannah Richardson, d. May 22, 1847, AE. 17 yrs’. So many were so young. I became infected with an inexpressible melancholy as I wandered alone among these hundreds of stilled souls, the emptied lives, the row upon row of ended dreams. Such a sad place! I stood there in the mild October sunshine, feeling so sorry for all these luckless people and their lost lives, reflecting bleakly on mortality and on my own dear, cherished family so far away in England, and I thought, ‘Well, fuck this,’ and walked back down the hill to the car.",

The southern and leeward coasts of Hawaii as far as Kaawaloa are not much more attractive than coal-fields. Contrasted with the shining shores of Hilo, they are as dust and ashes; long reaches of black lava and miles of clinkers marking the courses of lava-flows, whose black desolation and deformity nature, as yet, has done almost nothing to clothe. Cocoa-nut trees usually, however, fringe the shore, but were it not for the wonderful colour of the ocean, like liquid, transparent turquoise, revealing the coral forests shelving down into purple depths, and the exciting proximity of sharks, it would have been wearisome. After leaving the bay where Captain Cook met his death, we passed through a fleet of twenty-seven canoes, each one hollowed out of the trunk of a single tree, from fifteen to twenty-five feet long,. about twenty inches deep, hardly wide enough for a fat man, and pointed at both ends. On one side there is an outrigger formed of two long, bent sticks, to the outer ends of which is bound a curved beam of light wood, which skims along the surface of the water, rendering the canoe secure from an upset on that side, while the weight of the outrigger makes an upset on the other very unlikely. In calms they are paddled, and shoot over the water with great rapidity, but whenever there is any breeze a small sprit-sail is used. They are said to be able to stand very rough water, but they are singularly precarious and irresponsible looking contrivances, and for these, as well as for all other seas, I should much prefer a staunch whale-boat. We sailed for some hours along a lava coast, streamless, rainless, verdureless, blazing under the fierce light of a tropical sun, and some time after noon anchored in the scorching bay of Kawaihae.",

Imagine actually being at Genoa, seeing its name written up in the station just like any other name—at Nervi it was pouring, and when at last towards midnight, for again the train was late, they got to Mezzago, the rain was coming down in what seemed solid sheets. But it was Italy. Nothing it did could be bad. The very rain was different— straight rain, falling properly on to one's umbrella; not that violently blowing English stuff that got in everywhere. And it did leave off; and when it did, behold the earth would be strewn with roses.",

The ducks had moved offshore to larger water ponds, so McKinlay and Hadley tried their luck trapping foxes, and managed to catch a young one, but it was small and provided so little meat that, as McKinlay put it, “It merely proved tantalizing.” Still, they kept trying, hoping to get more, not just for the meat, but for the skins. McKinlay imagined wishfully that he might capture enough to make a fur jacket for the coming winter.",

We walked into the city centre through streets Sunday-quiet; all shops and most offices were closed. Jennifer seemed to know everyone in the mainly black throng around the church and as we were queuing to be frisked by ANC marshals only the heavy SAP presence generated unease. A Xhosa beside me muttered, ‘Why they come around with all that tear-gas? They’re not here to protect us. If the AWB came they could shoot first and be arrested after – like in Vanderbiljpark!’ He was referring to the shooting dead last Sunday of two black men, and the serious wounding of two others, by a middle-aged right-winger. Under the noses of the police, this CP member fired into the crowd from his bakkie during an orderly Hani protest march.",

In the hallway I confronted an antique twenty-person pulley-lift, its mechanism visible through iron bars, its groans and squeals unsettling. In fact such lifts are meticulously maintained, like the fun-fair equipment in Santiago; a building’s residents being bottom-of-the-pilers makes their safety no less important than anyone else’s. (In theory there is no ‘pile’ in Cuba, in real life Revolutions can’t overcome individual limitations.) However, at that date my research had not encompassed municipal virtues so I chose the stairs. Sections of the rusted wrought-iron banisters hung loose or were missing and in the dim light one had to watch one’s step while negotiating loose chunks of marble cladding. The five landings gave access to long galleries overlooking an unadorned rectangular courtyard that seemed dark despite its canopy of blue sky. Ten narrow doors opened off each gallery, the flats’ numbers crudely chalked on the wall and often indecipherable because of falling plaster. This whole building looked as though it had been neglected not merely since 1959 but from its date of completion.",

It even has its own airport, and the resort that has sprung up to serve it, called Yulara, is the third largest community in the Territory when full. Yulara stands a discreet and respectful dozen or so miles from the rock itself, so we stopped there first to get rooms. It consists essentially of a lazy loop road along which are tucked a range of accommodations, from campgrounds and a youth hostel up to the most sumptuously deluxe of resort hotels.",

She was owned by a Chinaman, chartered by an Arab, and commanded by a sort of renegade New South Wales German, very anxious to curse publicly his native country, but who, apparently on the strength of Bismarck’s victorious policy, brutalised all those he was not afraid of, and wore a ‘blood-and-iron’ air,’ combined with a purple nose and a red moustache. After she had been painted outside and whitewashed inside, eight hundred pilgrims (more or less) were driven on board of her as she lay with steam up alongside a wooden jetty.",

I enquired about the infant’s age, sex and nocturnal habits (babies are useful ice-picks) and at once its mother began to unwind.

This duty is to be considered a precise act of charity and of justice toward those who are in haste to attend to their own affairs.” (It is also forbidden to “attach money to sacred images,” which news has not yet reached New York or, indeed, Naples. . . . When I grew up, Jehovah's Witnesses taught me to regard the pinning of paper money to ambulatory statues of Mary as evidence of the corruption of the Church, which perhaps it is, though I could not [and cannot] see the harm.)",

It wasn’t the distance that delayed our crossing for a week. It wasn’t the fifteen knot wind from the north or the five knot current in the Gulf Stream. It was the combination of these two forces that can turn the Gulf Stream into an impenetrable wall for a small boat. We were waiting at anchor for just such an event to pass. Two weeks prior to our crossing, the leading edge of a stationary weather system over Georgia brought fifteen to twenty knots of wind against the flow of the Stream. This is a very normal condition in South Florida in autumn. When this strong north wind blows in opposition to a strong current it causes the waves to pile up into a disorganized mess of confused square topped waves. Even a boater on a schedule would have reservations about venturing into the strait under such conditions. The rest usually turn back. If they don’t they may even live to tell the big adventure story.",

A sprawling industrial conurbation of some 600,000 people, the Netherland’s second largest metropolis has none of the canals, cobbles or picturesque bridges of its more famous rival, Amsterdam, and as such is rarely troubled by tourists. However, much to my surprise, it soon began to feel like home. Literally hours after walking out of the airport in the snow, I found myself living in a tall, crooked townhouse, on a tree-lined street between a canal, a tram stop and a bar selling tiny glasses of Heineken. My Caribbean suntan swiftly faded, and my long beard joined my tattered beach clothes in a rubbish bin on the rain-soaked balcony. By the time the snow melted, my belongings had already arrived in the post from England, and I was eating bright green erwtensoep (pea soup) with gusto. The skinny girl – a feisty, fiercely intelligent Rotterdammer with a pretty smile – showed no signs of kicking me out, and I began the slow process of integrating into Dutch society.",

I sat on a stool and waited. The young man who appeared twenty minutes later had been taught English by his Hmong grandfather who fled to Thailand in 1975, learned English in a refugee camp and returned home in 1992. When Mr Khamvone condemned poor Hare as ‘a very bad bicycle’ there was nothing I could truthfully say in her defence. It seemed the Muang Kham mechanic, despite (or because of?) all his high-tech gadgetry, had done more harm than good when replacing ball bearings. Mr Khamvone devoted forty minutes to repairs, then set off on his Honda in search of a basket. Returning half an hour later, he would accept payment only for the basket. He smiled and bowed and said, ‘I enjoy helping you.’ Too soon he was to have more enjoyment of the same sort.",

After Charles Lindbergh’s flight, the Pennsylvania Railroad relaunched its service between St. Louis and the East Coast and called it, all but inevitably, the Spirit of St. Louis. Sometimes, it must be said, the names were more romantic than the journeys. The Scenic Limited, from St. Louis to Pueblo, Colorado, was mostly across northern Kansas, which was not many people’s idea of topographical sumptuousness, even in Kansas. Some names were flatly misleading. The New York, Chicago & St. Louis Railroad didn’t actually go to the stated termini, but plied more modestly between Chicago and Buffalo. The Atlantic Limited likewise never sniffed salt air, but confined itself to a daily run across northern Minnesota and Michigan.",

    "target_paragraph": "Alberti on the other hand, took from the Romans their fundamental conception of an architecture of masses and developed it, with refinements, for modern, Christian uses. To my mind, he was the better and truer architect of the two. For I personally like mas siveness and an air of solidity. Others, I know, prefer lines and lightness and would put the interior of San Lorenzo above that of Sant’ Andrea, the Pazzi chapel above San Francesco at Rimini. We shall never be reconciled. All who practise the visual arts and, presumably, all who appreciate them must have some kind of feeling for form as such. But not all are interested in the same kind of forms. The lovers of pure line and the lovers of mass stand at opposite ends of an æsthetic scale. The æsthetic passion of one artist, or one art lover, is solidity; another is moved only by linear arabesques on a flat surface. Those formal passions may be misplaced. Painters may be led by their excessive love of three-dimensional solidity quite beyond the field of painting; Michelangelo is an obvious example. Sculptors with too great a fondness for mere linear effect cease to be sculptors, and their work is no more than a flat decoration in stone or metal, meant to be seen from only one point of view and having no depth; the famous Diana attributed to Goujon (but probably by Benvenuto Cellini) is one of these statues conceived in the flat. Just as painters must not be too fond of solidity, nor sculptors too much attached to flatness, so, it seems to me, no architect should be too exclusively inter ested in lines. Architecture in the hands of a linear enthusiast takes on the too slender, spidery elegance of Brunelleschi’s work.",

The weather reminded me of showery, warm midsummer days in Ireland, when light breezes send lots of grey-white cloud moving slowly across a very blue sky. Everything everywhere looked exuberantly green, the people seemed to have an access of vitality and the air was blessedly dust-free. Yet even the rains have their disadvantages, and now the whole city reeks still more odiously of stale urine; but that is an unimportant detail compared with the golden light that comes slanting between clouds on to freshly leafy trees, tumultuously blossoming shrubs, neat, vivid paddy-fields, glowing red-brown houses and the burnished roofs of pagodas by the score.",

The farms were neat and trim, and the towns I passed through gave every air of a comfortable prosperity. It was impossible to believe that a metropolis of 4 million people lay just over the hills behind. I felt as if I had stumbled into some forgotten, magically self-contained world. There were things out here I hadn’t seen in years. Gas stations with old-fashioned pumps and no canopies over the forecourt, so that you pumped your gas in full sun, as I am sure God intended it. Metal windmills of the sort that used to stand in every Kansas farm field. Little towns with people in them—people going about their business, greeting each other with a smile and a nod. It all had a familiarity about it, but the familiarity of something half forgotten. Gradually it dawned on me that I was in the American Midwest—but it was the American Midwest of long ago. I was, in short, in the process of making the marvelous and heartwarming discovery that outside the cities it is still 1958 in Australia. Hardly seems possible, but there you are. I was driving through my childhood.",

I wanted to laugh and shout and cry; it was the end, the end of the worst boredom I had ever experienced, the worst fear and the worst exhaustion. If I had not been so tired (it was March the second, we had been walking for exactly four weeks and covered about three hundred and fifty miles), civilization might not have seemed quite so desirable in comparison with what I was leaving: the complete simplicity on the edge of subsistence, the little groves of rice-birds, the graves of the chiefs, the tiny fires at sundown, the torchlight, the devils and the dancing. But civilization, for the moment, I was ready to swallow whole, even the tin roofs, the stinking lurching lorry from which the natives on the way from market in Grand Bassa drew back with the same dread as their fellows had shown on the road to Kailahun, hiding their faces against the banks as the monstrosity ground by. The journey had begun and ended in a lorry in the stink of petrol.",

And somehow, in this stale, dark and weary odour, there was also a quality of terror, menace, and foreboding – as if the huge and dingy chronicle of human tragedy and error which this grim room had witnessed – all the brutal, shabby sinfulness of a little town – that swarming, hideous and tawdry fraternity of poverty, vice and error – dredged from its rat-holes in the dark depths of old brick buildings, hunted out of cheap hotels, pool rooms, greasy little lunch rooms, nigger shacks, and the rickety wooden brothels near the railroad tracks, with its vast brotherhood of scarred and battered men and women – chain-gang niggers, drunken country youths and cheap bootleggers, grimy prostitutes and all their furtive bawds and pimps, cutters, sluggers, stabbers, slashers, and brawlers – both those who live by vice and those who are its victims – this whole huge earth of pain and crime and misery had left the terrible imprint of its history so indelibly there that the weary air was impregnated with sorrow and fear, and the wood, walls, floors and ceilings were seasoned and ingrained with the substance of human wretchedness.",
