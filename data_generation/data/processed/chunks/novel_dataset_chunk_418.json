I went to RV centers, where salesmen showed me how to pull tubes and wires from hidden panels to set up for the night and how to put them all back when it was time to leave. I lifted my short legs onto tall steps to enter the driver ’s seat and wished for something smaller?a new VW Eurovan. Designed for weekend camping, it was the largest vehicle I could tolerate driving and the smallest home I could consider.",

Saqqara is a massive archaeological site, home to several large and prominent step pyramids (the pyramid of Djoser, the Red pyramid, and the Bent pyramid). Like many of the most famous sites around Egypt, Saqqara is a necropolis dotted with tombs and monuments to the dead. The site fills a broad plain on the left bank of the Nile about twenty miles upriver from Cairo. Our guidebook recommended a visit, but suggested that travelers devote a whole day to the site. There were few services at Saqqara, our guidebook warned – bring sunscreen and pack a box lunch.",

I passed through miniature cactus forests of samphire and between torn chunks of ferroconcrete. The surface of the mud, a gritty curded paste, was intricately marked with the filigree of worm tracks and crab scrabbles. In the centre of the causeway, where the mud had dried and cracked into star patterns, there were many wader footprints – sandpipers, oystercatchers and gulls – and I remembered the printed snow of my night-walk back in Cambridge. The slithery clay offered pleasure to the foot, and mud curled up between my toes with each step, oily as butter. By the time we reached the sea wall, David and I both wore diving boots of clay. We washed them off in a puddle, and stepped up onto a boat ramp. We had made landfall.",

He partook ravenously, without restraint and decency, cutting thick slices with the sharp carving knife, and swallowing them without bread. In the course of that refection it occurred to Mr Verloc that he was not hearing his wife move about the bedroom as he should have done. The thought of finding her perhaps sitting on the bed in the dark not only cut Mr Verloc’s appetite, but also took from him the inclination to follow her upstairs just yet. Laying down the carving knife, Mr Verloc listened with careworn attention.",

Frederick Parmenter was a payroll clerk, Alessandro Berardelli was his guard. They were carrying $15,776.51 in cash in two metal boxes, the week’s wages for five hundred employees. Their route took them past another shoe factory, Rice and Hutchins, which occupied a five-story building built hard by the road, giving it a dark and looming air.",

I stayed the night in a bargeman’s tavern at Mohács in order to see the battlefield where Suleiman had overthrown King Lajos: one of history’s most dark and shattering landmarks: a defeat as fatal to Hungary as Kossovo to the Serbs and Constantinople to the Greeks.)",

He soon saw that the tendency of all promenaders was towards a particular spot in the Walks, and eventually proceeded thither himself. The notes of a stringed band came from the enclosure that Farfrae had erected—the pavilion as he called it—and when the Mayor reached it he perceived that a gigantic tent had been ingeniously constructed without poles or ropes. The densest point of the avenue of sycamores had been selected, where the boughs made a closely interlaced vault overhead; to these boughs the canvas had been hung, and a barrel roof was the result. The end towards the wind was enclosed, the other end was open. Henchard went round and saw the interior.",

Soon a blaze, pale in the sunny air; and when the wood was burning strongly he laid the coat and the bible and the trophy and the photograph on the flames and prodded them and turned them until they were consumed.

I tiptoed up the stairs—they had deep treads and lower-than-normal risers, which create the effect of a person floating as she ascends or descends. At the top of the staircase a heavily carved door presumably led to the main quarters of the house. Above the stairwell was a domed ceiling painted with a skyscape—a mini–Sistine Chapel that looked to have been done about six hundred years ago—inset with windows, which let natural light into the interior of the house. The wall space in the stairwell was large, perfect for hanging a massive tapestry or two. What a great place to live, I thought.",

The quiet bearing of one who brimmed with an inner activity characterized Elizabeth-Jane at this period. She took long walks into the country two or three times a week, mostly in the direction of Budmouth. Sometimes it occurred to him that when she sat with him in the evening after these invigorating walks she was civil rather than affectionate; and he was troubled; one more bitter regret being added to those he had already experienced at having, by his severe censorship, frozen up her precious affection when originally offered.",

I had noticed it before, mainly because I could see nothing of it but the tip of its mast and a little of the ragged sail, blackened with pig's blood to make it last longer. I remembered it as we all walked to the other rail to watch the planes, because the one fishing boat still left on our flank was now completely empty. Its crew had climbed aboard our ship and was crouching beneath the deck rail—a skinny bearded man in a loincloth, a plump middle-aged woman with her hair in a braid down her back, a little boy about eight years old, and a naked baby who could just stand up. They all, except the baby, squatted on their heels, hiding unnecessarily, for the planes' pilots could not possibly have sighted them where they were. The bearded man grinned wryly, flashing his teeth. The woman's eyes were dull and flat, and the little boy was impassive. Only the man seemed awake, almost merry; then I saw that his hands, holding the baby around the waist, were gripping so tightly that the knuckles were pale.",

Strung between the bushes the webs made by a very large sort of spider were as complex as wire entanglements and, when the sun rose over the hill ahead, they glistened like thick white cords.

I tried to imagine what it must have been like and the only comparison I could relate to was the time when Mount Pinatubo erupted in June 1991 in the Philippines, and spewed out more than five cubic kilometres of magma and sent an ash cloud 35,000 metres into the air, which eventually covered Manila in a blanket of grey ash.",

She came out onto the terrace of a country house and drifted toward me, down across the lawn. D had black hair and beautiful wide eyes; in the spring breeze and light of flowers, she looked bewitched. We had been quarreling in recent days, and recriminations rose, tumbling all over one another in the rush to be spoken, yet as we drew near, the arguments aired so often in the past rose one by one and passed away in silence. There was no need to speak, the other knew to the last word what would be said. Struck dumb by this telepathy, our mouths snapped shut at the same instant, then burst into smiles at the precise timing of this comic mime of our old fights; delighted, we embraced and laughed and laughed. And still not one word had been spoken; only later did we discover that all thoughts, laughter, and emotions had been not similar but just the same, one mind, one Mind, even to this: that as we held each other, both bodies turned into sapling trees that flowed into each other, grew together in one strong trunk that pushed a taproot deeper and deeper into the ground.",

He built another crude igloo and crawled in. He was out of fuel oil, so for fluids, he sucked on bits of ice and handfuls of snow. One of his feet was badly frozen. His hands, too, felt frostbitten, the woolen gloves not nearly so warm as the mittens he’d given to Clam.",

Again there had been the roaring tumult of the people rising from their tables, linking arms together with their mugs upraised, the rhythmic swinging, the rocking back and forth to the blaring of “Ein Prosit!” Again the ritualistic spell of all those human rings in swaying, roaring, one-voiced chant there in that vast and murky hall; again the image of the savage faces in the old dark forest of barbaric time; again the sudden fear of them that froze his heart. What happened then he did not know. In that quick instant of his drunken fear, had he swung out and smashed his great stone mug into the swinelike face, the red pig’s eyes, of the hulking fellow next to him? He did not know, but there had been a fight—a murderous swinging of great mugs, a flash of knives, the sudden blinding fury of red, beer-drunk rage. And now he lay here in the hospital, his head all swathed in bandages; he lay upon his back and listened, listened to the rain.",

The Bay of Pigs is a beach resort now, and San Juan Hill is most famous for its “patio cabaret.” The Isle of Youth, long the most dreaded Alcatraz in the Caribbean, entices visitors with its International Scuba-Diving Center. There is a “Cretins’ Corner” in the Museum of the Revolution, featuring an effigy of Ronald Reagan (“Thank you, cretin,” says the sign, “for helping us strengthen the Revolution”). And one beach near Matanzas (the name means Massacres) has, somewhat less than romantically, been christened Playa Yugoslavia. Cuba, in fact, has edges and shadows not often found in other West Indian resorts: the billboards along the beach offer stern admonitions (“The best tan is acquired in movement”), and the gift stores in the hotels sell such deck-chair classics as The C.I.A. in Central America and the Caribbean. Everything here takes on a somewhat unexpected air. “Cuba’s waiting for you,” runs the official tourist slogan. “We knew you were coming.”",

Varuna gently heeled over, baring the starboard side of her maroon hull, and began to glide along in rhythm with the sea and wind. Perfect. We were on a beam reach, with the wind perpendicular to the boat, the point of sail at which any sailboat makes its best performance. The boom was sheeted in and she pranced along like a filly.",

The only way to sleep or in fact live was to lie naked on the marble floor under the paddle fan in the hotel bedroom. I was never entirely naked since I couldn’t remove my motorman’s gloves even to shower. The catch in China Rot is that you spread it merely by touching your skin; scratch your head and you had another crop of China Rot.
