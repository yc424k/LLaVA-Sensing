The mist had cleared a little by now, and the cluster of glassy towers on the opposite bank of the Maas had come into view, poking through the white clouds like toes in a foamy bathtub. Up on the bridge, I waited impatiently with a group of black-smudged children and their long-suffering parents. As the mist ascended the temperature had dropped further, and a biting North Sea wind was cutting up the river. I rested my forearms on the steel handrail of the bridge and recoiled immediately – even with a thick coat on, the polished metal was too cold to bear.",

The sun burned through the fog, revealing an idyllic landscape of lush, green pastures and quaint farmsteads. I cruised along at over three miles per hour for what felt like the first time in my life. As I drew closer to Boiling Springs, I passed more homes as well as joggers, cyclists, and dog walkers enjoying the greenway that was the AT corridor. They nodded acknowledgement, smiled, or waved.",

We join forces with a wonderful family who has kids about the same age as Lilly, and the three kids walk almost the entire way, making us parents exceedingly proud. Lilly (just turned 8) and Aviva (9) chatter nonstop as they walk, imagining dragons and fairies at every bend in the trail. Each day when we arrive at camp, the adults relax with hot tea but the two girls disappear down to the riverbank or into a tunnel of bushes and immediately start building fairy houses or a bakery or a store. I am so impressed at their imaginations and energy levels.",

The beard was somehow horrible; it recalled the corrupt vitality of hair, which can grow from a rotting corpse. And Ben’s thin lips were lifted, in a constant grimace of torture and strangulation, above his white somehow dead-looking teeth, as inch by inch he gasped a thread of air into his lungs.",

    "target_paragraph": "Before looking for Mike we had to look for alfalfa – which has now become ‘Alf’ in Murphy jargon. We wandered up and down neat, straight, Spanish streets, almost free of motor-traffic and full of friendly people. Alas! we were too late for Alf who only appears in the early morning when the campesinos bring in burro-loads from their fields. Remembering then how our Mexican pony had relished maize grain, we decided to give Juana a well-earned treat. From an astonished grocer we bought two kilos at (relatively) vast expense. But Juana spurned it. In despair we tried to force-feed her, shoving a handful into her mouth. With luck the centavo would drop and she would realise that here was some delicious though novel nutriment. Baring her teeth most comically, she spat it into the gutter. Whereupon an enormously amused bystander informed us that maize grain is human food which no Peruvian animal has ever tasted. (A starting point there for some essay on the comparative economies of Mexico and Peru.) Accepting defeat, we sought Mike, who in due course solved the Alf problem – and also the cobbler problem which was, as you might say, no less pressing. He incidentally informed us that a white flag over a doorway means bread for sale: a useful tip. But what really made my day was an encounter with an ancient man, redolent of chicha, who ended a welcoming peroration by describing Rachel and myself as ‘two flowers that have sprung up on the pavement of Cajabamba’!",

A flawless pink nose and gorgeous striped tail. He was rescued from a Chinese restaurant. Katarina told me that Sammie arrived here last year with a boyfriend. She was assigned to Vanesso, who was just a baby then. Sick from all the Chinese food, vulnerable, needing a mum. She stayed for a few months, left because her boyfriend wanted to, dumped her boyfriend immediately and came back to look after V. She’ll stay now until her money runs out. She walks Vanesso alone. Along the edge of a long lagoon. Through his forest trails. I do not doubt that all that time, one-on-one with the jungle, with him, has done something to her brain. Whenever anyone mentions Vanesso, it is as if just the sound of his name makes her heart crack. I am starting to wonder what the recovery period for an experience like this is.",

For miles around I could see groups walking or riding across the wide plain towards their home-villages, and within half-an-hour we had been absorbed by a cheerful party which was also going south. Its members were a local District Governor on a mule, attended by two gunmen, a young priest – also riding – attended by one gunman, the Governor’s twelve-year-old son – walking sturdily – and a ragged Muslim trader driving eight donkeys loaded with salt-blocks. And soon we were joined by Abebe, a breathless eighteen-year-old student who told me that he had been running for miles to catch up with a party which included ‘gun-people’. There is a certain Chaucerian quality about this sort of travel, and in their way such casually companionable wanderings can be as enjoyable as solitary trekking.",

They are delayed because they left their breakfast – tins of Heinz spaghetti – outside their sleeping-bags, and the spaghetti froze. They have to thaw them in water on the slow stoves and force the crystalline mush down before they can set off. Quickly it becomes clear that the wind is too strong and the air too cold. Nobody is properly clothed: the wool in their gloves and puttees stiffens to plywood in the cold; the fibres in their felt hats matt together and will not retain the heat. Slowly and painfully they move up the ridge, and are forced to bivouac far short of their intended goal, perched on a little ledge of ice and rock on the lee side of the ridge at 25,000 feet. One of Norton’s ears and his feet have been frostbitten, and he cannot sleep. Morshead, too, has been wrecked by the cold: the fingers on one of his hands have gone an ominous raspberry-and-cream colour. All night the men lie awake, two to a sleeping-bag, and listen to ‘the musical patter of fine, granular snow’ on the tent. They bash the sides of the tent with their flat hands when they begin to sag under the weight of the snow, and send the snow hissing off on to the ground.",

I could think of nothing to say but \"Oh, Kathy, it's dreadful, it's awful,\" but it didn't matter, because she wasn't listening. Sitting upright on the edge of a chair, she gave her full attention to the thoughts clamoring in her mind, and it was out of these that she finally said, \"Don't tell anybody about this for a while.

On 6 March at eight o’clock the shabab attacked his house with molotov cocktails. Their object was to blow him up by igniting the gas canisters he kept in his garage. But they didn’t know that the Israelis had given the garage new metal doors. As they tried to break in, Abu-Zeid hobbled up onto his roof and began picking them off with his gun. After he had killed four, the village imam broadcast an appeal for help on the mosque loudspeakers. The whole village rushed into the street and joined in. There must have been seven hundred people out there.’",

While true, especially of the sensitive alpine variety, this lesson belies the fact that the dwarf plants comprising tundra—reindeer lichen shaped like tiny white antlers; bottle-brush bog rosemary; the spicy intoxicant Labrador tea—are some of the most tenacious living things on the planet. Woody-stemmed and nonvascular plants alike survive six to nine months of frigid winter every year, bear the imprint of the moose’s and caribou’s heavy hoof, withstand bears digging for roots and grubs, and shrug off midsummer frost and midwinter thaw with equal aplomb. Though without a doubt fragile (and losing the battle with ATVs and horse hooves all over the state), tundra plants are the steely architecture of Alaskan landscapes.",

And this desire of his was unquestionably enhanced by all he had read and visioned, by the romantic halo that his school history cast over the section, by the whole fantastic distortion of that period where people were said to live in ‘mansions,’ and slavery was a benevolent institution, conducted to a constant banjo-strumming, the strewn largesses of the colonel and the shuffle-dance of his happy dependents, where all women were pure, gentle, and beautiful, all men chivalrous and brave, and the Rebel horde a company of swagger, death-mocking cavaliers. Years later, when he could no longer think of the barren spiritual wilderness, the hostile and murderous entrenchment against all new life – when their cheap mythology, their legend of the charm of their manner, the aristocratic culture of their lives, the quaint sweetness of their drawl, made him writhe – when he could think of no return to their life and its swarming superstition without weariness and horror, so great was his fear of the legend, his fear of their antagonism, that he still pretended the most fanatic devotion to them, excusing his Northern residence on grounds of necessity rather than desire.",

It is a busy thoroughfare that runs right through the centre of Rangoon. There are wall-to-wall bookshops, and stalls selling books and magazines cover almost every inch of pavement. There are books everywhere you look, piled on the ground and placed on makeshift wooden shelves: dusty old English classics, scientific textbooks, newly published Burmese novels, books for English-language students, old colonial gazetteers, collections of contemporary Burmese poetry and short stories, and translations of fiction and non-fiction from around the world. Some 100 books are published every month, alongside over 100 monthly magazines, and 80 weekly journals. Clearly, the regime’s heavy-handed censorship has not killed the urge to read and write.",

His alarm increased, and in the pauses he would dart his eyes here and there; then, loth to give up, he would branch off into feeling allusion to the dangers of his journey. The audacious Hernandez, leaving his usual haunts, had crossed the Campo of Sulaco, and was known to be lurking in the ravines of the coast range. Yesterday, when distant only a few hours from Sulaco, the hide merchant and his servants had seen three men on the road arrested suspiciously, with their horses’ heads together. Two of these rode off at once and disappeared in a shallow quebrada to the left. “We stopped,” continued the man from Esmeralda, “and I tried to hide behind a small bush. But none of my mozos would go forward to find out what it meant, and the third horseman seemed to be waiting for us to come up. It was no use. We had been seen. So we rode slowly on, trembling. He let us pass—a man on a grey horse with his hat down on his eyes—without a word of greeting; but by-and-by we heard him galloping after us. We faced about, but that did not seem to intimidate him. He rode up at speed, and touching my foot with the toe of his boot, asked me for a cigar, with a blood-curdling laugh. He did not seem armed, but when he put his hand back to reach for the matches I saw an enormous revolver strapped to his waist. I shuddered. He had very fierce whiskers, Don Carlos, and as he did not offer to go on we dared not move. At last, blowing the smoke of my cigar into the air through his nostrils, he said, ‘Señor, it would be perhaps better for you if I rode behind your party. You are not very far from Sulaco now. Go you with God.’ What would you? We went on. There was no resisting him. He might have been Hernandez himself; though my servant, who has been many times to Sulaco by sea, assured me that he had recognized him very well for the Capataz of the Steamship Company’s Cargadores. Later, that same evening, I saw that very man at the corner of the Plaza talking to a girl, a Morenita, who stood by the stirrup with her hand on the grey horse’s mane.”",

We’re safe.” But the first time he showed her how to climb down the jagged steps, Olanna saw a snake coiled in a corner. Its black skin glistened with silver markings and tiny crickets hopped about and, in the silence of the damp underground that made her think of a grave, she screamed.",

Local boosterism aside, he has a point. Like the paradise in James Hilton’s novel Lost Horizon, Cordova is cut off from the rest of the world by high mountains, so you can’t drive there. It’s the sort of place city slickers from Anchorage and Juneau go to get an authentic outdoors fix: hiking trails branch off its few paved roads in multiple directions; both the Copper River and Prince William Sound are prime paddling and fishing spots; and Cordova even operates its own low-key ski area, within walking distance of downtown, serviced by the old single-chair lift from Sun Valley. I doubt any Cordovans live to be two hundred years old, like the high lama in Lost Horizon, though all the omega-3s in the fish consumed here presumably yield certain life-extension benefits. Shangri-la is a place of heightened consciousness. Against its will, Cordova has become perhaps the most environmentally conscious town in Alaska.",
