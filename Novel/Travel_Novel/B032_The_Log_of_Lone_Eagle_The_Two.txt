Prologue


Someone once said that life is what happens to you when you are busy making other plans. Janis Joplin, in the lyrics of her song Me and Bobby McGee, said freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose. If you’ve been dreaming about going off cruising to tropical islands and gin-clear water, but life seems to have gotten in the way, then maybe you are at a point where you have nothing left to lose, and freedom will be yours if you just throw the lines on the dock. If just the thought of that is resonating with you, then this book is for you.

Maybe you’re waiting for something to happen, and then you’ll go. Perhaps you're trying to convince your wife to go, or you're trying to save enough money, or maybe you’re building the boat of your dreams, and you keep telling yourself that someday you will. For me, it was the other way around. Life happened when I was making other plans, and at that point in my life, to use Janis’ words, I had nothing left to lose, and desperately wanted to get out of the rat race. I wanted freedom, and I wanted to be a kid again, and I realized that I had a boat that would be my magic carpet for both. This is my story of how I slipped the bonds of city life and set off on a two year, 14,000 nautical mile journey to Australia on my 36’ sailboat Lone Eagle that began in Washington DC a month after an up-close and personal encounter with 911.

Most people spend years planning and getting ready to go off cruising. For me, this, too, was different. From the day I decided to go to the day I threw the lines on the dock was seven months, but I did it in that short span of time because my life was at a crossroad, and I refused to sit around and simply let life happen. I had other plans; they were big, and I immersed myself in making them happen. I set a date and had a single-minded focus that drove me through the grueling days of getting ready before I threw the lines.

I had a few things in my favor. Lone Eagle was a rock-solid bluewater cruiser, I knew how to sail and had a bit of sea time, and I thought I had enough money to get me going. What I didn’t have was someone to make the trip with me. Thankfully, she did come along.

Was the boat perfect when I left? No, but I did a fair bit of fit-out in those seven months before I left and then along the way, which is where I learned what I really needed to live a comfortable cruising life. In the pages ahead, you will see how I got Lone Eagle ready, and in the Appendix, I have included lots of tips and tricks that will save you time, money, and maybe even your life.

This is a true story, and it is about the idyllic cruising lifestyle you’ve been dreaming of, but it is more than that; it is a story about passage making to places most cruisers never go. It is about the paths taken by seafarers and how I followed them and what I did to survive. My objective in writing it was to make the reader feel that they are right there in the cockpit with me, so settle in with your atlas and a glass of rum, and keep the Dramamine handy.





CHAPTER I August 1999 - When Chapters Close



Paris, Virginia

Lat: 39° 00’16.87” N, Long: 77° 57’06.12’ W

He went downstairs to the basement apartment that he had built for them. It had been five years since he had moved his parents up from Florida to the mountain house in the Shenandoah when the chemotherapy had gotten too much for them to handle on their own. It was an hour's drive from their place in Washington, DC. It had been a five-year remission – five great years he thought with his dad, but now that was over, the cancer had returned, and this time, it was going to get him. They had only given him six months. I wondered how much time he’s got left, he thought as he turned the corner at the bottom of the stairs and walked into their living room. His dad was laughing.

“What’s so funny, dad?”

“I’m reading a story in Professional Mariner magazine about the ship I was on during the war - the Cefalu; it’s a story about a shifting captain trying to move the ship in San Francisco Bay after the war. The shifting captain was getting tangled up in the blackout curtains and running aground and crashing into docks and bridges.”

“Dad tell me about the ship?”

“That was the one I sailed on out to Australia in 1942 when I met your mother in Sydney.”

His dad told him that he had spent more than a year aboard the Cefalu in Australia and that the ship made more than ten trips up and down the Australian coast to Milne Bay in the Philippines carrying troops and war supplies to fight the Japanese. He told him about his voyage from Panama and across the Pacific to Sydney. They were great stories – funny ones.

“Dad, you ought to write a letter to the editor; I bet they’d publish it.”

“No, they wouldn’t.”

“Come on, dad, you write it, I’ll key it into the computer, and I’ll email it to the editor, and we’ll see what happens, they’re great stories, and I’m sure they’ll publish them.”

His dad said, “OK, I’ll write it, and we’ll see what happens.”

Over the next few days, he went downstairs several times to check on progress. His dad was sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by his logbooks and writing away on a legal pad. He wouldn’t let him read it until it was finished when he finally handed him the stack of yellow legal pad pages and announced, “Here it is.”

He took the pages and sat down to read them. Wow, it was great, he thought. There were some funny passages.

“Dad, it’s great, a few minor edits, and I’ll key it in.”

He went up to his study and started typing. When he finished, he printed it out and took it downstairs to his dad.

“Should I send it?”

“Send it. Let’s see what happens.”

He typed out an email to the editor and attached the manuscript. Then he hit the send button. I hope he publishes it. It would really give dad a boost.

It was Sunday afternoon, and that meant that he and Catherine needed to head back to their apartment in Washington for work on Monday. They said good-bye to his mom and dad and loaded up the car for the trip back. Catherine thought the article was a great idea.

It was Monday afternoon, and he was working on a case brief on his computer at their place near West End when an icon popped up, indicating he had email. He clicked on his inbox and there it was - an email from the editor. He was going to publish it. That’s great, he thought, as he reached for the phone to call his dad. “Hi dad, you’re going to be a published author, they’re going to print it.”

After he hung up with his dad, he called the editor to thank him. The editor said he loved the article and would see when he could fit it in. Fit it in, he thought? The magazine comes out every two months “Won't it be in the next edition?” he asked. The editor explained that the content for the next edition was already finalized, so the soonest would be the following edition. That’s four months, he thought – dad may not have four months. He explained to the editor that his father was dying of cancer and might be gone in four months. The editor said he would see what he could do about getting copies out to him as soon as it was printed.

The months rolled by, and as they did, his dad continued the slow, cancer-ravaged decline. He had just come off a big biotech government contract law case in April and was working on his business venture. It was 1999, and the dotcom boom was booming, especially inside the DC beltway. He wanted to believe he was going to be part of it. He had perfected a software design for a professional services application and had all of the software architecture done and checked by the best software development house in DC. Software patent applications had also been prepared and were ready to be filed. The business plan was done, and the investor roadshow presentation had been dry run among his lawyer and accounting friends. The investment broker he was working with had already secured huge amounts of funding for five start-ups and believed his web service application would be a sure winner with commercial companies and government departments and agencies.

“They would all be using it – daily,” his investment broker said.

The roadshow was set to start in the first week of April, with six investment house presentations scheduled in three cities. Flights and hotels were booked.

By the beginning of March 2000, it was clear that it was unlikely that his dad would make it to the end of the month. Every weekend in February that he and Catherine had been out at the mountain house, he seemed thinner and frailer than the week before. The hospice nurses had been coming for a couple of weeks. He called the editor and told him that his dad had just a few more weeks. The editor told him that the April/May edition had just gone to press and that he would call the printer and have him overnight the first printed copies.

By then, it was mid-March 2000. It was a Sunday afternoon, and the hospice nurses had said his dad’s body was starting to shut down. He knew he needed to be there for both of them. He went downstairs to tell his dad that the editor would be sending copies of the magazine with his article in it. Little solace he thought. God, it was crushing to see his dad like this. He had put up a good fight – it had been 14 years since he was first diagnosed with lymphoma.

Monday morning brought with it the FedEx delivery. He ran downstairs with the package from the printer.

“Here you go, dad – you’re a published writer.”

There were a dozen copies of the magazine, so they all sat and read the article. They hadn’t edited a word of it. They talked, they laughed. It was his last good day.

Within days of his dad’s death the last week of March, the roadshow was about to begin. That was, however, when he got the call from the investment broker and was told all the dotcom investors had canceled, and none were returning his calls. And so it was, that his dad and his dotcom business venture both died by the end of March 2000. The dotcom boom had turned into the dotcom bust, and all the vulture capitalists, as he called them, had all disappeared. All that was left was to pick up the pieces and get his mom back to Australia. To use James Taylor’s words, everything was like ‘sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground.’ Fire and Rain, how appropriate, he thought.





CHAPTER II April 19, 2000 - The trip to Oz



Sydney, Australia

Lat: 33° 52’ 07.75” S, Long: 151° 12’ 33.47” E

“Sir, are you OK? Sir?” he heard the words of the flight attendant, but to him, they seemed so far away. He turned from his window seat window and looked up at her, tears streaming down his cheeks. He thought she had a kind face.

“What’s wrong?” she asked.

“I just lost both of my parents.”

“I’m so sorry,” was her response. He could see the genuine sympathy in her eyes. “Get some sleep, sir, it’s a long flight, and you will feel better after some rest.”

He had not only lost his dad but his mom, too, as he had just left her in Australia with her sisters. Effectively, in his mind, they were both gone. As the plane arched its way out over the Pacific and Sydney faded in the west, the enormity of the events that had occurred in the last month of his life hit home. It was all he could do to hold back the tears.

As he resumed his stare out the window, his mind drifted to that late summer day in 1999 shortly after the surgery that his dad had, that would be his death sentence. The lymphoma had morphed into a type of gastric cancer that the doctor’s said was incurable. They had given him six months. As they both sat on the deck that summer afternoon, he could smell the freshly mowed lawn.

“Dad, have you discussed with mom what she wants to do?”

“She wants to go back to Australia to be with her sisters.”

“She gave up her Australian citizenship, and we’ll need to re-apply for it,” he reminded his dad.

“I got her out here; I’ll get her back.”

He knew not to push the subject any further with him. His father didn’t like to have any conversations about death and post-death matters.

“I’ll take care of it,” was his dad’s last word on the subject.

In his perfectionist and meticulous manner, his dad did take care of it, along with everything else, including writing out the steps he would have to follow with Social Security. He did, however, bring up what he wanted for his final arrangements over dinner one night – cardboard box, cremation, no service, no obituary, and no further discussion - just the admonition to tell the funeral director to turn the crematorium up to high.

Sure enough, his father’s letter to the embassy plus the fact there was a provision in the Australian immigration laws that the war brides could always come home because of their war-time service to the country ensured that she regained her Australian citizenship. It wasn’t long before her new passport showed-up in the mail.

As he looked out of the plane’s window over the Pacific, he wondered how many times his dad had sailed to Australia, and knew he would look at his dad’s logs when he got home. His mom and dad had written for seven years before he finally proposed to her in a letter after the war ended. The story of that letter was a family legend. Apparently, his dad got a bit lax in his writing, and his mom sent him a nasty-gram to the effect, that if he wasn’t going to write, that he could send back her picture to which he replied, if you accept the enclosed engagement ring and the plane ticket, I won’t need the picture.

And so it was. She flew to Canada in 1953, and they were married in Toronto while his dad lobbied his congressman and anyone else who would listen to get her into the States.

His thoughts flicked over to Pensacola and his Navy fighter pilot training – Officer and a Gentlemen School. To the white uniforms, the flight deck, to the steam catapults launching the F-14s that he was going to fly. He had washed out of pilot training but knew that in his next life, he would be a Spitfire pilot during World War II during the Battle of Britain or, maybe, he would be flying Corsairs off a carrier during the Battle of Midway.

His mind drifted to images of the1940s - the big bands playing, the dances, and all the love letters that were swirling among the bullets and bombs through the winds of war. Amazing, he thought, amid all the death and carnage, people still fell in love. He wondered how many love letters had been written during the war. He wondered whether he would have survived it – fighter pilots had a very short life expectancy, but he thought, what a way to go. But then he thought, would I have found her? Would we have loved as they did? Enough of that, he thought. His mind snapped back to what he had found while packing up his mom for the trip home to Australia.

It was so hard, he thought, to pack forty-six years of marriage into four suitcases. She had her new passport, so all was good on that front. As he turned each page in the family papers folder looking for documents she would need to begin her new life, there was his Grand Father’s Certificate of Naturalization when he gained his US citizenship and relinquished his Norwegian citizenship. He was sad that he had never discussed with him his Ellis Island experience during the late 1800s.

She would need her birth certificate, so the page turn continued when he came across her US Certificate of Naturalization. He looked at her photo. She was so attractive. As he scanned the document, he saw that it was issued in 1958. He looked again and read it more carefully. He knew she had come to the States in 1953, why was citizenship granted five years later? He had no idea that she didn’t receive her US citizenship until 1958. That meant, with his birth in 1956, he was technically born of an Australian mother which meant he was entitled to Australian citizenship. He couldn’t believe what he had found. He knew that his father and mother had toyed with the possibility of moving to Australia, but both had dismissed it as neither thought it would be possible under Australia’s strict immigration laws.

He picked up her Naturalization Certificate and went into her room. It was so sad to see her sitting on her bed surrounded by tissues and sorting through all the memories and the piles of clothes.

“Take the memories, mom,” he said. “You can always buy clothes when you get to Oz. Mom, do you realize that you didn’t get US citizenship until two years after I was born?”

“I don’t remember,” she replied as he handed her the certificate and pointed out the issue date.

“Mom,” he said, “what this means is, I was born of an Aussie mom, not an American mom, which means I am entitled to Australian citizenship. I can have dual citizenship.”

“No, that couldn’t be right,” she replied.

“Mom, I am pretty sure I’m right.” He let the subject drop as she picked up a photo and said, “Do you remember this one?”

As he gazed out the plane’s window over the Pacific, he knew there were a lot of things he needed to look into when he got back to Washington. If he could get dual US/Aussie citizenship, he would have options. As he closed his eyes to get some sleep on the fourteen-hour flight to LA, he wondered if he would be able to practice law in Australia. That was probably a bridge too far, he thought, as he drifted off to sleep.

The plane was wheels-down at Dulles Airport on a Sunday afternoon in late April. It had been an exhausting flight, and he knew the jet lag would be with him for a few days. The next morning he dragged into work. The staff quizzed him about the trip, and the little stuffed koalas and kangaroos toys he had brought back with him were a big hit. The people at the government contract consulting firm that he worked for were great. He and their Senior VP had known each other for years. The government contract law bar in DC was a small group and he knew most of the firms and most of the players. It would be an okay gig, he thought for a while, but not long term. Probably another General Counsel position with an IT contractor would be a better fit, but this was a good port in what was about to be the biggest storm in his life. He checked his email and then pulled up the phone number for the Australian embassy. It was a call he had to make. He was surprised that he was able to get an appointment to see an immigration officer on Friday. All the documents he needed were already in his briefcase.

He had an early client meeting Friday morning in DuPont Circle. After his client meeting, he headed straight for the embassy which was just a few blocks away. He told the immigration officer about his war bride mother. The officer listened intently and said that many of the war brides were losing their American husbands and were seeking to return to Australia to be with their surviving family members and then added, so were their sons and daughters.

The immigration officer was intrigued by his story. Especially his dad’s efforts in support of the Australian war effort transporting troops and munitions up the coast to the Philippines. He asked the officer if he wouldn’t mind if he showed him some of the family documents that he had brought with him. The officer agreed with an intrigued look.

He took the folder out of his briefcase and laid the papers out across the conference table in chronologic order. It showed his mom’s birth certificate from Sydney, her Canadian visa for when she married his dad in Toronto, her old Australian passport with the US immigration stamp date in 1953, his 1956 birth certificate, and finally, her 1958 US Certificate of Naturalization. The immigration officer carefully studied each of the original documents. Once the officer put the Certificate of Naturalization down, he asked, “So, as you can see, I was born of an Australian mother, not an American mother.”

“Yes, you were,” he replied. A big smile came across the immigration officer’s face as he added, “Congratulations, you’re an Aussie - give me eighty dollars and I’ll give you a passport.”

He was stunned at the prospect that he would now have dual citizenship. He gave the immigration officer the eighty dollars. The immigration officer left the room for a moment and returned with a passport application form, which he completed while the officer continued to peruse the documents he had brought with him. He was taken to a room and had his photo taken. A few minutes later, the meeting was over, and the immigration officer assured him that his new Australian Passport and a Certificate of Citizenship would be mailed to him in a few days.

Wow, he thought as he walked back to his West End condo that April afternoon. He never imagined that obtaining his Australian citizenship would have been that easy, but he thought the law and the documents were both clear – he was born of an Aussie mom. The cherry blossoms were in full bloom, and his mind wandered as he made his way home. Let’s do some internet sleuthing tonight and see whether it’s possible to practice law out there. Was it a bridge too far or, was it possible?





CHAPTER III Late April 2000 - Picking up the pieces



Paris, Virginia

Lat: 39° 00’16.87” N, Long: 77° 57’06.12’ W

The snow was still on the ground. Even the tire tracks of the ambulance were still visible. This was his first weekend out at the Virginia house since taking his mom back to Australia. His father was gone, and his mother was now with her sisters in Australia. And there they were - the love letters. The ones that mom said that dad had written to her all those many years during the war. He had never seen them. He didn’t know she had kept them, but there they were, wrapped in an old, worn brown paper bag tied with ribbons. There had to be at least a hundred of them. He wondered how many times she must have read them. And now she had left them for him to read. He sat there on her bed, surrounded by boxes of their possessions accumulated over 46 years of marriage, much of it now destined for charity, but not these letters, he thought.

As he looked out the window at the tire tracks left by the ambulance, the tears welled up again in his eyes. That day had been etched in his mind forever. The hospice nurses said his father’s body would soon be shutting down. They said that the cancer was now in the final throes of ravaging his body. They had provided him with liquid morphine and instructed how much to give him to keep him comfortable, but they hadn’t told him, or his mother about what he later learned was terminal agitation – where the patient becomes uncontrollably upset and incoherent just before lapsing into a coma. God, it had been horrible. He had administered a double dose of the morphine and that was it; he went into a coma.

The ambulance came, and as he rode in the back with him, he whispered in his dad’s ear, ‘Fair winds, calm seas, and safe passages.’ He didn’t know whether his father had heard him, but he kept saying the words over and over again as the ambulance threaded its way down the fog-enshrouded mountain. For him, his father died that day. He couldn’t even bring himself to go to the hospital two days later with his mother to be there for his last breath. Catherine went with her. God, it had all been such a strain on his marriage. He knew that too, was dying. He reminded himself, one crisis at a time.

He closed his eyes, wiped the tears away, stuffed the bundle of letters in his briefcase, and walked out into the kitchen – the one he had built for his parents – the one where so many good times had been spent. He imagined his mother cooking one of her fabulous dinners while his father sat there at the kitchen table, writing his letters with the two golden retrievers at his feet ever ready for a morsel to be thrown their way. Everyone loved his dad’s letters. He pushed the image out of his head and picked up the sympathy letter from Tudi that was now sitting on the table. The last letter his father had written was to Tudi a month earlier when her beloved husband Gus, his dad’s best friend, had died of cancer at the end of February. God, he thought they died just a month apart, and both of them from cancer. His mind drifted back to the days of his youth, and the day when Gus had pulled up in their driveway in his Air Force flight suit and handed him his helmet – a fighter pilot’s helmet. He couldn’t believe Gus had given it to him. He remembered he was the coolest kid on the block for weeks.

He reached for the phone and dialed Tudi’s number in New Bern, North Carolina. They cried, and they caught up. Tudi wanted to know how his mother was doing now that she was back in Australia. He asked how she was doing and she said she was dealing with boat brokers. Boat brokers, he thought, what was she doing dealing with boat brokers?

He asked her, “Isn’t Bobby taking Lone Eagle?”

“He didn’t want her,” she replied.

He knew Bobby lived on his own boat but was stunned to learn that he didn’t want Lone Eagle. His mind raced - Lone Eagle, the boat that dad and Gus sailed on, the one that his dad had described as the perfect sea boat was being sold. He’d never even seen her. Not even a picture. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

His mind flashed across all the dinner conversations when his dad had described Lone Eagle and how he thought she was the perfect blue water cruiser.

“Tudi,” he said, “I have got to come and see her. Please do not sell her. I have to see her.”

Tudi said that there had been a gentleman that had come by and seen the boat. She said that he told her that he wanted to do a circumnavigation but that he needed sponsorship to fund the purchase of the boat and the trip. Thank God he thought, no money had changed hands. She promised him that she wouldn’t sell Lone Eagle until he had seen her. They agreed that he and Catherine would drive down to her place the following weekend – the first weekend in May.

The drive back to their West End condo from the Virginia house on Sunday afternoon was full of conversation about their upcoming trip to Tudi’s and of Lone Eagle. Catherine was anxious to see Lone Eagle. They had both done bareboat charters with the Moorings charter company in the Abacos in the Bahamas, and a second one in the West Indies. The West Indies trip took them from St. Lucia to Grenada – they were the best of times with Catherine, he thought. He wondered if Lone Eagle would help them rekindle the magic they once shared. Catherine had loved both trips. He imagined that she liked the idea of them having a sailing yacht in Washington on the Potomac. It was, to his mind, a status thing with her. For him, it was a chance to sail again. The last time he regularly sailed was when he was working for Boeing in the mid-West. That was a long time ago, he thought.

Back at the West End condo, they had dinner, and Catherine headed upstairs to pack for her trip in the morning. He no longer even asked where she was going. He headed for his computer and started his sleuthing. It wasn’t long before he found the New South Wales Legal Practioner Admission Board website. He held his breath when he clicked on the eligibility requirements tab. He knew that American and Australian legal systems were both based on English common law, but would that be enough? Maybe; it was the same curriculum for every first-year law student in the States.

As he went through the eligibility requirements, they were all the usual – good standing, clean police record, and then he saw it – academic. He clicked on the tab, and it took him to a page that listed all the law school classes that had to have been successfully completed. Contracts, property, torts, civil, and criminal procedure - he had every one of them. He pushed his desk chair back and just stared at the monitor. He met every requirement. He couldn’t believe it. He just sat there dumbfounded. He opened his desk drawer and pulled out his law school transcript to double-check. Sure enough, he had every class.

He downloaded the Application for Admission form and printed it out. He would call the DC and Florida Bars in the morning and get Certificates of Good Standing. He would also call the DC police and request a police report. I might get them in the mail by Friday with a little luck, he thought as he shut down the computer for the night.

He called out to her to let her know he was going to bed.

All she said was, “Good night.”

It was a good night, he thought. Admission to practice in Australia might be within reach.





CHAPTER IV May 2000 – Lone Eagle – Beginnings



New Bern, North Carolina

Lat: 35° 07’ 49.00” N, Long: 076° 97’ 0.0 W

He and Catherine got out of the SUV after the eight-hour drive to Tudi’s place in New Bern, North Carolina. Neither of them had been there before. The pines were whispering in the breeze as Tudi came out to greet them. Catherine said that she thought their place was like a tree fort with the elevated decks touching the boughs of the pines that surrounded their home on the river. He was anxious to get a glimpse of Lone Eagle, a 36’ Pacific Seacraft Mariah. He followed Tudi and Catherine upstairs into the living room with its massive stone fireplace. It was then he saw her. There was Lone Eagle framed in the picture window next to the fireplace. He could just see her through the pine trees at the end of a long T dock with the sun starting to set behind her. His heart stopped.

He couldn’t wait any longer. He herded the ladies out to the dock. They were engrossed in animated chatter, and he didn’t hear a word of it. He just stood there on the dock staring at Lone Eagle’s lines, her mast, and her rugged cutter rig. He wasn’t even walking down the long dock toward her. His feet weren’t moving; he just stood there and stared. My god, he thought, she was the most beautiful sailboat he had ever seen. He now knew why his father had said she was the best sea boat he had ever seen. She was. As he slowly approached her, he could see the strength of her construction. He took it all in. He processed every detail while the ladies chatted. The high bulwarks, the amount of freeboard, the Sampson posts – everything about her was strong. All the fittings were solid bronze, and then he saw the massive tiller. Wow, he thought – a tiller – made of solid oak timber. It looked like a tree trunk. He could just imagine how she would handle - how nimble she would be. The ladies were still chatting, but he overheard Catherine remark, “She’s beautiful.” That’s a good sign he thought.

They all climbed aboard into the teardrop-shaped cockpit. He took the tiller in his hand and swung it. The balance was absolutely perfect. Tudi unlocked and removed the weatherboards and opened the companionway hatch. His heart stopped again. He looked down the companionway into the cabin below. She was all teak with brass oil lamps everywhere; all the portholes were solid bronze. A traditional sea boat, he thought. He could feel it deep within him – Lone Eagle had a soul; she had character and he knew at that moment that she had won his heart. He knew this was the boat of his dreams – one that reflected his passion for sailing and one whose builders had made sure she would be ready for whatever the oceans would throw at her. He opened hatches and compartments while the ladies chatted on and saw that she had been lovingly cared for by Gus.

Tudi showed them all of the things that Gus had built and how some of the ship's systems worked. He thought to himself, Gus thought of everything. By then, the sun had dropped below the tree line, and Tudi started lighting the oil lamps. Embracing. That was the word that came to his mind. He knew she would keep them safe and warm; that she would be a refuge no matter what.

Tudi turned on the stereo at the nav station and pushed in a cassette tape. Christopher Cross’s Sailing started to play. A moment later, the music softened, and Gus’s voice announced, “Welcome aboard Lone Eagle.” They all stood there frozen as Gus provided a detailed description of Lone Eagle. When Gus’s description of Lone Eagle and Sailing had finished, Tudi turned off the stereo and said, “Mr. Perfect made it to help me sell her.” They were all teary-eyed.

Back in the cockpit, Tudi announced that she needed to get dinner started, so they reluctantly extinguished the oil lamps and stepped onto the dock. As they did, he caught Catherine’s eye and she gave him a wink and a nod. As they stood alongside Lone Eagle, he smiled and looked at Tudi and said, “We want her.”

Tears welled up in Tudi’s eyes, and she said, “Gus would be smiling. It will be like keeping her in the family.” They all hugged and cried.

As they walked down the dock, Tudi said, “If I had known you were going to buy her, I wouldn’t have spent so many days taking all the gear off her.” As they reached the stairs up to the deck, Tudi took a key out of her pocket and opened the garage door, and said, “This was Gus’s workshop, you’re welcome to anything in here.”

He walked in and couldn’t believe his eyes. Every piece of gear imaginable – even a spare tiller was in there. All organized, labeled. Boxes of every manner of fittings – dozens of them. Tudi broke his train of thought when she said, “And one more thing goes with the boat, it’s just around here.” They both followed her around the corner of the house under the upper floor deck as she pulled a tarpaulin off what was the most beautiful sailing dinghy he’d ever seen - all beautifully varnished. Tudi smiled and said, “She goes with the boat; she really sails and rows well.”

He managed a “thank you” and just stood there in awe holding back tears. He couldn’t believe this was all happening. He was going to have a sailboat again and not just any sailboat – Lone Eagle – the boat of so many of his dreams. Tears started to well up in his eyes.

Tudi touched his arm and smiled, “It’s what Gus would have wanted."

After dinner, they went into Gus’s study for coffee. The walls were covered with Air Force photos and memorabilia. Tudi explained that ‘Lone Eagle’ was Gus’ call sign and that he flew F86 Sabrejets during the Korean War. They talked about the closeness between Gus and his dad, and about how they both died of cancer. He said that he thought his dad’s lymphoma and later gastric cancer may have been caused by his exposure to chemicals that he used in the painting and maintenance of the yacht he skippered.

Tudi listened intently and then passed him a letter. It was from the Department of Veteran Affairs. It admitted that Gus’ pancreatic cancer was ‘service-related.’ He had been at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada in the 40s and 50s for the nuclear tests. He was dumbfounded. He had practiced government contract law for years and knew the government never admitted anything much less admit responsibility. Tudi then handed him several letters – love letters – that Gus had written to her from Nellis Air Force base. He read them. My God, he thought, Gus had been flying daily through the radioactive fallout from the mushroom clouds created by the nuclear tests nearby. Tudi said she had sent copies of Gus’s letters to the Department of Veteran Affairs, and that was what finally prompted their admission that is pancreatic cancer was ‘service-related.’ She said, “Gus was determined to have them admit responsibility.” They had.

The next morning after a long lingering look at Lone Eagle and a tearful goodbye with Tudi, they headed up the highway for the long ride back to Washington. They talked for hours about Lone Eagle - about sailing the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay and what fun they would have with their city friends. When Catherine drifted off to sleep, his mind was filled with all manner of things – he had to get all that gear in Gus’ shop back to their place in Virginia, and he had to get Lone Eagle to Washington. He estimated it would take a week to make the trip up the Intracoastal Waterway. He had done the trip as far as Norfolk with his dad several times, but he had never sailed the Potomac River. God, he thought, it had been so many years – the last time he had done, it was when he was a teenager. He smiled – what fun it would be. Catherine will love it, he thought. This might be the shot in the arm their marriage needed.

It took him three trips in their Ford Explorer to transport all of the gear from Gus’ workshop to their house in Virginia. He made arrangements for Lone Eagle to be hauled and bottom painted in New Bern before taking her north. When she was ready, he floated some possible dates for the trip but Catherine announced that she wouldn’t be able to take time off work to make the trip. His heart sank. He knew how great the trip would be, and now she would miss it. This didn’t bode well, he thought, never realizing how right his instincts would prove to be.

He and his neighbor Bill brought Lone Eagle to Washington in the last week of May. It was a great trip. They stopped at the same marinas along the way that he and his father had stopped some twenty years earlier. They hadn’t changed much. They encountered a few thunderstorms on their way north, which made sailing a bit sporty. Most they dodged, but one got them. They were right off the Marine airbase at Quantico, Virginia. Thank God for their revolving beacon at their airfield and for the hand-held GPS he had bought before they left. Visibility went to zero and the winds gusted to fifty knots and he had to keep Lone Eagle in the narrow channel of the Potomac. They got passed that one – little did he know it was the first of many big blows yet to come.

It had taken seven days to get Lone Eagle to her new home at the Washington Sailing Marina just south of the Regan Airport. When he got home, there was a pile of mail on his desk. Sure enough, the Good Standing letters from the Florida and DC bars had arrived as had the clean police report. He had a certified copy of his Cumberland Law School transcript in his files, and the Application for Admission form the Legal Practioner Admissions Board was already done and in the folder. The next morning he put them all in a FedEx air pack bound for Oz and dropped it in the outbox at the reception desk. Fingers crossed, he thought.





CHAPTER V Summer 2000 – The Boat and the Bar Exam



Washington Sailing Marina

Lat: 38° 54’ 23.74 N, Long: 77° 02’ 29.50” W

June was the start of the summer sailing season, and he hoped that Catherine would get the sailing bug, and they could start rebuilding their marriage. She joined him several times for short jaunts on the Potomac but preferred dockside sundowners with their friends or sails with all of their friends aboard. The day trips they did as just a couple began to fizzle out when she started announcing mid-week that she was going out to the mountain house for the weekend. It was becoming clear that things weren’t getting better between them.

By July, his work at his consulting services job was just a matter of going through the motions. Meatball surgery, as Hawkeye used to call it. He found nothing was stimulating – nothing he could sink his teeth into. He reminded himself that he needed that steady paycheck if he ended up flying solo. Finding himself in gridlock beltway traffic every day was wearing on him. The thought of continuing to work and the real prospect of being solo again in DC wasn’t an appealing prospect.

He opened his mailbox. Wow, he thought. It was a letter from the New South Wales Legal Practioner Admission Board. His hand started to tremble. He opened the letter and stopped at the word ‘congratulations.’ Had he done it? He read on and saw that he had been conditionally admitted as a legal practitioner subject to his completion of professional responsibility and client trust fund accounting exams. This was good, he thought, the professional responsibility exam shouldn’t be too much of a problem, but what about the client trust fund accounting. That would be a challenge as he had never had to deal with client trust funds as an in-house corporate counsel. That only happened in private practice at law firms.

The letter asked him to send them an email so that they could coordinate sending the study materials and to organize for the two exams that he would need to take at the Australian embassy. My God, another bar exam. I’m getting too old for this, he thought as he booted up his PC after dinner to respond. By morning he had received an overnight reply that the study materials would be shipped to him and that the exam papers would be sent to the embassy. He would need to set up a date and time to do the exam and was advised that he would have to pay the costs of an invigilator. What was an invigilator, he thought?

The next morning at work, he called the embassy. The woman he spoke to was the one copied on the overnight email from the Legal Practitioners Board. She reiterated that he would need an invigilator. He asked, “What is an invigilator and would it hurt.”

She laughed and said, “That’s Australian for exam proctor.”

They both had a good laugh and agreed that he would call her once he received the study materials to set up a time for the exam.

It was now the fifteenth of July, and the study materials had arrived. It took him two evenings to do a first pass read of them to get a sense of what he was up against and how long he would need to prepare for the exam. As he suspected, the professional responsibility exam would be pretty straight forward – there was little difference between the US and Aussie legal systems. The client trust fund accounting was another story. It was accounting, and he wasn’t an accountant and had never done double-entry bookkeeping accounting. He estimated he would be studying every night and every weekend for two weeks to be ready or, as ready as he was ever going to be.

He called his contact at the embassy, and they scheduled the two, ninety-minute exams for the twenty-fifth of July. He had his work cut out for him. Most of his time was spent on the client trust fund accounting. He read and annotated all the materials and did each of the practice exams. They were tough, and it took a while for him to understand how to arrive at the correct answers. He was worried.

He heard the invigilator say, “Time’s up; pencils down.”

Shit, he thought, I almost finished all of the accounting questions. He was confident of how he had done on the professional responsibility exam but had a sinking feeling about the client trust fund accounting exam. The invigilator told him she would fax his test papers to the Legal Practioner Admissions Board. He thanked her and dejectedly headed home.

It was a warm July afternoon in DC. As he drove back to their place in West End, he wondered if he had passed the accounting exam, although he knew in his heart that he hadn’t and then he wondered what would happen if he didn’t. Would they allow him to re-take it? To his mind, the accounting exam wasn’t difficult; it was more of a time management problem. You had to move very quickly to complete it, and he hadn’t. Could he do better? His gut told him that he could.

A couple of days later, his fears were realized when the email from the Legal Practioner Admissions Board arrived. He had done well on the professional responsibility exam but had failed the accounting exam. Oh well, he thought, I gave it a good try as he sent a reply email asking if he would be allowed to retake the accounting exam and asking how long they would give him to do it. Time, he knew, wasn’t on his side.

It wasn’t long before he received the answer. He could retake the accounting exam, and they would give him a year to do it. The Board also told him that there was a preparatory course he could take at the College of Law in Sydney that was offered four times a year. He knew he would have to factor that in for his next trip back to Australia. For now, there were a lot of other things he knew that required his immediate attention.





CHAPTER VI Autumn 2000 - And then the big freeze



Fort Washington, Maryland

Lat: 38° 42’ 25.73” N, Long: 77° 01’ 22.57 W

August had been a good month for sailing on the Potomac. He got lots of solo sails in, as well as quite a few with his friend and colleague Dave. Dave worked for one of Washington’s best law firms and specialized in government contract law. Dave had also been his outside counsel for dozens of government contract cases that they worked on together as they came up during his tenure at several companies as in-house counsel. Dave was a dear friend and loved to sail. He had a summer place on Cape Cod and owned a small boat that he kept on the Potomac for twilight sails that they both enjoyed over the years. But Dave loved Lone Eagle because she was a traditional boat whose design was based on the North Sea rescue boats. Dave loved the warmth of the teak and oil lamps below and the feel of her big tiller and the tear-drop shaped cockpit. Rail down with cold beers in their hands, and the summer just seemed to melt away.

“Are you going to keep her at the marina over the winter or haul her out somewhere?” Dave asked.

He had toyed with both ideas and replied, “I don’t know, the river can freeze over here in the winter, and you need a bubble systems to keep the ice away from the hull,” and then added, “If you have a problem, and there is ice, you won’t be able to haul out which is always a risk. I think I’ll haul her out.” He knew the nearest shipyard was Fort Washington on the Maryland side of the Potomac. “Dave, you’ve been to Fort Washington. Is there enough water for Lone Eagle to get in there?”

“I think so,” Dave replied, but then added, “You better call their office and ask. I had plenty of water when I went up there, but you draw a lot more water than me."

He and Dave got in a few more sails that summer. He and Catherine got out for one last autumn sail in late September. As was their practice, they would go out for an afternoon sail and have sundowners aboard and dinner at the Washington Sailing Marina.

Before each sail, he would go down to Lone Eagle and get her ready and would turn on the fridge and add a bag of ice to the freezer box. The water from the ice melt would go into the bilge, and he would then pump the small amount of water out with the bilge pump. It wasn’t much water, but he always checked the bilge, and mostly it was bone dry.

It was the first weekend in October when he was next able to get down to Lone Eagle. He went below and looked at the battery monitor and then opened the engine room hatched and looked down into the bilge. Quite a bit of water, he thought, but well below the bilge pump float switch but a lot more than from a bag of ice. He thought he had pumped it all out after their list sail. He took his Maglite and focused the beam to a narrow point and scanned the entire engine room looking for the source of the water. The thru-hull fitting for the engine was closed and dry to the touch. So too was the dripless shaft seal where the propeller shaft exited the boat via the stern tube. But wait, he thought, there was glistening on the little fiberglass shelf just below the shaft seal where it slipped over and was clamped to the stern tube. He got a paper towel and inched his body over the top of the engine. It wasn’t easy, but he was able to reach the dripless shaft seal and felt all around it. It was dry. So was the stern tube. Strange he thought. Then with the little Maglite in his teeth, he put his fingers on the small fiberglass shelf below the stern tube. It was wet, and there was wetness seeping down the side of the engine compartment wall below the edge of the shelf and down into the bilge. He had found the leak, and it wasn’t good. The water was seeping right through the fiberglass. This was going to be a major repair, and he knew he would have to haul. He couldn’t leave her in the water at the marina over winter. Not with that kind of leak.

The first week in November, he and Dave left the Washington Sailing Marina and headed down the Potomac bound for the Fort Washington shipyard. Dave had never been aboard Lone Eagle when he had taken her under the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. Lone Eagle had 49’ mast clearance height and the height at the center of the bridge was 50’ leaving just one foot of clearance. He checked to see if there was any up-river bound traffic. Good, he thought. None was coming. He would have had to abort if there was. A wake or being forced out of the center by a passing boat would have resulted in a mast strike. All good, he thought, as they proceeded under the span with Dave instinctively ducking as they went under the grated roadway above and watched the bottoms of cars passing overhead on the beltway.

The run-up the channel to Fort Washington was well marked. Just stay in the middle, he thought as the depth sounder alarm kept chiming. It was set at two and a half feet under the keel, and the sounder was reading just one foot. Fingers crossed that depth would hold until they got in.

They arrived at the shipyard’s turning basin, and he radioed the lift master on the hand-held VHF and confirmed all was ready with the 100-ton travel lift. Dave was on the foredeck with the boathook as he eased Lone Eagle into the lift straps. The lift master was an old-timer. Probably eighty, he thought, as the lift straps were moved inward, centered and tied together so that they wouldn’t slip off the keel. He gave the thumbs up for the lift to begin, and up she came until Lone Eagle’s deck was even with the travel lift tracks. He and Dave hopped off, and he met Lenny, the lift master.

“Been doing it for forty years,” he said as he revved the diesel, and Lone Eagle resumed her rise out of the water.

He explained to Lenny about the leak below the shaft seal and asked if he could keep him in the travel lift slings for a while before blocking and bracing her.

Lenny said, “Sure, ain’t lifting anybody else today. Just tell me what you need me to do.” With that, Lenny put the travel lift in gear and drove the travel lift with Lone Eagle suspended in the slings over to the spot where the blocks and bracing supports had been set up.

“You can lower the stern down on that block, but let’s keep the bow in the sling,” he said, as he examined the propeller shaft and cutlass bearing that was protruding as it should, slightly out of the stern tube. He had dried the whole area with a towel, and no water coming out. OK, he thought, now for the water test.

“Lenny, I’ve got to put this hose in the bilge and fill it up to just below the stern tube. Can we lift the bow up a couple of feet so that the water pools in the aft part of the bilge so I can see if it leaks?”

“Sure, two feet up on the bow enough?” Lenny asked.

“That ought to do it,” he replied as he disappeared below with the hose. He filled the bilge above the little shelf so that it was underwater, being careful not to take the level of the water above the stern tube. When he had it right, he went up on deck and climbed down to the ground and inspected the area around where the propeller shaft encased the stern tube that exited the boat trough the cutlass bearing. He could see water seeping out of the set screw recesses in the fiberglass that held the cutlass bearing in place in the stern tube. Water had seeped through the set screw recesses on both sides because they hadn’t been caulked properly. He pulled his pocket knife out and probed the fiberglass hull area encasing the stern tube. To his horror, the blade slipped in. He kept probing the area, and the blade kept slipping in. Not good, he thought, as he shouted out to Lenny that it was okay to lower Lone Eagle’s bow down onto the forward block. They finished the bracing, and he hooked up the shore power and pumped out the bilge.

He and Dave thanked Lenny as they got into Dave’s car for the drive back to the Washington Sailing Marina to pick up his car.

“What do you think?” Dave asked as they entered the beltway.

“I think I’ve got a big problem. That part of the hull that houses the stern tube and the propeller shaft is soft. I am going to have to get in there from the engine room side and pull out all of that wet fiberglass, dry it out, and then replace it.”

“Big job,” he said, as they passed over the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. “You think you can do the work yourself?” Dave asked.

“I hope so. I’m just scared about getting the alignment right when I put it all back together.”

The weekends of November and December were spent working on the leak problem. He had ground out all of the wet fiberglass which was a messy, dirty contorted job, scrunched behind the engine and transmission. Some days it had been snowing, but he had managed to remove all of it. The tricky part was the shaft log that housed the propeller shaft and the cutlass bearing. It, too, had become waterlogged and couldn’t be salvaged, and he knew he couldn’t buy one, so he had to make it himself. He took the measurements and turned a template out of maple on his wood lathe that matched the inside dimension of the stern tube perfectly. Then he sanded the template smooth and applied a wax coating and then a layer of fiberglass cloth and then resin, and then he wound it with monofilament fishing line. He did six layers until he reached his outside dimension measurement. He was pretty sure it would work. He knew he just had to get the alignment right.

By the end of March, it was warm enough to complete his fiberglass work and the installation of his new stern tube. He took one last look at his handiwork as he gave Lenny the thumbs up to lift Lone Eagle to be splashed. Lenny lowered her down until she was floating on her lines. Moment of truth, he thought, as he went below and grabbed his Maglite. Thank God, he thought. No leaks. He had done it. The alignment was perfect, and that problem was solved.

He fired up the engine, and she was pumping out exhaust water. The winterization job he had done was as per Gus’s written instructions in his maintenance log. Even the vodka in the waterlines to keep them from freezing had worked. It made for an excellent stiff first drink of spring out of the tap as he applied gentle pressure to the foot pump – don’t want to waste that vodka, he thought.





CHAPTER VII Spring 2001 - It was time to move on



West End, Washington, DC

Lat: 38° 54’ 23.74” N, Long: 77° 02’ 29.50 W

The winter had been a long one with Lone Eagle hauled out at the Fort Washington Marina. Aside from solving his leak problem, he had spent most of the winter in his shop at the mountain house, working on projects for Lone Eagle. Painting and varnishing the dinghy, building a new teak cockpit deck grate, and designing a system to bridge the two cabin births to make a king-size bunk. On many weekends he had stayed aboard Lone Eagle. He had mounted his dad’s Navy barometer and his ship’s clock right above the nav station. The oil lamps and the little space heater made it cozy below but he didn’t enjoy using the broom to get the snow off the decks. Things with Catherine were rapidly deteriorating. She was always traveling, and when she was in town, she was in her craft room. They ate together, big deal, he thought. Now that they had Lone Eagle, he knew that if he didn’t get her to agree to go off cruising for a while, then it was likely the marriage wouldn’t survive. His instincts told him that she wouldn’t.

She walked into his study pencil clenched in her teeth and hands on her hips.

“Rob, do you know how many international trips I made last year? She paused for effect and then said, “Fifty-two!”

He gently reminded her that there were only fifty-two weeks in a year, and that didn’t include all of her weekly domestic travel.

Changing the subject, he said, “Have you finished reading that cruising for couples book I gave you?”

He wanted to re-open the discussion about them going off cruising. She dismissed him, saying she would consider it once they had worked through their issues with the marriage counselor. He told her that they needed time together to do that and that her business travel was making that impossible.

“We have the money, and with Lone Eagle, we can go off and try to find us. We can see if we can reconnect; see if we can find the love that brought us together in the first place.” He knew he was wasting his time. She would never leave her job – not this one – not the money – not the prestige - no way he thought, she was her job. She was married to her career – not him. He knew he wasn’t going to win this one, but he tried. “We can do this. We can go off and try and reconnect, and when we get back, with our credentials, we can both get jobs within a week.” No score. She wasn’t buying any of it.

Lone Eagle had been launched after the winter lay-up in April. The summer sailing season had begun, and every time he tried to organized a weekend of sailing with her, she had always come up with an excuse to miss it. He knew the marriage was dying. Each time she declined, he took the opportunity to go down to the boat. There were always friends ready to go for a sail, and frequently he took them, but his favorite time was when he took Lone Eagle out solo. He loved her feel, could sense her mood if she was over canvased or hauled in just a bit too tight, he could feel it. Those were magic feelings. He had started the process of becoming one with his boat.

It was now the first week in July, and he had just returned from two weeks in Australia to check on his mom one year on since losing his dad. She was doing well. Her four surviving sisters (out of seven) were great support for her. For him, this trip was different. He had a bit more time to explore Coffs Harbor and the Mid-North Coast of New South Wales. Breathtaking. The beaches, mountains, and rainforests were beautiful. He visited the marina at Coffs Harbor that jutted right out into the blue Pacific and was formed by a jetty connecting the shore to Mutton Bird Island. He imagined himself there aboard Lone Eagle. He knew he wanted to be there. He had fallen in love with Oz. The thought of going back to DC and working for another twenty years in that rat race wasn’t appealing.

By July, he had been working at the consulting services job for a couple of months. He had ended their marriage counseling sessions, and they had separated. The mountain house was sold; the West End condo was sold - both at the top of the market, so they both were flush. Once the West End condo sold, they moved into separate apartments in the same apartment complex in Alexandria, Virginia, and had shared custody of Abby and Chaser their beloved golden retrievers. Chaser was his – had been, for fourteen years. Abby, he had bought for her.

He had been back from Australia for less than a week when Catherine invited him over for dinner, and he asked her one last time if she would go off cruising with him.

Her response was, “when are we going back to counseling?”

He told her, “I don’t think the issues that stand between us are fixable by a counselor – they are only fixable by us.”

She insisted that they resume marriage counseling.

He said, “No,” and added, “You are married to your career, not me. I’m sorry, but I want a divorce. I want to go and live in Australia.”

That was it. Ten years together, married for five, and it was over just like that. Catherine was explosive, but he knew shattered would soon follow. He was just numb.

He left her place and drove down to the marina to his beloved Lone Eagle. He lit an oil lamp. No tears – just numb.





CHAPTER VIII July and August 2001 - Ship, sell, or sail?



Alexandria, Virginia

Lat: 38° 48’ 20.41” N, Long: 077° 02’ 48.92” W

July and August were a blur. His mind wasn’t on work, the divorce was in the works, and the property settlement was done. He got Lone Eagle. She had wanted the boat sold, and the proceeds split 50/50, but he reminded her that he had paid off all her debt from her first marriage when they had first gotten together and that the down payment on the Virginia house had come from the proceeds of the sale of his home in Florida. She relented and signed over Lone Eagle to him.

Throughout August, he agonized over Australia. He knew he was going there, but would it be with or without Lone Eagle? Should he sell her, ship her, or sail her? He couldn’t sell her. Not now. He needed her. She was the only thing right in his life. Shipping her, he thought, well, that was doable but expensive. The quote he had received from Yachtwise, the yacht shipping company, was eighteen thousand dollars from Miami. That plus the sixteen thousand to ship all of his belongings in a forty-foot container to his mom’s place in Australia would have made it impossible. Could he really sail her? How much would that cost? How long would it take? How would he find crew? And the big one, was he a good enough sailor to be able to do it?

Those questions were his entire focus during July and August. He set September first as his decision day. He had scoured all the marine catalogs to price out all of the gear that would be necessary to upgrade Lone Eagle for ocean passage making – a Monitor wind vane, an Icom single sideband radio, a Furuno weather fax, a Sectra watermaker, a GPS chart plotter, an anchor windlass, new sails, radar – the list was endless, and the numbers were daunting.

September 1, 2001, came after a sleepless night – just one in a long string of them. His decision was made. He was going to sail Lone Eagle to Australia. If his father had been around, he would have told him he was absolutely out of his mind. His dad was probably right, but he had to do it. No, he wanted to. He wanted to taste freedom again, to become one with his boat as he did with his first sailboat when he was ten. He wanted to climb the wind; wanted to retrace his dad’s voyage to Australia in 1942 – just magic, he thought.

He had practiced law for fifteen years – the last ten in Washington – he needed a break. He wanted to be a little kid one more time in his life. He knew he might never make it – sunk on a reef, holed by a floating container, or worse, run down by a container ship. God, he thought, you will really have to have your shit together. After he told his circle of friends, a colleague, Jim, from one of the big law firms, told him, “I have one word for you – Qantas.” That said it all – everyone thought he was completely crazy.

He went into work that first day of September, gave his notice and left for the day. He came home and placed dozens of orders for everything, including posting an ad for crew on several sailing websites.

Crew Wanted for Voyage to Australia

I am the owner of s/v Lone Eagle, a 36’ Pacific SeaCraft Mariah, based in Washington, DC. She is a double-ender (canoe stern, cutter rig) bluewater cruiser. I am preparing for an extended cruise and am looking for one crewmember to help me to tune-up, and make the voyage. In September, I will be organizing supplies, and in October, I will take her South to New Bern, North Carolina – a seven-day cruise. I will spend one month fitting her out in New Bern at a friend’s place and will leave mid-November for Florida. I then plan to spend January cruising Florida and the Bahamas and then plan to set-off for Mexico and clear the Panama Canal by the first of May. After Panama, the destination is Sydney, Australia via the Galapagos Islands, the Marquesas, Tahiti, Polynesia, Fiji, and then Sydney.

I am interested in one crew member for the entire voyage but understand that this could involve many months. I will consider someone interested in one or more segments but would certainly prefer someone who could make the entire voyage.

I am 45, divorced, have dual US/Australian citizenship, and will be traveling to Australia to be with my family. I have been sailing for many years with voyages up and down the East Coast and throughout the Caribbean. Lone Eagle was designed for bluewater cruising. She is beautifully designed for self-sufficient cruising weighing-in at 8 tons with all bronze fittings. She has a teardrop-shaped cockpit, is all teak below decks, is equipped with a full galley, and sleeps four in two separate staterooms.

I am looking for someone who can (or I can teach) to trim a sheet, stand a watch, share a sunset, and adapt to the rigors and rewards of this kind of voyage. All cruising expenses, including return airfare from Sydney, will be paid by me except for your personal costs while in port.

Please drop me a note if you or someone you know might be interested.

Thanks for your interest.

Within days the boxes of gear started to arrive. There were dozens of them being with packing lists, parts lists, installation instructions, catalogs, receipts, downloaded emails, technical specifications and drawings, and pages of notes strewn from one end of his apartment to the other. And with them began the onslaught of emails from prospective crew members in response to his ad.

There were hundreds of them. There were a number of them from recent college graduates - backpackers wanting to go off and see the world. The majority had no prior sailing experience and were more interested in where they were going (to get off and explore), than in how they were going to get there in one piece. Still, others were old salts – guys that had made passages and had the experience. He didn’t want to do this kind of a trip with a guy, much less with one who was going to tell him how to sail Lone Eagle and had already been to the places he was going. No. It was going to be a woman – one that hadn’t seen the places they were going, one that was willing to learn and, if he was lucky, one that blew his hair back. Otherwise, he was going to do it solo. Not an appealing prospect, but one he knew nonetheless he had to consider. Then there were the women. 40+, divorced and looking for their escape pod. A number of them had sailing experience, as they described it at the hands of their very own Ahab. As he read their words, he felt their baggage and knew it would sink his and Lone Eagle’s waterline. No, he had to keep going. Keep looking, he told himself – she’s out there.

Sure enough, the next crew response email that arrived got his attention. This was an interesting one, he thought. She’s in IT and working in Arizona. No sailing experience, but she is into rowing, so she’s got to be in good shape. Lesley was her name. He typed a reply email and said they needed to have a chat and that he would call her that evening.





CHAPTER IX September 2001– Enter Gillian



Alexandria, Virginia

It was the end of the first week in September, and he knew he had to turn to the wind vane autopilot purchase. He knew he had to have one. All of the Around Alone racers had them, and everything he read about them said they were terrific - purely mechanical, designed to sail at a set angle to the wind. Good, he thought – no electronics to fail. Several companies made them. He had surfed all of their websites but these mechanical contraptions had to be mounted to the stern of his boat and Lone Eagle was a double-ender with a pointy stern, with a tiller and an outboard rudder. That was going to be a difficult install job, but Scanmar International, a west coast company that he had found, had noted on their webpage that they had installed them on Pacific Seacrafts just like Lone Eagle. He pulled up their website again, found the ‘contact us’ page, and sent an email to their contact – Gillian, requesting more information and photos of their wind vane installs on other Pacific SeaCrafts. He wrote that he would be sailing to Australia and he needed to have detailed installation instructions to see if their wind vane would work for Lone Eagle. He also asked for a recommended spare parts list and pricing.

Get back to your inbox, he thought. There was a note from Lesley with the attached photo he had requested. He opened the picture first. Not bad, he thought but she had said she was 5’2” and 105 pounds. She looked thin, but he could see she was fit and toned. He opened her email and saw that she had enjoyed their phone chat and was very interested in making the trip. She said she was a contract IT worker and could leave with two weeks' notice. She asked when he would need her. Need her – yesterday would be great, he thought.

He clicked his way through the other crew response emails. Not promising, he thought. Just then, his fax machine came to life. He looked at the lead sheet coming through. It was from Gillian. That was quick, he thought. One of ten pages it said, so he was going to get the info he had requested. The last page dropped into the tray, and he collected them and started absorbing the technical install instructions for the Monitor wind vane. There was a photo of one installed on Pacific SeaCraft Mariah, just like Lone Eagle. Reading all of the install instructions raised almost as many questions in his mind as it answered.

He opened up a new email to Gillian. He thanked her for her fax and then got right into his questions. It was a long email with lots of questions, but it was going to be one of his biggest purchases for Lone Eagle, and it had to be right. He hit the send button. Just as he did, he heard a knock on the door.

There he was again – the FedEx man. He had been there every day that week.

“Where do you want it? This one is heavy,” he said.

It was the manual, ratchet-type anchor windlass – solid bronze. It wouldn’t stay that shinny for long, he thought. He knew it would get that green patina overnight like all the other bronze fittings aboard Lone Eagle. He reminded himself that he would have to fabricate a teak mounting plate for it that would ride on top of Lone Eagle’s bowsprit, so he went to the garage to see if he had a piece of teak that might work. All he had to do was make up the teak plate, install the windlass, and buy 300’ of 3/8ths inch anchor chain. Simple – yeah, right, he thought - but you have to get this one done before you leave, so move that box over to the install-before-you-leave side of the room, he told himself as he dragged it across the room. The install-when-you-get-to-Florida side of the room was growing too. There was also the ship-to-Oz corner that was growing daily. He wondered if he could stow all the install-when-you-get-to-Florida gear aboard Lone Eagle and still have room up in the forepeak for Lesley to even have a place to sleep.

He thought the FedEx guy had left when there was another knock on the door. When he answered it, the FedEx guy handed him three more boxes – one was the size of a small suitcase – “The last one,” he muttered as he turned and headed down the stairs. He could see from the return address on the suitcase-sized one that it was the offshore med-pack. Geez, it was big, he thought. Wonder where I am going to stow this. He unzipped the international orange bag and saw that it contained dozens of zipped pockets, all labeled for various medical problems – burns, fractures, wounds. It was amazing. You could probably do brain surgery with it, he thought.

The next box from West Marine contained more cruising guides and a fat plastic envelope containing a pile of neatly folded courtesy flags for all the countries he would be visiting. He couldn’t believe how expensive they were. There were also two quarantine flags – two just in case he lost one. You had to come in flying one or you were illegal, he thought.

The phone rang, and he picked it up. Mary, from Ritchie Compass, was returning his call. Great, he thought, as he explained that he was interested in a new, binnacle-mount compass. They discussed the model he wanted, including its size, mounting points, price, and the price for a set of spare LED lights. He was delighted and told Mary he was grateful for her help and then added he would be sailing to Australia.

Mary asked, “You’re going where?” and then added, “that compass won’t work in the southern hemisphere.”

“What do you mean – won’t work?” he replied.

Mary explained that “It won’t work in the southern hemisphere because it’s calibrated to the northern hemisphere. If you use one for the northern hemisphere in the southern hemisphere, you will have compass dip.”

“What is compass dip?” he asked.

“Compass dip is when you take a northern hemisphere compass into the southern hemisphere that wants to point north, and the compass card dips deeper and deeper in the globe of the compass the further south you go. It eventually hangs up, but readings get more inaccurate the further south you go. We could recalibrate your northern hemisphere compass after you cross the equator, but it would be a hell of a service call.”

He took it all in, and after a few moment’s hesitation, he replied, “OK, I got it. So you’re telling me I need to buy two of these compasses – one calibrated for the northern hemisphere and other calibrated for the southern hemisphere?”

“Exactly.” she replied and added, “Let me see if we have a southern hemisphere one in stock.” A moment later came the reply, “We do, and I can get these shipped today if you place the order in the next ten minutes.”

He took her word for it about compass dip as he read out his credit card details to her. Two compasses, he thought. Where do you store the spare and, oh boy, how much fun is it going to be to install one mid-ocean? Maybe you do it after the mid-ocean oil changes you will be doing, he reminded himself, as he said goodbye to Mary. He would be researching compass dip really soon, he thought. Wonder if anyone else thinks of this stuff – he had never seen a reference to compass dip in any sailing book or magazine. Ka-ching again, he thought.

The next morning the FedEx guy was back with a big box. It wasn’t too heavy, he thought, as he placed it on the dining room table. It was from West Marine – must be the life jackets, he thought. He had ordered two Stern off-shore rated life jackets and two inflatable life jackets with heavy webbing and ‘D’ rings that would take tether snaps so that they could hook into the hard point in the cockpit and the jack lines for the deck that were also in the box. At the bottom of the box was the book he ordered – A Practical Guide to Life Boat Survival. Just some light reading, he thought, as we went through the inflatable life jacket spares bag. Yep, four CO² cylinders, and four replacement water triggers. He wanted water-activated inflation – you could be unconscious when you hit the water, he thought, as he moved all of it to the pile of gear he was taking to the boat that afternoon.

OK, back to email, he thought. He had to respond to Lesley’s ‘when do you want me here’ message but wanted to see if Gillian had responded to his questions. Sure enough, there was an email from Gillian. This lady was on the ball, he thought. As he read through her responses, he knew she had to be a sailor. He read the last paragraph – she lived on her own boat in San Francisco Bay. He still had some technical questions and reached for the phone. Gillian had an English accent and answered all of his questions, and then they talked – talked for what seemed like hours. She was great and said she had done the canals of Europe and had been living aboard boats for the past eleven years. He told her he was looking for crew and jokingly asked her if she wanted to make the trip. She said she always wanted to do the Caribbean and Pacific, but that she loved her job. Too bad, he thought she would have been perfect.

She did offer to post his crew ad at her marina. They talked about everything – boats, marriages, life aboard – she was great. He told her he would be placing an order for the Monitor wind vane as soon as he could get down to Lone Eagle and take some final measurements that she would need.

Over the days ahead, they traded dozens of emails. They shared their life’s story, their loves, their losses – everything. A bond was forming. She told him she had lots of frequent flyer points and would like to come out for a visit. He was delighted – what a sorely needed respite that would be. A couple of days later, he picked her up at the Baltimore / Washington Airport. That night of passion and the bond between them was made. She loved Lone Eagle. He told her he wanted to make the trip with her, but he knew she wouldn’t give up her life for his. She was wonderful. She encouraged; she looked and gave constructive advice on all the gear he was ordering; she became his friend. It was a great weekend, he thought as he drove back from the airport. She’ll be back for the Annapolis Boat Show in a few weeks he reminded himself as he pulled into his parking space back at his apartment.

He checked his watch. It was early evening Arizona time, so he picked up the phone and called Lesley. As he dialed her number, he was hoping he could get her to DC quickly as another set of arms, legs and eyeballs could help keep things on track for an October 31st departure. She answered on the first ring. She had just gotten back from rowing. She said she could arrange to be in Washington by the 15th of October at the soonest. She said she had to give her roommate time to find someone and had to move her things into her parents' place. They agreed on the 15th. Thank God, he thought as he hung up the phone – the crew issue had been solved. He needed her yesterday and would just have to make due until the 15th. He reminded himself to say a prayer that night that things would click with her.





CHAPTER X 911 - Everything and Nothing Changed



Alexandria, Virginia

Lat: 38° 48’ 20.41” N, Long: 077° 02’ 48.92” W

September 11, 2001, started like any typical day. The night before Catherine called and said she would be flying to Dallas out of Dulles Airport in the morning and could he take the dogs, as she had an early meeting in the Pentagon before she had to catch her flight. He hung up the phone and walked over to collect Chaser and Abby.

After he got back from his morning walk with the dogs, he turned on the big screen TV and put the coffee maker on. No big news, he thought - just baseball scores. He filled his coffee mug, grabbed his master inventory list for Lone Eagle, muted the TV, and walked downstairs into the spare room which he was using for an office. He launched a couple of crew response emails and went upstairs to get his second cup of coffee when he glanced at the muted TV. The image was of a large office building on fire. It looked like the World Trade Center, he thought. It was the World Trade Center. He turned the sound on, as the news anchor was speculating whether it was a just a fire, or whether it was a bomb, or had a plane hit the building. The news anchor hadn’t finished his sentence when the second plane hit tower two. He froze. That was a passenger plane. My God, hijackers – we’re under attack, he thought.

He ran out the front door and across the breezeway to Rob’s apartment. Rob was a Navy Seal. They had become good friends over the last couple of months.

“Rob! Did you see the TV? Planes have hit the World Trade Center!”

“Yeah,” he said, “I’m getting my gear and heading for the Pentagon.”

They lived between the Pentagon and the Reagan Airport, and their apartments faced the west, so the sounds of jet airliners were ever-present. But just then, as they were standing at their westward-facing doors, the sound of one was louder than usual. He looked to the west and said, “Jeez, he’s low,” as they watched the plane disappear below the tree line. Moments later, they saw the fireball as it slammed into the Pentagon. As the shock and sound waves hit them, the pictures were knocked off the walls, and the windows rattled. Then the smoke – a huge mushroom-shaped column rose skyward. He just stared. Rob grabbed his M-16 and his rucksack. They jumped in Rob’s jeep and headed north through the back streets of Alexandria toward the Pentagon. As they rounded the last bend, they saw it – the western side of the building with a gaping hole – a whole section was gone.

They stopped at the entrance checkpoint. It was pandemonium – people running. Guns were drawn everywhere. Rob flashed his ID, and the guard directed him where to assemble for rescue operations.

The guard yelled, “Get that vehicle, the hell out of here.”

As he no longer had military ID, Rob threw him the keys. He climbed in behind the wheel and stared for a few moments at the devastation before driving back to the apartment. He knew the world had just changed forever. As he drove, he could see the smoke in his rear-view mirror, then he gripped the wheel – Catherine – she was supposed to be in there – in the Pentagon for meeting this morning. Where was she, was she alright?

He arrived back at the apartment. The TV was still on, and as he looked at the screen and heard the commentator just as tower one crumbled right before his eyes. My God, all those rescue workers dead. He became detached, circumspect, and his mind told him to brace himself – Catherine could be gone. He thought about the casualties and reached for the phone to see how close to home it would strike. He called her office and her cell phone dozens of times throughout the day. The helicopters and the F-16s screamed overhead that day as they would for many days and nights. The calls from his mom in Australia, from Gillian, from Lesley, and from his cousin in Australia - amazingly got through. Local outbound calling was impossible. He knew the day wasn’t going to end any time soon. The reports came in over the TV – all airports were being shut down – where was Catherine? He had spent the entire day glued to the TV – watching the towers collapse – the carnage and calling Catherine – her office, her cell phone.

It was 7:15 pm when a knock came upon his door. Instinctively he knew it was Catherine. She looked as white as a ghost. She sat down and explained that she had left the Pentagon to catch her flight to Dallas but knew she was going to miss it because the meeting at the Pentagon had gone on longer than expected. She said that when she knew she knew she wouldn’t make her flight, she diverted from the airport, and went back to her office over in Crystal City. She arrived just after the plane impacted, and could see the smoke from her office. She said that all of the people she had been meeting with at the Pentagon had been killed. Then she said that the plane she had missed was the plane that hit the Pentagon. My God, he thought, she had missed being killed twice. He tried again to convince her to go off sailing. She would hear none of it.

After she left with the dogs, he knew he needed to get to the boat. Lone Eagle was at the Washington Sailing Marina just across a small bay from Reagan National Airport. He took the back roads and parked in the space reserved for those with boats. Lone Eagle was on A Dock and overlooked the bay and the airport. From 7 am to 10 pm, planes would be taking off and landing every thirty seconds. Now, it was still – eerily still. He reached the A Dock security gate, and there was a new sign. He could see the US Coast Guard logo on it. It said that no boats were allowed on the Potomac North of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge without a Coast Guard escort. Unbelievable, he thought, I’ll be getting a Coast Guard escort out of here.

He climbed aboard Lone Eagle and sat in the cockpit, looking out across the Potomac to the Washington skyline. The eerie quiet was broken by the sound of a flight of F-16s, and off in the distance, he heard the thump of helicopter rotors. They were Apache and Blackhawk choppers overflying the city. He remembered where he was when Kennedy had been shot, and he knew that the events of the day would be etched in his mind forever. The world had changed that day – forever, he thought. He knew he had eight more weeks to get Lone Eagle ready and to get all of his belongings shipped to Australia. He had to be underway by the end of October to have any chance of outrunning winter and to avoid having to pay for winter dockage at the marina. He was going, and today was all the more reason to get going.

As he pulled out of the parking lot to get on to the George Washington Parkway for the ride home, there was a long military convoy heading up the parkway toward the city. It had started, he thought.





CHAPTER XI September 2001 - The Annapolis Boat Show



Annapolis, Maryland

Lat: 38° 58’ 42.40” N, Long: 076° 29’ 31.86” W

In amongst everything else was the developing relationship with Gillian. They emailed daily and spoke several times each week. The Monitor wind vane had arrived, and the planned install was a few weeks away. So was the Annapolis Boat Show and she was coming east for it. They had planned a dinner in Annapolis.

Annapolis was a town he really liked. A fairytale-like New England fishing village nestled on the western side of the Chesapeake with the US Naval Academy right in the heart of it. It was also the home of the Annapolis Boat Show. The little downtown harbor was brimming with all manner of gorgeous sailboats. He enjoyed it here – his on-the-water-roots, he thought. He wondered if things would have been different with Catherine had they bought a place here instead of in the Shenandoah. No, he thought, they wouldn’t have been.

He got there early as he wanted to connect with a number of the equipment vendors that he was planning to place orders with before he joined up with Gillian for dinner. Those guys first, he thought, as he mapped out his route through the show.

The Monitor wind vane was almost four thousand dollars, and the Spectra watermaker was more than six thousand dollars. The Monitor wind vane had already been purchased and was in pieces on his living room floor. The watermaker was the next big one, and Spectra, the company that made it was at the show. They were his first stop.

He had traded dozens of emails with Pete, the sales guy at Spectra. With only a thirty-five-gallon water tank onboard Lone Eagle, not having a watermaker wasn’t an option. He had to have one and it had to have some redundancy in case one pump went out; it had to have a backup feedwater pump. His other problem was space. The unit itself, the Clark pressure pump, and the filter membrane were all large items. He had the dimensions from his emails with Pete and had spent hours aboard Lone Eagle figuring out whether it was possible to get all of the components hoses and fittings under the galley sink and associated counter area. It was going to be a really tight fit, and he really wanted to eyeball all of the components. Based on the measurements, it should fit he thought, but he also knew that there might be some installation requirements associated with one or more of the components that might upset the almost zero tolerance space arrangements that he had worked out. Six thousand plus dollars and it doesn’t fit would not be a good answer, he thought, as he spotted the Spectra booth.

As he approached the booth, a sales guy was talking to a customer. He could see his name tag. It was Pete. He scanned the various models on display and found the Santa Cruze - the one he was interested in. Moments later, Pete was at his side and introduced himself. He and Pete spent the better part of an hour going over the Santa Cruze. He had a list of questions, and they worked their way through all of them. To his relief, it seemed that the Santa Cruze model would fit in the limited space under the galley sink. They worked out the spares list and the dozens of filter elements that he would need since he would be running it every day.

He also confirmed that the output he would be getting with both feedwater pumps operating would be forty gallons an hour. Plenty he thought, and if one of the pumps goes down, he would still be able to make twenty gallons an hour. Good, he thought, I’ll also have the Pur emergency desalinator in the ditch bag in Baby Dink. It wouldn’t produce much but it would be enough to keep them alive.

They discussed the price that, with spares, and the secondary feedwater pump, plus four spare impellers, had taken the total amount well north of the six grand he had in the budget. Pete was a good guy and gave him his best boat show discount, and told him everything would be shipped on Monday.

He finished up with Pete and looked at his watch and saw that he had another hour before he needed to be at Gillian’s booth. He was carrying several bags full of purchased gadgets and gizmos plus some additional product literature for other useful items he may need, including a catalog from the Bellingham Chart Company that sold 1/3 size charts that he knew he would need. He wondered how much space there would be after all of the install-in-Florida gear was loaded aboard Lone Eagle. He just groaned as he located the remaining exhibitors that he had to see that were on his list. A couple of more bags, and he was done.

He arrived at Gillian’s wind vane booth just as the day was ending. He tinkered with the display model, as she answered the last potential customer’s questions and closed up the booth for the night. They spent the evening together, and once again, it was clear to both of them that the bond between them was growing stronger. She said she had plenty of frequent flyer miles and could fly back for a long weekend to help out until Lesley arrived. He gratefully accepted her offer to come back Labor Day weekend.

The last weekend of September – Labor Day weekend – the last weekend of America’s summer arrived with a cold front that reminded him that winter was closer than he wanted to think about. He rolled up the car window as he reached highway speed out to the Dulles Airport to meet Gillian. It had only been a few weeks, but it seemed like ages since seeing her at the Annapolis Boat show.

They met at her gate, and the warmth and bond continued to grow. They had a sundowner aboard Lone Eagle that night. They talked about Lesley - the big unknown that would soon be arriving. They talked about her job and about whether she had thought any more about making the trip – she said she had, but said she just couldn’t do it. Nonetheless, the bond continued to grow between them. Gillian couldn’t have been more thoughtful and helpful. He was growing weary from all the preparations, but her encouragement spurred him on. Over dinner, she pulled out a piece of paper and read him a poem she had written.



Ode to Lone Eagle



A voyage of spirits, a search for my soul

Years of frustration and withering inside

A yearning for freedom, the call of the ocean

The challenge so clear, but how to turn the tide?



Spirits from the past, generations of sailors

The sea in my blood passed down through the years

Father, Grandfather, the days of my youth

Too long, just memories, washed by my tears.



The passage of time, the loss of close loved ones

The soul searching cry that pierces my heart

The ache and the loneliness of a soul still denied

The oceans enriched with tears too long cried



The torment and searching are finally over

A boat with a heart and a soul of her own

Strong, majestic, spiritual yet noble

The beautiful lines of the vessel Lone Eagle.



He was stunned. They had only known each other for such a short time, but she captured it. It was as if she had looked into his soul. He instinctively knew as she walked down the boarding ramp for her return flight to San Francisco that this wasn’t the last he’d see of her. He knew that they would see each other again. Don’t close this chapter, he thought, as he walked back to his car. Keep focused - you have a big week ahead of you, he reminded himself.

The next morning he looked at the install-before-you-leave pile. The Monitor wind vane, the Maxprop self-feathering propeller, single sideband HF radio, and the new thru-hull fittings for the saltwater intake and the brine water discharge had to be installed and installed with the boat out of the water. Better call Lenny at Fort Washington and let him know that he urgently needed to haul out and would be on the hard for at least five days. It had to be done in the first week of October as Lesley was due in on the fifteenth, and he needed to start sorting and loading. That will take days, he thought.





CHAPTER XII October 2001 - Trying to outrun winter



Alexandria, Virginia

Lat: 38° 48’ 20.41” N, Long: 077° 02’ 48.92” W

His living room was still a war zone. The install-before-you-leave side of the room thankfully wasn’t getting any bigger, but the install-when-you-get-to-Florida side of the room was massive. Where was he going to stow all that gear, he thought and the survival gear was only just starting to come together. It had taken him days to organize all of it. Bits and pieces had been ordered from a dozen different places and from his local West Marine. Flares, solar blankets, knives, flashlights, fishing gear, high energy bars, rations, the emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) from New Zealand, and everything imaginable for survival at sea and all of it had to be organized and packaged. He’d already gone through hundreds of Ziploc bags, and the number of batteries needed for all manner of things was staggering.

The FedEx guy was pulling up again in front of his place. He was unloading a stack of boxes this time. I wonder what this is, he thought. It turned out to be the watermaker. He sat down on one of the boxes and started looking over the installation instructions. He just groaned – this was going to be a big install. The schematic looked like an octopus, and the bag of parts weighed a ton. It would have to wait until he got to Florida. What the hell, he reminded himself - there was plenty of water available along the 1,000 miles of the Intracoastal Waterway. He dragged all of the water maker boxes over to the install-in-Florida side of the room.

He put the watermaker install instructions back in the box and looked over at the shiny bronze self-feathering propeller sitting on his coffee table that had arrived that morning along with the wind vane that was still in pieces on the floor. He called Lenny, and they agreed that he would be hauled on Friday. He would have the weekend to tackle the Monitor and he would need Dave’s extra hands to do it – the weekend would be perfect. Do a final anti-foul paint job while you’re at it, he thought. He reminded himself that he had to book Dave in for the weekend. As he reached for the phone, it rang.

“Hi, this is Lesley,” she said and went on to explain that she’d given her notice and booked her flight. “I arrive on the 20th of October,” she said. Five days later than promised. Not good, he thought, but there was nothing he could do about it.

They talked about how much gear she should bring and what she needed to buy. He told her she could purchase her foul weather gear at the local West Marine. God, he thought, he had spent a fortune at West Marine over the last few months. He told her he had to run, and then he called Dave. Dave was good for the weekend.

He grabbed his notebook and his keys and headed for Lone Eagle to meet the sailmaker. It had taken him days to prepare the specifications for his new sails, the canvas cockpit covers, and the cover for the dinghy. He arrived at the marina and saw Kevin’s car. As he walked down A Dock, he could see Kevin at work on the cockpit canvas and a pile of sail bags on the dock. He couldn’t wait to see Lone Eagle’s new sails up. There wasn’t any wind, so he was pleased that they could put them all up and see how they looked. Just then, his cell phone rang. It was the electrician, he’d be there in the morning to install the high-frequency single sideband Icom radio, do the wiring for the watermaker, the new inverter, a cockpit freshwater washdown pump and the taffrail generator. It would be a long day tomorrow, but it was coming together – thank God, he thought. Friday would be even bigger.

The new sails looked great. Even though he had specified that the main have no battens, it had an excellent shape and would have no batten pocket wear problems. As he looked at her shape, a breeze came up, and she filled. He saw the two sets of reef points he ordered and thought about the nights ahead where he’d be on deck taking in a reef before a blow. Kevin took his final canvas cockpit cover measurements and was on his way. He said he would be finished in the morning.

It was early Friday morning - the first week of October and the Potomac River was like a mirror as he and Rob backed Lone Eagle out of her slip. He grabbed the VHF radio mic and called the Coast Guard. The radio crackled to life. They were around the bend at the channel entrance to the marina, waiting to escort them to the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. It was a beautiful morning that first week of October. The trees along the river were ablaze in color, and there was indeed a chill in the air. Rob had layers of clothes on to fend off the cold. As they reached the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, he radioed the patrol boat and thanked them for the escort. As they passed under the bridge, he looked up at the mast – one foot of clearance, he thought. He could see the underside of the cars through the draw bridge grate above. They were all headed to work at that hour. Strange, he thought, he wouldn’t be working in this town again. He was really doing it.

They reached the Fort Washington Shipyard, and Lenny, the travel lift operator, had the lift and slings in position. He eased Lone Eagle into the slings and watched as Lenny operated the controls. He saw the straps tightened, taking the strain of Lone Eagle’s 8 tons. Up she came. Lenny was a pro and had been operating that travel lift for thirty years. He had made friends with Lenny during the past winter when he spent almost every weekend working on Lone Eagle. Lenny positioned the travel lift and lowered Lone Eagle onto the blocks. Time to get to work, he thought, as he placed and tensioned the jack stands around her hull.

Thus started what turned out to be three days of work installing the wind vane, the new self-feathering propeller, the two thru-hull fittings for the watermaker, and putting on a coat of anti-fouling paint. Several of his friends dropped by and gave him a hand for a couple of hours, but Dave was there every day. The Monitor wind vane was the hardest. It took hours to get all the lifting ropes just right to position it on the stern and then even more drilling and sealing of all the through bolts for the mounting. What a strange-looking metal contraption he thought, as he stepped back to look at his new wind vane. He knew he would have to do a lot of experimenting with it, as this contraption was going to be steering Lone Eagle all the way to Australia.

The new Maxprop three-bladed self-feathering propeller was another story. He assembled all of its bronze parts and pitched the three blades to the specifications for his type of engine. He finished the anti-fouling paint job and walked over to Lenny’s office. “We’re ready to splash,” he announced.

Lenny said, “Let’s do it.”

His neighbor Rob was aboard for the ride back to the Washington Sailing Marina. Lenny eased the slings, and Lone Eagle settled on her lines. The travel lift straps were lowered out of the way, and once clear, he backed Lone Eagle out of the travel lift pen. That new propeller was great, he thought. Wow, terrific reversing thrust. He idled her down the narrow channel to the Potomac River. He had less than a foot of water under the keel, so his eyes darted from the channel markers to the depth sounder. When he got to the river, he boosted the RPMs to cruise speed, and Lone Eagle surged passed 7 to 9 knots – well beyond hull speed. He looked over the side and saw she was way down in the water. Shit! The wrong pitch he thought. He yelled to Rob, “I’ve got to haul her out again and re-pitch it.”

He raised Lenny on the radio and said they would be heading back and would need to be lifted out so he could change the pitch while she was in the slings. He swung Lone Eagle around and picked up his cell phone to call the propeller company – to give them a piece of his mind and get the new pitch settings.

Three hours later, he had re-pitched the prop, and they splashed Lone Eagle. As he got her out on the river, he boosted the RPMs to cruise level – 7 knots - perfect, he thought. That’s done.

The rest of October was a blur. If he wasn’t down on Lone Eagle doing an install, he was home organizing all manner of spare parts, safety gear, and bits and pieces that would be needed along the way. All systems were go for Lesley’s arrival on the 20th as were the plans for the movers to arrive on the 27th to commence packing and loading the container with his possessions to be shipped to his mother’s place in Australia.

He looked at his watch and thought you better get going if you want to be on time to pick up Lesley. He’d had been straightening up his place all morning to make it look as tidy as he could despite the piles of boxes and gear lining the walls. He was thrilled that she was finally arriving, but was also nervous about whether they would hit it off. My god, he thought I’ll be sailing halfway around the world with her – what if we don’t hit it off – there wasn’t a Plan B.

He reached her gate just as the first passengers came down the air bridge concourse. There she was. Cute, he thought. They hugged, and he gave her the roses that he had picked up along the way. She was a bit thinner than he expected, and that hug told him he would be doing all the heavy lifting. That’s okay, he thought, you figured as much anyway, he reminded himself. They chatted while they waited for her duffle bags to hit the carousel. The two duffle bags he said that would be all they would have room for came off the carousel. Good, he thought she did follow instructions.

They arrived back at his place late in the afternoon, and he got her settled into her room. He cooked dinner, and they shared a glass of wine while he discussed all the things they had to complete to be able to leave by the end of the month. He asked her if she wanted to go and see Lone Eagle.

“I thought you would never ask.” She loved Lone Eagle even the forward V-berth where she would be sleeping – all five foot two of her. She spent a lot of time opening compartments and asking lots of questions. He showed her the cockpit layout and all the sail and halyard control lines. She kept asking lots of questions – he liked that.

The days passed quickly, and Lesley worked as hard as he did. She was an IT expert and took charge of the laptop that they would be taking on the trip. The laptop, the high-frequency single sideband Icom radio, and the Pachter modem that he bought would, via their new Sailmail email account, give them the ability to send and receive emails while at sea. It was a daunting system with all manner of manuals and instructions, but Lesley rolled up her sleeves and made it her mission to make it all work.

On October 27, the container door slammed with a clunk as he was signing off on the packing lists with the shipping company. It contained all of the things that he hadn’t sold or given away. Funny, he thought, it will take thirty days for it to arrive at mom’s place and it would take him a year to get there. He watched the truck turn at the corner and went back inside to see how Lesley was doing organizing all the canned goods. They had three more days until their departure and there was still so much left to be done. He thought enough for one day, let's go get a pizza. He was going to miss his favorite pizza place.

October 31 – Halloween was their last day in Washington. It took two trips to get the last of the gear moved to Lone Eagle. They spent the afternoon stowing everything and making the final run to the grocery store for fresh fruit, veg, and bread. His friend Dave arrived and right behind him was Kevin the sailmaker. They toasted a safe voyage. He was glad they could stop by. He knew future contact would be via email. He and Dave had practiced law together for fifteen years. He and Dave went for a walk down A Dock, where he gave Dave a folder containing his signed will and power of attorney.

"You sure you want to do this?” Dave asked somberly.

“I’ve got to do this.”

“There’s always a place for you at the firm,” Dave said.

“Thanks, Dave. I’ve always enjoyed working with you, but I’ve got to do this – there’s nothing left for me here in Washington.”

They embraced – “Be careful, my friend.” Dave said as he turned and walked down A dock to his car.

Back aboard Lone Eagle, he pulled the companionway hatch closed and turned on the little space heater. It was starting to get cold. You better beat feet south boy, he thought as he and Lesley continued their stowing preparations.





CHAPTER XIII November 2001 - The Potomac River



Colonial Beach, Virginia

Lat: 38° 12’ 16.69’ N, Long: 76° 58’ 47.66” W

It was a ninety mile run from Washington to the mouth of the Potomac River, where it emptied into the Chesapeake Bay. He had set the alarm for 0400 so that they could get some breakfast and get the lines ready to be taken in at first light. As he warmed up the diesel, he picked up the VHF mic and called Coast Guard for the required escort. They were there waiting for him – right on time.

The weather forecast was good – it needed to be. With Daylight Savings Time over, he would need every minute of daylight to make it to Colonial Beach, Virginia. They cleared the Woodrow Wilson Bridge and had all the canvas up. The tide was running out, so that gave them a few extra knots. He knew it would be against them before nightfall, but he didn’t know by how much. Keep that one to yourself, he thought. By early afternoon the tide had changed, and their speed dropped to under four knots. He checked their position and knew they wouldn’t make it to Colonial Beach before nightfall – and, if memory served him, there were no places to anchor along this part of the river – too shallow and too narrow. He’d never been into Stepp’s Marina just south of Colonial Beach. This is going to be dicey, he thought.

He climbed into the cockpit and sat next to Lesley. “We’re not going to make it to the marina south of Colonial Beach before nightfall,” he told her.

“What does that mean?” she asked with more than a bit of trepidation in her voice and on her face.

“We’ll have to make a night landing into the marina – there just aren’t any places to anchor along the river. We’ll just go in real slow so that if we run aground, we can back off. It's all mud, so we should be alright.”

“Rob. What if we get stuck and can’t back off?’ she asked.

“Well, it will be low tide and we’ll just wait for high tide, and then we’ll float off.”

As the miles ticked by, the sun dropped lower, setting at 1730. At least the main channel markers were lit, he thought. They made it to the entrance to the side channel that would lead them to Stepp’s Marina – he knew the side channel marks wouldn’t be lit, so he had the spotlight at the ready. He was on the bow and as he spotted each mark he directed Lesley at the tiller. They were going dead slow. Then, there was no next mark – Number 7 where was it, he thought. They were on the right compass heading. He ran back to the cockpit, and they changed places. He decided to ease Lone Eagle to slow ahead on what appeared on the chart to be the right course to find the missing next mark. The depth sounder alarm went off, and he put her in reverse – too late, as he watched the depth meter go to zero and felt Lone Eagle abruptly stop in the mud. He throttled up in reverse, and she pulled free.

They soft grounded twice more. Lesley was still sweeping port and starboard with the high beam spotlight looking for elusive Number 7. Just then, the VHF radio crackled to life.

“The vessel entering the harbor, do you read me?” the voice said. The voice said he was the Stepp’s Harbor marina manager and said he had been watching them come in. Thank God, he thought. He keyed the mic and thanked the voice and then asked, “Where are markers No. 7, 8, and 9?”

“They were all washed away by last winter’s ice. I’ll come out in my dinghy and guide you guys in.”

Great, he thought, that was six months ago, and they hadn’t replaced them. “Thank you,” he replied, wondering how many other boats had had as much fun as he was having.

The voice belonged to Charlie. He came alongside in his leaky dinghy that looked like it was about to sink and introduced himself. He then took up a position in front of Lone Eagle. As Charlie guided them into his marina, he watched the depth sounder. He had told Charlie that they drew 5 feet, but Charlie assured him that they had ‘plenty of water.’ Lesley had the dock lines ready. By the time they finished tying up and stowing gear, it was already 2130. He told Lesley, who looked exhausted that they wouldn’t be prepared for an early 0-dark-hundred departure the next morning and that they would need to stay over another night. She seemed relieved, but then he had to explain that the next leg to Reedville was just as long and that they would have to leave at first light to have any chance of making it and avoiding a repeat of tonight’s performance. He knew the doubts were creeping into her head, but there wasn’t a thing he could do about it – he couldn’t make Reedville any closer. He kept reassuring her that she was doing a great job, and this was all part of sailing – he hoped it would be a very small part of it.

“You guys awake?” came Charlie’s voice.

He had been up for a while and had just finished his first cup of coffee with Lesley. “We’re up, Charlie, want some coffee?” he replied as he came up the companionway ladder.

“No thanks,” Charlie replied, “But the misses just baked these muffins and thought you might like them,” Charlie said as he handed him the basket.

“Thanks, Charlie, that was very thoughtful. Please thank your misses very much for us. And, Charlie, is it OK if we stay another night?”

“No problem. And if you need the use of a car to get into town for anything you can take my old Volvo, it’s up there next to the barn – keys are under the front seat.”

“Thanks, Charlie – that’s very generous of you. I think we will need to take a trip in to top up our provisions.”

They had re-provisioned and topped off the Volvo’s tank as he eased her in next to the barn. They carried the groceries down to the boat and stowed them. Lesley took the basket that contained the muffins from the morning and headed for Charlie’s house and returned an hour later.

“Rob, Charlie’s wife is Helen, and she is so nice, she made tea for me. I wish we could stay another day, but I know we have to get going.”

“I like the place too, but you’re right, we do need to keep moving – winter isn’t far behind us. I settled up with Charlie so we can head out at first light.”

0400 came, and he was up downloading the weather forecast. Good news and bad news – a cold front would be coming in from the northwest – good wind he thought, but he knew the mouth of the Potomac as it entered the Chesapeake bay would likely be a bit sporty. Keep that thought to yourself, he decided. He told her about the cold front and the good wind that he expected. What the hell he thought, no need to rattle her cage especially if the sportiness he expected never materialized.

They were underway at first light. There wasn’t any wind – yet. It came in out of the north at about 0900 and was building – the front was coming. As the day wore on, the wind continued to build and started to back out of the northwest. A good 20 knots and Lone Eagle was powering along at five knots. Five knots – it should be more, he thought. He reminded himself that the tide would be running into the river until seven – God, we’re going to have another night landing.

As they were approaching Piney Point, he looked at the chart and saw the wreck of the German submarine U-1105 that sunk during WWII on its way up the Potomac River on its way to attack Washington. Incredible, he thought. It certainly would have gotten everyone’s attention had they succeeded.

They reached the mouth of the Potomac just after sunset, and Reedville was just around the corner. As he saw the channel light at the entrance to the river and felt the wind at his back, he could see the white caps. The tide had turned; it was running out pushed by the wind, and the white caps were atop a steep four-foot wave – it was indeed going to be sporty.

“Lesley, go get your foul weather gear on and bring mine up,” he said as he looked at the GPS. They would be in this for a couple of miles, and then they would turn right and head south toward Reedville. At that point, they would be under the lee of the Virginia shore, but it was still going to be a night landing – not good, he thought.

Lone Eagle powered through the steep chop with a fair bit of spray and a bit of green water over the bow. He knew all was okay, but Lesley looked terrified despite his calming words. They rounded the channel marker at the entrance to the Potomac and took up a heading toward Reedville. As they passed the river entrance, the chop flattened and he could concentrate on organizing his approach to Reedville. The GPS had him right on course. As he approached the entrance to the Reedville harbor, the lights of the town made it hard to see the flashing red and green lights in the harbor maks.

“Lesley…please grab the spotlight, I think we will need it.” While she was below, he rechecked the GPS and the chart. There were some right-angle bends to the channel that he knew would be tricky. He took it slow – dead slow as they made their approach. They were on the right compass course after the last mark, but Lesley couldn’t find the next mark. Just then, the first soft grounding occurred. Lone Eagle’s bow dipped, and he eased her into reverse and backed off the mud bar. They had several more soft groundings before they were well into the harbor and able to make out the various docks and the marina where they would tie-up. Lesley was shaken. They tied up to the marina dock, and without a word, she disappeared down the pier and into the marina restaurant. She returned and was crying.

She exclaimed, “I can’t do this…I can’t do this anymore. I called my Dad, and I’m going home.” She pushed passed him and went below into the forepeak and was tearing through duffle bags and stuffing them with her belongings.

“What are you doing?” he asked.

“I’m going home.”

“Home?” he said in disbelief.

“Look, Lesley, I know it was a white knuckle landing, but we made it. We’re safe; the boat is safe; we made it.”

While she was stuffing her duffle bags, he tried to reason with her. “Why don’t you wait until morning, and I’ll organize transport for you back to Arizona.”

Her only reply was, “I’ve got to go home.”

Within a matter of a few minutes, she was off the boat, duffle bags in tow and heading down the dock.

She disappeared into the night in the middle of nowhere. Where would she go; where would she stay; how would she get to the airport? What the hell, he thought – that’s her problem. If she walked off – jumped ship – he knew he had no obligation to pay for her transport home. Let her go, he thought. He sat in the cockpit and wondered what he was going to do. Shit, his crew was gone. Was he going to do this solo? He crawled into his bunk that night, tears in his eyes, could he do this solo, was the better question.

The next morning he awoke to the renewed trepidation of what he was going to do. He was solo now, and the painful reality of it was just starting to settle in. He walked up to the restaurant on the dock, and the looks he got from the wait staff said it all. Lesley must have told them he was some kind of Captain Ahab. He grabbed his ordered coffee and headed back to Lone Eagle and sat in the cockpit, and started taking stock. He looked at his watch and saw that it was early west coast time and dialed Gillian’s number. She answered on the second ring. She couldn’t believe Lesley had jumped ship. They both agreed that her rowing experience hadn’t given her any night running much less night landing experience, and she just freaked - out. Gillian said she had lots of banked vacation time and would go to her boss and see if she could get a few days off to help him take Lone Eagle down to Tudi’s place in North Carolina. She was magic, he thought. I can’t believe she would do this to help me. Within a couple of hours, she called back and told him that her boss had given her the time off and that she would book her flight and call him and tell him when she would be arriving in Norfolk, Virginia – the nearest airport.

That night she called and gave him her flights. Great, she’ll be here tomorrow night. How far was Norfolk from Reedville, he wondered as he closed the hatched and crawled into his bunk’? I’ll work that one out tomorrow, he thought as he drifted off to sleep.





CHAPTER XIV November 2001 - Enter Gillian – Again



Reedville, Virginia

Lat: 72°50’ 30.85’ N, Long: 76°16’ 24.02” W

Her flight into Norfolk from San Francisco was getting in at 2100, and with the drive to Reedville, he calculated she’d be in around midnight. He busied himself straightening up Lone Eagle for her arrival. He looked at his watch; it was midnight. Just then, he saw a flash of a car’s headlights in the marina restaurant’s parking lot. She’s here – thank God.

She was walking down the dock just as he was climbing up the companionway later.

“Hi Baby, thanks for coming,” he said.

“It was a miracle I found this place. The guys at the car rental place didn’t even have a map that showed Reedville. I finally found a gas station, and they had a map.”

They sat in Lone Eagle’s cockpit for a nightcap and talked about Lesley’s departure and their plans for the next few days. They were going to sail Lone Eagle to Tudi’s place on the Neuse River in North Carolina. As soon as they arrived, she would fly back to San Francisco, and he would spend the next two weeks doing more of the install-before-you-leave work that still needed to get done. They agreed that they would need one more day in Reedville to give Gillian time to organize Lone Eagle and the galley for the run to Tudi’s place.

That morning Gillian went at it. All the cabinets and hatches were open, and everything was strewn everywhere. He returned from one of his many trips to the hardware store to find Lone Eagle a war zone.

“Gillian. What are you doing?”

“I’ve got to straighten out the mess Lesley left you. If you can stay out of here for an hour, I’ll have it all stowed,” she replied, then added, “Lesley didn’t have a clue about organizing a galley.”

“No problem. I have plenty to do on deck.” He replied as he grabbed his tool bag and a caulking gun and headed for the anchor windlass he had installed on Lone Eagle’s bowsprit. A little caulking and some seizing wire around the shackles connecting the anchor to the anchor chain, and she’s done, he thought.

They were up before first light, and he was going over the charts for the Chesapeake Bay for the run to Norfolk, Virginia, while Gillian cooked them breakfast and started making sandwiches for lunch. God, she’s great on a boat. This is the way it should work, he thought.

They took in the lines and motored Lone Eagle down the winding, narrow channel that was so nerve-racking several nights earlier.

“I’ll never forget this place,” he said as they cleared the last marker and entered the Chesapeake.

“Neither will I. I can’t believe this is my first sail on Lone Eagle,” she replied.

The late autumn sun was up, and the breeze was filling in. “Let’s get some canvas up,” he said as he climbed up on deck and hoisted the mainsail. As he climbed back into the cockpit, he released the furling line on the Genny, and she filled with a crack. Lone Eagle settled into a gentle heal. As the knots increased, he shut down the diesel. It was always a great sensation to shut down the engine and have only the sound of the water rushing by the hull. He loved it.

The Chesapeake Bay was beautiful at this time of the year. Even some of the old Skipjacks were working. It made him think of his days growing up on the Great South Bay on Long Island. All those late autumn days clamming and sailing the bay. He remembered the times when his father had borrowed a friend’s scallop dredges one late autumn and they came home with bushels of scallops and sat in the garage for hours shucking them while his mother put them in Tupperware containers bound for the deep freeze and delicious dinners throughout the winter months when the bay was frozen solid.

He remembered his father’s stories about Norfolk during the war when all of the convoys would form up and head out into the Atlantic to face the German submarine wolf packs that decimated so many ships. There was one story that really stayed with him. As his father told it, he was aboard a Liberty ship, and they were tied up in Norfolk waiting for orders. One morning they were ordered to remove all of the tools off the ship, but they had no idea why. When they deposited the tools on the dock, there was a truck waiting that had unloaded several wooden boxes on the wharf which contained copper replacement tools that they took aboard. Then another truck arrived and unloaded thirty days’ worth of boxed lunches. Later a convoy of trucks arrived carrying a million gallons of highly flammable aviation fuel in five-gallon jerry cans. The copper tools were to prevent sparks and the boxed lunches meant that there would be no cooking. They were bound for North Africa.

As his father told it, his Liberty ship and another just like it loaded with avgas passed through Gibraltar headed for Libya when out of the clouds, a German Stuker dive bomber appeared and dropped a bomb on the ship next to them. The explosion was so great that it vaporized the ship and melted the paint. It also singed all of the hair off the crew that were on deck on his dad’s ship. There were so many stories.

Norfolk would be a night landing, but this time the harbor would be well lit as it was the home of the US Navy’s Atlantic Fleet. He had sailed past it on his way back from Tudi’s. As they approached the harbor, it was ablaze with lights – the Navy must be making ready for deployment, he thought.

It was mid–November and the city docks were already covered in Christmas lights. There was even a tall ship gathering, and they too were draped in Christmas lights. He used the binoculars to scan the fleet of tall ships. Was she there? – Sorlandet – the Norwegian training ship that his great uncle had captained before the war? No. He didn’t see her – someday, he thought.

The reflection of the Christmas lights on the calm waters of the harbor was magic. He eased Lone Eagle into the marina, where the dockmaster directing him to a slip.

“How long are you staying?” he asked.

“Just for the night,” he replied as Gillian threw him a bow line.

“No problem. Just come up to the office when you’re finished tying up – I’ll be closing in an hour, and I expect you will be underway long before we open.”

They had made it to Norfolk. The start of the thousand-mile long Intracoastal Waterway that ended in Miami. He wondered how many times he had made the trip. Spring heading north; fall heading south. He’d done it so many times and loved it. The Intracoastal Waterway or the ICW, or the ditch, as it was known by the yachties, went through the heartland of America’s east coast paralleling the Atlantic. The locals along the way had big hearts, warm smiles, and freely offered whatever help you needed. It had been almost twenty years since his last trip the full length of the ICW. I wonder how much has changed, he thought. He knew from a year earlier that little had, at least, on the segment from North Carolina to Norfolk when he brought Lone Eagle back to Washington. It was the same as it had been when he had made the trip with his father on the Bountiful II.

The three days from Norfolk to Tudi’s place passed quickly. Everything with Gillian was clicking – everything went smoothly even night landings at the marinas named Coin Jock, and Thunderbolt happened without incident. He remembered that he had spent many happy nights in their restaurants and bars eating great local seafood and sharing a beer with the other nomadic yachtsman, some he hadn’t seen since the last seasonal migration.

They arrived at Tudi’s place, and the sight of Lone Eagle back at her old dock brought a tear to Tudi’s eye among the hugs that went all around. He had made it, he thought, and Gillian’s agreement the night before to come back to do the next leg to South Carolina gave him so much relief. She would be back the day before Thanksgiving, and he knew that as soon as she got back that they needed to keep pushing southward. Winter wasn’t far behind them as he tied-off the last dock line and walked up the long dock for what he knew would be one of Tudi’s wonderful home-cooked meals.

The next morning the drive to the Raleigh airport was a quiet one. The goodbyes were getting harder and harder, but he was thrilled that she would make the trip with him south as far as Georgetown, South Carolina. They embraced as she walked down the jetway for her flight back to San Francisco.

During the drive back to Tudi’s place, his mind raced through all of the projects that he wanted to have completed before Gillian’s return. He knew the list was daunting, but he reminded himself he had two weeks to get them done, and that was a lot of time.





CHAPTER XV November 22, 2001 - The Neus River



New Bern, North Carolina

Lat: 35° 07’ 49.00” N, Long: 76° 97’ 00.00” W

He woke before it was light. The little space heater was going, but he could feel the chill in the cabin air. He felt her warmth next to him under the goose down quilt. They were going today, he told himself, but get some rest while you can. He inched closer to her; she was incredible. She had arrived at midnight and was carrying cooler packs with a complete Thanksgiving dinner. He so wanted her to make the whole trip.

“Rob, what time is it?”

“It’s 0500 baby, we better get going.”

“It’s cold, I’ll get the stove going and get us some coffee,” she said as he removed the three weatherboards from the companionway hatch.

“Hey Gillian, winter has caught up with us; take a look at this,” he said as he stood and stretched his muscles in the cockpit. She climbed up the companionway ladder, and there it was – winter - snow and ice on the decks, and the river was enshrouded in fog.

“Are we going to be able to get out of here?’ she asked.

“The fog will burn off in a couple of hours. We need to be ready to move as soon as it does.”

The fog was slow to burn off as he kept looking at his watch. If they didn’t get going soon, he thought they would have to make another night landing at Wrightsville Beach.

“We’ve got to go now and hope it clears by the time we get out into Pamlico Sound. The entrance to this place is tricky, so if it isn’t clear enough to see the marks, we’ll just drop anchor and wait,” he said as Gillian and Tudi took in the lines.

“I’ll see you guys in Florida for Christmas,” Tudi yelled as they were powering away from the dock.

As he looked back, Tudi and the dock gradually disappeared into the fog. I don’t think I’ll ever see this place again, he thought.

They made it to Pamlico Sound after a brief anchoring at the channel to wait for better visibility. It was cold, but they were dressed for it, and the sailing was exhilarating. They had the wind on their beam, and Lone Eagle was powering along.

“If this wind holds, we should make it to Wrightsville Beach just at sunset,” he told her as she passed up another steaming mug of coffee.

“We better,” she said. “I’ve carted this Thanksgiving dinner all the way from California, and I don’t want us to be too tired to eat it.”

The wind held, and they made Wrightsville just at sunset. It had been a great day, he thought as he finished with the last of the dock lines and the ever-important power cord that would keep their little space heater going.

It was a fantastic Thanksgiving feast with all the trimmings. She had thought of everything. The oil lamps were burning, and they were together once again. “Have you given any more thought to making the trip with me?” he asked.

“Rob, I want to, but how am I going to leave my job, and if I do quit, I’ll have to sell the boat I’m living on. Let’s concentrate on getting Lone Eagle to Key West.”

He knew he couldn’t push it any further. As she stood at the galley sink, he put his arms around her, “Thanks for coming back, and thanks for such a great dinner; you’re simply wonderful.”

The days passed quickly, the nights were spent tucked into little marinas along the ICW. They arrived in the small town of Georgetown, South Carolina. It had a picturesque little harbor where they anchored. It was late autumn, and the trees that surrounded the harbor were still ablaze of color. A great spot he thought. I just wish I had more time to stay here. They had lunch ashore and Gillian amazingly ran into some old friends from California. With goodbyes said, they went off to the local supermarket to top up their provisions. “We need to get you easy meals to make for this next leg,” she said.

The next morning he rowed her ashore in Baby Dink to pick up a rental car for the drive to the airport. It was another teary goodbye. She had promised she’d be back for Christmas. These goodbyes were killing him.

“Rob, be careful,” she said as she slung her bag over her shoulder and headed down the jetway.

The sun was setting as he pulled into the car rental place. It was dark by the time he made it back to the town dock and rowed out to Lone Eagle in Baby Dink. Solo again, he thought. This will be an interesting run – South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. He had three weeks to cover three states. Better get some sleep, he thought as he tied off Baby Dink and lit the oil lamps. No space heater tonight, he thought – not here at anchor.





CHAPTER XVI Early December 2001 - The Solo Leg



Hilton Head Island, South Carolina

Lat: 32° 12’ 58.74” N, Long: 080° 45’ 09.39” W

Lone Eagle’s engine was warming up just as the kettle came to a boil. He filled one thermos with coffee, the other with instant soup, and made a couple of sandwiches. He knew he had to have it all handy if he was going solo down the ICW. He knew he could stop and anchor, but also knew he couldn’t afford the lost hour or more it would take, not with the sun still setting at 5 pm. He got the anchor up out of the mud of Georgetown Harbor and set off down the channel to the ICW. Marine weather radio said it would be a good day, but rain was forecast for tomorrow. OK, let’s see how far we get today.

He released the furling line to the Genny, and it opened with the usual crack as it filled with wind. He wound the sheet line around the self-tailing cockpit winch while he kept his foot on Lone Eagle’s tiller and his eye on the compass. You’re going to have to get real good at this, he thought. Then he thought, how am I going to do this out at sea in a blow? Stop thinking about doing this solo, he reminded himself. You can’t do it solo. You just have to get Gillian to say yes. A big ask he thought.

Time to play with the wind vane and see how she works, he thought – you need to do this. He knew the wind vane could free him up to leave the tiller and work on deck. He eased the Genny and brought Lone Eagle to a stop in the middle of the ICW channel. He connected Monitor’s airfoil, the control lines to the tiller, and dropped its paddle in the water. Good, he thought – let’s do it.

The wind was steady, and he played with the control lines. Tug on this one and see how Lone Eagle responds – just watch, he thought – feel how she responds. She did – she slowly started to head upwind. OK, he thought, now let’s tug on the other one and see if she heads downwind – she did. This could be great, he thought. Throughout the day, he let Monitor steer Lone Eagle, adjusting her heading only at each bend in the channel with little tugs on the control lines. Lone Eagle stayed right on course – he could even go below for a few seconds to pop in a new CD or grab a sandwich out of the fridge. Relief, he thought. I can do this – I can sail Lone Eagle solo! The relief that washed over him was palpable. He walked up on deck while Monitor steered Lone Eagle down the ICW, and danced to Christopher Cross’ Sailing as Lone Eagle powered ahead and Monitor kept her right on course.

His next port would be Hilton Head, South Carolina. Wow, he’d stopped there with his dad and on numerous other yachts twenty years earlier. Its candy-striped lighthouse and harbor were beautiful. He had had so many good times there, and wonder how much it had changed. He checked his chart and GPS and thought he would be in by 1600. The tide was running out, so he was getting an extra two knots, making his speed 7.5 knots. Just might get in early, he thought.

He picked up the binoculars and started looking for Hilton Head. There it was – the candy-striped lighthouse. Wow – Hilton Head – this is going to be fun. He raised the dockmaster on the VHF and was given berth and entrance instructions. As he was pulling into his slip, a guy from a big 63’ Hatteras sportfishing boat jumped on the dock and took his lines.

“Names Mike,” he said.

“Hi Mike, I’m Rob, nice boat you have there.”

“Thanks,” he said. “I am having a devil of a time wiring in a new bilge pump. You know anything about wiring.”

“I do. I’d be happy to have a look at it for you later.”

“You look like you could use a cold beer.”

“Thanks, Mike. I’d love one; it’s been a long day.”

He finished his beer and told Mike that he had to get to the marina’s little store before it closed.

“How long are you going to be here?” Mike asked.

“I’ll stay tomorrow but need to be heading out the day after. I’ve got to meet some people in Stuart, Florida, for Christmas.”

He found his way back to the little marina store and bought a fresh loaf of bread. On his way back he spotted the showers and walked by the expensive shops that catered to the island’s upscale guests who flew in on their Lear jets to meet their transiting mega yachts. The only thing that had changed was the size of the yachts – they were bigger, much bigger. When he came through with his dad all those years ago, seventy feet was considered a big boat. Now it wouldn’t get a second look.

The next morning he grabbed his coffee and walked over to Mike’s yacht Thunder.

“Hey, Mike, you aboard?”

The hatches were open, and a voice from below said, “Come aboard.” He stepped into Thunder’s cockpit just as Mike was poking his head up through one of the hatches.

“How’s it going?” he asked.

“I give up. I am just going to call an electrician,” Mike said with an obvious note of frustration in his voice.

“Let me have a look,” he said.

“Rob, what do you think?”

“I can do this,” he said, knowing it was going to take the better part of the morning. “Show me where your main panel is, and I’ll see if we can make this work.”

Mike took him below. Thunder was beautiful. He loved Hatteras yachts – they were built to be fantastic sea boats, and Thunder was no exception.

He opened the electrical panel and saw the wire race that he needed to use to wire Mike’s new bilge pump. He went back to Lone Eagle and grabbed his electrical bag. It was noon before he climbed out of Thunder’s cockpit hatch. “Turn it on,” he said as he looked at his scratched arms and greasy hands.

Mike yelled, “It’s working. Rob, that’s great, thanks.”

“No problem,” he replied as he closed his electrical bag and started for the dock.

“How much do I owe you?” Mike asked.

“A beer a bit later would be great.”

“No way, Rob; I’m paying you an electrician’s hourly rate,” Mike said as stuffed a hundred in his pocket.

“Thanks, Mike, this will come in handy at the fuel dock.”

He was up at first light and was backing Lone Eagle out of her slip when Mike came up on deck. “Fair winds Rob. Have a great trip,” he yelled.

He had shared with Mike his plans. “Fair winds, my friend,” he replied.

He was enjoying being back in the boating community. People helped people - plain and simple. They didn’t ask; they just rolled up their sleeves and pitched in. A far cry from his Washington law practice, he thought as he eased Lone Eagle down the channel passed the candy-striped lighthouse. This is probably the last time you’ll ever see Hilton Head, he thought. It made him sad. There were a lot of things he was going to miss.

He reached the ICW and turned southward. It was a beautiful autumn day with the sun bright and the wind a consistent at 15 knots out of the east. It would be a good day, he thought as he furled out the Genny and engaged Monitor. With a little luck, he would make Savannah by nightfall. As the day wore on the wind started to build, it was now 20 knots and gusting to 30. OK, Monitor, let’s see what you’re made of. He had the main and the Genny up, and Lone Eagle was making 6.5 knots. As the gusts hit, Monitor would round up into the wind, spill some off, and fall right back on course. Magic, he thought – even if I’m a bit over canvassed, she’ll spill off the wind. This was going to come in handy in a blow. He could sense Monitor would act-up if he were over canvassed. If he put a reef in the main, she would settle right down. You’re tuning into your boat, he thought.

The CD was blasting the Doobie Brothers Under Full Sail when he looked at his watch and then the GPS. Savannah was going to be a push he thought. Let’s see if the ICW guide shows a marina this side of Savannah. Sure enough, there was a small marina, just north of Savannah. We’ll stop there for the night.

Tired, but with a satisfying sense of relief, he tied up at the little marina. It was only three in the afternoon, but the next marina was on the far side of the Port of Savannah some twenty miles away and he knew he’d never have made it before nightfall. No way, solo night navigation through the Port of Savannah was not something he was interested in tackling even with Monitor. He finished tying Lone Eagle’s dock lines and grabbed his shower kit, and headed off to the marina’s showers. He took what felt like a two-hour shower, and stood there with the hot water cascading over his shoulders – the knots in his shoulders loosening as he thought to himself, you’re really tuning in with your boat – you can feel her; anticipate her reactions.

The alarm went off at 0500, and as he pressed the snooze button, he heard the sound of rain on the cabin roof. Oh God, he thought, I’ve got to navigate the Port of Savannah in this weather. What kind of visibility am I going to have, and what kind of shipping traffic am I going to encounter? He got out of his bunk and grabbed his foul weather gear to have a look topside. Misting rain – quarter-mile visibility – I’ve got to do this, he thought. OK, get the coffee and the soup in the thermos and get a couple of sandwiches made.

Once away from the dock and in the ICW, he dropped the back and side curtains for the cockpit – God he wished he had asked the canvas maker to make larger plastic windows – he could hardly see a thing, but at least he wasn’t getting wet. There wasn’t a puff of wind, so he motored down the ICW coffee mug in hand and Jimmy Buffett’s Cheeseburger in Paradise playing on the stereo – that would be a lot better than the peanut butter and jelly sandwich he was just eating. Yeah, he thought; a margarita in Margaritaville wouldn’t be bad either. Key West boy; you're on your way, he reminded himself.

The GPS showed his exact position in the channel with another ten miles to go before he reached the port of Savannah. So far so good. Just then, the VHF radio crackled to life.

“Sailing vessel proceeding southbound on the ICW approaching channel marker 143 this is the ocean-going tug Atlantis two miles astern of you - do you copy?” the voice said.

He looked at the GPS; channel marker 143 was his next mark. Must be me, he thought. He keyed the mic. “This is sailing vessel Lone Eagle southbound on the ICW approaching channel marker 143; do you copy?”

The radio crackled, “Lone Eagle, this is the ocean-going tug Atlantis; we are two miles astern of you and towing large cargo. We need you to exit the channel as we pass. There is plenty of water on either side of the channel, please acknowledge and advise which side of the channel you prefer.”

He keyed the mic “Atlantis, this is Lone Eagle. I will take the starboard side of the channel and will standby channel 16.”

“Thank you Lone Eagle, this is Atlantis standing by on 16,” the voice replied.

“Lone Eagle standing by on 16,” he replied.

The rain was still misting, and visibility was about as bad as it was going to get. He altered course to be just outside of the channel markers and kept a close eye on the GPS and the depth sounder. No place to run aground, he thought. I hope that tug captain is right about deep water just outside of the channel markers – the depth sounder showed it was. He got a visual on marker number 145 and was adjusting his course toward it, just as he heard the sound of high-speed propellers. They were getting closer. He peered through the plastic window of the port side curtain and could just make out a dark shape along his port side. He raised the corner of the side curtain and there was a 20 foot inflatable with six guys all dressed in black Nomex and aiming M-16 rifles at him.

“Hi guys,” he said, as he looked just aft of them and saw the conning tower of a huge submarine – a Los Angeles class attack submarine. She was massive, and so was the wake she was putting out. He had just enough time to lower his US flag – an old sailor’s tradition when overtaken by a man-o-war that he had learned from his father. He no sooner dropped the flag to half-staff when the radio crackled to life.

“Lone Eagle… this is Captain Williams of the USS Charleston, thank you for your courtesy.”

“Charleston, this is Lone Eagle; you’re most welcome,” then added, “Captain, you are throwing a massive wake that I will need to turn into, in a moment to avoid losing everything below and swamping my dinghy. Could you please advise the guys in Nomex off my beam that I am not initiating hostile action.”

“Will do, Lone Eagle.”

“Thank you, Captain, and good hunting.”

“Acknowledged, and thank you, Lone Eagle. Charleston clear.”

“Lone Eagle, clear.”

He watched Charleston fade into the mist. He wondered what her orders were and thought to himself, I hope they blow the bastards to hell that hit us on 911. Charleston had just made the turn for the run seaward when he lost sight of her. Instinctively he snapped to attention and saluted in their direction. He was proud to be an American, and those boys were heading into harm’s way. God bless and God’s speed, he thought.

Hang on; concentrate, he thought. This is really a wide port, and you have to find the entrance to the southbound side of the ICW on the other side of it, and visibility is terrible. He headed for what he thought was the entrance. No score – it doesn’t look right, he thought as he put the binoculars down. Let’s raise one of the fishing boats out here on the VHF radio and see if we can get some help. They confirmed that he was closer than he thought and had a short motor to the entrance to the ICW on the south side of the Port of Savannah. He made it. Wow! What a morning he thought – a cheeseburger in paradise and a Los Angeles class attack sub.

He made the turn for the ICW, and the weather started to break. He felt the breeze building in from the east, and with it, the sky began to clear. He furled-out the Genny and engaged Monitor. Lone Eagle dutifully healed to starboard, and the knot meter climbed. He turned off the engine and ducked below and put in Springsteen’s Born in the USA and spent the afternoon surging down the ICW.

From Savannah, he was headed to Georgia’s Dismal Swamp. There were two routes through it. In the past, he had taken both. He decided on the Dismal Swamp route – more open water and a better chance for wind. The other – the one-through-the-tree's route, was a straight channel little wider than Lone Eagle that would have tall trees on both sides, and no wind. He veered off for the Dismal Swamp route. It ran for almost twenty miles, and for four hours, all there were dead trees on either side of the channel. They looked like ghosts reaching up to the sky. They had died a long time ago – how long ago he didn’t know, but they had been there twenty years earlier when he had made the run with his dad.

He reached the end of the Dismal Swamp and maneuvered Lone Eagle into the ICW channel along the salt marshes. The marshes smelled sweat to him. A smell that had been known to him since the days of his youth on Long Island – a scent that he associated with good fishing and even better seafood. Those were the days he thought. The Great South Bay was his playground with its barrier islands and beaches; the sailing and the fishing were his passions. First, it was on a 12-foot Sunfish sailboat and then on his 16-foot skiff with its little 9 horsepower motor. It was where he learned to sail and learned how to climb the wind. He knew the bay like the back of his hand. All the good crabbing spots; where to camp for the night and catch dinner – okay, he thought, enough drifting off, you’ve got the ICW to cover, and you don’t know it like the back of your hand he reminded himself.

He looked at the ICW chart and the GPS. He was approaching the Georgia / Florida border. He hoped he could make it to Saint Augustine before nightfall. It would be a big stretch, he thought. The ICW at this point was just a channel in the salt marshes with the Atlantic just over sand dunes less than a half-mile to the east. The wind was out of the east, and he had the main and Genny up, and Monitor was steering. He was making four knots, and Saint Augustine was twenty miles and one bridge away. It was already 1400, and the tide was against him – he was only making four knots – that’s five hours, he thought.

OK, one last bridge to clear before I can cross the border; it’s just a mile ahead, according to the chart. Just then, the VHF came to life.

“This is the sailing vessel Ticonderoga heading south on the ICW. If anyone out there is heading south and approaching the draw bridge at the border, be aware that the tide is ripping through under the bridge. We almost hit one of the dolphins.”

Great, he thought, this is going to get dicey. He disengaged Monitor and revved Lone Eagle’s engine to full RPMs and checked the oil pressure and water temperature. All okay, he thought. Please don’t fail me now.

As he neared the bridge, he saw that the pass under the bridge span was almost like a rapids; the water was boiling through. Keep a good grip on the tiller and hold her in the middle, he told himself. His heart went to his throat when he saw that his forward progress had slowed almost to the point of almost standing still. Go full-throttle – Now! Lone Eagle was barely edging ahead as the water boiled around him. The Genny was out at seventy-five percent. Release the furling line and get her to a hundred – Now, he thought as he reached for the furling line. Lone Eagle was gaining ground. He gripped the tiller with both hands and knew that if the in-flow caught his bow that he would careen headlong into one of the dolphins. He looked up at the bridge tender peering out of his control tower, watching his progress. He cleared the dolphins, and the current through the pass ebbed. Thank God, he thought as he watched the knot meter increase.

It was now 1700, and he estimated he’d be in by 1830 – an hour and a half after sunset, but what the hell, he remembered that Saint Augustine was well lit.

He checked the GPS and the ICW chart, Saint Augustine harbor was just around the next bend. The sun was just setting, and he knew he had another half an hour of twilight. Might be enough, he thought.

As he rounded the last bend, he entered the north side of the harbor and was coming up on the channel marker to port that would lead out to the Atlantic. What was that out there, he thought? It looked like a cloud bank. The light was fading fast, and it sure looked like a cloud bank. Just then, he realized it was moving – moving his way. Oh God, it was a fog, and it was about to envelope him. Not good, he thought. He looked at the GPS and knew that was all he would have to find his way across the harbor and to the marina. He checked his compass heading, his GPS position and marked the chart. Last known position, he thought; time to concentrate.

The fog bank floated over him – enveloping him, and visibility went to zero. He could barely make out Lone Eagle’s bow. He had retrieved the ship’s bell from below before it hit and started ringing the signal ‘vessel fog-bound, but underway.’ God, he hoped that there was no one else out here – he’d never see them. He looked at the GPS and the chart and brought Lone Eagle around on a dead slow heading for the bridge. His eyes were useless, but his ears were tuned to every sound in the harbor. He could hear trucks and machinery off in the distance. There was one draw bridge between him and the marina, and the GPS showed his position in the channel and the approaching draw bridge. The sound of the trucks must be coming from the bridge, he thought. They sounded like they were coming from dead ahead.

He was at idle speed as the draw bridge slowly materialized through the fog. Thank God for GPS. He threw the engine in neutral and ghosted up to it. The sign on the dolphin said it opened on the hour. He looked at his watch. Oh shit, he had just missed the six o’clock opening. He raised the bridge tender on the VHF radio who confirmed, irritatingly, that he would open at seven and not a minute sooner. OK, he’d have to orbit for 48 minutes – just do it in sight of the bridge, he thought. He raised the marina on the VHF and advised that he would be arriving as soon as the bridge opened. They gave him a slip assignment and said they would be closing for the night at 1830. Great, he thought – strange marina, fog, find your slip in amongst hundreds and pull in with no one to take your lines. Piece of cake, he thought.

The bridge opened at 1903. He thought the additional three minutes were just to piss him off – it did. He cleared the bridge and turned into the marina entrance. There was no one on the docks, and it took a bit of doing, but he found C dock and his slip. The marina lighting was good, and there was no wind, so he was able to ease Lone Eagle into her assigned berth. He tied her up, went below, mixed himself a stiff vodka tonic, and decided dinner wasn’t in the cards tonight. He set up the king-size bunk, pulled the goose down quilt over his shoulders, and laid there long enough to thank God for getting him safely in. He and Gillian would have handled it well. Lesley would have had to have been sedated. You really need to think about getting a radar chart plotter interfaced with GPS. Shit, how much would that cost? Several grand, but it beats trying to do this with a handheld GPS.

He blew out the last oil lamp and thought as he drifted off to sleep, I need another day here; my roots are here; this was once home.

The next morning he poured himself a strong mug of coffee and climbed into the cockpit. The sun had been up for an hour – slept-in, he thought as he looked up at the draw bridge and thought of the consternation of the night before with the bridge tender. Saint Augustine – wow, the playground of my youth. Saint Augustine was an hour and a half by car due east of Gainesville – the home of his alma mater – The University of Florida. He had driven across the Bridge of Lions hundreds of times late on a Friday night in his VW bug along with half the campus bound for a weekend of surf, sun, and fun. He had fond memories of driving his VW on the beach, pitching his pup tent, joining the bonfire beach parties and catching the best waves at sunrise.

He finished his coffee, settled up with the dockmaster, and set off across the bridge to Crescent Beach. He reached Dune Road that led from Highway A1A over the dunes and onto the beach. He remembered those moonlit nights crossing over the dunes and onto the beach and driving along the beach to his favorite surf spot. He had his cooler full of Millers, his pup tent and his tunes on the VW’s radio. It didn’t get any better than that.

He walked down to the ocean. There were several cars on the beach. Here and Daytona were the last places left in Florida where you could still drive on the beach. God, the memories. The girls, the parties, and the waves – the best days of his life were spent there. The memories of each washed over him. The wind was out of the east, and the swell was just a couple of feet. He sat on the beach and stared out over the ocean. She was different now, not only the provider of waves to surf. No, now she was the medium to convey him to new worlds. He looked out to the horizon and knew that he would soon be out there. Out in what? Big blows or gentle trade winds – he hoped it was the latter as he dusted the sand off his shorts and headed back down Dune Road toward the bridge and the marina. He had to top-off provisions and make Lone Eagle ready for the run to Stuart and Gillian’s return.





CHAPTER XVII December 15, 2001 – Cappy and Sparky



Saint Augustine, Florida

Lat: 29° 54’ 04.48” N, Long: 081° 18’44.76” W

He cleared the marina break wall and turned southward on the ICW. It was first light as he heard the bridge’s opening bells sound behind him as he watched it slowly open. He could make out the mast of a sailboat making its approach. He’s had a long night, he thought. As he entered the ICW, the sailboat cleared the bridge and was alongside him. Navigator was her name. He picked up the VHF and hailed her with, “Good morning, Navigator, where you headed?”

The reply that came over the radio startled him. “We’re going around the world, where’s Lone Eagle heading?”

“I’m Rob, and we’re heading for Australia,” he replied.

They sailed and motored together throughout the day, and they introduced themselves as Cappy and Sparky. Sparky was stunning with a golden tan and long flowing blond hair. He learned that Cappy was taking the eastern Caribbean route down the east coast of South America and around Cape Horn into the Pacific.

“Cappy,” he asked, “Why are you going around the Horn? Doesn’t sound like much fun to me? Why not the Panama Canal?”

“Done it three times before; want to try something different.”

He learned that this was Cappy’s third circumnavigation and Sparky’s second.

It was lunchtime, and Navigator and Lone Eagle were motor sailing side-by-side. He opened the cooler and was reaching for a peanut butter sandwich that was dangerously close to falling into the ice water when the VHF came to life.

“Lone Eagle, Navigator, we are going to come alongside. We have something to drop off for you. Steady as she goes.”

“Roger Navigator,” he replied.

Cappy eased Navigator to within a couple of feet, and Sparky came up on deck with a Ziploc bag and yelled, “Catch” and tossed it to him. “Thanks, guys,” he replied as Cappy headed off and resumed his station off to his port side.

Inside the Ziploc were a hot roast beef sandwich and two muffins that were still steaming. He devoured everything and couldn’t remember any food ever tasting better. He raised them on the radio and thanked them both for their kindness. God, what lovely people, he thought.

The day passed quickly, the wind was light for most of it, so they were motor sailing most of the way. It picked up in the late afternoon, and he shut down the engine. The knot meter showed he was making 5.5 knots – good, he thought. Just then, Cappy’s voice came over the VHF. “Rob, where do you plan on putting in for the night?” He looked at his ICW guide and saw that there was a marina about ten clicks ahead.

“I was thinking about that marina at marker 48, but I’m open to suggestions,” he replied. Cappy came back on the radio and told him about an anchorage at Dragon Point about two clicks further south of the marina. He said it was a sweet little spot. “Sounds great, and I’ll save on the marina fees for the night. I’ll follow you in.”

“Great,” Cappy replied and added, “Rob sundowners and dinner are aboard Navigator when we get in.”

“Thanks, Cappy,” he replied, “that sounds great.” He hadn’t had a good dinner since Gillian was last aboard, and some good chow would be fantastic, especially if it was half as good as the lunch Sparky had thrown to him.

Dragon Point lived up to its name. As they passed along the western side of it, on the way to the southern entrance, its rock formations looked like the back of a dragon, and the locals had sculpted and molded concrete into a dragon's head at the entrance to the harbor. He followed Navigator into the quaint little harbor. They dropped their anchors on either side of the small channel that entered the harbor. The sun was just dipping below the horizon as he went below and pulled out the oil anchor light. Gus had thought of everything. This light was big and had a huge Fresnel lens to magnify its light just like the old lighthouses. He lit the oil lamp, adjusted the flame, and climbed on deck to hang it from the ring Gus had sewn into the edge of the now-furled Genny. Just then, a powerboat came by, decked-out from top to bottom in Christmas lights with Christmas carols booming from its stereo. Ah, he thought, the Christmas boat parades were starting. He wonder how many of them he would encounter on the route south.

He untied the painter to Baby Dink and rowed over to Navigator with a nice bottle of wine that he had been saving. As he did, he looked back at Lone Eagle and saw that the anchor light was throwing a bright beam. Sparky took his painter as he climbed aboard Navigator. She took him below and the smells from her galley made his mouth water. Cappy showed him around Navigator as Sparky was busying herself in the galley. Navigator was incredible – fully equipped with every system imaginable for blue water passage making. Sparky had made a beautiful roast chicken dinner with all the trimmings. When they had finished the last morsels, she asked, “Rob, would you like some dessert?”

“Yes, please,” he eagerly replied, and to his amazement, she handed him a big bowl of ice cream.

“We love our ice cream,” Cappy remarked. “When the guy installed our new fridge a few months back, I told him that he wasn’t going to get paid if it didn’t keep ice cream.”

“Wow, Cappy, my freezer is about the size of a shoebox, and while I can make ice with it, I can’t keep ice cream frozen.”

“That’s because ice cream needs to be three degrees cooler than the temperature necessary to make ice – most marine fridges won’t go that low,” Cappy explained.

With the ice cream finished, Cappy headed for Navigator’s cockpit with him and Sparky in tow. She poured glasses of the red he had brought when a skyrocket lit up the sky over the harbor. “Boat parade is starting,” Cappy said.

They watched as all the decorated boats that had been marshaling out in the ICW lined up to head into the harbor and pass by the public dock that was brimming with locals. They would be moving through the channel right between Navigator and Lone Eagle. God, I hope that anchor light is bright enough so that they can see Lone Eagle. Just then, he heard one of the skippers on one of the parade boats exclaim, “I can’t see a fucking thing with all those Christmas lights…tell me where I am going?” he shouted to his wife on the bow. Oh shit, he thought, how are they going to see Lone Eagle? Just as he was getting up to jump into Baby Dink and row back to Lone Eagle, a local police boat with blue lights flashing pulled alongside Lone Eagle. He could see the police officers banging on the hull to see if they could raise someone. He borrowed Cappy’s VHF radio and tried to raise them on every channel he could think of. No luck. The police boat tied off against Lone Eagle with its blue lights flashing. Cappy, un-flustered by the goings-on, said, “She’ll be fine now.”

After the last parade boat passed, he thanked Cappy and Sparky for dinner; untied Baby Dink’s painter and rowed back to Lone Eagle to thank the guys on the police boat for standing watch. When he arrived, the officer in charge commented that he had the best anchor light he had ever seen, but the Christmas lights on the parade boats had made it almost impossible to see. He thanked them as they untied their lines and headed off to the harbor to deal with any mayhem that might be taking place just off the public dock where all the parade boats were circling in front of the judges hoping to win the prize for the best-decorated boat.

He traveled southward with Navigator over the days ahead en route to Stuart, Florida, where he would thankfully reconnect with Tudi and Gillian. They spent many fun days and nights together. They knew he was anxious to get to Stuart. As they neared their destination, Cappy recommended Manatee Pocket in Stuart as a great spot to meet up with Tudi, Bobby, and Gillian. Tudi’s son Bobby was driving his car down from North Carolina with Tudi. He would meet up with them and then head off to pick up Gillian at the airport in West Palm Beach. He couldn’t wait to see her again. They would be sailing through his old stomping grounds of Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale.

They got in early at Manatee Pocket. It was, as Cappy had told him, a great spot. He was going over to Navigator for dinner and had just finished setting up the anchor light when he picked up his cell phone and saw he had a message from Catherine. He called her, and she answered in tears. “How could you do this to me,” she said. Chaser, his beloved golden retriever, had been put down. They talked briefly, but he was too stunned, too shattered to say very much – so was she, for that matter. They ended their conversation, and he burst into tears. Chaser had been his best friend for almost fifteen years, and he had left him. He knew he had died of a broken heart, and he wasn’t there – wasn’t there for his or even his dad’s death. He knew those thoughts would haunt him.

He knew he wouldn’t be much company for dinner, so he picked up the VHF and called Navigator to beg-off. Sparky picked up the mic. She knew just by the sound of his voice that something was terribly wrong. He told her what had happened, and she offered her and Cappy’s condolences. He thanked her and signed off. He sat there in Lone Eagle’s cockpit and cried as the realization washed over him that the price tag for this adventure was still climbing. Was he doing the right thing? How much more grief was he going to have to bear? What’s done is done, he thought.

Just then, he heard the sound of an outboard motor. Sparky came alongside and tied-off her painter and came aboard. She put her arms around him, and he lost it. Someone cared. They talked for hours. He told her about Gillian, and she couldn’t wait to meet her. As she headed back to Navigator, he looked up at the stars and thanked God for bringing people like Cappy and Sparky into his life – this is why you’re doing this, he reminded himself. He knew they would only be on the scene for a short time, but their presence in his life at that moment in time meant the world to him.





CHAPTER XVIII December 20, 2001 - The return of Gillian



Manatee Pocket, Stuart, Florida

Lat: 27° 10’19.96” N, Long: 080° 10’10.04” W

The morning dawned bright and clear and Tudi, and Bobby would soon be arriving. They were in Stuart for Christmas and had driven his car down from North Carolina – at least he would have wheels. He was anchored out in Manatee Pocket near Navigator. He saw Tudi and Bobby at the marina dock and waved to them as he raised Lone Eagle’s anchor and motored over. It was a good spot to fuel up and top off the water tank.

As he pulled in, Tudi and Bobby took his lines. It was good to see them, and hugs were all around. “What time are you picking up Gillian at the airport?” Tudi asked.

“She gets in at two, so we should be back here by four. Would you like to get together for dinner?”

“Sorry, we’re meeting John and Christine, our friends here in Stuart for dinner, but we would love to come back tomorrow morning for coffee with you and Gillian if that’s okay.”

No problem, he thought, “That would be great.” He could have some time with Gillian before they set off on the next leg.

He finished fueling and taking on water, and said goodbye to Tudi and Bobby and set off to re-anchor Lone Eagle near Navigator. He spent the morning straightening up Lone Eagle for Gillian’s arrival. He looked at his watch; it was time to go. He rowed Baby Dink to the marina and hopped into his car. Strange to be back behind the wheel of his car, he thought. He drove out to I-95 and headed south. God, it had changed. He was amazed at the growth along the highway; this used to be all farmland, but then again, it had been ten years since he’d been on this stretch of road.

He made it to the West Palm Beach airport exit and pulled into the airport parking lot. Wow, it too had changed. He remembered all the times he had flown out of this airport on business. At his first in-house legal counsel job in Fort Lauderdale, he racked up a million air miles in his first year, all of which originated out of this airport. That was a long time ago, he thought as he headed for the incoming flight board. On-time – great. He made it to the gate just as they were announcing her flight’s arrival.

He met her at the jetway where they embraced, and he held her close. It never felt so good to hold and to be held, he thought.

“Merry Christmas, baby,” he said. She sensed something was wrong, and he told her about Chaser as they waited for her bags. She had met Chaser when she was in Washington and knew the connection he had to him. Her words comforted him, but he still felt terrible for not being there for either his dad’s or Chaser’s deaths.

On the way back to Stuart and the marina, they talked about the run south, his meeting Cappy and Sparky, and how things were at work for her. It was so good to be back with her.

“When did Tudi and Bobby arrive?” she asked.

“Yesterday, they are having dinner with friends tonight, but they will be coming over for coffee in the morning.”

“That’s great,” she said.

“Can we stop at a store and I’ll pick some things up for coffee?”

“Not a problem, there’s one just before we get to the marina.”

“When we get back to Lone Eagle, I’ll take a look at our provisions. Do you think we can make a provisioning run once I have a list?” she asked.

“That works for me, I’d like to see if we can get underway at first light the day after.”

“When do you have to be back at work?” he reluctantly asked as they were pulling into the marina parking lot. He needed to know how far she would be able to run with him.

“The day after New Year’s Day.”

“That gives us nine days to get us down the Keys and find a good spot where I can hole-up for a while and get the rest of the installs done.”

He carried her duffle bag down to Baby Dink, and they rowed out to Lone Eagle. Cappy and Sparky were on deck and waved him over, so he rowed alongside Navigator to introduce them to Gillian. “Hi, Gillian,” Sparky said, “We’ve heard so much about you. Please come and join us later for sundowners.”

“We’d love to,” Gillian replied.

He knew Gillian and Sparky would hit it off as they pulled up alongside Lone Eagle and unloaded Gillian’s duffle bag.

“Rob, do you remember rowing me in at Georgetown?”

“I do,” he said, “that was a lot of miles ago. The goodbyes aren’t much fun, are they?”

Gillian dragged her duffle bag down into Lone Eagle’s cabin and started unpacking. “How’s the run been from Georgetown?” she asked. He told her about the submarine and the night landing in Saint Augustine, while she was searching her bag for something.

“What are you looking for?” he asked.

“Found it,” she said and produced a snow globe with a Santa and sleigh in it and a pair of port and starboard Christmas ornaments.

“You’ve thought of everything, haven’t you?”

“It’s our first Christmas together, and I wanted to bring a little Christmas spirit aboard,” she said as she shook the snow globe and showed it to him. She was amazing. I wonder if she’ll agree to join me for the voyage, he thought as he helped her stow her gear.

The sun was just going down as they pulled alongside Navigator. Cappy took Baby Dink’s painter as Gillian climbed aboard. A minute later, she was below with Sparky as he and Cappy stood on deck and watched the sun disappear below the horizon.

“Is she going to make the voyage with you?” Cappy asked.

“I don’t know. I haven’t raised the subject since she arrived. I think I’ll wait a few days,” he replied, as he thought to himself that Sparky and Gillian were probably having the same conversation below in Navigator’s galley.

He and Cappy headed back to the cockpit and were greeted with a procession of platters of food that Gillian was passing up from below. They munched while the ladies bantered below. Cappy leaned closer and whispered, “She’s great.”

“I know,” he replied but added, “She’s got a great job. Would you leave it if you were her?”

“She will,” Cappy replied without a second’s hesitation.

“I hope you’re right, Cappy. I don’t know how I’ll manage solo if she doesn’t.”

“It’s doable, but it would be a hell of a lot easier and a lot more fun for you if she comes along,” Cappy replied.

“I know.”

They were getting ready to head back to Lone Eagle. The night had gone on well beyond sundowners, and he knew Gillian was tired from the flight.

“Rob, what’s the plan for tomorrow?” Cappy asked.

“Gillian wants to top off our provisions before we head off the day after.”

“Mind if we tag along?” Sparky asked.

“No problem, you know you are welcome to come with us or use the car anytime you guys want,” he added.

“We want to top off with provisions too. We’ll be heading off for the Bahamas at Palm Beach; which way are you going?”

“We’ll probably do the ICW until we get to Miami and then do the Hawk Channel down to the Keys,” he replied. “Weather hasn’t been looking too good, Cappy, for a run to the Bahamas. Do you think you’ll get a good weather window?”

“I downloaded the latest forecast just before you guys got here, and it looks like the next front will come through day after tomorrow; by then, we will be in Palm Beach and then we’ll make our move.”

“If it’s a strong front Cappy, you may want to give it a day for the sea to die down. That Gulf Stream can be awful. If it looks like saw teeth out there, then head back in and give it a day.” He remembered his many passages to the Bahamas across the Gulf Stream. The Stream ran at 4.5 knots northward, and the fronts came from the northwest, pushing southward against the Stream. The swell was vertical and steep, and many a yacht had come to grief, trying to make a deadline. He remembered looking eastward out to the horizon, and if it looked like saw teeth, he knew it had the same effect on boats.

The next morning he and Gillian met up with Tudi and Bobby. He rowed them out to Lone Eagle, and Gillian had organized a scrumptious breakfast. Tudi and Bobby told them that they would be spending Christmas with their friends in Stuart, and Bobby offered to stay on and drive the car down to the Keys. He readily accepted.

“I can stay on for a while and help you out with the last installs,” Bobby offered.

“Thanks, that would be a big help to me. I’ll give you a call when I know where we’re going to be, and when you get down there, I can drive Gillian to the airport. Her flight back to San Francisco is on New Year’s Day. We’ll need the car today to do a provisioning run, but I’ll call you later when we’re done with it. I’ll leave the keys under the seat, and you can pick it up whenever you want.”

He and Cappy were in the front seats, and Gillian and Sparky were in the back with groceries piled on their laps. He couldn’t believe it, the trunk was packed full of provisions. Amazing he thought. She bought – out-the-store. We’re going for a week, and she had purchased enough for months. They got back to the marina, and Cappy and Sparky loaded their stuff in their dink and motored out to Navigator. Gillian spent a half an hour stripping out all the packaging for everything they had bought and sent him off on several trips to the marina’s dumpster.

“You’ve got this down to a science,” he said.

“Roaches live in the cardboard,” she replied as she put the stripped-out provisions into plastic bags and handed them to him to load into Baby Dink.

The next morning dawned overcast and rainy. Gillian felt so good next to him as he rolled over to hit the snooze button on the alarm clock. OK time to get moving, he told himself; Cappy’s forecast was right – the wind was due north and building. It would be a sporty run down to Palm Beach.

“We’re out of here,” he yelled to her as he fired up the engine and went up to the foredeck to winch up the anchor chain.

He was thinking that Manatee Pocket was a great spot as he worked the windlass ratchet handle. Cappy was doing the same aboard Navigator. Their anchors broke water at the same time, and both took up their positions at the helm as they threaded their way out of Manatee Pocket and joined up with the ICW southbound.

Gillian kept the coffee coming and made egg salad sandwiches. Better than the peanut butter and jelly ones, he thought as he looked at the GPS for the next marker. He and Cappy chatted on the VHF on the way, and they traded email addresses. They reached the Port of Palm Beach late in the day and bid each other fair winds, and safe passages as Cappy swung Navigator toward the inlet.

“Looks a bit sporty, Cappy, but I think she’ll die down after sunset.”

“Roger that Lone Eagle…fair winds Rob.”

“Thanks, Cappy. Much love to Sparky,” he said as he swung Lone Eagle behind Peanut Island, their anchorage for the night. He knew that it was unlikely that he would ever see them again, but knew he was blessed with their short presence in his life. They made a massive difference at a time when he needed it the most. God keep them safe, he thought as he watched their stern light disappear into the night.

Wow – Peanut Island just off Palm Beach. Kennedy had a bomb shelter on the island, and he remembered sailing out to it with Vincent, his old high school buddy, when Jackie O was aboard the Christina – Onassis’ old yacht. Unreal, he thought – the memories. He had lived in Palm Beach for two years while his dad was a yacht captain for a millionaire who had given them his tiny guest house to live in on North Ocean Boulevard. He surfed right outside his front door before school. He remembered Eric Clapton’s album 461 North Ocean Boulevard. He lived just down the block, and he and his friends took the school bus and would jump off and skip school if there were waves at the Inlet or at Flag Pole Beach. That was until his friends had gotten their driver's licenses, and their rich daddies had bought them Porsches and Ferrari’s to drive to school.

He pulled Lone Eagle around to the side of the island in the lee of the northwest wind that was pushing through – Cappy should have waited until the morning he thought as he let out the anchor chain. Better go 4:1 on the chain. It could blow tonight. He tried to raise Navigator on the VHF several times but knew he was probably out of range.

The next morning he raised the anchor and thought – time to run the gauntlet – the dozens of drawbridges that lie across the ICW between West Palm Beach and Miami. Get the stopwatch ready. He knew he had to time his approach to every one of them to avoid getting hung up waiting for an opening. Gillian read off the miles to the next one and when it would open. Rush hour was the worst, as those bridges that normally opened on the half or quarter-hour would only open on the hour. What the hell, he thought it kept the commuters happy.

They reached Fort Lauderdale just at sunset. He knew this stretch of the ICW like the back of his hand. His thoughts drifted back to the days he had worked on a major car manufacturer’s corporate yacht. He’d done this run-up and down the ‘ditch’ as it was called hundreds of times. They reached the Los Olas Boulevard Bridge just as the heavens opened with a deluge of rain. Looks like that cold front is still working its way through, he thought. He cleared the bridge and was heading south when visibility went almost to zero. Better put in for the night, but where he thought?

The Pier 66 and Bahia Mar marinas were megayacht marinas and way too expensive, and there was no place until well south of the Port of Fort Lauderdale, and that was at least three miles ahead. Hang on, he thought. There might be just enough room on the south side of the Las Olas Bridge to put down the pick. He swung Lone Eagle around and backtracked to the Las Olas Bridge. As he got closer, he saw it was going to be tight - lots of boats anchored and very little room. He told Gillian what he had in mind and went up on the foredeck to drop anchor. He knew that tonight he would need the stern anchor as well, as there would only a few feet between Lone Eagle and the boats nearby and no swing room. He dropped well back on the bow anchor and then released the stern anchor. He pulled Lone Eagle up between the two – she was locked in position. It was raining hard, and they were both soaked. Gillian brought up the soap and the shampoo and they both showered on deck in the rain in the nude with the high-rises all around. What the hell it was Christmas Eve. They dried off, and she made a wonderful dinner, and with the king-size bunk already made up, they fell asleep in each other arms. “Merry Christmas,” he whispered to her as they drifted off to sleep.





CHAPTER XIX December 25, 2001 - The Gauntlet



Las Olas Bridge, Ft Lauderdale, Florida

Lat: 26° 07’ 10.56” N, Long: 080° 06’ 34.92” W

The cold front had completed its passage by the time they awoke Christmas morning. The sky was that deep blue – the kind that you get just after a front as he slid open the companionway hatch. He wondered how Cappy and Sparky had fared last night. Rough night probably as Gillian handed up what would be the first of many mugs of coffee that morning. They had ridden well last night, despite being sandwiched in between so many boats in the Las Olas Cove.

“So, what does the day look like for us?” she asked.

“One more day of the gauntlet – lots of drawbridges and then we’ll clear Miami. I figure we’ll make it to the port entrance by sundown and anchor for the night.”

“Works for me.”

He raised the stern anchor, and Lone Eagle faced into the northwest wind. Gillian took the helm as he raised the bow anchor. He had told Gillian how he wanted to pick their way through the anchored boats out to the channel, and she took up the first heading when he signaled that the anchor had cleared the water. This section of the ditch, as it was called, was ‘Millionaire’s Row’ with breathtaking mansions and even more breathtaking yachts side-by-side all the way to the Port of Fort Lauderdale. Gillian was amazed at the wealth.

“Well, baby, we won’t own one of those, but we will have a better view where we’re going,” he said as he lined Lone Eagle up for the 17th Street Causeway Bridge. He could see the large digital clock that showed three minutes until opening – good he thought there was too much traffic for his liking and the Port beyond looked like a washing machine with all the boat wakes. It had gotten a lot busier since the time he sailed out of here almost every day all those years ago.

The bridge opened right on time and he powered-up Lone Eagle to begin the transit across the port. He scanned the cruise ships lining the wharf to look for any signs that they would be moving across their path; none were getting ready to get underway.

The day passed slowly; bridge by bridge, as they made their way southward to Miami. He had the timing down and adjusted their speed to make it to the next draw bridge just as it was about to open. He had wished they had made the run outside in the ocean from West Palm Beach but reminded himself that the front that just went through would probably have made it a rough ride.

They made it to the last draw bridge - McArthur Causeway Bridge in Miami, just as the sun was starting to set. After clearing the bridge, he headed for the little anchorage he knew next to Star Island. They dropped anchor in the lee of the island just in time to see a beautiful sunset over the Miami skyline.

“Tomorrow we’ll be doing some blue water sailing. I can’t wait,” he said just as Gillian handed him his vodka sundowner. He pulled out the chart for the run from Miami to Key West, and they looked at their options. “We can’t do the Biscayne Bay run because the water was too shallow at Angel Fish Creek,” he explained. He’d almost gotten stuck there with his father as the Bountiful had a shallower draft than Lone Eagle. “We better make the run outside down Hawk Channel. If we can make Islamorada, we can duck in at Seven Mile Bridge and anchor on the west side for the night.”

He was up early doing the nav for Hawk Channel. He plotted his waypoints on the chart and then entered them in the hand-held GPS. The wind was out of the east so it would be a beam reach – perfect, he thought. They raised the anchor at 0630 and entered Miami Harbor and motored down cruise ship row toward the inlet. There were several big ones and Coast Guard patrols had security zones set up around them. Good idea, he thought. What an inviting terrorist target.

As they motored out of Miami, he could feel the east wind freshen and felt the seas lifting Lone Eagle. Wow, it felt good to get into some blue water. It had been almost a thousand miles in the ditch. Let’s see what you’re made of Lone Eagle.

“Time to get some canvas up,” he told Gillian as she took the helm, and he went forward to raise the main. The wind was a solid 15 knots, and Lone Eagle found her lines and was surging ahead. He engaged Monitor and adjusted the heading to put them on a rhumb line to the first Hawk Channel waypoint.

It was a perfect sail with the Hawk Channel waypoints passing as they drew nearer to Islamorada. They talked about tuning Monitor, and then the conversation turned to Gillian and her flight back to San Francisco on New Year’s Day.

“Rob, we need to find you a good spot to lay-up for a while to finish all of the installs,” she said as she flipped through the pages of the cruising guide to the keys. “Key West doesn’t look too good. The marinas are expensive, and there are no really protected anchorages. You need to be at a dock with shore power. I’ll take a look at Marathon,” she said. “It looks like there is an all-weather harbor, and the public dock has cheap dockage.”

“Sounds good; we can make Marathon by tomorrow evening if we can make Islamorada tonight.”

The conversation again turned to Gillian making the trip.

“We’ve had a good run together,” he said.

She smiled and said, “it has been a lot of fun.”

“Have you given any thought to making the trip with me?” he asked.

“I would have to walk away from everything,” she said.

“Will you?”

“Yes, but I’ll have to give them plenty of notice and arrange to have my things stored with Mary.”

He put his arms around her and kissed her gently behind the ear and whispered, “thank you, baby, we’ll be great together.”

He was so relieved he didn’t even notice that they had passed another waypoint. When he realized it, he thought, thank God we didn’t have to alter course.

The afternoon passed quickly as they discussed all the plans she had to put in place for her to rejoin him.

“I figure I can be back by the end of the first week in March. That gives you two months to do the installs. Do you think you can do it?” she asked.

“I’ll have to,” he replied as he glanced at the chart and saw that they would soon be making the turn for Seven Mile Bridge.

“Time to drop the canvas,” he told her as she took the helm, and he went forward to lower the main. They made the bridge just as the sun was starting to set. Good thing they would be approaching the anchorage from the west with the sun at their backs.

They cleared the bridge and turned north for the short motor to the anchorage he had found on the chart.

“My God,” he exclaimed “Look at all those crab trap floats – they can’t be more than ten feet apart.” There had to be thousands of them. “Gillian, go forward and keep a sharp lookout for those crab pots we don’t want to foul the prop.” They picked their way through the pots and found just enough room to anchor. With the pick down, they both went for a swim and settled in with their sundowners. God, it had been a good day. She was really going to make the trip with him.

They got an early start the next morning and picked their way through the crab pots back to Seven Mile Bridge right on schedule. They reached their first Hawk Channel waypoint and headed Lone Eagle southward. Monitor worked flawlessly, and they had a great sail. It was New Year’s Eve, and they made it to Marathon and cleared the bridge at the entrance to Marathon harbor in the early afternoon.

“Wow, look at all the boats on moorings,” – there were hundreds with many in a terrible state of repair.

They pulled into the City of Marathon Marina, which had a long concrete wall down a narrow canal with a large warehouse structure running along the entire length of the concrete wharf. He had raised the dockmaster on the VHF, and, thankfully, they had room for him. They pulled in and tied Lone Eagle port side to the dock. They got out the fender boards and he adjusted the spring lines to keep the fender boards on the pilings. Glad there isn’t much tide here he thought as he secured the last fender board. The warehouse housed the dock master’s office, a big recreation room with a wall of books and a TV, a workshop with a drill press, table saw and band saw. Great, I can get everything done right here.

They hit the showers and went out for dinner at a little pizza place up on Highway AIA. Her flight out of Miami wasn’t until three the next day, and Bobby would be arriving in the morning with his car. They returned to the boat and toasted the New Year. They turned in early to the sound of the marina’s New Year’s Eve revelers.

Gillian was up early packing, and Bobby showed up just in time for one of Gillian’s great breakfasts.

“Rob. What’s the plan?” Bobby asked.

“We’ll drive Gillian to Miami and then head back here."

“Rob, could you drop me off in West Palm Beach? I want to do some surfing up there, and then I’ll get mom to drop me off back here in a couple of weeks, and I’ll help you with the installs.”

“No problem,” he replied.

He and Gillian walked out to the jetway together.

“I’ll be back the first week in March. I’ll call you tomorrow and let you know how they took it at work.”

“Gillian. I can’t wait. Good luck tomorrow,” he said as she headed down the jetway.

He dropped Bobby off and was relieved that he would be back in a couple of weeks for the watermaker installation. That was going to be the big one.

After dropping off Bobby and Gillian, he turned on to Interstate 95 for the five-hour solo run back to Marathon, his thoughts bouncing from Gillian and his elation that she would be making the trip to the endless list of installs that he had to get finished in the two months until she returned. Mostly his thoughts were of Gillian.

He got back late and was tired after more than ten hours on the road. He made up the bunk and was off to sleep before his head hit the pillow.





CHAPTER XX January 2, 2002 - The Marathon



Marathon, Florida

Lat: 24° 42’ 17.08” N, Long: 081° 06’ 42.83” W

OK, time to get up, he thought as he could see that the sun was just starting to stream through the portholes. Let’s see, first things first, you need to do an oil change. The last one was in Stuart, and the hour meter showed he was twenty hours past the 150-hour mark.

He did his regular engine inspection before starting the oil change. What’s that? Oil drops way back by the shaft coupling. He reached back and placed his fingers around the driveshaft just in front of the coupling. Oil. Not good, he thought. It’s not leaking out of the transmission. The diesel mechanic classes he had taken helped, but he knew this one would need a mechanic.

He skipped the oil change and headed off for the dockmaster’s office and the phone book. Great, there is a Yanmar guy right here in Marathon. He gave him a ring and explained the problem. “Sounds like the main bearing to me,” the mechanic said.

“Oh shit,” he thought.

“I’ll have one of my guys drop in this afternoon and have a look.”

Marcus, the mechanic, arrived, and they went over the engine.

“Yep. The main bearing is fried. The crankshaft is probably fried too. Here’s your problem. See that motor mount? Do you see the hairline crack near that bolt on the motor mount? Must have been broken for a while. You never could have seen it,” Marcus explained, but it was little comfort to him. Ka-Ching was all he could think of.

“Marcus. What are our options?”

“We can rebuild her for about the same price as putting in a new thirty horsepower Yanmar, but if we rebuild her, you won’t have the five-year warranty that you’ll have with a new one.”

“What are we looking at for a new one installed?” he asked

“Rob, you’re looking at twelve thousand for the engine and another two thousand to install it. You’ll need a new motor mount arrangement as the mounts for the new one won’t match up with the old ones.”

He felt ill. The last thing he needed was a fourteen grand hit to the cruising budget.

“Where will you do the work?” he asked.

“Our place is right on a canal close to here, so you can tie up there while we’re doing the work.”

“When can you start?”

“We’ve got a new 3GM30 in stock, so tomorrow, if you can get her over there. You’ll need to have her towed as I wouldn’t risk having her let go when you are going through the Marathon Bridge.”

He spent the afternoon arranging for a tow the next morning to Marcus’ place. He checked with a couple of other diesel mechanics back in Virginia, and they confirmed the diagnosis and the price. The day was shot, and as he sat in the cockpit nursing his vodka tonic, he realized he was chilled, and his throat was scratchy. Great, he thought that’s all I need.





CHAPTER XXI January 2002 - The green flash



Marathon, Florida

Lat: 24° 42’ 17.08” N, Long: 081° 06’ 42.83” W

He had dragged himself out of his fiberglass dust-covered bunk. The flu was bad enough, but how many more days would Lone Eagle be torn apart and covered in fiberglass dust while Marcus installed the new diesel engine? And, he wondered, how long was he going to be in Marathon before Lone Eagle would be ready?

He couldn’t use the galley with all the dust and mess, and God, it was hot. I’ve got to get off this boat for a while, he muttered as he pulled on what appeared to be a clean shirt and hopped off the boat right into Marcus’ back yard. He looked over the edge of the dock and thought Lone Eagle’s keel would be resting on the bottom when the tide went all the way out. As he picked his way through the tools, spare parts, coffee cans brimming with nuts, bolts, and all manner of wiring, he spotted his old diesel engine sitting on an oil drum. What an unfitting end. She served Gus for twenty-three years and had gotten him all the way from Washington only to be dead on arrival. He hadn’t noticed the motor mount crack that had caused the main bearing to blow.

As he trudged down the crushed coral and gravel road with the blazing sun overhead, his thoughts drifted to Gillian. She would be back soon. Not soon enough for him, he thought.

He reached the waterfront and the local watering hole he had been using where he knew he could sit out on their deck and look out over the Gulf of Mexico - a welcome break from the mess back on Lone Eagle. At least there was a breeze here, and the food was cheap.

His thoughts were filled with the boat. The marathon in Marathon was in full swing. He went through his mental lists of all the gear that was on order and yet to be ordered. The dollars were being spent so fast. It was scary. He wondered whether it could all be installed and whether they would clear Panama in time for the start of the Pacific’s Coconut Milk Run sailing season. It had taken him two months to sail Lone Eagle down from Washington. He had beaten winter, but not by much. The snow and ice on the decks in North Carolina leaving Tudi’s place just a few weeks earlier made him shiver – must be the flu, he thought. The thought of holing up somewhere in the Caribbean for hurricane season was not an appealing one for him, but it was becoming a real possibility since they were already a month into the Pacific cruising season, and they hadn’t even left Key West much less cleared the Panama Canal. Another cruiser had told him that the Rio Dulce in Guatemala was where all the cruisers went in June to avoid the onslaught of the Caribbean hurricanes. He made a mental note to see if he could find a cruising guide for the area – just in case.

The bell at the bar brought him out of his thoughts. The countdown had begun. All the patrons were on their feet and looking out to the brilliant ball of orange setting into the Gulf. The upper limb of the sun was plummeting below the horizon just as the count hit zero, and there it was – the green flash – the brilliant green flash of light. He had heard about it. It was a local legend held by the Conks – the people of the Florida Keys. He understood that it was caused by the sun’s rays passing through the water at the edge of the horizon, but he had never seen it. Wow, how beautiful, I wonder how many of those I’ll be seeing in the months ahead.

As he was finishing the last of his snapper burger and his beer, he looked out over the crowd at the bar. It was winter, so the majority of the patrons were tourists, but there were the familiar faces of the Conks. The men - the old ones, bronzed and grey – the weathered ones, nursing their beers as if they were gold. Some were fishermen, some ran the sport fishing and tourist dive boats, others were the live boards, living on all manner of things that floated in Marathon harbor – the harbor, he thought of broken dreams. They were a lonely bunch who only seemed to come alive when sharing a sea story over a beer with someone of similar ilk. They all talked of someday – someday when they got their boat fixed or finished. That would be the day they would sail off into their beloved Caribbean. He was determined not to become one of them. It was palpable and real that he could be sucked into their world – become one of them. He promised himself that he wouldn’t – he had to be out of Marathon and on his way south through the Caribbean and into the Pacific as soon as the last of the gear was installed and tested. He promised himself that he and Lone Eagle wouldn’t be like those Conks in the harbor of broken dreams. Lone Eagle had half the world’s oceans to cross and he and she needed to be ready – ready for anything. He paid the tab and started to walk down the coral dust strewn road back to Lone Eagle; to his fiberglass dust-covered bunk.

His thoughts drifted to Catherine. To the book, he’d given her about couples going off cruising. The one that said, if she doesn’t go with you, you’ll end up like one of those lonely Conks that you were just looking at across the bar. He closed his eyes, and he flashed back to her. He knew he would be different.





CHAPTER XXII January 2002 - The Octopus Installation



Marathon, Florida

Lat: 24° 42’ 17.08” N, Long: 081° 06’ 42.83” W

“Start her up,” Marcus yelled from below. He turned the key, and the new diesel roared to life. It had been a week – a week from hell but it was finally done. “OK, Rob, let’s take her out for a sea trial.” Marcus came up on deck and helped with the lines. They motored out of the canal and into open water. “Rob, let’s take her up to 3200 RPMs and see how she does.” He brought the throttle up and watched the knot meter climb to 6.5 knots.

Perfect he thought. I don’t have to haul and re-pitch the prop.

“She’s great. Let's head on back to the city marina, and you can give me a lift back to the shop and we can organize your spare parts.”

“No problem,” he said as he swung Lone Eagle onto a heading for the Marathon Harbor Bridge. As he eased her down the canal for the city marina, he saw that his spot was still open, so he pulled in portside, and Marcus jumped on the dock with the bowline.

They drove over to Marcus’ shop and went over all the spare engine parts he would need to carry with him - just in case. They had swapped out the 60amp alternator for a 120amp model that would give him the extra battery charging that he knew he would need. Then came the spares; another alternator, injectors, starter motor, fan belts, water pump impellers – it was endless. He loaded the car with all the spares and paid Marcus the remaining installment. All told fifteen grand, and that was only the start of it. I’ve got to look into a radar chart plotter interfaced with GPS and a new tender and outboard. Baby Dink was great, but she was so small that you couldn’t haul very much in her.

He drove back to the city marina and climbed aboard Lone Eagle. He pulled out the vacuum and went over the entire interior. The fiberglass dust was everywhere. It took the rest of the day to get Lone Eagle back to a point where she was livable, and he wasn’t itchy from all that fiberglass dust.

He called Bobby and let him know he was back at the marina and ready to start the install of the watermaker.

“No problem Rob. Mom will drive me down tomorrow afternoon, and we can get started the next day.”

“Thanks, Bobby. I appreciate the help,” he replied.

Then he called Gillian. “Hi, baby, it’s done. I’m back at the dock. How are you going?” he asked.

“I’ve got six boxes packed, and I figure another six, and I’ll be ready to ship them to you.”

“Where are we going to put it all?” he asked with trepidation.

“Let me worry about that, you’ve got enough to worry about.”

“What’s next on your install list?” she asked.

“The watermaker, or should I say the octopus. I looked at the installation schematic, and it’s got hoses going everywhere.”

“If you have any problems, let me know. I know the CEO of the company. He’s a good guy,” she said.

“Thanks, baby. Let’s hope you don’t have to make that call.”

The next morning he read the installation instructions for the octopus. The parts bag was huge. Better do an inventory of the parts to make sure you have everything before you start, he thought. One-by-one, piece-by-piece, he checked them all off until he discovered he was short one high-pressure line compression fitting. Great, he thought. I bought this damn thing in Annapolis. I’ve got to call them and have them air freight it in.

He called and was in luck. They told him they had a dealer in Marathon, and they had the fitting. They said they would make a call to them, and he could drive over and pick it up.

He walked into the dealers' shop, and there was a display model of his watermaker. He studied it as the dealer finished up with a customer.

“Hi. My name is Rob, and Mitch from your Annapolis office was going to give you a call about a high-pressure fitting for me.”

“Yep. I’m Mark, and I have it right here for you.”

“Great,” he said.

“Hey Mark, I was wondering what you guys would charge to install my watermaker?”

Without missing a beat, Mark replied, “Seven thousand.” He was stunned.

“Mark, I paid six thousand for it, and you want seven thousand to install it. Are you kidding me?”

“Rob, it takes one of my guys a week to install it, and our charge out rate is a thousand a day.”

“Mark, I can’t pay you guys that kind of money to install it. I’ll have to do it myself. Can I pay your guy your hourly rate to come down and inspect my install job when I’m done to make sure I’ve gotten everything right?”

“No problem, just give me a call when you’ve finished, and I’ll send over my best guy.”

“Thanks, Mark, will do. Wish me luck,” he said as he walked out the door with the compression fitting.

He was still in shock at the installation price. Shit if it takes their trained technicians seven days, how long is it going to take me? He climbed aboard Lone Eagle and started reading the install instructions for the third time just as Bobby and Tudi came walking down the dock. Finally, help had arrived, and he knew he was going to need it.

The next morning he and Bobby removed the galley sink and started the installation of the octopus. Eight days later, wedged in under the galley sink for hours, fifty-eight hose clamps, and a lot of skinned knuckles later, and it was in. Thankfully the electrician in Washington had done all the wiring for it before he left. This thing will make forty gallons of fresh-water per hour, and he would need every drop of it since he only had a thirty-five-gallon water tank, and some of the passages he would be making were twenty to thirty days.

He called Mark and let him know that he had finished the installation.

“I’ll be down first thing in the morning to see how you did.”

“Thanks, Mark. I’ll have the coffee pot on.”

The next morning he was reading the operating instructions as Mark walked down the dock.

“How did it go, Rob?”

“Eight days and a lot of skinned knuckles. I don’t think my back will ever be the same.”

Mark went below and went over the install. He poked; he probed and spent the better part of an hour, tracing all of the hose lines and wires.

“Rob. Do you want a job? This install is as good as any that my guys could do.”

“Thanks, Mark. It wasn’t fun, but I’m glad it’s done. Should we fire her up and see if we can make some water?”

“Not if you want to plug up those filters. The harbor water is pretty dirty. I’d wait until you’re in blue water.”

“OK, I’ll be heading down to Key West in a month or so and will give her a try on the way down. If I have any problems, I’ll give you a ring.”

He and Bobby put the Galley sink back in and straightened up the boat. It had been eight days since they were able to use the galley, and eating out was losing its appeal.

“Have you got all your gear packed? It’s almost time for me to drive you to catch your bus.”

“Yep. All done,” Bobby replied.

“Thanks for all your help. I couldn’t have done it without you.”

“No problem. I was glad to do it.”

He dropped Bobby at the bus stop and thanked him again for all his help. He pulled back onto Highway AIA and stopped in at the marine electronics store he had heard about. He went in and was greeted by Jim, the proprietor.

“What can I do for you?” Jim asked.

“Well, I’m looking for a radar chart plotter interfaced with GPS.”

He and Jim spent a long time going over the brochures and comparing all of the features. He wanted the 4 kilowatt, 48 nautical mile color radar. He settled on the Furuno and then held his breath as he asked the price. Four thousand.

My God, he thought. “Does that include install?” he asked, remembering his latest adventure with the watermaker.

“Nope, it includes hook up once you get all of the components installed. I’m getting a bit old to go up the mast to install the ray dome,” Jim explained.

“OK. So I can install the monitor in the cockpit, but who do I get to install the ray dome up the mast?”

Jim explained that he worked with a rigger named Bobby, who had done a lot of installs. Jim called Bobby and handed him the phone. Bobby asked what he had in mind for a mounting point. He told him he wanted it just below the spreaders.

Jim had the unit in stock, and he swallowed hard and made the purchase. Jim said he would be down in the morning to deliver all of the components. He drove back to Lone Eagle. Another big Ka-Ching, he thought and then reminded himself that he still hadn’t bought the inflatable dingy and the new outboard motor. The marathon in Marathon was continuing, but when would it be over?

He was sitting in the cockpit with the brochures for the new radar and the cutout template for the monitor when he looked up and saw one of the old Conks looking over Lone Eagle. He said hi, and Phil introduced himself. He had to be in his seventies; white hair and white beard.

“Good to meet you, Phil, come aboard. I think I can find us both a cold one.”

“She’s beautiful, Rob. You have been working so hard on her over the last few weeks I didn’t want to interrupt your work. We’ve all admired your stamina.”

“I’m on a mission. I’m sailing her to Australia, and I’ve got to get her ready – and me too.”

“There are a lot of us dreamers here in the harbor – me included. Most of us spend our lives dreaming of getting our boats ready and heading out into the Caribbean. You look like your one of few who will actually make it. You look like you’re almost ready.”

“Thanks, I’ve got a new life to start in Australia, and I’ve got to get her finished and get going.”

“You think you’ll get through Panama in time to make the season?”

“I don’t know. It’s taking a lot longer to get ready than I expected, and the days are ticking by. I’ve got this radar chart plotter to install that ought to take a few more days,” he explained.

“You’re really going to be glad you’re installing a radar chart plotter. A lot of boats without them are going up on reefs or getting run down by container ships, and you don’t want to be one of them.”

“I sure don’t. I sailed down here with just a handheld GPS. It wasn’t enough. I need better chart detail, my position indicated on it, and the ability to do radar sweeps for storms, ships, and islands.”

They talked for hours. Phil shared his life story. He knew he wasn’t going to make it out of this harbor and was content with his lot. He really was a nice guy, and he looked forward to seeing more of him. He was a wise old Conk and a friendly one to boot. He bade Phil good night and checked his watch. Good, he thought, Gillian would be home from work. He called her – everything was on track on her end. She told him she had shipped the twelve boxes and that he wasn’t to open them until she arrived.

“Rob, ask the dockmaster if he can store them until I get there?”

“No problem, I’ll check with him first thing in the morning. This place is huge, so I’m sure he’ll have a storage locker we can use.”

He crawled into his bunk. Clean sheets and no fiberglass dust – what a relief, he thought, as his mind went over the challenges of tomorrow’s radar install.





CHAPTER XXIII February 2002 - Pacing Yourself



Marathon, Florida

Lat: 24° 42’ 17.08” N, Long: 081° 06’ 42.83” W

Jim arrived early, and he helped him with all the boxes for the radar chart plotter.

“OK, Rob, let’s have a look at how you’re going to install this.”

“How I’m going to install it? I’m counting on your advice on how I’m going to install it,” he replied. “I want the monitor in the cockpit, and I thought I could build a teak box with a Lexan window to protect it,” he explained.

“She is waterproof, or so the specs say, but I think your idea is a good one.”

“Jim, should we have a look at the mast step and see how we’ll do the wire run from the ray dome?”

“This thing has a fat cable that has about forty wires that will need to get connected up,” Jim explained.

They spent the better part of a couple of hours going through what needed to be done. He pulled out the jigsaw and cut the hole in the cockpit coaming that would house the monitor for the radar. He hated cutting holes in his boat. Then he measured the curvature of the hole and got out his teak scraps and started to measure up the frame he would need to build. He went up to the shop and cut the pieces on the band saw and then shaped them on the belt sander. The chart plotter monitor frame fit perfectly. Then he was off to stringing all the wiring, which took the rest of the day and required him to thread it through some inaccessible places in the belly of Lone Eagle.

The sun was already down by the time he got back from the showers. He had a quick bite to eat and was sitting in the cockpit nursing his vodka tonic when Phil stopped by and asked how it had gone today.

“Pretty good,” he replied. “We got the monitor in and all the internal cabling. Tomorrow, Bobby, the rigger, is coming to install the ray dome, which ought to be interesting.” Little did he know how interesting it was going to be.

He and Phil chatted for a while until he told him he needed to turn in for the night as tomorrow was going to be a big day.

The alarm went off at 0600, and within minutes, he was in the cockpit – coffee in-hand. The days and weeks that he had been at the city marina had flown. He couldn’t believe that Gillian would be arriving in a little over a week. Unbelievable – we’re really going to do this, he thought. Then he reminded himself that he better get going with his day because Bobby the rigger would be here soon and he needed to haul out the boson’s chair and block and tackle system so that Bobby could get up the mast and install the ray dome that was taking up almost all of the forepeak bunk.

Bobby arrived right on time. “Lone Eagle? You must be Rob?”

“And you must be Bobby. Good to meet you.”

“Let’s take a look at the wire race behind the sail track and see how much room we’ve got to work with for this ray dome cable.” The news wasn’t good. The wire race was full, and there was no room for any additional cables.

“Now what, Bobby? Any ideas?”

Bobby stood there for a while, looking up the mast to the spreaders where the ray dome mount had to be installed.

“We’re going to have to insert PVC conduit into your mast; pop rivet it to the inside of the mast and then mouse the cable through,” Bobby explained.

“How long do you think it will take?”

“I should have it done by the end of the day with a little luck.”

Great, he thought. At eighty an hour, that would come in at eight hundred for the day. Geeze, when was this going to end.

It took all of ten hours and was like trying to thread the eye of a needle in the dark. In the end, the ray dome was mounted, and the cable for it came out of the base of the deck-stepped mast. OK, he thought; now you need a waterproof fitting, so it was off to the local West Marine store to pick one up.

As he walked through the door to West Marine, Vince yelled across the isles and informed him that the cruising guides he had ordered were in. All the salespeople knew him by name. He was the nut sailing to Australia. He was also the nut spending big bucks every time he walked in the door, so they were ever eager to help him. He found the waterproof plug he needed and paid for the cruising guides, including the one for Guatemala and the Rio Dulce River – the hurricane hole. Tonight’s bedtime reading he thought.

He installed the waterproof plug for the ray dome cable and built the shelf for the fluxgate compass that had to be mounted on centerline below deck away from other electronics. The only place to do that was under the sink in the head. That was so much fun he thought as he put his tools away for the day.

Jim arrived the next morning and completed all the connections for the radar chart plotter. “Nice install Rob. I think you’ll be a lot happier having the monitor right here in the cockpit rather than at the navigation station down below. Of course, you can always buy another monitor for the nav station for another two grand.”

“Thanks, Jim, but no thanks. I want to be able to look at it and operate it from right here in the cockpit rather than running up and down the companionway stairs to the nav station.”

“OK, throw the breaker and will get her tuned for you. Rob, we need to go out and swing the compass and align the radar heading.”

“Give me fifteen to stow stuff below, and we’ll get underway,” he replied. As he looked at the mess that would have to be stowed, it would be closer to thirty minutes.

They were back at the dock in under an hour. The radar chart plotter was working fine.

“Jim, have you heard back from C-Map on the electronic charts we ordered?”

“Not yet,” he replied, but I’ll call them as soon as I get back to the shop if I don’t have an email from them.”

“Thanks, I hope the new chip releases come out soon. I just spent six grand on an electronic chart plotter that doesn’t have any electronic charts.”

“Don’t worry, I talked to their VP of Sales last week, and he promised me they would be out by Monday.” As Jim walked down the dock, his words were little comfort. He had heard countless VP’s of sales promise new software releases that never came out when they were promised.

As he was reading the Furuno owner’s manual, Norm the dockmaster came over and said, “there is a big delivery for you in my office. Twelve big boxes! Where are you going to put all that stuff.”

“I’m not. Gillian is. Those were the boxes I told you about. I’ll come over and start moving them into that locker if you’ve got the key.”

He dragged the last of the boxes into the storage locker and padlocked it shut. Shit, they were all so heavy. What did she have in them, and where did she think she was going to stow all that stuff? Lone Eagle was already down on her lines, and he could see his waterline sinking further with all of the stuff Gillian just sent. Oh yeah, and don’t forget he reminded himself, you still have an inflatable tender and a fifteen horsepower outboard motor to stow, not to mention food.

His t-shirt was dripping by the time he finished stowing all the boxes. He looked at his watch; it was already 1630. Time to knock off for the day and hit the showers. He was hanging his towel on the lifelines when Phil walked up.

“Hi Rob, have you finished the radar install?” he asked as he looked up at the big ray dome on the mast.

“Yep, finished earlier today. We had to go out to align the fluxgate compass, but it all went well. How have you been?”

“I’m great. Can I come aboard? I have something for you.”

“Sure, Phil. Let me go below and see if I can find us a couple of cold ones.”

“I’m ready,” Phil replied.

They talked about the radar install and the new tender he was looking for. Then Phil got real quiet. “Phil, what’s on your mind?” he asked.

Phil remained quiet for a few seconds longer, and then he spoke. “Rob, me and the other Conks have been watching how hard you are working. We know you are not going to be a gunna like us. You are gunna make it. We envy you going off to live your dream. We all wish we could be doing the same, but you know we all have a story that goes along with our dreams. Well, Rob, I bought this new Conk Republic flag for you. We’d all be proud if you could fly it in those far off places you are going and think of us back here. We may still be back here dreaming someday, but you’ve been an inspiration to all of us. God speed son.”

He was speechless. It was like all of the emotions; all the frustrations had just been released. Tears welled up in his eyes. “Phil, thanks. I’d be honored to fly it in every port that I visit, and as I hoist it, I’ll give it a big salute and think of all of you guys. Thanks for your strength and encouragement. It has meant a lot to me.” He didn’t know what else he could say, but it had been enough.

Phil had a big grin on his face. “I better get going. You look like you could use some chow and some sleep.”

“Thanks, Phil. I’ll see you tomorrow,” he replied.

As Phil ambled down the dock, he looked at the flag in his lap and said to himself, I know I’m going to make it too.





CHAPTER XXIV Late February 2002 - Almost Underway



Marathon, Florida

Lat: 24° 42’ 17.08” N, Long: 081° 06’ 42.83” W

The days were ticking by until Gillian’s return, and the installs were slowly being completed. The inflatable dinghy had been ordered, and the 15 hp Yamaha outboard was ready for pick up. The thoughts of what still needed to be done to make Lone Eagle ready occupied his thoughts as he savored his morning coffee and watched as the sun as it arched its way upward. Just then, he saw a sailboat make the turn to come down the canal for the city marina. He could see a man at the helm and women and a couple of kids on deck with lines at the ready. The space in front of Lone Eagle was open, so he climbed up on the dock to give them a hand with their lines.

The boat was Shadowfox, and Tom and Tracie were her owners. They invited him aboard for coffee and some fresh bread that Tracie had just baked. They were headed off to cruise the Caribbean and had just made the passage from up north out-running winter. It was their first year out, and they were just settling into the cruising life.

“So, Tom, what brings you here?”

“Shore power,” he replied. “Tracie has some canvas work that we need to get done. If you need any canvas work done, Tracie is great on the Sailright sewing machine.”

“I’ve got a few small projects, but they can wait until you guys get your stuff done. I’ve got to run. I’ll be spending the day up in the woodshop, making a fair bit of sawdust. Thanks for the coffee and Tracie, the bread was delicious. I hope Gillian can make it just like this.”

He had been working on all the latches for all of the hatches and cabinet doors for days. Everything had to be hinged and latched, and he had bought a pile of brass hinges and latches to do it. He knew he had to get it done. He knew that if they hit a big blow and Lone Eagle was knocked down, or worse rolled that it was the stuff in the cabinets and lockers that killed people. The cabin sole hatch alone had to weigh sixty pounds and could do some serious damage if it came loose. He shut off the router when he saw Norm at the shop front window waving to him. It was hot and the sawdust he was making was sticking. “Hi Norm, what’s up?” he asked, as he tried to brush it off.

“You’ve got three more boxes that just came in. They weigh a ton.”

“Thanks, Norm. I’ll take a look at them and see if I’m going to put them in the storage locker or take them down to the boat.”

He walked back to Norm’s office and saw the boxes were from Oklahoma. It had to be the canned meat he had ordered. Each box contained a dozen cans of beef, pork, and ground beef. Better put these in the storage locker until Gillian gets here, he thought as he hefted the first one on his shoulder and headed for the locker. Wow, it was heavy. They must be big cans, he thought. This stuff is going to come in handy when we are in the middle of nowhere and want meat.

He finished the last of the router projects in the shop and ran into Tom on his way back to Lone Eagle.

“You look bushed. Tracie wants to know if you’d like to have dinner with us?”

“Thanks, that would be great. I’ll hit the showers. I think I’ve got a bottle of wine that I can bring.”

Tracie had cooked a great dinner, and their two kids Allen and Alice, were so well mannered. Tom explained that he and Tracie spent a few hours everyday homeschooling the kids. The kids said that the most fun was when they got to go to school with other cruising kids when they were in a port. Wow, what a life he thought – school on the beach.

He said good night to Tom and Tracie, and the kids were fast asleep up in the forepeak berth. Tracie had finished their canvas projects and promised him she’d start on his in the morning. “Bring your materials, I’ll have the coffee ready,” she said as he stepped off Shadowfox.

“Thanks, Tracie. Dinner was great.”

He got back to Lone Eagle and decided to give Sailmail another try. He had to get his arms around this new email system because it was going to be their only means of communicating with the outside world. He looked up at the backstay and saw the isolators that had been installed back in Washington. Amazing he thought. The backstay was now an antenna, and his laptop sent his emails through the new Pactor modem and out the backstay via the radio waves.

OK, let’s check the propagation tables for tonight and see which ground station we’re likely to pick up. He clicked on the drop-down menu for the propagation tables and saw that Lunenburg, Nova Scotia had the best reception. Astounding, he thought. He had to be 4,000 miles from it. He tuned the high-frequency single sideband Icom radio to the best transmit and receive frequency, and listened to the static and heard the familiar sounds of transmission noises. Someone else was sending. He waited and the second it stopped, he hit the transmit button. Within seconds the screen said he was connected and had one email. It had to be the test message from Gillian.

Great, he thought. It was working correctly, and Gillian’s email advised she had picked up the World Cruising Routes book that he wanted. She also said she had picked up the Eileen Quinn CDs that Sparky had been playing on their last night together in Manatee Pocket. They both loved Eileen’s nautical ballads – she certainly knew about life as a cruiser. He couldn’t wait to listen to them. He typed out a quick acknowledgment email and hit the transmit key. Wow, slow tonight, he thought as five minutes had passed and it was still sending.

Better get some sleep. Gillian gets in the day after tomorrow, and you’ve got to get this mess cleaned up before she gets here. The last of the installs were done. All we’ve got to do now is start organizing and provisioning, and we can head south for Key West in a week or so.

The sun was already streaming through the portholes when he awoke. He got up and broke down and stowed the bunk and made a strong coffee. He knew he was going to need it. He grabbed the bolt of burgundy Sunbrella canvas that Tracie needed and his patterns and headed over to Shadowfox. Tracie already had her Sailright sewing machine set up in the cockpit. “Morning, Rob, let’s see what you’ve got for me this morning.”

“Not much, Tracie. I just need a couple of canvas drawstring bags and a couple of snap-on pouches to stow odds and ends.”

“Not a problem. Should have them done by the end of the day,” she replied. “What’s on the agenda for you today?”

“House cleaning. Gillian gets in tomorrow, and I need to clean up all of the sawdust I’ve been making.”

“Can’t wait to meet her.”

He had just finished vacuuming the entire boat when he heard a knock on the hull. “Hi Norm,” he yelled from below.

“Rob, here is another package for you – just came in. I had to sign for it.”

“Thanks, Norm,” he said as Norm passed him the package. Washington was the return address – must be Catherine. Yep, it was from Catherine. I wonder what she is sending me as he pulled out his pocket knife and cut through the packing tape. He opened the box and read the note on top. It was a copy of their final divorce decree, and inside, there was a little wooden box with Chaser’s ashes. It felt like someone had kicked him in the guts. He just sat there, stunned. He fought back the tears and took Chaser’s ashes and quickly stowed them and then filed the divorce decree in his knapsack along with the ship’s papers. He couldn’t bear to look at either of them.

He climbed back up in the cockpit and was lost in his thoughts. It’s not getting any easier, he thought as another tear rolled down his cheek.

Just then, Phil appeared. “Hi Rob,” he said, then paused and said, “What’s the matter. You look like you just lost your best friend?”

Phil came aboard, and he explained the package.

“Rob, the hardest thing that people do in this life is to cut the ties and go off cruising. They pay a big emotional and financial price to do it, but I’ve never met one that has ever regretted it.”

“Thanks, Phil; it isn’t easy, but I’m almost ready to shove off.”

“When is Gillian getting in?”

“Tomorrow; I can’t wait.”

“Get her here and get going Rob, you’ll feel a lot better when you get some salt spray in your face.”





CHAPTER XXV March 2002 - The Return of Gillian



Marathon, Florida

Lat: 24° 42’ 17.08” N, Long: 081° 06’ 42.83” W

He was awake and already lost in his thoughts when the alarm went off. Lone Eagle was clean and tidy, and Gillian was coming in a few hours. A wave of relief washed over him. It had been two back-breaking months at the Marathon Marina, and finally, they would be getting underway.

She gets in at 1800, and it’s a four hour run from here. OK, I’ve got to leave at 1400. That gives me time to organize the ParaTech Sea Anchor. He dragged and carried the heavy canvas bag containing the chute onto the dock and then the 350’ of 5/8th” nylon rope. He got one of the dock carts and wheeled all of it into the marina auditorium and set to work. He carefully coiled the line and spliced in a loop with plastic tubing to protect it from abrasion. Then he opened the chute bag. Wow, he thought, a fifteen-foot parachute. This was supposed to hold Lone Eagle head to wind in the event it all went to shit. I can’t imagine having to drag the chute and 350’ line out of the cockpit locker, up on deck, and then deploy it. You’ve got it, he thought. Let’s hope you never have to use it.

He finished his splicing and tied off all the coils of line with little quick-release cord with red reflective tags and dragged it all back to the boat and stowed it in the cockpit locker. The cockpit locker was stuffed with all of their safety and survival gear. I’ve got enough time to check the weather fax. The next report would be transmitted from the New Orleans station in a few minutes. He turned on the weather fax and waited. Right on time, the printer came to life, and the weather map came spitting out. Good, the front goes through tonight and will cool things off a bit.

Time to go. He hopped in the car and headed up Highway A1A for the drive to Miami. The miles ticked by as did his thoughts of Gillian and the things they needed to get done before they could get underway. He pulled into Miami Airport and looked at the flight board; she was right on time.

She came down the jetway, and they embraced. “Ready for some fun, baby?”

“I can’t believe we’re really doing this.”

“We are. Have much luggage?”

“Just two duffle bags.”

The drive back to Marathon was over in a flash. They talked about everything. They knew they were getting close, and agreed that Gillian would spend the next morning stowing the twelve boxes of stuff she had shipped in, plus the three boxes of canned meat that had come in.

“Rob, I want you off the boat when I do it. I know exactly where and how I want to stow everything, and I don’t need you looking over my shoulder.”

“No problem, I’ve got to go and pick up the new inflatable dinghy and the new outboard. I’ll help you get the boxes down to Lone Eagle, and then I’ll be gone.”

He got back in the early afternoon with the packed inflatable, the outboard motor, and the fuel tank. The dock next to Lone Eagle was piled with empty boxes. She had done it. She stowed it all. The waterline was down a bit, but he had raised it four inches when he did the last anti-foul job.

“Hi,” she said as she looked up from the companionway. “All stowed Cap, but we are going to need to ship all our winter wear to your mom in Australia. We won’t be needing it where we’re going,” she said with a big smile on her face. They were both looking forward to tropical sailing.

He paid the cashier at the post office for the postage for the four big boxes of winter gear. As they drove back to Lone Eagle, he said, “Tomorrow we do a run for the non-perishable provisions and the day after we head up to Fort Lauderdale, pick up your new camera gear and sell the car. We’ll get a one-way rent-a-car back, and then all we need is a good weather window.”

They got back to Lone Eagle and unpacked the inflatable dinghy that they christened Big Dink. She was a 10’4” Achilles air floor inflatable, and he couldn’t wait to try her out. Baby Dink, was stowed in the cradle he made on Lone Eagle’s cabin top. It was filled with all the survival gear. “Up for some fun?” he asked. “Let’s take her for a spin.” The first launch of Big Dink off Lone Eagle’s bow made for interesting spectating. They used the halyard for the lift, but Big Dink was a hundred pounds, and the first launch was awkward at best. “We’ll get a lot better at this,” he told her. “OK. Now that we’ve got her in the water, let’s take her back aft and see if we can use the davit to lower the motor down to me.”

Just then, Phil showed up to watch the action.

“Hi Phil, I’d like to introduce you to Gillian.”

“Hi Gillian, Rob has told me so much about you. We’re glad you are here – especially Rob here. He’s been working so hard.”

“Thanks, Phil,” she said “I’m making a big pot of stew tonight. Would you like to join us?”

“Would love to,” Phil replied. “You guys going out for a spin by the looks of it.”

“Sure am,” he replied as he gave the outboard motor lug nuts a final turn.

Phil explained that the south end of Marathon Harbor had some mudflats that manatees loved to play in. “Why don’t you guys see if you can go play with them?”

“Will do,” he replied as he pulled the starter cord on the new 15hp Yamaha, and it roared to life.

They got out into the harbor, and he revved her up. She flew – rocketed.

“Big Dink is going to be great – we can haul a lot of gear with her,” he yelled as he swung her around to head for the mudflats. They were there in no time, and he eased up to the edge; there were the manatees – lots of them. He shut off the outboard and put the oars in the water. It was unbelievable that they were able to row right into the middle of the pod where there were babies; the mothers seemed to sense they meant no harm. Gillian was beside herself. She had never seen a manatee before and was able to reach over the side and pat them. She giggled with glee.

The days since Gillian’s arrival passed quickly. The car was sold, albeit for a lot less than he wanted, and Gillian had done her non-perishable provisioning run. The waterline sank another inch or so – my he thought, we could go without touching land for six months with all that food. They went through all of the safety and survival gear and all of the procedures that they would have to follow to use it.

“I hope we never have to abandon ship into Baby Dink. I don’t know whether we would make it,” she said.

“She may be small, and we’re going to get wet, but with all the fenders snapped on around her, she won’t sink, and, at least with a sailing dink, we can sail to help and have thirty days rations. With life rafts, you just sit there bailing water and hoping someone sees you as you drift away from the shipping lanes.”

They printed out the latest weather fax and went over it during dinner.

“Looks good, we’ll have winds out of the east tomorrow so it will be a beam reach to Key West. Are you ready to get this show on the road?”

“Let’s do it,” she replied.

“OK, let’s turn in early I want to be underway by first light.”





CHAPTER XXVI March 10, 2002 - Onward to Key West



Key West, Florida

Lat: 24° 46’ 47.95” N, Long: 081° 46.95” W

They cleared the harbor at 0530 and made for their first waypoint. “OK, we’re in blue water; let’s see if we can make some water.” Monitor was steering, and Gillian was keeping watch while he went below and pulled out the operating instructions for the Spectra watermaker. He threw the switch to turn on the primary feed pump that was internal to the unit and factory-installed. It sounded like it was working, but he didn't see any water flow through the clear hose lines. Damn. OK, he thought, let’s try the secondary pump – the one he installed. Works fine. “We will have to call the dealer when we get to Key West and get them to send down a technician and spare pump. We can’t go with just one feed water pump – that’s half our output.”

The sail to Key West was perfect. He spent most of the time fiddling with the new radar chart plotter. He fired up the radar and watched the amp meter. Eats a fair bit of juice, he thought.

They anchored near Wisteria Island along the western flats and tried to get under the lee close to the mangroves to have a little protection from anything that would be coming from the northwest – the source of all the cold fronts. They launched Big Dink and managed to lower the outboard onto her transom even though there was a fair bit of chop that made it a bit bouncy.

The next morning they got the forecast from Key West Coast Guard on the VHF radio. It was 0600, and the front was coming through, and the clouds were darkening, and the wind was a sustained 20 knots. He let out another 75’ foot of anchor chain that gave him a 5:1 ratio. Enough he thought. They took Big Dink into Key West and found the post office where a new alternator was waiting for him. He shipped back the old one to Marcus, and they grabbed the new one and headed for the dinghy dock.

“Hey Rob,” Mike yelled from across the street, “You better get back to your boat; she’s dragging anchor.”

He and Gillian ran to the dinghy dock, imagining the worst. He gave Big Dink full throttle, and they screamed back toward Lone Eagle. The chop had picked up, and Gillian was bouncing like a rag doll. He had to slow down. He could just see Lone Eagle. Oh shit, she was tangled up with another boat. He pulled alongside Lone Eagle and climbed aboard to see the other boat’s bowsprit chewing up his starboard toe rail alongside the cockpit.

He was able to get them apart and retrieve his anchor. He was sick. This would be another delay they didn’t need. The wind was building now to a sustained 35 knots – not what they forecasted. No way to re-anchor out here, and there was no protection anywhere. He decided to head for Key West’s little harbor and got in just as the gusts built to 40 knots. The two marinas were full, so they tied up to a concrete dock that was under construction. This will do for the night, he thought as he called his insurance company and told them about the incident. Then he called the Stock Island Ship Yard – they could take him in the morning. Next was a call to the Spectra watermaker dealer – they would meet him there tomorrow as well. Maybe we can be out of here by the end of the week, he thought.

The next morning they pulled into the Stock Island Ship Yard. The shipwright said no problem; he should have a new piece of teak toe rail fitted by the end of the day. Just before lunch the watermaker guy showed up and tried to blame the pump failure on his installation, but when he was reminded that it was the factory-installed pump and not the one he installed that wasn’t working and that his boss had inspected and approved the install, he backed off after a brief phone conversation with his office. They had to pull out the sink to get at it, but it was done by the end of the day. This time they tested it at the dock and it was making 40 gallons per hour with both feedwater pumps running. They would need every drop he thought.

The next morning they hitched a ride into Key West, where he went into the Coast Guard office, and she went shopping – what else did she need?

Ensign Anderson was sitting at his desk and looked up over his computer monitor and asked, “what can I do for you?”

“I understand that I can get a cruising permit for Cuba. We are checking out tomorrow and would like to have a permit, please.”

Ensign Anderson said that they had just started issuing them and explained the Treasury Department regulation against trading with the enemy. “Sir, when you come back, you can have nothing aboard that shows that you have bought anything in Cuba – no rum, cigars, not even a T-shirt.”

“I’m not coming back,” he replied.

“But when you do come back…,” Ensign Anderson insisted.

“I’m not coming back, Ensign. I’m making a one-way voyage to Australia.”

“You’re going where?” he asked, still stunned.

“Australia,” he replied.

“How long do you want the permit for?”

“Let’s make it for thirty days just in case I do have to come back.”

Ensign Anderson went off and came back with all kinds of forms for him to fill out. He walked out of Coast Guard Station Key West with a signed Cuban cruising permit in-hand and thought this is it; you’re really out of here. He was going to miss America. It hurt already. Each tie that he had cut in the months leading up to this point was like driving a wedge between him and the country he was born in – the one he loved – the one he was so proud of. He reminded himself that he was going to be with family and, hopefully, a better life. He took one last look at the American flag flying over the Coast Guard Station and turned for the walk into town to meet up with Gillian. I wonder how much more stuff she has bought and where she thinks she’s going to find room to put it.

They made it back to Lone Eagle in time to download the weather fax forecast from New Orleans. The wind was going to be out of the east for another two days before the next cold front arrived.

“We go tomorrow,” he said as Gillian stowed the last of what she had bought.

“What’s it look like?”

“Winds out of the east 10-15 knots and seas 4-6 - shouldn’t be a problem.”

They turned in early, but neither could sleep.

“You awake?” he asked.

“Yeah.”

“What are you thinking?”

“I’m just a bit scared,” she said.

“We’ll be fine, baby. We’re ready, and Lone Eagle is ready.” He pulled her closer. He was a bit scared himself but knew that sharing that wasn’t a good idea.





CHAPTER XXVII March 14, 2002 – The Run to Cuba



Marina Hemmingway, Cuba

Lat: 23° 05’ 21.84” N, Long: 082° 29’ 44.09” W

If every journey begins with the first step, he knew this one was going to be a big one. They were leaving the States, and all future ports would be foreign ones. There would be strange harbors, different cultures, and languages. I hope we’re ready, he thought.

The run from Key West to Cuba was ninety miles across the Florida Straights and the Gulf Stream that pushed through from west to east at better than four knots. It could be a good run or a miserable one if the wind out of the east kicked up. They were up early, and he tuned into the VHF radio weather forecast. It was still the same as last night, 10-15 knots out of the east and seas 4-6’.

They spent the morning with last-minute stuff. Gillian made sandwiches for the night watch with plenty of fruit and energy bars. He didn’t think he would need any of the energy bars – he was running on adrenalin.

He checked the waypoints in the chart plotter and entered them into the hand-held GPS, just in case.

“Gillian, I figure we shove off at noon and should make landfall just after dawn.” He explained that “the approach to Hemingway Marina is hard to see until your right on it, so we need to get there after first light to be able to see the approach, even though I’ve got the entrance marked as a waypoint.”

As they sailed out of the Key West harbor, they made their last mobile phone calls to friends and the last one to their mobile phone companies to disconnect their services.

“Just toss them in the electronics bag,” he told her.

“I thought you wanted to throw yours overboard?” she asked.

“I did, but we might want to use them when we get to Australia.”

They were underway, and the winds were light, but he knew they would build throughout the day. The day flew by, and with each hour, he marked their position on the chart to get a sense of the eastward set the Gulf Stream was having on them – lighter than expected, he thought as he plotted the 1800 fix. Gillian had made spaghetti and meat sauce for their dinner meal. Food always tasted better at sea, he thought as he watched the sun melt into the Gulf of Mexico.

“No green flash tonight, baby.”

There was no moon, and the sky was overcast, so it got dark – inky dark, really fast. The mast tricolor light was lit, and the chart plotter glowed in the cockpit.

“Well, baby, we’re going to be spending a lot of nights out here. Sure wish we had some stars,” he said as he switched on the radar to being their fifteen-minute sweeps.

The Florida Straights had a lot of shipping traffic with hundreds of container ships and oil tankers bound from New Orleans and Texas. “No one out there at the moment, but you’ll have to do fifteen-minute sweeps, so none of those big boys sneaks up on us.”

“Get some sleep, I’ll take the first watch,” Gillian offered.

“Will you be alright?” he asked.

“No problem. I’ll wake you up if I see anything.”

“OK, but I’m not kidding; you really need to wake me up if you see anything. I don’t care how far away it is,” he replied as he pulled the companionway hatch closed.

He laid there for what seemed like hours listening to Lone Eagle’s sounds, vibrations – everything. He was just dozing off to sleep when the hatch opened.

“Rob, I see lights on the horizon.”

“On my way,” he replied and climbed out of the bunk and up into the cockpit. The red cabin lights that he installed were great; they didn’t destroy his night vision.

He sat down next to Gillian and saw that the wind was building. It was a sustained 15 knots and gusting to 20.

“We’ll need to put a reef in the main,” he said as he scanned the horizon with the binoculars. There were the lights. “OK, let’s turn on the radar and see where he’s headed, he looks to be about 10 miles out and closing. He’ll pass in front of us with 4-5 miles of clearance,” he explained as the target illuminated on the radar.

“I’m going up on deck and put a reef in the main,” he said as he fastened his inflatable harness tether to the jack lines and climbed up on the cabin top.

“Be careful,” she reminded him.

He put the first reef in the main and stood there for a moment, looking at the shape of the main and then shifted his gaze to the ship off their port bow. It’s moving fast, he thought as he and slid his hooked tether along the jack lines back to the cockpit.

Let’s see if we can raise our friend on the VHF. He keyed the mic and gave his course speed and position and then identified the target by its position indicated on the radar. The VHF crackled to life. The target – a tanker had him on his radar, and they agreed to maintain course and speed. “OK, that’s the first one. Let’s hope the others work the same way,” he said. “Go get some sleep baby. I’m too wired to sleep, so one of us ought to get some shut-eye.”

The seas were a bit lumpy, but Monitor had Lone Eagle right on course. Each hour he quietly went below and marked their position on the chart. Less Gulf Stream set than I thought he muttered to himself as he climbed back into the cockpit and looked at his watch. There were a few more ships, but all were passing well clear of them. The glow of Key West had faded hours ago. Wow, he thought, you are going to be spending lots of nights out here in the cockpit. His thoughts bounced from Lone Eagle and all the work he had done on her, to Hemmingway Marina, and what the entrance might look like. Before he knew it, it was 0400, and he was ready for a cat nap before dawn.

“Hey baby, it’s 0400 – it’s your watch,” he whispered down the companionway.

A groggy “I’m coming,” was all he heard. Minutes later, she hooked in and climbed into the cockpit. “How’s it going?”

“No problem. A couple of targets passed us, but there is nothing on the radar at the moment.” They were still 25 miles off the Cuban coast. “Gillian, wake me if you see any more lights and keep doing the 15-minute radar sweeps. I’ll need to radio the Cuban Defense Force when we’re 12 miles off their coast, so wake me up when the radar shows us 15 miles off.”

“I will,” she replied.

It felt like he had been asleep for ten minutes when he heard, “Hey, Rob, we’re 15 miles off, and it's starting to get light.”

“Thanks, baby. I’ll be up in a minute.” He climbed into the cockpit and saw a dim glow to the east. He checked the radar – nothing. “OK, let’s see if the Cuban military is awake,” he said as he keyed the VHF mic. No answer. He tried to raise them a couple of times but no reply. Not surprising, he thought. “I’m sure they have heard us and probably have us on their radar,” and then thought to himself, one of their gunboats might swing by for a look.

The sun had cleared the horizon just as the chart plotter showed they were 10 miles off the entrance to the Hemingway Marina. It was hazy – very hazy, but slowly land came into view - the island of Cuba. It looked long and low, but what appeared to be dark clouds over it revealed themselves to be mountains. Wow, he thought, it’s incredible how high they are. Nothing like flat Florida and just 90 miles off the coast.

The remaining miles ticked by with the chart plotter flashing to indicate they had reached the waypoint for the entrance to Hemingway Marina. He scanned the shoreline and could see masts and continued scanning for the pass through the reef. It took a few minutes to see it – a channel just wide enough for a boat that was cut through the coral with breaking waves on either side of it.

“Gillian, I’ve got it. Hold her into the wind and start up the engine while I go up and drop the main,” he said as he hooked onto the jack line and went forward.

He was hooked on to the mast and pulled the bright yellow quarantine flag out of his pocket and connected it to the port spreader flag halyard. Remember, he reminded himself, make sure that once you clear in and hoist the Cuban flag that the star is right-side up. He had read in the cruising guide that flying the Cuban flag wrong side up was not appreciated by Cuban authorities – an act of war the guide said. He raised the port flag halyard, and the yellow quarantine flag snapped in the breeze. We’re legal, he thought.

He got back to the cockpit and throttled up Lone Eagle to line up for the approach.

“What’s that over there?” as Gillian pointed.

“It’s what’s left of a sailboat that didn’t make it through the pass,” he explained as he focused on the narrow entrance. Coral on both sides – real tight, but not as narrow as Man-O-War Key in the Abacos in the Bahamas where he had less than a foot on either side. They made it through and saw that Hemingway Harbor was a series of interconnected canals cut right out of the coral. He saw the Customs House and a military guy waiving them in to tie up alongside.

“Gillian, let’s get out the fenders and prepare dock lines for a port side to landing.” Gillian moved quickly, and all was ready as he eased Lone Eagle alongside the Customs House wharf. He greeted the guard in Spanish and was greeted with, “Welcome to my country” in English.

The procession started first with the Customs Officer coming aboard. He informed the Customs Officer he had firearms aboard and presented him with a weapons inventory for the three guns, including a description of each with serial numbers and the number of rounds of ammunition he was carrying. The Customs Officer inspected the guns and the inventory and then looked over the ship's papers and their passports. He was using his Australian passport and Gillian was using her UK one.

“Do you want stamps?” the customs officer asked.

“No, thank you,” he replied.

There would be no record they were ever there without the stamps. That might come in handy if he ever went back to the States as Cuba was still on the unfriendly list.

The Customs Officer asked, “Do you have a gift for the Cuban people?”

Gillian pulled out some coloring books and pencils. “These are for the children of Cuba,” she said.

The Customs Officer frowned; he was clearly looking for money.

“We are poor cruisers, but we can give you this,” he said as he handed the Customs Officer a twenty-dollar bill. The Customs Officer nodded and grunted and then picked up his fishing tackle box and opened it up. He picked out two new lures still in their plastic packaging and put them in his pocket.

Gillian looked at him, and he looked at her but they both knew he could not make an issue of the theft. The Customs Officer asked about their cruising plans and gave them a sixty-day cruising permit and signed the receipt for the ‘armamentos’ he had prepared in Spanish. Next, the Customs Officer wanted to look at all the radios and handheld GPS units that they had aboard. He put all the ones that were not mounted into a plastic bag and put a seal on it.

“You are not to use these while you are in Cuba. You must leave with all of them, or there will be problems,” he warned.

He had been told that the Cubans would be very sensitive and strict about these items as they could be used by those ever-present Cubans refugees climbing aboard rafts bound for Florida.

As the customs Officer climbed off Lone Eagle, a man and a woman in uniform were waiting on the dock. As the Customs Officer climbed on to the dock with the guns under his arm and passed them, he muttered something to the two in uniform who climbed aboard. The man introduced himself as a Quarantine Officer. They went below and wanted to look at the ship’s stores - in particular, all fruit and vegetables. Gillian showed them what they had on board, and the man selected several of the best of each and put them in a plastic bag. I guess that’s how they eat, he thought. Just then, the woman pulled out an aerosol can and gave a couple of squirts into the air. I wonder what that was, he thought as the officers climbed up the companionway hatch and made their way to the dock.

Next was the Port Captain. He wanted to inspect the engine, asked how many bilge pumps they had, and then proceeded to check Lone Eagle’s cleats and dock lines. “You are assigned to A wharf. You can now lower your quarantine flag and proceed to slip 85. It’s a starboard tie, and there are power and water on the dock,” and then went on to say that “no Cuban citizens are allowed aboard your vessel. The docks are patrolled by our military. Do not try to bring any Cubans aboard your vessel, or it will be confiscated.” Then he added, “Welcome to Cuba. We hope you enjoy your stay.”

Gillian started to take in their lines while he started up the engine. He had the hatch to the engine compartment open and saw that the alternator was vibrating and that the mounting bolt needed to be tightened. “Gillian, get a line back on the dock. I’ve got a little problem here,” he yelled up to her from below over the noise of the engine.

Lone Eagle was re-tied to the dock, and the Port Captain came back. “What is the problem?”

“Lose alternator mount; I’ll tighten it up and be out of here in five minutes,” he replied.

“You must leave now. Other boats could be coming in,” he explained with little patience or compassion in his voice.

“Sir,” he replied, “I will be underway as soon as I make my vessel seaworthy” and added, “You don’t want me crashing into your other guests, do you?”

The Port Captain turned on his heel and headed back to the Customs Office. Score one for the Yankee gringo, he thought.

He tightened the mount, and they motored to A wharf, which was little more than a channel cut in the coral. They tied up to the south side just aft of a US sailboat named Margarita. Margarita’s owners Allen and Lindsay took their lines and said, “Welcome to Cuba. How did you go with Customs and the Port Captain?” He introduced himself and Gillian and explained that clearing in had not been a problem. Allen told them that the Canadian boat behind them Tonka was owned by Dick and Aileen but they were in Havana and would be back later in the evening. They thanked Allen and Lindsay for their help with their lines and started to straighten up Lone Eagle.

It was hot, and they decided that they would take a walk to the Yachtsman’s Chandlery. Incredible, rum was three dollars a bottle, and all the US spirits were under ten dollars a bottle. The Cuban cigars – Cohibas were a dollar apiece. He couldn’t believe it. Yeah, but the Coke was four dollars a can. Oh well, he thought, we’ve got a good stock of Coke aboard, and if they ran out, rum on the rocks wouldn’t be too painful. As they walked back to Lone Eagle, he spotted the Hemingway Hotel. It was right on the beach and had its own radar on the top floor. Interesting he thought. Must be an old KGB monitoring station.

A little while later, he headed down the dock to the public showers, next door to the marina office. Coming his way was Allen and he had a toilet seat hung over his arm.

Allen handed it to him and said, “Here, you’re going to need this,” as they passed on the walkway.

“I’ll get it back to you as soon as I can,” he replied as a smile crept over his face.

They turned in early that first night. It had been a long two days, and neither of them had gotten much sleep, but they had done it – they were in Cuba.





CHAPTER XXVIII March 28, 2002 - Havana to Paradise



Cayo Paraiso, Cuba

Lat: 25° 55’ 30.98” N, Long: 083° 25’ 58.85” W

Strange, he thought – the political situation with the US and Cuba. Ninety miles apart and a time warp in between. Havana, once the Riviera of the Caribbean, staunchly Catholic had some of the most beautiful architecture, not to mention some of the most beautiful women he had ever seen. Incredible how the two countries could be so far apart politically. What the hell he thought, you can’t win the presidency without winning Florida’s 23 electoral votes, and you don’t win them unless you win the anti-Castro hearts and minds of the Cuban exiles in Miami. It had been that way since the Cuban revolution.

They had been at the Hemingway Marina for ten days, and it was time to move westward along the northern coast of Cuba. Cuba had a fringing reef all along its northern coastline, but fortunately, he knew from the cruising guide that it had lots of good passes into sheltered water inside the reef. He had spoken to Allen and Lindsay as well as several other cruisers that were on the ‘Gringo Trail.’ All were headed westward, and all planned to hole-up in the Rio Dulce in Guatemala for hurricane season. He studied the cruising guide and entered waypoints for Cayo Paraiso (Paradise Cay) some 60 miles to the west. The cruising guide said the pass through the reef was pretty straight forward and the island of Cayo Paraiso had a teardrop-shaped anchorage free of coral heads. The guide also said it had been used as a lookout by Ernest Hemingway during WWII to spot German subs transiting the Florida Straits.

They cleared out with the Marina Hemmingway Port Captain and recovered the guns – the ‘toys’ they now called them and made for the entrance to Hemingway Harbor. It was a stunning day. The front had passed early the day before, and the winds were just starting to come up out of the southeast. Good, he thought – a broad reach. He unfurled the Genny, and she filled perfectly. The waypoints passed as they luxuriated in the warm winter sun.

“We’re doing it, Gillian – we’re off cruising to go explore our first Cuban island.”

“I can’t wait for a swim in the lagoon,” she replied.

They reached the pass for the Cay in the early afternoon. It was, as the guide said, straight forward and they entered easily. Cayo Paraiso was a little island – little more than an acre with lots of palms, a beautiful white sandy beach, and the most amazing reefs on the northern side. They motored into the anchorage and were the only boat there – bliss. He set the anchor – the ‘pick’ and put his snorkel on for a dive to see if it was set. The plunge into the turquoise water felt great, and he could see that the pick had set well. “Hey baby, come on in, the water is crystal clear,” he yelled up to her from the spot where he was hovering over the pick.

They swam and just lounged in the cockpit all afternoon. It was a perfect spot and well-named - Paradise Cay. “I could get used to this place,” he said as she handed him his vodka tonic sundowner.

The sun shower (the black plastic bag full of water) was hot to the touch, and they both had great cockpit showers as they watched the sun melt into the Gulf. Magic, he thought. All that work was worth it.

He turned on the watermaker and topped off the tank while Gillian made dinner. He broke out the black walnut cockpit table he had made and put it in place and helped her set the table. Alfresco dining never got better than this. They lingered over dinner until well after sunset. He lit the brass oil lamps, brought them up into the cockpit and put on some Buffettt. They talked about not making the Pacific run this year. They were already well into the season, and the Rio Dulce was becoming a real prospect.

The next morning dawned hazy with barely a breath of wind when they launched Big Dink. He was going to do some reef diving today. They finished getting Big Dink ready and loaded it with his snorkel gear and a spear gun. A fish dinner might be on the cards. Gillian served up a great breakfast, and they lounged in the cockpit, enjoying their morning coffee as he looked out to the mainland shoreline some three miles away. “I wonder what that is? It looks like a raft of some sort,” he said as he reached below for the binoculars. It was a raft, and there were two guys on it paddling. “Looks like they are heading our way.”

“Let me have a look,” Gillian asked.

They watched for more than an hour as the paddlers struggled to propel their little raft forward.

The two men looked exhausted when they finally pulled alongside. They introduced themselves as Miguel and Pedro between sips of water from the coconuts that they had tied to the raft. The raft consisted of two truck inner tubes cut in lengths with the ends tied. They looked like two big black bananas with a piece of plywood lashed between them. Their paddles were equally primitive – a stick with a small piece of plywood lashed to it.

Miguel asked, “Do you want lobster, man?” and then reached over the side of the raft and pulled up a string that held some beautiful looking lobsters. They had all been speared, and most still had quite a bit of life left in them.

“How much?” he asked.

Miguel thought for a second and then gestured, pointing to his hat. “You want my hat?” he replied.

“Si Señor, we like baseball,” Miguel replied.

He took off his dirty, sweat-stained New York Yankees cap and handed it to Miguel. Miguel passed him the string with eight big lobsters. He couldn’t believe it – eight lobsters for a dirty baseball cap and Miguel, with a big grin, looked like he thought he had gotten the better end of the bargain.

They chatted a while with Miguel and Pedro. Their English was quite good, and they explained that they lived in a little village not far from shore; both had wives and children and scraped together a living by selling lobster and fish to passing cruisers. Gillian went below and came up with two Ziploc bags containing little bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and soap that she had made up for giveaways, for them to give to their wives. Miguel and Pedro were thrilled.

“We come back tomorrow with fresh fruit for you,” Miguel said as he and Pedro started the long paddle back to shore. Wow, he thought. They were so nice and had so little.

As Miguel and Pedro paddled off, he got Big Dink ready to go ashore. “Up for a little island exploration?” he asked.

“Sounds great, let me get my hat and sunscreen.”

They beached Big Dink and set up their camping chairs under a palm hanging out over the beach. She sunbathed, and he walked the island. It was a stunning little island, and when he got to the northern side, he imagined Hemmingway camped there with binoculars in hand scanning the horizon for German subs. He came across the remains of a campfire and what looked like a big rock next to it turned out to be the sun-bleached shell of a loggerhead turtle. Possession of one of those shells in the States was a criminal offense, but here it was a matter of survival.

He had a great snorkel on the reef on the south side of the island. No luck spearfishing, but he didn’t care, because they had a fridge full of big lobster tails.

They sat in their camping chairs under the palms and watched as a sailboat approached from the pass.

“There goes the neighborhood,” he said as he stood to get a better look. “I think its Dick and Aileen on Tonka.” They watched as Dick eased Tonka into the little anchorage and placed the pick well away, and forward of Lone Eagle. Cruisers generally did respect each other’s privacy. Dick spotted them on the shore and gave a big wave.

They packed up their beach gear and loaded it aboard Big Dink and motored out to Tonka.

“Hi guys, welcome to paradise,” he said.

“Won’t be for long,” Dick replied. “Four more boats about an hour behind us.”

He told Dick and Aileen about Miguel and Pedro and invited them over for lobster on the BBQ. They eagerly accepted.

“I’ll bring a big salad,” Aileen said as he started up Big Dink’s outboard motor and headed for Lone Eagle.

They sun showered off, and Gillian grabbed her book and settled into the cockpit. He checked the battery meter. We’re using a fair amount of amps. “Hey Gillian, we need to charge the batts. Will you fire up the engine and bring her up to a thousand RPMs.” He watched the battery meter and saw that they were putting in 60 amps. “I figure she’ll take about an hour to charge up. I think the fridge is using a lot to keep up with this heat.”

He took Dick’s bow line (painter) as he and Aileen pulled alongside just as the sun was making its lazy slide into the Gulf. Dick and Aileen were Canadian. They had bought Tonka a year earlier and were planning on doing the Gringo Trail. They had met in Hemmingway but hadn’t seen much of them as they spent a lot of time in Havana. They hit it off, and he had a ball cooking the lobster tails on Lone Eagle’s little Force 10 barbeque. The four other boats had arrived, and all had their dinks in the water. One of them had a large center console RIB (rigid inflatable boat) with a 40 hp outboard. The guy was buzzing the anchorage like he was in an Indy race.

They had a great night with Dick and Aileen and talked about the next stop at Puerto Esperanza. It was supposed to be a fun spot about thirty miles further westward. After they left, he and Gillian cleaned up the galley.

“You know Rob, tomorrow is your birthday?”

“Don’t remind me.”

“Well, I have some surprises for you.”

The next morning he was having his coffee when he looked out to the south and could see Miguel and Pedro off in the distance paddling towards them. “Buenos Dias amigos,” he yelled as they approached. He took their line just as Gillian came on deck.

“We have fruit for you,” Miguel said as he opened a burlap bag and proudly laid out some bananas and oranges. They looked to be in poor shape, but he bought all of them and gave them ten US dollars.

“What are you guys going to be doing today?” he asked.

“We need to catch more fish and lobster – you come?” Pedro asked.

‘I’ve got something I’ve got to do this morning on the boat, but I can meet you at the reef in about an hour.”

He finished the work he had to do and loaded up Big Dink with his snorkel gear and spear gun. He had been watching Miguel and Pedro out on the reef. Hope I get some lobster today, he thought as Big Dink rocketed over the sand bottom. He liked snorkeling but didn’t like sticking his head or hands under rocks where most of the lobsters liked to hide. He hated moray eels, and they were everywhere. He dropped anchor next to the raft and saw that Miguel and Pedro were having a good morning. They speared everything, even angelfish. He didn’t have the heart for that.

He put on his gear and slipped over the side. Two hours later, having speared nothing, he dragged himself exhausted aboard Big Dink. Miguel and Pedro were sitting on their raft, surveying their big catch. He told them he had to get back to Lone Eagle. When they saw that he hadn’t caught a thing, Miguel grabbed several nice size grouper and a couple of lobsters and threw them into Big Dink. “You tell Gillian you caught them,” he said with his big smile.

“Thank you,” he replied. “Stop by the boat on your way home. I’ve got something for you,” he said as he started up the outboard and headed for Lone Eagle.

What’s that alongside Lone Eagle, he thought? It was another raft. This place is getting busy. As he approached, the raft and the two guys on it pushed off and quickly started to paddle away from Lone Eagle. Gillian took his painter as he pulled alongside. She had a very concerned look on her face. “Who were those guys?” he asked.

“They tried to sell me some lobster, but their eyes were all over the boat. When they saw you coming, they were in a hurry to leave. I don’t have a good feeling about those guys.”

“We better hoist up Big Dink with the spinnaker pole tonight,” he replied.

They barbequed the grouper, and the tails and Gillian served him the homemade ice cream she had made for his birthday. It had been a good stop at Cayo Paraiso.

“We need to be moving tomorrow. I’ve looked at the guide, and Puerto Esperanza is about thirty miles west of here. What do you say, we get moving after breakfast tomorrow?”

“No problem, I’ll miss this place.”

“Me too; you ready to turn in?”

The next morning Miguel and Pedro paddled by, and he waved them over. They had plenty of lobsters in the fridge, but he wanted to say goodbye to them. Gillian gave them both T-shirts and ten dollars each. Just then, they saw something coming from the west - a Cuban Patrol boat. Miguel and Pedro looked scared and set off paddling as fast as they could to the beach. He could see them run into the palm grove and start digging in the sand – they were burying the money and the T-shirts.

The Patrol boat pulled alongside the sailboat with the high-speed RIB – the RIB was gone. He turned on the VHF radio and hailed Dick on Tonka.

“What’s going on Dick?”

“Someone stole their RIB last night, and they have been on the VHF all morning with the Cuban Defense Force.”

“Thanks, Dick. We’re out of here in a few minutes. See you in Puerto Esperanza.”

The patrol boat’s launch headed for the island. Oh God, he thought they were going to pick up Miguel and Pedro. Gillian was so upset. It wasn’t long before they had Miguel and Pedro and were taking them back to the patrol boat. “It had to be those guys I saw yesterday,” she said. Gillian radioed the patrol boat and explained about the two guys she had seen the day before. She told them that Miguel and Pedro were good guys and hadn’t stolen the RIB. The captain thanked her and explained that he still had to question them.

“Baby, I think it’s time we make our move,” he said as he fired up the engine and went forward to raise the anchor. They were underway in minutes and watched the patrol boat launch making the rounds among the cruisers. He lined up on the pass, and within minutes, they felt the lift of the swell as they made their turn westward though their thoughts were with Miguel and Pedro. It could be very unpleasant for them, he thought.





CHAPTER XXIX March 30, 2002 - Enter Sandra



Puerto Esperanza, Cuba

Lat: 22° 46’ 10.62” N, Long: 083° 43’ 54.72” W

The run went smoothly, and the waypoints passed along as they approached the pass through the reef to Puerto Esperanza. The sky was clear, and the wind was out of the southeast at just over 10 knots – perfect conditions. They were quiet for most of the run, with each thinking about Miguel and Pedro.

They cleared the pass and started looking for the gap in the mangroves to the west that the guide said opened into a little cove. The guide said it was marked with sticks and had plenty of water, good anchoring, and protection from any weather coming from the northwest.

“I think I see the sticks,” he said as he tried to focus the binoculars. “Yep, that’s the first stick, and you can see the others in a line. What’s our depth?”

“Eight feet under the keel.”

"Good, hold her steady on this heading. I’m going forward to keep a lookout,” he said as he climbed on deck and headed for the bowsprit.

“Depth?” he yelled from the bowsprit.

“Four feet.”

Good, he thought. The cruising guide said that they would have four feet under the keel all the way in.

“Gillian, we’re through, come right ten degrees and head over toward that clump of mangroves.” She swung the tiller and slowed Lone Eagle as she reached the spot. He let go the anchor, and the chained clattered as he let out more chain while Gillian backed Lone Eagle down. The pick was set, and Gillian revved it in reverse to dig her in.

“Welcome to Puerto Esperanza,” he said as they high fived another safe passage. It became a custom with them.

“When do you want to go into town,” she asked.

“We have to head out of this cove and anchor over by the town dock we saw as we came in. Then I’ve got to go ashore with the toys and turn them in at the Defense Force office. Let’s go in tomorrow. We can stay here for the night and go ashore in the morning when the winds are light. Let’s launch Big Dink. We can explore the cove, and it's protected enough that we can tow her when we head over to town tomorrow.”

They had taken a spin around the cove and returned to Lone Eagle to spend a lazy afternoon. He was watching the battery meter constantly to check their amp consumption – too high, he thought. He hoisted the AquaAir 100 wind generator off the deck and up into the rigging. She was putting out a steady two amps – not enough, he thought to keep up with the 6-7 amps the fridge was drawing. He knew that when they got to Mexico, the priority would be additional battery storage and more power generation – they just had to keep running the engine too long to charge up the batts, and he knew that running an engine in neutral for so many hours wasn’t good for it. He pulled out the West Marine catalog and started looking at the prices for alternators, solar panels, and wind generators. Ka-ching, he thought.

The VHF radio crackled to life. “Lone Eagle, this is Tonka do you copy?”

He keyed the mic, “Tonka, this is Lone Eagle; how are you, Dick?”

“We’re great, but I’m having a bit of trouble finding those sticks. Are you guys in the cove?”

“Affirmative Dick; if you take up a heading of 270 off the town dock, you should spot them. There is a good eight feet of water all the way through.”

“Roger that Lone Eagle.”

“Tonka, clear.”

He took Big Dink over to Tonka to find out the latest back at Cayo Paraiso. Dick told him that the Defense Force had interviewed each of the cruisers and that several had told the same story about the strange two guys on the other raft.

“Rob, they told us all that we all had to leave, so the rest of the boats are on their way here. I expect most will anchor off the town.”

“Dick, did they let Miguel and Pedro go?”

“No, the patrol boat left with them onboard.”

“Not good,” he replied.

He headed back to Lone Eagle and shared what he had heard from Dick. Gillian looked devastated.

“Isn’t there anything we can do?” she asked.

“Not much, I’m afraid. Dick said that all of the cruisers described the strangers you saw to the Defense Force guys, and all said that Miguel and Pedro weren’t the ones that stole the RIB.”

“But they didn’t let them go. They have wives and families, and all they will know is that their husbands have disappeared,” she said, the anguish in her voice palpable.

“I wish we could do something, but we don’t even know which town they live in, much less who their families are?”

The next morning they pulled the pick and motored back through the stick-lined channel and dropped anchor just off the town dock at Puerto Esperanza. As soon as they had the pick down, they saw a guy in uniform walk down the pier and climb into a panga (the Cuban equivalent of a skiff), and watched him as he motored out to Lone Eagle.

He turned over the ‘armamentos,’ and the Port Captain signed his cruising permit and a receipt for the ‘toys.’

“Welcome to Puerto Esperanza,” he said as he climbed over the rail and started up the panga’s outboard motor.

“Well, let’s go see if we can find Sandra, the unofficial port captain that we keep hearing about,” he said as he grabbed his rucksack and climbed into Big Dink.

The cruising guide and the other cruisers had told them about Sandra. She was a friend of the yachties and would meet them at the dock, show them around town, help them with anything they needed, and earn hard currency by serving them dinner at her house. Sure enough, there was a woman in a long white dress waving to them as they motored Big Dink into the town dock.

“Buenos Dias, Sandra,” Gillian yelled as they came alongside the dock. “We’ve heard so much about you.”

Sandra took Gillian’s arm, and off they went, with him barely keeping up. “What do you need for your yacht?” Sandra asked.

Gillian replied that some fresh vegetables as she explained that the stuff they had bought in Havana had gone off days ago. Sandra marched them through the little town, and as they turned the next corner, they met up with Dick and Aileen from Tonka. They, too, were on the quest for fresh vegetables and joined them with Sandra in the lead.

Sandra took them into a little wooden hut with a tin roof that had rows of wooden bins. Most were empty. There were two that contained half a dozen almost rotten potatoes and onions. They bought two of each just to be polite; so did Dick and Aileen.

Sandra herded them onto the street and took up the lead as they weaved their way through the little children that had gathered to ask this new bunch of gringos for candy. They had walked blocks but finally made it to Sandra’s house, where she introduced them to her 10-year-old son Marcus, 7-year-old son Juan and her very pregnant 19-year-old daughter Imelda.

Shortly after their arrival, Julio, Sandra’s husband, came home with a string of six big groupers. Sandra beamed with pride at Julio and immediately began preparing them for dinner. She explained that many cruisers had come through Puerto Esperanza over the years. Sandra stopped her dinner preparations and ushered them all into her modest living room. The walls were covered in what appeared to be graffiti – but was actually writing from cruisers – she had all of them sign her wall and handed them a marker so that they could do likewise. There were hundreds of signatures and messages from yachts of every flag spanning more than ten years.

Before long, Sandra had everyone seated for dinner. She regaled everyone with her tales of the many yachtsmen that passed through over the years. Amazing, he thought, what an enterprising woman. When dinner was over Gillian, Aileen and Sandra chatted over the dishes while Julio rolled cigars for them both. Julio explained that he was working on an addition to the house to be a nursery for Imelda’s new baby, and then asked if they needed anything for their yachts?

“I could use some gas for my outboard motor,” he said.

Julio told him to meet him at the town dock at eight tomorrow morning, and he would take his tank somewhere where he knew he could get gas. They all said good night to Sandra and Julio and made their donations to their hard currency fund and left with smiles and waves.

The next morning Dick picked him up and ran him into the town dock to meet Julio at eight. They arrived at the pier and found Julio’s seven-year-old son, Juan, sitting on the beach rubbing something on a rock that he had in his lap. They greeted the boy and asked what he was working on. Juan showed them the fish hook that he was trying to sharpen – there wasn’t much left of it. He and Dave nodded to one another just as Julio showed up with a donkey in tow.

“Buenos Dias, Julio,” he shouted as he climbed onto the public dock with the gas tank in hand. He tried to give Julio money, but he refused, telling him he would collect whatever it cost later when he returned.

Julio told him to meet him back at the dock at five and said he would have the gas by then. He and Dave watched as Julio strapped the gas tank to the donkey’s back and trudged up the dirt road in a cloud of dust until he was out of sight.

“Ten bucks, says you’ll never see that tank again,” said Dick.

“I’ll take that bet, can you take me back to Lone Eagle? I want to get a new fish hook for Juan.”

“No problem,” Dick replied with a big smile.

They motored back to Lone Eagle, and he went into his tackle box and came up with three new hooks about the same size as the one that Juan was filing on the rock. They motored back into shore, and he gave the new hooks to Juan. Juan lit up like a Christmas tree and spoke so fast that neither he nor Dick could understand a word he was saying, but his smile was unmistakable. Juan grabbed his cane pole and ran into town – probably to show his friends his new fish hooks.

Dick dropped him back at Lone Eagle.

“Dick, why don’t you drop by for a beer at around 1630, and we’ll see if you can collect on that bet of ours,” he said as Dick shoved off from Lone Eagle.

“I’ll see you then,” he replied as he pointed his dink toward Tonka and started the engine.

He and Gillian spent the afternoon reading in the cockpit, and then she disappeared below and started tearing the forepeak lockers apart. “Hey,” he exclaimed, “what are you doing down there?”

A muffled, “I’m on a mission,” was all he heard.

Dick showed up at 1630, and they cracked open a couple of beers. They talked about his amp consumption problem, and they discussed the options – more batteries, solar panels, and a new wind generator where all discussed and all involved big bucks. It was 1700, and Dave piped up, “I think you’ve lost that bet, my friend.”

“Let’s give it a while longer,” he replied as he reached for the binoculars. He looked at the road Julio had taken that lead straight up-hill into the mountains and adjusted the focus. “I see a cloud of dust coming down the road.”

“Probably a truck,” Dave replied.

“Don’t think so,” he countered – “Too slow for a truck.”

By 1730 Julio could clearly be seen in the binoculars with the donkey in tow and the gas tank strapped to its back. “I guess you win, Rob. I thought he was gone with your tank,” Dave sheepishly conceded.

“Dave lets head in, and I’ll grab a cold one for Julio – it looks like he might need one.”

They motored into the town dock in Dave’s dink and met Julio. He looked exhausted and was covered in dust, sweat, and dust that had turned to mud. They gave him the cold beer, which he downed in one slow, long drink.

“I got your petrol, Rob,” Julio stammered as he unlashed the tank from the donkey’s back. “It’s good fuel,” he said.

“How much do I owe you?”

“Fifteen dollars,” Julio replied.

He gave him twenty dollars, but he would only take the fifteen dollars.

He lugged the tank aboard Lone Eagle and thanked Dick for ferrying him to shore. “No problem. See you tomorrow,” he said as he headed for Tonka.

Gillian came up from below covered in sweat. “Did you get the gas?” she asked.

“Sure did. Julio would only take what it cost him. He must have walked for hours.”

“Rob, can you take me ashore in the morning? I’ve got something to give to Sandra.”

“OK, but I suspect the something has something to do with what you’ve been digging around for in the forepeak.”

“It does,” she replied. “Sandra asked if we had any old linens or towels, and I was able to find some old ones that we won’t need, including a couple of sheets that Lesley left behind.”

“OK, but let’s get an early start. It looks like the weather will be right for our next run, and I’d like to be out of here before lunch.”

They awoke to banging on Lone Eagle’s hull. Hell, it was barely sun up. “Who could that be?” he exclaimed as he pulled on his shorts and climbed up the companionway stairs. There was little Juan with a big smile on his face and a line holding his catch of the morning. “Buenos Dias, Juan. Como Estas?” he asked.

“Muy Bueno,” Juan politely responded and handed him his catch o’ the day. He invited Juan aboard, and Gillian made toast with honey for both of them. Juan sheepishly took a bite of the toast and then lit up like a kid in a candy store – he’d never tasted honey before.

The three of them climbed into Big Dink with Juan’s little dugout canoe in tow. They walked through town together. Gillian had a bulging rucksack on her back. They arrived at Sandra’s place, and he spotted Julio working on the new addition for Imelda and her baby. Gillian was greeted at the door by Sandra, and he went over to see Julio hunched over an old brace and bit drill, trying to drill a hole in a piece of wood with a drill bit that had seen better days. He told Julio he had to run but would be back in a little while.

He took off for the dock at a sprint and made it back to Lone Eagle and started going through his collection of drill bits. He picked out four new titanium bits of different sizes, stuffed them in his pocket, and fired up Big Dink’s outboard for the run back to the town dock. He made it back to Sandra’s, covered in sweat and knelt beside Julio and opened his hand to reveal the four titanium drill bits. Julio just stared at them, and then with tears in his eyes, he said, “Mochas gracias mi amigo.”

Just then, Gillian appeared at the door with Sandra. “Where have you been?” she asked.

He smiled and said, “I’ve been on a mission too, how was yours?”

“Success, and yours?”

He nodded and held her hand as they waved goodbye to Sandra and Julio and walked through town toward the dinghy dock.

The people of Cuba had touched their hearts, and they knew they had touched theirs. If only the politicians could get it right, he thought as they motored out to Lone Eagle.





CHAPTER XXX April 2, 2002 - Points West



Cayo Le Lena, Cuba

Lat: 21° 51’ 47.00” N, Long: 084° 57’ 03.00” W

The fringing reef that protects the northwestern Cuban coast was a challenge for the run westward owing to the mazes created by the reefs. Some parts were dead ends, and you couldn’t find a way through. For those, you had to go out through one of the passes into open water. Other parts, you could carefully and slowly pick your way through the shallow – skinny water as it was called by the yachties, but it was slow and nerve-wracking. Each day they sailed further westward.

Even though it was early April, the northern cold fronts continued to march their way across the Gulf of Mexico. The winds would clock from east to north to northwest as each of the fronts passed. As they did, they found islands where they could anchor under the for protection from the northwest winds that frequently reached 40+ knots during the passage of the front.

They stopped at places like Cayo Rapido Grande, Ensenada de Anita, Cayo Montano. All were uninhabited little islands. Some had beautiful beaches with swaying palms, others were covered in mangroves. All provided shelter from the procession of the relentless fronts. Their goal was to get to Cayo Le Lena – a large mangrove-covered island with a deep channel down the middle of it. It was reported to have good shelter, but more importantly, it was the jumping-off point for the Yucatan Channel and the run across to Mexico.

“Lone Eagle, Tonka, I think I can see the entrance to Cayo Le Lena.”

“That’s great, Dick. How much water have you got?”

“Six under the keel,” came the reply. “And Rob, I see Margarita up ahead, and it looks like Allen’s got a big one on.”

He grabbed the binoculars, and sure enough, Allen did have a big one on. It was a big tarpon, and it was tail-walking off Margarita’s bow with Allen holding on for dear life.

As he positioned Lone Eagle for anchoring, Allen yelled, “Hey Rob, I’ve had this big boy on the line for thirty minutes. The place is full of them.”

“Looks like fun Allen, as soon as I get the pick down, I’ll join you,” he replied as he went forward to let drop the anchor.

The pick was in, and he gave Gillian the hand signal to rev her up in reverse to make sure it was. “Welcome to Cayo Le Lena, our last stop in Cuba,” he said as he climbed back into the cockpit.

“Not much to look at,” she replied, “But it does give us a lot of protection, and it looks like you’ll have some fun fishing.”

“Lone Eagle, Margarita, do you copy?”

Gillian picked up the VHF mic. “Hi Lindsay, how have you been?”

“We’ve been great, Gillian. Would you guys like to come over for dinner? Dick and Aileen are coming too.”

“Sure. We’d love to,” Gillian replied. “Hey Rob, I’m going to see if I can tune into the New Orleans 1300 forecast.”

“Thanks, baby. I’m hoping we get a weather window in the next couple of days,” as he went below to get his fishing rod.

Three fish make up the top of the list for Caribbean sport fishing – Tarpon, Permit, and Bonefish. None were edible, but all put up the fight of a lifetime, and anglers paid big bucks to hunt them. Tarpon could get big, and little had changed them since prehistoric times. Their scales were like shiny, silver disks the size of a coffee cup and formed an outer armor that even gators didn’t like.

He was using a 40-pound test line and a silver spoon, and it no sooner hit the water when he hooked up. “Gillian, I’ve got one,” he yelled as she came up on deck to watch the show.

“My God!” she exclaimed, “He’s huge. Dick still has his on, and it looks like Allen’s going to throw his line in the water.”

The fight this fish was putting up was incredible. This monster would dive and strip the line off the reel and then he’d rocket through the surface and dance on his tail. It had been forty minutes since he hooked up, and his arms felt like lead, and his T-shirt was dripping.

“Dick has got another one,” she exclaimed.

He looked over, and sure enough, Dick was struggling to hold onto him. Amazing, he thought, here we are in the middle of nowhere; three boats, three guys, and all three hooked up with record-setting tarpon, all at the same time. Allen was the first to lose his when it leaped out of the water, shook its head and threw the hook. His soon followed suit, and Dick’s line broke a few minutes later. “That was fun,” he said as he plunked down exhausted in the cockpit. “Were you able to get the forecast from the New Orleans station?”

“Yeah, and you are not going to like it. The fronts are stacking up, so we could be here for a few days.”

He looked over the printouts from the weather fax, and sure enough, it didn’t look good. “Well, let’s launch Big Dink so we can get over to Margarita for dinner. Maybe tomorrow, we can do some exploring.”

The next morning he took Big Dink and went exploring. He headed westward down the channel and found an opening to the north. He had his rod and tackle box and was looking for a place to catch some mangrove snappers for dinner. He took the little channel through the mangroves. It got narrow – very narrow, and he was concerned about getting a puncture in the inflatable. That would be a lot of fun he thought being miles from anyone, and he hadn’t brought the hand-held VHF. Just then he saw the channel widen a bit and he followed it. Wow, it opens into a huge lake. It had to be hundreds of acres. It was shallow but flat calm and had more than enough water for the outboard motor.

He made a few casts with his rod along the edges near the mangroves. Nothing. Oh well, it’s still a great spot. That afternoon he told Gillian, “Let’s go for a ride and grab that bottle of wine we’ve been saving and a couple of glasses.” The water was flat, and he brought Big Dink to full throttle, and they rocketed down the canal to the little channel he had found earlier in the day. He motored slowly down the channel, and Gillian became a bit anxious.

“Where are we going? These mangroves are getting a bit close.”

“Hang on, we’ll be there in a minute,” he replied.

Within minutes they were at the edge of the immense lake, and he went to full throttle and headed for the middle of it. When he got there, he hit the kill switch, and they glided to a stop in the flat water. “Welcome to Gillian’s Lake,” he proudly announced as he popped the cork and poured her a glass.

“It gorgeous,” she said; “there isn’t a soul here.” They laid there in Big Dink soaking up the sun, sipping their glasses of red and talking.

“I don’t think we can make the Pacific this year,” he said. “It’s April, and we’re already four months into the season, and we’re at least a month from Panama.”

“OK, so what’s our plan from here? Should we go to the Rio Dulce, like the rest of the boats, and then head for Panama in January?”

“Well, the New South Wales Bar has given me until January to take that last exam, and I really don’t want to try and petition them for an extension. If we lay up Lone Eagle in the Rio and then fly to Australia, I can take the class, hopefully, pass the test and swear-in at the Supreme Court during the first week of December. I’ve checked the class schedule and the swear-in dates. It will work if we head for Oz in September. We can have Christmas with mom and the family and be back to the Rio to pick up Lone Eagle and head for the Canal in January.”

They spent the afternoon floating around ‘Gillian’s Lake’ and talked about the logistics of postponing the Pacific run. He wasn’t happy about it, but he knew it was a prudent decision. You had to be out of the Pacific, or be, as far south as Brisbane to avoid cyclone season by the first of December.

The sun was setting as they pulled alongside Lone Eagle. He tied up Big Dink, and Gillian went below to check the weather fax printout. “Hey, they’ve updated the forecast. I think we’ve got our weather window,” she said as she handed him the printout.

“Looks good baby; the next front isn’t due for at least two more days, and the wind arrows are showing us having 10-15 knots out of the east. We need to break-down and stow Big Dink if we’re going to head out tomorrow.”

He picked up the VHF mic and radioed Tonka. Dick had seen the same report, and they were going too.

They finished organizing Lone Eagle for the Yucatan Channel run in the morning. He had already loaded the waypoints in the chart plotter. They would leave at noon and should arrive the next day at about the same time. Gillian had turned in early, and he sat in the cockpit, thinking about the decision they had made to postpone the Pacific run. Another year and a lot more money, but it had to be done. He blew out the last oil lamp and crawled into the bunk beside her. His head was processing so much of the Oz trip logistics that sleep didn’t come easy.





CHAPTER XXXI April 16, 2002 – False Start



The Yucatan Channel

Lat: 21° 54’ 21.86” N, Long: 084° 41’ 10.45” W

It was barely first light; Gillian was sound asleep, and he was wide awake. All blue water passages were challenges, but he knew this one could be more than most. The Yucatan Channel was the gap between the western tip of Cuba and Mexico. It was a major shipping route, and the Gulf Stream ripped through at better than four knots along the edge of Mexico’s continental shelf that dropped off into thousands of feet of water. Add a northerly and he knew the seas would go vertical and breaking. Don’t want to be there if that happens, he thought.

He quietly slipped out of the bunk and lit the kerosene stove to make the first of what he knew would be many cups of coffee. He grabbed the kettle just before its whistle blew and grabbed a mug full, and headed for the cockpit with the cruising guide for Mexico under his arm.

He watched the sun as it slowly began to rise, all the while, with his eye lining up on the clouds as they passed across the top of the mast to see what the winds aloft might be doing. He sipped his coffee and thought about the decision they had made the day before to head for the Rio Dulce in Guatemala. It was mid-April, and the northern hemisphere hurricane season would start June first. Let’s enjoy Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala for a few months, and if one of those tropical waves developed into a hurricane, we can duck into the Rio for shelter.

He fired up the chart plotter and looked over the electronic chart of the Yucatan Channel. The Gulf Stream ought to be the strongest here as put his finger on the screen. Right here at the edge of the Mexican continental shelf, he thought. That’s going to be four knots on the beam or worse, on the nose. He knew it was going to be a twenty-four-hour run, no matter how good the wind was.

He opened the Mexican cruising guide and turned to the dog-eared page for Isla Mujeres – the Island of Women. It was an island just off the Mexican coast, and a short hop by ferries that the guide said ran to Cozumel and Cancun. Nice harbor and easy entry, but the holding in the anchorage was reportedly not very good. That means more scope on the anchor chain, activate the GPS anchor drag alarm when you go to bed and if it blows we stand an anchor watch, he thought as he closed the guide and was about to head below to refill his coffee.

“Morning Cap,” she said as he climbed up the companionway stair.

“Hi baby, how did you sleep?”

“Like a log, and you?”

“Not great,” he replied and added, “But I think we’ll have a good day for the run.”

They were underway with Tonka by twelve and made their first waypoint turn around Cabo San Antonio. Seas were lumpy, and the wind was ten knots out of the east. He headed below, to run his routine fifteen-minute engine room checks, and raised the hatch to the engine room and focused the beam of his Maglite on all the key components. When he reached the shaft seal, he saw that there was water cascading down the port side of the hull. Oh shit, he thought.

“Baby, throttle back to idle and call Tonka and tell Dick we’ve got a problem and to stand by on Channel 16.” He was able to isolate the problem with the Maglite, but getting at it was going to be a big problem.

“Rob, I’ve got Dick. He’s standing by. What’s wrong?” she asked with a fair bit of trepidation in her voice.

“Port cockpit drain hose is leaking big time at the thru-hull fitting. I’m going to have to pull all the gear out of the port-side cockpit locker and see if I can get the hose off and shove a bung (wooden plug) into it to stop the leak. The words no sooner left his lips when the bilge pump alarms started going off. Move fast, he thought. “Gillian, tell Dick we are attempting repairs and ask him to please stand by – and Gillian, I need you to pull the cockpit cushions out of the way so I can get into the port cockpit hatch,” as he shifted his gaze to the leak – the big leak.

Think through it – he thought. A lot of gear to move, and what tools and spares do you need? The list of shit he had to move and where he was going to put it ran through his mind while he glanced at the GPS and marked their current position on the paper chart.

First – move all the gear, he thought as he yanked open the port cockpit locker hatch. A Honda 1kW generator, the duffle bag full of a ton of Big Dink stuff and, of course, the Paratech Sea Anchor, 300’of line, and a mountain of dock lines.

“Gillian, go below. I’ve got a lot of stuff I’ll be handing to you. I’ll help with the big stuff,” he grunted as he lifted the Honda generator out of the locker.

The bilge pump alarms kept ringing, the sound seeming to get louder as he handed arm-loads of gear to her between looking down into the bilge to see if the bilge pumps were keeping up with the in-flow. He did it in under five minutes but was exhausted before he even got to the problem.

“Gillian, go topside and watch our course, while I get what I need to fix our problem,” he said with a staged grin on his face. Shit, the things I do for morale, he thought.

He watched the hose fitting connection to the thru-hull fitting. He couldn’t tell whether it was a leak in the hose or the thru-hull fitting.

“Gillian, I’ve got to get in there and see how bad it is.”

“How are you going to get all the way down there to work on it?”

“I’m afraid head first," he replied as he lowered his mesh bag of parts and tools into the hole and slid in head-first.

It was hot – his first and continuing impression. The engine had been running for better than an hour. He reached the cockpit drain thru-hull fitting – the water was coming out of the fitting – fast – almost as fast as the sweat pouring into his eyes and blurring his vision.

“Gillian,” he yelled from below, “Flip her over onto the other tack and tell Dick we’ll be altering course. Ask him if he’d like to join us?”

He undid the hose clamp and yanked with all the might with his free arm to pull it off the thru-hull fitting barb as soon as he felt Lone Eagle heal over on the new tack. Shit, the barb on the Delron thru-hull fitting was cracked. He grabbed the bung that Gus had tied to the thru-hull fitting. It fit. Thanks, Gus, he thought as he took a good whack at it with the rubber mallet to make sure it didn’t come loose.

“Gillian, tell Dave we will be flipping back over to our original tack,” his yell muffled from below.

As Lone Eagle healed over to the new tack, so did his stomach. The heat, diesel fumes, and being head-first upside down wasn’t a good combination. As the boat and his stomach settled on the new tack, he saw that even now, submerged, there was no water coming in. Good, but you’ve got to head back, he thought as he pushed himself upward as if doing a vertical handstand.

He propped himself up in the cockpit, exhausted, gasping for air after extricating himself from the hatch. As soon as his vision and senses cleared, he leaned over to the chart plotter while grabbing for the VHF mic.

“Tonka, Lone Eagle, do you copy?”

“Rob, are you guys okay?” Dick asked with obvious concern in his voice.

“Dick, I’ve got a crack in the barb to a cockpit drain thru-hull fitting. I’ve got a bung in it and its holding, but I need to abort and head back to Cayo Le Lena to make repairs.”

“Copy that, we’ll abort too and follow you back and give you a hand with repairs.”

“Thanks, Dick, but we’ll be alright – the bung is holding. You guys keep going.”

“Negative, Lone Eagle,” came the reply, “You guys need a hand, and the latest weather looks better for tomorrow.”

“Tonka, I’m sure we’ll have a few cold ones when we’re done,” he replied and added, “Lone Eagle coming to course zero nine zero,” as he swung the tiller and Gillian readied herself at the Genny winches.

“Well, baby, we’re going to have one more night in Cuba.”





CHAPTER XXXII April 16, 2002 - The Yucatan Channel



The Yucatan Channel

Lat: 21° 54’ 21.86” N, Long: 084° 41’ 10.45” W

They rafted up with Tonka in Cayo Le Lena and were able to make the repair to the thru-hull fitting quickly using Marine-Tex epoxy. The repacking of the cockpit locker took longer than the repair itself. By the time all of the gear was stowed, and they had their sun showers, it was time for dinner. Aileen had cooked a great dinner, and they talked about Isla Mujeres and the fun they would have in Mexico.

“Rob, here is the latest forecast. It looks like we’ll have ten knots out of the east. I think it’s going to be a slower run than we were hoping for.”

He looked at the printout and said, “I think we need to move up our departure for ten.”

They all turned in early. It had been a long day, and he was exhausted. Let’s hope we don’t have any more surprises, he thought as he drifted off to sleep.

Tonka and Lone Eagle were underway out of Cayo Le Lena at 0930, each taking up westward headings. He was hoping for a bit more wind, but Monitor was doing the job in the ten knots of breeze they had. They cleared the Cuban continental shelf an hour later, and the depth meter began to flash. He looked at the paper chart and saw they had two miles of water between them and the bottom – incredible, he thought – the wall.

He went below and grabbed his fishing rod – the Tuna Stick it was called and his tackle box and handed them up to Gillian. He marked their position on the chart and checked the cockpit drain fitting – it was holding just fine. They were motor sailing at about five knots, and he let out his line and watched the bright pink lure dancing on the surface in their wake. The water was a cobalt blue, and the sun’s rays could be seen penetrating hundreds of feet down.

He and Dick spotted several freighters transiting along the north/south run, but there were at least ten miles ahead and didn’t require any course changes. The wind had slowly built all morning, and by two in the afternoon, it was holding at fifteen knots. Lone Eagle was healed perfectly and powering ahead. Good, he thought. It makes for a more comfortable ride when the seas are this lumpy when you’ve got a bit of speed. They were well into the Yucatan Channel but the effects of the northward push of the Gulf Stream had yet to show up. He looked at the chart plotter and knew that they would probably be feeling its effects by the early morning watch.

Gillian was down below on the radio to Aileen trading recipes when he heard the snap of the quick release pin and then the screech of the line being stripped off his reel.

“Fish!” he yelled as he grabbed the rod.

The drag on the line was pretty tight, and this guy was stripping the line off the reel. He kept the rod tip up and within moments, the reel fell quiet. He started to reel and pulled back on the rod just as the reel began to scream again as whatever was on the end of it took a deep dive. Within minutes he was able to pump the rod and reel in a few feet at a time. He was coming up.

He had himself brace against the stern pulpit and had a line on the rod just in case it was yanked out of his hand and went over the side.

“What can I do?” she asked.

“Start the engine and put it in reverse at low speed,” he was able to grunt, just as the line went taught, and what was at the end of the line leaped clear of the water. It was a big bull-nose dolphin – mahi-mahi.

“Look at his color,” she exclaimed. She had never seen one before.

“There’s dinner, baby!”

He had him on for thirty minutes, and his arms felt like lead, and his shirt was dripping. He got him in close enough to grab the stainless steel wire leader in his left hand and the gaff hook in his right. A bit closer, he thought. This guy still had a lot of fight in him, and the wire around his gloved hand was pulling tighter and tighter. Just then, the fish rolled on its side and the gaff was under him.

“Now,” he grunted as he jerked upward and buried the gaff hook into him just behind the gills. “Got him!” He lifted him into the air and thrust his free hand into his gills and hung on as the thrashing increased and then subsided.

His arms were covered in blood, and he was exhausted. He dragged the fish onto the starboard deck and put his rod back in the rod holder.

“Look at his color. He looks like a green rainbow.”

“Not for long baby. They lose their color and go a flat silver when they die,” he explained as they both watched the color fade.

Gillian handed him a bucket and his filet knife.

“You’re not cleaning him in the cockpit, are you?”

“No, he’s too big. I’m going to drag him up on the foredeck and filet him there,” he said as he hooked his harness into the jack line and started dragging the fish up on the foredeck.

The filet knife was brand new, and its edge cleanly sliced the dolphin’s flesh into two huge filets that were three feet long and at least three inches thick on the big ends. He cut the filets into meal-size portions and washed them, himself, and the deck off with bucket after bucket of seawater. He threw the carcass over the side and watched it spiral down into the depths – shark food he thought as he dragged the bucket full of filets back to the cockpit.

“Here you go, Gillian. We’ll have plenty to share with Dick and Aileen when we get in tomorrow.”

He got the sun shower ready while she packed the fillets in Ziplocs.

“Fridge is full,” she said as she handed up their shower kits. The warm water felt great on his aching muscles. They showered off and changed into clean clothes. She was busy in the galley, while he fired up the Force 10 barbeque. The fresh grilled mahi-mahi was out of this world. What a fantastic fish, he thought.

“I hope we catch a lot more of those,” he said as they watched the sun melt into the Gulf.

“Lone Eagle, Tonka, I’ve got a radar target at fifteen miles that we need to keep an eye on.”

“Roger. Switching to active now. Do you want to see if you can raise him on the radio and see if he has us on his radar?”

“Roger will do.”

He watched as the blip got brighter and closer. It took Dick three tries, but finally, a Spanish speaking voice acknowledged and confirmed that he had them both on radar and that their speed was 23 knots.

Gillian was looking through the binoculars. “Got him,” she said and then added, “He’s a big tanker and is really moving. It looks like he’ll pass ahead of us.”

He was watching the radar closely.

“I figure we will close to within two miles of him when he crosses our bow.”

They watched as the massive supertanker passed ahead of them.

“He’s huge,” she said.

“We may see a few more tonight. We need to do radar sweeps every ten minutes.” He keyed the mic, “Tonka, Lone Eagle, do you copy Dick?”

“Copy Rob,” came the reply, “How was dinner?” he added.

“Great, Dick. I was wondering – are you taking the first or second watch tonight?”

“Second watch.”

“Thanks, Dick,” he replied. “I’m turning in now and will take 12- 4. Thank Aileen for keeping Gillian company.”

“Will do, Rob. Night-night.”

He handed Gillian the water bottles and the snack bag and plotted their current 2000 position on the chart. Still no Gulf Stream current, he thought as he turned out the light and crawled over the lee cloth into the sea bunk. The seas were lumpy, and it took a while for him to get to sleep. He was dozing when he heard Dick raise Gillian on the radio. He had a target, but he heard Dick say that it would pass well behind them. He rolled over and went back to sleep.

“Rob, wake up, it’s your watch,” she whispered down the companionway hatch. He managed an okay as he shook the sleep from him. Wow, he thought, midnight already.

“Any radar targets?”

“Nothing at the moment, but we had one earlier,” she explained.

He got his windbreaker and marked their 2400 position on the chart. He had set a course fifteen degrees south of his rhumb line in anticipation of the northward push from the Gulf Stream. He drew a line between their 2000 and 2400 positions and saw that they were starting to feel the northward set of the Gulf Stream. There it is, he thought. We’ve got 65 miles to go. At this rate, we ought to be right on our rhumb line when we cross the wall.

He was two hours into his watch when a radar target appeared off their stern at 25 miles. He shifted his gaze in its direction and saw a strange glow on the horizon. Couldn’t be the moon. They had seen it set earlier. Fire onboard a ship – possibly he thought, but not likely. He watched the radar, and the blip was on the same heading he was on and gaining. He figured it was moving at 18-20 knots. He kept watching the radar and the horizon – the glow was getting much brighter.

“Tonka, Lone Eagle, good morning Aileen.”

“Morning Rob,” came Aileen’s reply.

“Aileen, I’ve got a target aft of us on the same heading we’re on and closing. As soon as I get a visual on him, I’m going to try and raise him on the radio.”

“Roger Rob. I’ll stand by. Should I wake Dick?” she asked.

“Not yet, Aileen. Let the boy sleep until we figure out what it is and whether it sees us,” he replied.

The target was now 10 miles aft of them and closing. The glow on the horizon was still getting brighter, almost like moments just before sunrise. He focused the binoculars on the brightest spot and watched. It looked like the sun coming up. Shit, it’s a cruise ship all lit up like a Christmas tree. It must have every light aboard on, he thought.

He keyed the mic, “Cruise ship, cruise ship at latitude 21 degrees 17 minutes west 86 degrees 29 minutes north on a heading of 270 degrees this is the sailing vessel Lone Eagle 10 miles ahead of you on a heading of 270 degrees do you copy?”

“Lone Eagle, this is Pacific Princess we have you and another vessel to your starboard on radar. If you maintain your current heading, we will pass to your starboard.”

“Pacific Princess; Lone Eagle, acknowledged. The vessel to my starboard is the sailing vessel Tonka. We will both maintain our current headings.”

“Tonka, Lone Eagle, did you copy that traffic?”

“Roger that Lone Eagle.”

He watched as Pacific Princess grew larger and brighter. It was a floating city. They were on a heading that would take them to Cozumel or Cancun. He watched as she slowly disappeared below the horizon to the west.

It was coming up on 0400.

“Hey baby, it’s your watch,” he whispered down the companionway hatch.

She stirred and said, “I’m coming.”

He turned in but didn’t sleep. It was starting to get light, and his last position fix had them coming up on the continental shelf of Mexico – the wall. He was awake as the rolling became much more noticeable – the wind was dying. He rolled out of the bunk and climbed into the cockpit and watched the sunrise with her.

“Rob, I’m going to get some sleep if you’re not going to,” she said as she made her way down the companionway stairs.

The chart plotter showed them coming up on the edge of the wall just as the depth sounder found the bottom at 600 feet. The sun was up, and he could make out several sportfishing boats working the wall. Let’s throw a line in the water and see how we do this morning, he thought as he released the brake on the reel and watched his lucky pink lure skip across the surface.

He had no sooner settled himself in with his coffee and the Mexican cruising guide when he heard the snap of the quick release pin and heard the screeching of the reel. He jumped into the stern pulpit and braced himself while yelling, “Fish.”

He heard an audible “Shit” from down below as his pole bent and the reel screamed as the line was stripping away. The fight was merciless. He’d reel in ten feet, and the fish would strip off twenty. Gillian had the engine going in reverse, so they were sort of stopped, but what he really needed was the ability to back down on the fish like you could on a sportfishing boat – no luck, he thought – not under full sail.

He had whatever it was on for 40 minutes, but it never surfaced. I wonder if it’s a shark, he thought. He was exhausted, and whatever it was on the other end of the line seemed to be getting stronger. Finally, he was reeling in more than the fish was stripping off. He was getting him closer to the boat, and as he did, he caught a glimpse of a shimmer of blue. Tuna or wahoo, he thought as he kept the rod tip up and reeled in as fast as he could. He was gaining on him.

“Tuna – yellowfin,” he yelled as he grabbed the wire trace. The tuna broke the surface right under him, and he lunged the gaff hook in as deep as he could and lifted with all his might. Gillian took his rod while he thrust his hand into its gills. Blood was splattering everywhere. The stern of the boat and the cockpit were covered in it. It looked like a murder scene, but he managed to subdue him after a few whacks with the winch handle.

“Thanks for letting me get some sleep,” she said as she handed him a large garbage bag and his filet knife from below.

“Lone Eagle, Tonka, it looks like you’ve had your exercise this morning.”

“Yeah, Dick,” he replied and then added, “I’m exhausted, but you now have your choice of mahi-mahi or tuna for dinner?”

“Sounds great. I can see Isla Mujeres up ahead – we ought to be in by lunchtime.”

They rounded the northern tip of Isla and followed the channel which took them right along the beach. Lots of resorts and lots of skimpy bikinis were what he could make out through the binoculars.

“Hey Gillian, welcome to the Island of Women,” he yelled down to her as she rolled over and wiped the sleep from her eyes.

They motored to the west side of the island and entered the protected harbor. Lots of boats – must be thirty, he thought. They had the pick down in minutes, a short distance from Tonka. Gillian brought up two big bloody marys, and they toasted and high fived.





CHAPTER XXXIII April 17, 2002 - The Island of Women



Isla Mujeres, Mexico

Lat: 21° 15’ 00.45” N, Long: 086° 44’ 48.30” W

Allen and Lindsay on Margarita had arrived a couple of days earlier, and Allen explained the ins and outs of clearing in and told them about the morning Isla cruiser’s radio net that came on the air at 0800.

“Gillian, are you ready to give me a hand with Big Dink?”

“Sure,” she replied in a cloud of flour, as she kneaded the dough for her new bread recipe she had gotten from Aileen on the way over.

Big Dink was ready in a matter of minutes, and the quarantine flag was up. He pulled out the ship's papers, the passports, the crew list, and the list of ‘armamentos’ all dutifully typed in Spanish. He was glad they had bought the little Canon bubble jet printer. It was coming in handy.

He headed Big Dink into the dinghy dock that Allen had pointed out to him. The harbor was full of cruisers. He made it to the rickety dinghy dock that had more than twenty inflatable dinghies attached to it. He squeezed his way in and was able to run the locking cable through a gap in the dock planks.

It was hot, and it was dusty in downtown Isla Mujeres as he made his way through the market stalls to the Puerto Captain’s Office. He greeted the man behind the old wooden desk in Spanish. The ceiling fan was slowly turning with little cooling effect other than to move the smoke that was drifting out of the overflowing ashtray.

“Señor, are your guns locked?” was the only question he was asked.

When he confirmed that they were, the Puerto Captain told him that the Guarda would be coming out to the boat to put a seal on the locker that would be removed when he checked out of Isla. The rest of check-in was as easy as Allen said it would be, and he was able to get fresh fruit, vegetables, and even freshly baked flour tortillas in the market before he headed back to Lone Eagle.

Gillian filled a bucket full of water and added a tablespoon of bleach to it and began the process of carefully washing – actually scrubbing all the fruit and vegetables. They didn’t want to catch a case of Montezuma’s Revenge.

He was below putting away the ship's papers when she said, “Looks like we are about to have company.”

He looked out through the porthole to see a Guarda panga – a big one with twin 200 hp outboards and eight guys in black Nomex with M-16s. They gotta be dying in this heat, he thought as he climbed past Gillian into the cockpit, and took their lines. The whole process took less than five minutes and went smoothly right up to the point where the Commandant asked how many ‘bombas’ he had aboard. His initial response was “No, no bombas” until Gillian shoved the Spanish dictionary under his nose, and he saw that ‘bombas’ meant pumps – bilge pumps. They completed their safety inventory, sealed the locker containing the ‘armamentos,’ and were on their way.

It was mid-April, the best season to be in the Caribbean in general and Mexico in particular. The days were marked by brilliant cloudless skies that lasted until the 1600 thunderstorms – you could almost set your watch by them. He knew that this weather pattern would last for about six more weeks before the start of hurricane season when the tropical waves from the east would start moving through. He knew that he had to use this time to solve his energy generation, storage, and consumption problems.

The next morning they finished breakfast, and he fired up the water-maker. It was laundry day, and he knew Gillian would be using bucket loads of it. He grabbed his rucksack and put in the West Marine Catalog and his notebook and headed for Big Dink.

“Time to spend some money,” he said as he started the engine and motored off to Margarita.

Allen took his painter as he pulled up to their swim platform. They spent hours making lists of all the products, pieces, and parts that they need to order. For him, it was four 32 watt flexible solar panels, a 120 amp Balmar alternator and external regulator, a big 8D battery box, and an AirMarine X Wind generator. Allen made a copy of the order form, and they both double-checked it. No fun, he thought if you were in the middle of an install and realized you were missing something.

They drafted the Yacht in Transit letters in Spanish and English that the Port Captain would need to sign. They would fax the English one to West Marine so that they didn’t have to pay any State-side sales tax and then take the Spanish version to the airport in Cancun so that they wouldn’t have to pay import duty when FedEx notified them that the order had arrived and was being held by Mexican Customs.

“Allen, do you think we’ll end up having to pay duty? That could be fifty percent of the value of the shipment, and the packing list will show we’ve got about four grand in gear.”

“That my friend,” he replied, “depends on who’s working in customs that day and whether we can make friends with him. I’ll take this stuff into town in the morning; get the Port Captain to sign, and then I’ll get it faxed to West Marine. The catalog says that international shipments to Mexico come in via Cancun – thank God it isn’t Mexico City – we’d never get the stuff. It would be ripped off within minutes.”

“Thanks, Allen. We just have to keep our fingers crossed that the Yacht in Transit letter works, otherwise I am looking at a couple of grand in duty.”

“Looks like that big thunderhead is heading our way,” Allen said as he climbed up on deck.

“Yeah, the rain curtain is about twenty minutes away, and then its anchor drag showtime.” He pulled the handheld VHF radio out of his rucksack. “Lone Eagle, Lone Eagle, this is Lone Eagle Mobile, do you copy?”

It took a couple of seconds, but Gillian picked up. “Lone Eagle Mobile, this is Lone Eagle,” she replied.

“Hi, baby. See that thunderstorm off to the southeast?”

“Roger that,” she replied.

“We figure it’s about twenty minutes out, so you better get the laundry in. I’ll be heading back in a minute.”

He made it back to Lone Eagle in time to help her with the last of the laundry. While she went below to stow it, he walked up onto the foredeck and checked the anchor snubber and looked out ahead of Lone Eagle at the dozens of boats in front of him. Shit, he thought, any one of them could drag anchor and be down on us in minutes – I don’t want a repeat performance of what happened in Key West.

Within minutes the sky darkened, and the rain curtain approached. The wind was gusting in the high twenties and he knew that it would soon gust to forty or more.

“Lone Eagle, Lone Eagle, Margarita, do you copy?”

“Roger, Allen looks like showtime is about to begin.”

Indeed it was. The rain curtain was upon them, and visibility went to hell. He stood in the companionway hatch behind the clear curtain, peering through it as best he could.

“Lone Eagle, Margarita, you’ve got one dragging to your starboard.”

“I see him, Allen, and it doesn’t look like there is anyone aboard – you up for saving her?”

“Roger, Lone Eagle. Come pick me up, and we’ll go get her.”

He grabbed his knife, the handheld VHF, and his dive mask. The rain was coming down so hard he was glad he had put the dive mask on before he jumped into Big Dink.

“Gillian,” he yelled above the wind, “Get on the net and tell anyone listening that the name of that boat that is dragging is Trinka and see if anyone can raise the owners? Tell them we will attempt to re-anchor her. And, Gillian, watch the boats in front of us. If you see one starting to drag down us, start the engine and raise me on the handheld.”

The chop kicked up by the wind made it almost impossible to keep Big Dink’s bow from going airborne. He managed to get her alongside Margarita, and Allen climbed in as he gunned the throttle, and they headed off to Trinka. She was dragging fast and was headed for a large sloop whose owner was on deck watching the impending collision. He hoped they would get to her in time before Trinka’s anchor fouled the sloop’s anchor. They got Big Dink alongside Trinka and tied on.

“Allen, I’m going to see if I can get us headed away from that boat. See if you can get the engine started, so we can hold a position once we’re clear.”

Allen climbed into the strange cockpit while he gunned Big Dink’s 15 hp Yamaha. Gee, tug duty, he thought. Trinka was turning and almost clear of the sloop when Allen got her engine started. Thankfully the owners had left the key in the ignition.

Trinka didn’t have an anchor windlass, so Allen maneuvered her so that they could both recover the anchor. It was hard work – the last thirty feet was all chain, but they were able to get her re-anchored just as the storm started to lift. He dropped Allen off and returned to Lone Eagle in time to be handed a vodka tonic and a towel. The anchor drags reminded him of Eileen Quinn’s song The Anchoring Dance and her funny lyrics about the antics of cruisers when they anchor their boats.

“You guys did great,” Gillian said and explained that she had made contact with friends of Trinka’s, and they were going to let Chris and Mandy, Trinka’s owners know what you guys did.

The next morning he and Gillian were just finishing off their coffee when Chris and Mandy pulled alongside in their dink.

“Hi, you must be Rob, and you must be Gillian? I’m Chris, and this is Mandy. We wanted to thank you guys for what you did yesterday. We heard it was a near miss. Thank you.”

He shook Chris’s hand, and Mandy produced a bag full of cookies and handed them to Gillian.

“Hi Gillian,” Mandy said as she handed up the bag of fresh-baked cookies.

“Gillian, thanks for getting the word out on the net yesterday.”

They invited Chris and Mandy aboard and made another pot of coffee. They were from Wisconsin, and this was their first year of cruising aboard Trinka.

“We’re going into town and just wanted to drop by and say thanks. We’re off to Margarita to say thanks to them too,” Mandy said as they climbed into their dink.

Once Chris and Mandy were underway, they organized themselves for a run into town. It was a stunning little town with little tiendas – outdoor cafes selling all manner of delicious Mexican food. In places, the island was narrow enough to throw a rock from the open ocean side to the harbor side. Gillian was off to shop, and he was off to find stainless steel tubing that would be needed to install the new wind generator that hopefully would soon be arriving. He was also in search of a new 8D battery, so his first stop would be a gas station to find out if it were possible to buy one somewhere on the island.

It was a hot, dusty day, and by the time they rendezvoused at the dinghy dock at the appointed hour, they were both dripping and ready for a swim.

“How did it go?” Gillian asked.

“Not bad. There’s a place here on the Island that sells big truck batteries. They’re on the other end of the island, so I’ll have to cab it tomorrow and see if they’ve got what I need.”

“Did you buy anything, perishable?”

“No,” she replied.

“Good. Let’s dinghy over and check out the little marina on the other side of the harbor that Allen told me about. He said they have a pool and a bar, and I’m ready for both.”

“Great,” she replied as he started the engine.

The breeze felt wonderful as they skimmed across the turquoise harbor waters and pulled into the dinghy dock. The marina had dockage for about ten boats, and it looked full. As they headed up the dock the bar and pool could be seen under the palms. They passed an old 45’ schooner and saw several local police officers coming up from below.

“Wonder what’s going on there?” he whispered to her as they passed.

The bar was pretty quiet – just a few cruisers nursing, their cold Dos Eckes – the local beer. They were warmly greeted by the bartender and ordered two cold ones. The bartender fished them out of cooler brimming with ice. He didn’t think it could get any better until he took the plunge in the pool. When they were ready for the next round, he asked one of the cruisers what the story was with the police on the schooner. The cruiser introduced himself as Mark and explained that the guy who owned her had died yesterday. Apparently, the old-timer had just come in after a memorable sail through the Virgin Islands and was regaling everyone at the bar last night with his sea stories when he suffered a massive heart attack and just put his head down on the bar and died. Amazing he thought. What a way to go. I guess if you’re going to check out, he could think of worse ways to do it.

In the days that followed, ‘showtime’ each afternoon proved to be an adventure. He and Allen from Margarita and Dick from Tonka took turns rescuing anchor drags. In six weeks in Isa Mujeres, they had racked up seven boat saves and consumed a lot of free beers at the little marina bar. The summer hurricane season was about to begin, and the tropical waves were forming out in the Atlantic off the African coast. It was only a matter of time before one developed, and he wanted to be within a two day run of the Rio Dulce in Guatemala – hurricane hole.

All the gear had come in – thankfully without duty. The installs took days and were a sweaty affair. Each day they ripped the boat apart, and then each night, they had to put it all back together to cook and sleep, but it was done. They were making and storing more energy than they were using. It took a bit of getting used to the sound of the Air Marine X wind generator. The stronger the wind blew, the louder it got but it was sure pumping the amps into the batteries. The new 8D truck battery he had installed had added 150 amp hours and increased their previous capacity of 240 amp hours to 390. He had even bought a window air-conditioning unit in Cancun that fit in the companionway hatch like it had been engineered for it. With the little Honda generator, they could be cool even at anchor. In the steamy jungle of the Rio Dulce, it meant that they could sleep in cool comfort. It was all coming together.

They had met another couple – Henry and Lisa from Grippen. Grippen was also a Pacific SeaCraft like Lone Eagle. They had met when he had seen Henry go out on an anchor drag. Lisa and Gillian instantly hit it off, and Henry proved to be quite a character. The plans were taking shape for the run south down the Mexican coast to Bahia de Espirito Santo (the Bay of Christ) and Bahia de la Ascension (Bay of the Ascension of Christ). Both were world heritage sites, and Allen on Margarita was excited about his chance to pursue the elusive bonefish that the cruising guides reported where plentiful.

Margarita was the first to leave, followed by Tonka. He and Gillian spent a full day breaking camp and readying Lone Eagle for the next leg. They would travel with Henry and Lisa on Grippen. It was June first, the first day of the hurricane season. It was a day run to Bahia de Ascension, so the plan was to leave at 0800, which would put them in by mid-day. All was ready, and so were they. Isla Mujeres had been a great spot, and now that all the energy problems had been solved, he hoped this leg was going to be a good one.





CHAPTER XXXIV June 2, 2002 - The Mexican run



Isla Mujeres, Mexico

Lat: 21° 15’ 00.45” N, Long: 086° 44’ 48.30” W

It was an overnight run, and they were underway in the company of Grippen at 0830. The wind was east southeast 10-15, and he knew the run would be a challenge. With the Gulf Stream pushing north at 4-5 knots and them heading south, he knew he had to find the elusive southward counter-current that would lie somewhere along the edge of the wall. All the navigation at this point was by bearings and he remembered the rock-to-rock navigation he had done so much of in the Bahamas. He took up a heading of 270 degrees after clearing Punta Cancun and Punta Brava and then started to slowly shift his course slightly eastward for twenty minutes and then westward for the same amount of time. He was looking for the counter-current that he knew had to be out there. He watched the depth sounder and the chart plotter. When he saw their speed over ground on the GPS exceeded their speed through the water shown on the knot meter, he knew he had found it – the southerly counter-current. It was only about a knot and a half, but better, he thought to have a gentle push then the alternative of bucking 4 knots on the nose. Depth was 175 feet, and the chart showed that there was a southerly 175-foot line that ran 2 miles off the coast that he could hug. They were making over five knots, and he hoped it would hold.

“You ready for some lunch?” Gillian yelled from below.

“Sure am,” he replied. “How we doing on amps?”

“We’re positive, 4 amps.”

Excellent, with the fridge and the chart plotter drawing 5 amps each, that meant that the solar panels and the wind generator were putting out 14 amps. We’ve finally solved the energy problem.

Gillian was just clearing lunch when the clip on the fishing line snapped, and the reel started to scream. Monitor was steering so he braced himself against the pulpit railing as he inserted the rod butt in the leather rod holder belt he wore whenever he was trailing a line. This guy was big. He had set the drag pretty tight, and this guy was just stripping off the line. He kept the rod tip up and reeled in whenever the fish ran towards the boat. Not fighting like a tuna, he thought. Probably mahi-mahi – good, dinner is taken care of. He had him on for twenty minutes when his suspicions were confirmed when the mahi-mahi leaped out the water and then came back up to do some tail-walking. An awesome sight. The colors were vivid – a rainbow of yellow, green, and blue.

He and the fish were tiring. He had reeled him in to within 20 feet of the boat, and the fish at that point appeared to be giving up and was being dragged on his side. He reeled in until he could grab the wire trace taking two turns around his sail-gloved hand. In his other, he held the gaff. He positioned himself to gaff him, but just as he did the fish came to life and launched himself airborne, shaking its head violently to throw the hook. He succeeded, and with a splash, he was gone. Oh well, old boy, you did it. You threw the hook – you deserve your freedom.

They sailed past the ancient Mayan ruins of Tulum. They were two miles off the coast, but the ruins on the hillside were clearly visible. The cruising guide had said it was an ancient Mayan shipping port, and all that was left were the remnants of three stone structures – all in line, one above the other on the hillside. These were the lead lights the Mayans would use to sail in through a tiny gap in the reef. The Mayans ashore would light fires in each of the structures, and when a canoe at sea lined up all three fires, they could paddle through the narrow gap in the reef to shore. It was mind-blowing that they were using lead lights a thousand years ago, and we still use them today at almost every port around the world.

They passed Tulum just as the sun was starting to set over Mexico. It looked like an angry fireball, and the dust in the air over the Mexican mainland made it almost blood red. It had been a hot day, and they knew that a cool evening would be their reward. He rigged the sun shower as Gillian passed up their shower kits. They stripped off, and the warm water felt so good cascading over their tanned bodies. Gillian finished first and went below. He drained the last of the water out of the sun shower. The shave and the clean felt wonderful. He stood in the cockpit, drying off as the sun disappeared below the horizon. Gillian came on deck in her sarong with two vodka tonics brimming with ice and fresh lime. It had been a good day.

“Rob, do you want me to take the first watch?”

“I think so, but let me raise Henry and Lisa and see who’s taking the first watch.” He keyed the mic, and Henry answered. He could see them about a quarter-mile off to starboard. Lisa was taking the first watch.

“Hey Rob, you had a big fish on today. I got tired just watching you.”

“Yeah, me too, Henry. Sure would have liked to have had him for dinner, but I’ll give it another try in the morning. With a little luck, we’ll be sharing a mahi-mahi dinner tomorrow night.”

“Gillian, it looks like you and Lisa will be able to keep each other company tonight.”

Gillian made her signature dinner that he just loved – pan-fried chicken with mashed potatoes. They sipped their vodka tonics and watched as the stars revealed themselves.

They sat there in the cockpit with the Weems & Plath star finder disc that they had bought in the Keys before leaving. Pick the disc for your latitude, aim it northward and there were the constellations – magic, he thought. The Big Dipper was starting to appear lower and lower in the sky. It had been his companion throughout his youth, and he knew it would bring a tear to his eye when he caught his last glimpse of her as she set into the northern hemisphere horizon.

“I’m going to turn in baby. Remember, fifteen-minute radar sweeps and wake me up if you see any light or something shows up on the radar.”

“Sleep well – you’ve had a big day,” she said as he climbed down to the bunk below.

The weather was good; the breeze just right, and he thought he could get some sleep but knew on the first night out; he never slept. Just tuning-in with the boat, he thought.

It felt like he had been asleep for just a few minutes when her voice drifted softly down the companionway hatch.

“Rob, wake up; it’s your watch.”

He managed an “I’m awake,” and shook himself to clear the cobwebs. It was 0430 – she had given him an extra half hour.

He climbed up into the cockpit and tried to focus on the chart plotter. Gillian had kept them right on the 175-depth line.

“See anything?” he asked.

“Nothing, but I had a good chat with Lisa. Girl stuff. They’re headed to the Rio Dulce like we are. I am going to turn in. What do you want from below?” she asked.

“The usual.”

Up came the Mars bar and the Diet Coke.

“Good night, baby,” she said as she slid the hatch closed.

He turned on the flashlight with the red lens to save his night vision and began to check the rig and Monitor. All was in order – no chafe on the lines. The chart plotter had them right on course. He turned on the radar and adjusted the range. First, the coast – right where it should be – two miles off. Then a longer range. Good no targets. He settled in and was getting into the rhythm of the seas as he let the breeze flow over him. They were holding five knots, which meant that they would reach Bahia de la Ascension by midday. He raised Henry on the VHF. Lisa had turned in and he too was clearing the cobwebs.

He had switched the radar to the guard zone function. It would do a full 35 mile sweep every 10 minutes. He had settled in with his book and had adjusted the book light, so the pages were illuminated. The CDs were in the four-stacker, so he was set for the night. A bit of Buffett, Clapton and the Stones would keep him awake. He did ten-minute binocular sweeps as he knew that some of the small fishing boats might not show up on radar. He had just completed his binocular sweep when the radar did its automatic sweep and started to beep – someone in the 15-mile guard zone. He looked at the screen and his lay line – it was a target at 10 miles dead aft of him. He switched to continuous – it was moving fast right up their asses. He kept watching. It – whatever it was - was now at 8 miles and closing. He raised Henry on the VHF. He too had seen it and was watching it.

“Henry, we ought to get a visual on him in a few minutes. Might be a cruise ship,” he added.

“Roger that, Lone Eagle,” came the reply.

Minutes pass, and the target kept closing. It was now 4 miles astern and rapidly closing. He keyed the mic and gave their position, course, and speed as well as the target’s position, course, and estimated speed – no reply. Henry was a half-mile to the west and just about even with him. He could see his tri-color light and his stern light. His eyes were riveted to the radar.

“Henry, he is closing fast and looks to be on a course to go between us.”

“Roger, Rob. I’m going to light her up.”

“Affirmative, I’ll do the same.”

He put the mic down and climbed down below and switched on the harbor running lights and the spreader lights.

“Gillian,” he reluctantly said in a whisper. “Baby, we have a target closing fast. I may need you…,” he said as he climbed back into the cockpit, grabbed the mic, and peered at the radar screen.

The target was less than a mile and was splitting the difference between Lone Eagle and Grippen. The VHF crackled to life - Henry was trying to make contact. Still no contact and no lights. This guy was running black. Not good, he thought – there were pirates out here.

“Gillian, please get me the spotlight and break out the guns.” He knew that would terrify her, but he had to be ready.

Less than a quarter-mile - he heard it before he saw it. It was the drone of engines. Big ones - turbines, he thought. No pirate – had to be military. There was little or no light from shore, but there was just enough to make out her silhouette. Military. Mexican Navy and the bastard was less than a hundred yards from him. He tried the radio again – no luck. OK, big boy, how’s about some candle power into your bridge? He pressed the button on the spotlight, and the razor-sharp beam penetrated the darkness and swept over the ship. He positioned it on the bridge and keyed the mic to advise that the light was coming from Lone Eagle. Still no answer – assholes, he thought.

As the target sped ahead of them, he was able to lower his personal threat level.

“It’s okay baby. It was the Mexican Navy. You can go back to sleep.” He knew the words would have little solace.

He had never told her to break out the guns, and he knew that doing so would have well and truly rattled her cage. He was right. A half-hour later, she peered over the hatch and announced, “I can’t sleep.”

They reviewed what had transpired. She had done well – the guns and ammo were laid out just like he had explained to her back in the States. He gave her a hug and said, “We followed our plan, and we were ready. You did great baby,” he said and pulled her close.

After a while, she went below and hit the rack. For him, it was check everything and then settle in for the remainder of the watch. It was 0230, and he had another hour and a half before he had to wake her. Give her an extra hour – 0530. They would have another 4 hours to Bahia de la Ascension.

He managed to make it to 0600. The sky to the east was getting brighter. The sun would be up in half an hour, and he knew he needed to get a bit of sleep before they got to Bahia de la Ascension.

She woke him at 0900. It had been a cat nap, but he still felt better for having it. The sun was well up, and he could feel it searing his skin. The coffee was hot and strong. She was magic, he thought. She did so well last night, and this morning, the coffee and big breakfast were just what he needed.

It was just before noon when they rounded Wilson Point and entered Bahia de la Ascension. The cruising guide said it had recently been declared a World Heritage Ecosystem, and he could see why. The bay was huge – 40 miles across and teeming with birds. It was shallow – skinny water – but the chart said he would average three feet under the keel. He keyed the mic and was able to raise Allen on Margarita. He could just see Margarita anchored off in the distance lined up behind one of the barrier islands that were part of Wilson Point.

They got the pick down a short distance from Margarita and Grippen was right behind them. They were both exhausted. He radioed Allen. They were all invited for dinner aboard Margarita. He gladly accepted. It had been a long night, and they were relieved to have arrived safely.





CHAPTER XXXV June 4, 2002 - A bit of fishing on the flats



Ascension and Espirito Santo Bays

Lat: 19°35’ 13.65” N, Long: 087° 20’ 16.66 W

Ascension Bay and Espirito Santo Bay were enormous bays, comprising hundreds of square miles of shallow water and mangroves. You could really get lost in here, he thought as watched Allen loading all of the fishing gear in his aluminum skiff that was designed for the elusive bonefish, and this was the bonefish capital of the world. The gringos paid thousands to fish these waters, and he was going to try his hand with Allen for free.

Lindsay and Gillian had been on the radio all morning, and Lindsay was coming over to spend the morning burning CDs and swapping stories with Gillian.

Through the portlight, he could see that Allen and Lindsay were on their way over. He gathered his rucksack and went up on deck to take their painter. It had been squally throughout the evening, and it was likely to continue by the look of the clouds. They left the ladies to their own devices and headed out to the flats. Within minutes they were there, and Allen had to tilt up his outboard for shallow water drive to get in close enough to the mangroves. There wasn’t much of a breeze as Allen cut the engine and climbed up on the poling platform to get them in closer.

“There they are,” Allen announced with glee.

He knew this was going to be big for Allen, so he volunteered to pole so Allen could work his fly rod magic. He could see the dorsal fins of the bonefish little more than thirty feet from the boat. Allen made his cast. Then another, and another. Then one of them hit, and the fight was on. They weren’t very big, but they certainly did put up a fight. Allen was having a ball while he tried to pole the boat in closer, but it was no use; they were hard on the bottom. He was glad he had checked the tide; it was about to turn and come in – wouldn’t want to be stranded out here all night, he thought.

Allen got his first bonefish up to the boat and was holding it proudly while he took a couple of quick photos just before Allen released his elusive prey.

“Nice one, Allen,” he said. “Let’s see how you do on the next cast,” as he put the camera back in its protective case.

Just then, the wind dropped, and all was still. He was back on the platform above the outboard, concentrating on his poling and watching Allen’s fly rod handiwork when he saw what looked like a black cloud coming toward them from the mangroves. Within seconds they were enveloped in a cloud of mosquitoes – millions of them. Allen dropped his fly rod, and he dropped the pole. Allen grabbed a can of mosquito repellant and sprayed it directly in their faces and then all over the rest of them from head to toe. The mess was unbelievable – millions of dead mosquitos swimming in insect repellent all over every exposed bit of their skin. The spitting, blowing, and spluttering lasted for quite a while as they emptied three cans of repellant over themselves.

After rinsing out his mouth, Allen, to his relief, said, “Let’s head back to the boats. The only way to do this is if there is a steady breeze; otherwise, we’ll be eaten alive.”

Fortunately, the tide was coming in and had just lifted them enough for them to pole back into deep enough water to get the engine down. Allen was disappointed that they couldn’t have stayed longer, but they both knew that Allen’s bonefishing aspirations needed to be tempered by respect for Mother Nature and the environs that he would have to traverse on his quest for his bonefish, permit, and tarpon in a single day hat-trick.

Allen eased his tender alongside Lone Eagle, and they both jumped aboard and were greeted by Gillian and Lindsay.

“So, how did you guys do?” Lindsay asked.

“A bit buggy,” Allen replied just as Gillian spotted the hundreds of dead mosquitos covering both of them.

“What happened?” Gillian asked.

He replied, “We were minding our own business when the wind dropped, and millions of mosquitos thought it was a good time to have us for lunch.”

“Well,’ she said, “Get up on deck, and I’ll hose you both down. I don’t want all of those dead bugs down below.”

With that, they both headed to the foredeck while Gillian turned on the wash-down pump and proceeded to hose them both down.

As they were toweling-off, Lindsay said that as she was cooking dinner tonight, and said, “Allen, we really need to get back to Margarita because Henry and Lisa will be coming over at five. We’ll see you guys then. Gillian, thanks for burning all those CDs for me. We’re really going to enjoy the new music.”

As they were shoving-off, he told Allen. “Let’s try for some tarpon next time. That way, we can both enjoy the fight.”

Allen smiled. “Better to be fighting fish rather than mosquitos.”

As they went below, he said to Gillian, “Let’s download the noon weather fax and see if those fronts are still stacking up. This grey, overcast weather day after day isn’t a pattern I’m enjoying.”

“Doesn’t make for good laundry days either,” Gillian replied.

Sure enough, the noon fax didn’t look promising. NOAA New Orleans was showing a succession of tropical waves heading their way from the southeast. He knew they had plenty of time to reach the Rio Dulce but was hoping for some good weather for the run down through Belize. It was, after all, he reminded himself – the start of lobster season.

It was just on five, as he slipped over the side into Big Dink and fired up the Yamaha, and Gillian handed him a big Tupperware bowl.

“What’s in there, he asked?”

“Just something I whipped up for dessert,” she replied.

They motored over to Margarita. Henry and Lisa had already arrived, and Allen was regaling them with the story of their mosquito fishing trip.

As usual, the ladies congregated in the galley with the guys in the cockpit where the conversation invariably drifted to the weather, the day’s repairs, and the next port.

He asked Allen, “How long are you going to stay here in Espirito Santo?”

Allen said that he had planned on at least a week in hopes of getting his elusive hat trick. He pulled out some charts and showed everyone each of his spots for bonefish, permit, and tarpon. He and Allen had fished both the tarpon and the bonefish spots, and both knew fish were there. Allen showed them the location of some flats and a drop-off to a shallow reef that he hoped would be a perfect spot for Permit. He said, according to his fishing guide bible, it was.

Allen asked about their plans and when they would be leaving for San Pedro, Belize. Henry confirmed that Lone Eagle and Grippen would be leaving together for the 24-hour run the day after tomorrow. Just as Allen was saying that he would catch up with them either in Belize or the Rio Dulce, the platters of food from the girls below started to be passed up and spread out across the cockpit table.

The dinner conversation drifted to what everyone wanted to do when they arrived in the Rio Dulce. The Rio, as it’s called, is the hurricane hole of choice for the southwestern Caribbean cruisers. It had been for decades. The sailing hippies of the ’60s built dozens of rickety wooden marinas for their equally rickety wooden boats and hung out there for the June to December hurricane season while using the shore time to visit the ancient Mayan ruins and mastering their command of Spanish. It wasn’t his first choice, but he knew he needed to lay-up Lone Eagle and get to Australia for the last bar exam. They could get a bus to Guatemala City from the little town of Fronteras, which was a ten-minute dinghy ride from where the marinas were and that there would be plenty of similarly situated yachtie gringos to keep an eye on Lone Eagle while they were away. For Allen and Henry, they would do what the gringos before them had done – the ruins and brush up on their Spanish. For him, it would be different.

The Rio meant the chance to complete the final fit-out projects to get ready for the Pacific run. Since leaving Key West, they hadn’t met any cruisers bound for the Pacific. All were staying in the Caribbean and ducking into the Rio during hurricane season. For the good ship Lone Eagle, they would be making the run to the Rio, get some projects done, get the boat ready for a few months of storage, and then heading off to Sydney. The plan was to be back in the Rio by the first of the year and clearing the Panama Canal by the beginning of March so that they could have seven months (through October) doing the Pacific before the southern hemisphere typhoon season started on December first. He had set November as the deadline to be in Coffs Harbor as history had shown that typhoon season had, on several occasions, started earlier and further South than he wanted.

For now, it was time to get the boat ready for the San Pedro, Belize run in the morning. His mind was more interested in running through his list of things to do than getting some sleep until he received a good nudge from Gillian and the admonishment, “I know what you’re thinking, get some sleep.”

He was awake just before sunrise and laid there running through his list. He knew what needed to be done to make ready for the passage to San Pedro. The trick he knew was figuring out the order in which they needed to be done, but first, coffee. As he lit the stove, Gillian stirred and murmured, “Morning baby.”

He had already read through the cruising guide and figured it would be a 24-hour run, so leaving at first light would mean arriving at first light. He moved his coffee on the nav station and started plotting his waypoints on the chart and then recording them in the Nav Log. Then he moved to the cockpit to enter them into the chart plotter.

“Want some breakfast?” Gillian asked from down below.

“That would be great.”

The day was filled with the usual get ready for sea tasks. Fortunately, they hadn’t really rigged for an extended stay in the Bays as there was little to do except for fishing, so the amount of break down and stow would be limited to Big Dink and her outboard. This was the last item, and it involved hoisting Big Dink’s outboard and then Big Dink aboard. Never a fun task, but they did have a well-oiled routine to follow.

Lindsay dropped by late in the afternoon with a freshly baked loaf of bread and a chat with Gillian. He was down below at the nav station and could hear their conversation up on deck. Lindsay was telling Gillian that she wished that she and Allen would be going with them and not spending another week in Espirito Santo. Allen fishing all day, and she on the boat alone was getting to her. Gillian assured her that they would soon be having lots of fun in Belize as soon as she got there.





CHAPTER XXXVI June 8, 2002 - The run to San Pedro



Espirito Santo

Lat: 19°13’ 07.49 N, Long: 087° 21’ 15.95 W

He was awake just as the sun was a dim glow in the east. There wasn’t a puff of wind, nor a ripple on the water in Espirito Santo Bay at this hour. It was 0515. This should be an easy run, he thought. It would be an overnighter, 125nm straight down the coast along the continental shelf. As they averaged 120nm per day, they should be at the entrance to San Pedro by first light, assuming he found the counter-current and a bit of wind.

Gillian was making sandwiches for lunch just as the kettle boiled for that all-important first cup of coffee.

“They are awake aboard Grippen,” he said as he saw their light on down below as he looked out the porthole above the nav station.

“I’ll wait until I see some activity on deck before I raise them on the radio. We should be able to be underway in less than an hour,” he said as he took his coffee, the chart and a pair of dividers up to the cockpit. He wanted to see how far off the coast the 100-fathom line would be. He was hoping it would be no more than 2-3nm off as it had been on the way down from Isla Mujeres. Having stepped it off with the dividers, he concluded that it was.

Just then, the VHF crackled to life.

“Lone Eagle, Grippen, you guys awake?” Henry asked.

“Grippen, Lone Eagle, affirmative, up to 72?”

“Going 72,” Henry responded.

Once on VHF channel 72, the boys agree to depart at 0630. Getting out of Espirito Santo Bay was going to be easy – pull the pick and sail out toward the shelf taking up a south- southeasterly heading until they got to the 100-fathom line. The wind was easterly tending southeasterly, which made it a close reach. He set Monitor and let Lone Eagle do her stuff. She settled right down on the rhumb line that he had programmed into the chart plotter. Monitor was a dream, it took advantage of every lift and brought you back on your angle to wind after every knock. His eyes darted from the compass to the chart plotter and then the knot meter. Where was that counter-current?

It was a little before 0730 when they reached the 100-fathom line. He was a quarter-mile ahead of Henry when he keyed the mic to let him know that he was going to start some lazy turns to see if he could find the elusive counter-current. Henry volunteered to do the same further inshore. He agreed as he knew that doing so doubled their chances of finding it. After almost an hour, he found it – the counter-current. It wasn’t much. A knot, to a knot and a half, but they had finally located it. He let Henry know, and Henry closed the distance between them so that they were only half a dozen boat lengths between them. He confirmed that he too, was on it. The wind was holding easterly and building to 15 knots. If that held, he knew they would make San Pedro at first light.

“Ready for some breakfast?” Gillian asked as a plate of scrambled eggs, and toast was passed up through the companionway hatch.

“Thanks, baby.”

As he ate his breakfast, his eyes kept scanning the chart plotter and the 100-fathom line, the speed over ground displayed on the plotter, and the speed through the water on the knot meter. Speed over ground was now three-quarters of a knot faster than speed through the water, so they were getting a decent push.

They had made water and topped off the tank and the sun shower on the way out of Espirito Santo. The wind generator and the solar panels had the batts topped up, and the day was sunny, and the breeze out of the east was constant. Gillian was on the radio to Lisa. It sounded like they were swapping recipes again.

The day slipped by. It was warm and getting warmer as they headed further south. The sun shower was going to feel good at the end of the day.

They had listened to the Northwest Caribbean Net on the HF radio that morning. They learned that several cruising boats behind them were likewise heading for San Pedro. Everyone had to stop there as it was the first customs port of entry for Belize after leaving Mexican waters. He knew he would have to surrender the guns there and was hoping the process would go smoothly. He was going to try out his newly-printed list in Spanish of the armamentos he had aboard and the gun receipt that he had prepared in Mexico.

By the end of the day, he had lost another big mahi-mahi right alongside the boat. It seems they had saved up the last of their strength for the end of the fight alongside the boat where they surged and threw the hook. He reminded himself to look at the hook barbs. Maybe the real answer was to bring them in slower and let them wear themselves out a bit more. It really was hard to troll for fish from a sailboat that was making five to six knots. Oh well, he thought, there would be plenty more fish along the way.

It was a beautiful, blazing sunset that they both shared with vodka tonics and the last of the fresh limes that Gillian had found in Isla Mujeres. They both loved Isla Mujeres, and Gillian was anxious to visit Cay Caulker, Belize – their next stop after San Pedro. According to Gillian, the guide said that Cay Caulker was a funky island on the gringo backpacker trail. Lisa apparently had a friend on a boat ahead of them that was in Cay Caulker, and she said that they were apparently having a great time.

Just as the last of the sun sank below the horizon, they rigged for their afternoon cockpit showers. He went forward and retrieved the sun shower from the foredeck. It was almost too hot despite having a white dishtowel on it since early afternoon. While he was up forward, Gillian had gone below to get their flannel-like pack towels that dried in minutes along with their shower kits. He hung the sun shower from the bimini as Gillian stripped off and sat down on the teak cockpit sole for here warm shower. Her all over tan was looking quite amazing. The water cascading over her stirred him. We watched as she stood and dried herself off. It was his turn.

Gillian made a delicious chicken curry with real Naan bread. She never ceased to amaze him with her resourcefulness and galley creativity.

He spoke to Henry earlier after losing his mahi-mahi – Henry had gotten one and called to gloat. They agreed that the girls would again do the first watch and they would both come on for the midnight to four watches. It seems that’s always when things get interesting, he thought.

Night was upon them. The tri-color light was lit, the chart plotter was dimmed, deck and line inspections were complete, and their current position was plotted on the paper chart. He was ready for the bunk. The intense heat of the day and the high humidity did take it out of you, he thought.

“Night baby. Wake me if you see any lights and make sure you do fifteen-minute radar sweeps. I’ll see you at midnight,” he said as he pulled the main hatch closed.

The top weatherboard wasn’t in as they didn’t have any reefs in the main – that was the rule – so the ventilation would be better. The cabin fan over the bunk was on as was the electrical panel light and the little oil lamp with the red glass for night vision above the nav station. He hoped he could sleep as he laid there listening and feeling Lone Eagle. He knew when everything was in balance, and tonight it was, and sleep was soon upon him.

“Morning baby,” she whispered down the companionway hatch. “It’s 0600, and we are about a half a mile from the last waypoint at the entrance to San Pedro. Welcome to Belize.”

It had been two hours since he came off watch, and he should have been tired and groggy, but the anticipation of arriving in Belize cleared the cobwebs. There was a lot to do.

The kettle started to boil just as he pulled the flag bag from the storage locker and pulled out the yellow quarantine flag and the Belize courtesy flag.

“I’ll put your coffee in the cockpit while you’re on deck,” she said just as he climbed into the cockpit.

They were now two miles offshore, and he had adjusted Monitor to close that distance to about a mile. San Pedro was just starting to come into view as he hoisted the quarantine flag on the port spreader. The approach to the port of San Pedro was, according to the cruising guide, pretty straight forward although the guide also mentioned that the harbor could get pretty busy.

When he returned to the cockpit, he decided it was a good time to charge the batts and make water while they were still out in clean water. He didn’t like making water in harbors but knew his watermaker filters, and UV filter would take care of any problems if they had to – you just had to clean the filters more often. The engine was warming up and the watermaker was making its sample batch when he keyed the mic and let Henry know he was firing up the engine and dropping sail to make ready for the approach into the harbor. Henry advised that he could see about a half dozen cruising yachts at anchor, but said that it looked like there would be plenty of room for them to anchor. Henry said he would go in first, and they agreed to touch base when they had the pick down. Up on deck, he dropped the main and began fastening the sail cover bungee tie-downs. They were coming up on the turn-point to starboard, and he could see lots of panga boats with their big outboards and boat-loads of dive passengers starting their morning run out to the reefs. The harbor was going to get busy, he thought. Probably a pretty rolly anchorage.





CHAPTER XXXVII June 10, 2002 – Lobster Season



San Pedro Belize, June 10

Lat: 17° 54’ 01.13” N, Long: 087° 57’ 59.61” W

By 0730, they had the pick down and were a few boat lengths from Grippen. At 0800, he radioed the port captain to let them know of their arrival and was pleasantly surprised when he was told that customs would send out a boat and come alongside to take care of the clear-in paperwork. Usually, he had to launch Big Dink and go ashore with the ship’s papers, the passports, and the guns and ammo and run around from the port captain’s office to the offices of customs, immigration, and quarantine to clear in. Invariably these offices were never in the same building, and finding them was never easy. Sometimes the whole process took the better part of half a day and the filling in of dozens of forms.

The customs boat arrived at Grippen just as Gillian was serving up some breakfast.

“How many of them?” she asked from below.

“Two,” he replied as he watched Henry escort the two customs officers below deck. The whole process aboard Grippen took fifteen minutes. He hoped they would be as lucky as he watched through the porthole as the customs guys took in their lines from Henry and headed their way.

The customs guys gently pulled alongside Lone Eagle. A good sign, he thought as he and Gillian took their lines and welcomed them aboard in Spanish. They were very gracious and took their boots off just after stepping on deck. How considerate, he thought. They were sitting in the cockpit with their clipboards, and Gillian offered up tea and toast with marmalade. They graciously accepted. The Sargent ran through the usual list of questions and then asked if they had any firearms aboard. He said yes and watched for their reaction. The junior customs officer stiffened slightly, but the Sargent simply asked where they were stowed. He said, down below, and invited the Sargent to go down the companionway first to inspect them.

Once in the saloon, he pulled out the soft gun and ammo cases from the storage locker and opened all of them so that the Sargent could examine them.

“You will have to surrender these while you are in Belize, but can have them back when you check out.”

He replied that he would be pleased to surrender them and produced his list of armamentos and his receipt all in Spanish. The Sargent asked the junior officer to check the serial numbers of the guns to the list of armamentos and count the various rounds of ammo. All was in order, and the Sargent signed the list and the receipt. Excellent, he thought.

He asked the Sargent whose English was flawless whether the guns could be transferred to Placencia, Belize, which would be their last Belizean port before heading into Guatemalan waters. The Sargent replied that he would make the necessary arrangements and asked when he thought they would need to be there. He said that they planned to spend at least ten days in Belize. The Sargent replied, “Welcome to Belize. Here is a thirty-day cruising permit. Your firearms will be waiting for you in Placencia. You can now lower your quarantine flag and are free to come ashore and enjoy Belize.”

In Spanish, he replied, “Thank you for your kindness and consideration. We are delighted to be in your beautiful country.” With that, the customs agents boarded their panga with the guns and headed for shore.

“Wow, that went smoothly. Do you want to rig Big Dink and go ashore?” Gillian asked.

“Sure did. Must have been your Spanish documents and your marmalade toast. They were very polite guys. Yeah, let’s get Big Dink ready to go shore. Let’s see if Henry and Lisa are up for a little exploring.”

San Pedro is at the Southern tip of Ambergris Cay. Belize was formerly British Honduras, and you could see the British influence was still there. The largest coral reefs in the Northern Hemisphere were just offshore of San Pedro. Turniff, Lighthouse, and Glover's reefs were second only the Great Barrier Reef and were a magnet for gringo divers. The reefs were described as incredible with blue holes having depths in the hundreds of feet. They were once above sea level caverns and the guide said that they still had stalactites with lengths up to 40'.

As he headed Big Dink into the dock with the most inflatable boats tied up to it – presumably the public dinghy dock – they were passed by several pangas loaded down with a dozen or more divers in full gear headed out to the reefs. Those pangas didn’t care about the large wakes they were throwing, so as each went by, he had to turn into the wakes and slow, almost to a stop to avoid getting them both drenched.

Henry and Lisa had just landed, so he nudged Big Dink in next to Henry’s inflatable. The town was a buzz. Lobster season had just started, and the lobster roll shops were doing a brisk business. As they were walking past one of them, Henry spotted a waitress carrying a large pitch of what he surmised was rum punch to a table of very white gringos who looked like they just got off the plane. Henry asked them how the rum punch was, and they offered him a glass.

Moments later, Henry announced. “We are eating here.” It was the right decision; the punch was sweet with spiced rum and very potent.

The people-watching was terrific. They saw some of the worst sunburns imaginable, some very sloshed twentysomethings and the tiniest bikinis he had ever seen. The lobster rolls weren’t bad either.

“Hey guys, we’re going to do a little shopping. How about we meet you at the dinghy dock in an hour,” Gillian said as she and Lisa picked up their rucksacks and headed off as they nodded in unison while finishing the last of the rum punch.

Henry suggested they check out the local ship’s chandlery as he was looking for some wire shrink-wrap for an electrical project. They had to ask three different people but finally found it down a non-descript side-street. No luck with the shrink-wrap, but the view down the isles consisted of a lot of outboard motor parts, which was expected.

After a while, Henry said, “Hey, we better head back to the dinghy dock to meet up with the ladies and their shopping.”

“Yep,” he replied; ‘I’m sure we’ll have plenty to carry back to the boats as they were headed for the grocery store to top off some provisions. Not much in the way of provisions in Cay Caulker – most of it’s shipped over there from here.”

The girls had just arrived, and it only took a couple of minutes to load up both of their dinks. The extra hands made it so much easier passing things across wobbly dinghies. The trip back to Grippen and Lone Eagle was really lumpy with pangas inbound and outbound streaking past them. Reef traffic was brisk, he thought as he pulled alongside Lone Eagle. They had finished unloading, and Gillian completed stowing everything but complained several times about the incessant rocking caused by the wakes of the pangas zipping by.

“Baby, I am hoping this will all die down at the end of the day when the last panga returns from the reef. Might be a couple going by to do night dives but not as many as the day runs.”

Chicken was on the menu, as it was many nights. You could pretty much trust the chicken, the meat was another story.

The sun had set, and they were discussing the day with their vodka tonics in hand when over the VHF he heard;

“Lone Eagle, Grippen, do you copy?”

He replied, ”Grippen, Lone Eagle, we copy, going to 72.”

He keyed 72 on the remote mic in the cockpit, and Henry piped up.

“Have a look in the southern sky. Do you see it?”

Sure enough there it was – the constellation Southern Cross. Wow, he almost couldn’t believe it. He and Henry spoke briefly as Gillian sat mesmerized by what she was seeing. There it was. The constellation that would guide them, from then on, all the way to Australia. It was just visible, low in the southern sky, and would only be visible for a short while before setting in the east, but he knew it would climb higher each night as they headed further south.

“Gillian, we are now south of 23 degrees north, so it was about time that she made her appearance, but this also means that the Big Dipper will soon be sinking out of view as we head further south. It’s going to be a very sad day for me when I see the Big Dipper and the North Star set for the final time.” It certainly would be, he thought. Further away from America. It was an unsettling thought. So was the idea of having to sail across the entire Pacific Ocean to get there. Now that was unsettling, he thought as he finished the last of his nightcap.

“Let’s get some sleep, baby. We both need to catch up on some sleep.” He said as he headed for the companionway hatch.

The next morning they were awoken at 0700 by incessant rocking as the first batch of pangas zoomed past on their way to the reef.

“Oh well,” he groaned as rolled out of the bunk.

“At least it wasn’t any earlier,” Gillian said as she put the final tuck into her sarong and headed for the kettle.

They were having their coffee in the cockpit when a panga with two guys dropped anchor about a hundred yards from them. Wonder what they’re doing, he thought just as both of the guys put on masks and snorkels and rolled out of the boat with what looked like spear shafts in their hands. He was intrigued and reached for the binoculars. Before he had time to grab them, he saw that the two guys were already flipping something over the gunnel of their boat. As he focused the binoculars, he could see that they were throwing lobsters into the panga – lots of them. Every thirty seconds or so, lobsters were being flung into the boat from both sides. It was amazing to watch these guys work.

By lunchtime, he had watched them throw hundreds of lobsters into their panga. They must be exhausted. As if on command, both guys hauled themselves into the panga and sat there with their heads down to catch their breath. The one at the forward end of the panga started to pull in the anchor line.

He went up on deck to get a better view and whistled to get their attention. As soon as they saw him, he waved them over. Within a couple of minutes, they were alongside Lone Eagle and up to their thighs in lobsters. He had never seen that many live lobsters and the two guys were throwing them by their antennas out of the way so that they could maintain their footing. He asked them how much. The guy at the outboard end of the boat replied, “Quanto?” He raised his hand, showing four fingers, and said, “grande.” The guy at the motor replied, “Diez.” What a deal. Four big lobsters for ten bucks. He handed the guy in the bow a bucket and a ten-dollar bill and received his bucket back with four big ones.

He thanked them, and they were off. Gillian looked at the bucket and said, “You’re cleaning them.”

He said, “Sure,” as she went below to get him his leather gloves.

They call them spine lobsters for a good reason. Their spines were really sharp, but what really gets you, and had gotten him once before, was the razor-sharp edges along the sides of their tail shells. If they rolled up their powerful tail in a ball and your fingers were between those razor-sharp saw-like teeth, you could lose a finger.

While he was working on the lobsters, Gillian was on the computer. She had been writing in her diary all morning. Meanwhile, he was dealing with a very feisty lobster. He had been able to break the tails off the first three, but this one, seeing and knowing what was in store for him, was going to put up a fight. And so he did, including some sound effects of grunts and gurgles that he had never heard before. Alas, it was over for the feisty one, and the bucket of tails was passed down to Gillian, who put them in Tupperware and then in the fridge.

“There’s dinner and then some,” she said.

“What are you working on?”

“It’s a poem about the Southern Cross, do you want to read it?”

Gillian had a way with words, and he eagerly replied, “I’d love to,” as she turned the laptop screen toward him.





The Southern Cross


For all these months past now

I’ve longed for this moment

The first time I’d catch sight

Of those five bright points of light.



Was it only my imagination?

Or did Lone Eagle turn just now?

For as we rest here at anchor

I feel her strain to point her bow.



How long have these stars been here?

How many sailors have shared in this quest?

How many boats have gone before us?

At that, we can only guess.



Tonight as I gaze at the heavens

Tears spill softly down my cheek.

And as I see these stars for the first time

It is tears of joy that I weep.



Five diamonds set against the velvet of the night

Four pointing like a compass, north, south, east and west

These jewels to guide us, we’ve no fear of getting lost,

The bright shining stars of the Southern Cross.



For the Southern Cross will lead us

And the spirits will be our guides.

We will sail across the oceans

Always heeding the winds and the tides.



When we make our final landfall,

We will know we’ve done our best

And through the years we will remember,

This night and our very first sight

Of the stars in the constellation, they call the Southern Cross.



Wow, he thought. “Baby, this is amazing. You’ve really captured it. You need to call Lisa and Henry to read it to them. I am sure they will love it.”

“I think it’s pretty good,” she replied as she reached for the remote mic in the cockpit and raised Lisa and asked her to shift to channel 72.

Gillian switch channels and read Lisa her the poem. Lisa loved it and so, apparently, did everyone else in the anchorage who decided to eavesdrop on their conversation on channel 72. No problem he thought, as several other cruisers in the anchorage piped up and complimented Gillian on her poem. When Lisa and Gillian were finished with their conversation, she asked Lisa to put Henry on. He wanted to discuss leaving tomorrow for Cay Caulker.

He and Henry discussed leaving after coffee in the morning. It was only a 15nm run so they could tow the dinks and not have to break them down. That was a relief, he thought as they agreed to pull the picks and be underway by 0900.

As the day wore on, the clouds thickened, and the wind got lighter and lighter as the temperature and the humidity soared. By sunset, it was pretty unbearable, so he decided to test out his Honda generator and the window air conditioning unit that he had bought in Isla Mujeres which fit perfectly in the companionway hatch. The generator and the AC unit were all set up and ready as they both sat in the cockpit and marveled at their achievement while he was giving the lobster tails the final turn on the barbeque. Just as he shut down the grill, he noticed that Lone Eagle was slowly turning to the west. Wind shift, he thought. As he passed the tails down to Gillian, he felt the sandflies starting to bite. He could see clouds of them blowing in from the west. He quickly pulled the starter cord to the Honda generator that was sitting on the watch seat. It roared to life, and then he turned the AC on, and, thankfully, it too roared to life. All good in the cockpit he thought as he climbed over the AC unit and down the companionway stairs pulling the hatch closed as the cold air poured into the saloon. They both stood there with their faces in it. They couldn’t believe how good it felt. They would get a comfortable night’s sleep, he thought as they set up the saloon table for their lobster feast.

The dinner conversation once again turned to the Rio and Australia when Gillian asked, “When do you think we should fly to Australia?”

He had thought about it and replied, “Well, the bar review course for the accounting exam is mid-November. I’d like to be there in mid-September so that I have a month to study before I take the course as the exam is right after the course.”

“When do you want to be back in Guatemala?”

“I checked, and there is a swearing-in ceremony scheduled for the first week in December. Assuming I pass, I think we do the swear-in and then spend Christmas with the family and be back by the start of the New Year. We should be able to clear the Canal in February and have almost nine months to do the Pacific.”

They were in agreement on the planned schedule. Dishes were done, and the bunk was made up. They were both looking forward to a cool night's sleep with their new AC.

He was awake at first light. It was strange to be sleeping with the AC running, but the hum did put him to sleep. He opened the hatch as he climbed up the companionway steps up and over the AC unit into the cockpit. The little Honda generator was humming along. It wasn’t too loud but figured he would hear about it on the morning net if one of the other near-by cruisers at anchor had been bothered by it. He hoped not, as he shut down the AC unit and then the Honda. Wow, he thought, it still had a quarter of a tank of fuel. This thing is going to come in handy in the Rio.

They were underway by 0900 in the company of Grippen, bound for Cay Caulker fifteen miles down the coast. The wind was out of the southeast at a steady 15 but had a lot of south in it, so they were close-hauled and rail down with Monitor doing its thing. Grippen was behind them, and Henry was using his electronic autopilot. It wasn’t as good as the mechanical Monitor wind vane because while it would keep the boat on course, it wouldn’t account for the ever-present lifts and knocks that they were experiencing. When they occurred, Grippen either luffed with a knock or fail to head up to take advantage of a lift. Lone Eagle did on both counts while maintaining speed and improving position on her rhumb line. He loved it.

It was close to noon when they set their picks in the little harbor of Cay Caulker, where ten cruising yachts were riding at anchor. He could see the dinghy dock and counted ten inflatables. Everyone was ashore, must be a fun place, he thought as he heard the sound of steel drums coming from the little town.





CHAPTER XXXVIII June 15, 2002 - The Gringo Trail



Cay Caulker Belize

Lat: 17° 44’ 72.90” N, Long: 088° 01’ 89.30” W

They had successfully navigated the Split, which divides the island in two. Gone were the zipping pangas of Sand Pedro – thankfully, he thought. The island was a coral atoll with blazing white sand – as white as he had ever seen. It was five miles long and less than a mile wide and only eight feet above sea level at its highest point. It had been flattened several times by hurricanes, but it had been a while since the last one, and the town was looking in beautiful condition with all the vibrant pastel color shops and homes. Cay Caulker had been a favorite on the gringo trail for backpackers for many years – Isla Mujeres, Tulum, Cay Caulker, Tikal, and then Lake Atitlan in Guatemala had been the path traversed by countless hippies over the years.

It was just a forty-minute ferry ride to Belize City, which wasn’t bad, he thought as you could get excellent international flight connections from there. He could hear Gillian below on the radio with Lisa. Apparently, Henry was going to do an oil change on Grippen, and Lisa was going to do some baking and would be going ashore to do some exploring of their own later. Great, he thought, let’s go in for a bit of reggae, some steel drums and a splash of rum.

They found the rickety dinghy dock and nosed their way in until the bow was pressed firmly (but gently) against the dock with the outboard idling in gear to hold Big Dink in place until Gillian could climb up on the dock with the painter. He cut the engine and made his way forward, lifting the heavy plastic-coated cable with him. It had been passed through the handle of the fuel tank and extended to a padlock on the lug nuts on the 15hp Yamaha outboard. He looped the cable around a piling and fastened the big padlock he had carried with him. No one will be stealing our dink today, he thought as he passed his rucksack up to Gillian.

It took just a few minutes to walk across to the ocean side and the central part of Cay Caulker. The town was a buzz as he had expected what with the start of lobster season. There were dozens of bright white sunburned gringos in town, and a steel band was playing some Bob Marley on the beach. Funky was the right word he thought to describe this place. The water was gin clear, and the few panga boats that were in the anchorage had all been unloading lobster for the local cantinas.

It was lunchtime as they meandered through the village past all the T-shirts and dive shops. They found a little cantina off the main street that was right on the beach, a half a block from the steel band. The hand-painted picnic tables all came with welcome grass roof shelters over them. The sun was blazing, and the reflection off the white powder sand ensured that their Maui Jims wouldn’t be coming off any time soon.

“I think this is going to be a great place to hang out for a while,” he said as a lovely, young Belizean girl dressed in a sarong and skimpy bikini top approached their table.

Gillian readily agreed as they looked over the laminated menu. Lobster salad three dollars and a pitcher of rum punch four dollars. Not bad, he thought as they placed their order. It wasn’t long before the lovely Belizean girl returned with a large beer pitcher full of rum punch, and some frosted mugs. It was liquid gold, he thought as the first mug full slipped down and quenched his thirst.

Gillian piped up, “Have a look at what she is bringing now.”

There were two large platters placed before them, with each having the meat of more than one lobster tail on a beautiful bed of lettuce with some fresh salsa alongside. It was a feast, and they lingered most of the afternoon sipping rum punch and listening to the reggae music of the steel band.

“Henry and Lisa are going to love it here,” he said.

“They sure will,” she replied, then added, “the night time entertainment ought to be a lot of fun.”

“Let’s come back here tonight with Henry and Lisa,” he said as he reached into his rucksack for his handheld VHF radio.

“Grippen, Lone Eagle mobile, do you copy.”

A few seconds later, Henry’s voice came in loud and clear – “Copy Lone Eagle, mobile going 72.”

He switched up to 72 and filled Henry in on their little shore excursion. Henry had finished his oil change and readily agreed to come ashore at 1900 for some dinner. The girls would be dancing the night away, Henry advised.

With dinner plans confirmed, they took a leisurely stroll through the village in the direction of the dinghy dock. They visited a couple of local art galleries where Gillian admired some of their handiwork.

It was 1530 by the time they got back to Lone Eagle – a perfect time for a siesta, he thought as he slid over to the shady side of the cockpit and pulled his cap low over his eyes.

“Wonder what we’ll be having for dinner?” he said, “Maybe lobster.” Could be worse, he thought as the gentle sound of the steel band could still be heard off in the distance. The rum punch had the desired effect, and sleep came quickly. It was so restful here, he thought as the gentle breeze and rocking took him to a happy place.

It was 1900 as he hung the oil-fired anchor lamp from the inner-forestay. They dinghied in, and Henry and Lisa were right behind them. It was midnight when they returned to Lone Eagle. It had been a fun night. The girls danced the night away and he and Henry got to know each other a bit better.

Henry was divorced and had decided that going off cruising would be a good move for him. He was an accountant and said he could always go back to Houston and find work. He and Lisa had found each other on the internet. They had been together six months when Henry popped the ‘let’s go off cruising’ question to her. He said she was great company but that she was finding it difficult to live the Spartan life of a cruiser. He said it had led to a few heated arguments, but he was hoping things would change for the better when they got to the Rio Dulce where they could get off the boat for a while and go off and do some sightseeing.

Henry wasn’t in a hurry to get into the Rio, and said he was happy to hang out in Cay Caulker for a while as it was only 120 miles from the Rio, and he could quickly duck in there if one of those tropical waves started to form-up as a tropical depression. He, on the other hand, knew that time was marching along.

Gillian had gotten an email confirmation from her friends in LA that they were able to help them book their flights to Sydney. They would be flying out of Guatemala City for LA on September 9th with a two-night stop-over in LA, while Gillian got her Australian visa. It was then off to Sydney on September 11. Wow, he thought the first anniversary of 911. The bar review course was to start on October 10th and ran through to the 30th. The exam was the first of November with results due back by the 15th and swear-in at the New South Wales Supreme Court the first week of December.

Their return flight from Sydney were booked for December 28, putting them back in the Rio on New Year’s Eve. It was a tight schedule, but they would have two and a half months in the Rio before they had to fly out. He hoped it would be enough time to complete all the projects – the list was getting longer every day.

They had seen a cantina the day before with a chalkboard advertising breakfast burritos and had agreed to meet up again with Henry and Lisa in town the next morning at 0900. The burritos were huge and went down well with the freshly squeezed orange juice. The boys were doing a reef snorkel in the azure waters just outside of the Spit, and the girls were off to do whatever the girls were going to do. Maybe more dancing and rum punch, he wondered. They couldn’t get enough of either as Henry handed him his snorkel gear, and he stowed it under the seat of Big Dink.

As they slowly motored out the Spit, you could see the bottom as if you were in a glass-bottom boat. It felt like you were floating in the air. The colors were breathtaking, and Henry was giving turn-by-turn directions to the little reef that he had read about in the cruising guide. Henry found the spot with the reef reaching up and almost touching the surface. Henry threw the little Danforth pick and had it set in seconds. They flipped over the sides of Big Dink at the same time. The coral scene below and around them was amazing. As he floated lazily on the surface, he extended his right arm and pointed his finger at a grouper tucked away in the coral. He didn’t flinch. Good, he thought, the place hadn’t been over spearfished. You could tell if it was if you extended your arm and pointed with your finger as the fish would scatter if the place had been over spear fished. Not here, he thought as he swam over to Big Dink and retrieved his spear gun. Some grouper for dinner would be a nice change from lobster. The lobster was very rich and you could get tired of it, but he kept coming up with new ways to cook it. His latest concoction was lobster scrambled eggs. It was becoming a favorite.

It wasn’t long before they had speared a couple of nice-size groupers. The girls would love the change of cuisine too. With their catches aboard Big Dink, they were free to do a bit of reef exploration. Lobster were all over this reef, with lots of antennas sticking out from under all types of coral and fans.

It had been eight days since the arrived in Cay Caulker. It had been the best stopping off point so far during the trip.

As they motored back to town, Henry asked when they would be heading for the Rio.

He replied, “In the next day or so, depending on when the next tropical wave is due to arrive here. I’d really like to avoid trying to get into the Rio in any kind of rain or poor visibility.”

Henry agreed that clear weather was a must and added that he had been reading the Rio cruising guide and had noted that El Golfete (lake) was pretty shallow and very poorly marked.

As they headed back to Grippen, he could see Gillian on deck hanging out some laundry. As they passed Lone Eagle, he held up the grouper. She waived and gave him the thumbs-up.

Henry climbed aboard Grippen with his catch. As Henry headed for the companionway hatch, he said, “Let’s download the noon forecast from NOAA New Orleans and see what’s coming our way.”

“Will do,” he replied as he backed Big Dink away from Grippen and headed over to Lone Eagle.

The noon forecast showed that the next tropical wave was due to arrive the day after tomorrow. Better see if we can get a bit further South before it comes, he thought as he reached for the Belize cruising guide to re-read the bit about how many cruisers had run aground on the trip down to Tobacco Cay. The good news was, it was an inside run and they wouldn’t have to pull Big Dink out of the water.

He radioed Henry and told them they would be heading out in the morning. Henry wished them well and said that he and Lisa looked forward to seeing them again in the Rio. He told Henry that they would tune into the Southwest Caribbean Net the day after tomorrow and brief him on the shoal patch aptly named ‘Puerto Stuck.’





CHAPTER XXXIX June 24, 2002 - Puerto Stuck



Tobacco Cay, Belize

Lat: 16° 53’ 52.00” N, Long: 088° 03’ 44.00” W

He had been through the Belize cruising guide’s coverage of Puerto Stuck as it was called – a big shoal patch just south of Cay Caulker that would have to be traversed on the way to Placencia – their last port in Belize where he would pick up the toys. He had confirmed, via VHF radio, with the San Pedro Port Captain that they were there waiting for him.

“See this picture?” he said as he showed Gillian a dog-eared page in the cruising guide that had an aerial shot of Puerto Stuck. “Do you see all of those squiggly lines there on the sand bottom? Do you know what they are?” he asked.

“They look like some sort of scratches on the bottom. What are they?”

“You’re right, they are scratches on the bottom, and they were made by yachts that ran aground trying to get through. They are keel drags of yachts trying to get through Puerto Stuck – hence its name,” he replied.

“Do you think we are going to run aground there?”

“I hope not. It’s a full moon so we’ll have a good high tide, but timing will be everything. The guide says there is little more than five feet of water, so we won’t be clearing the bottom by much. It is a twenty-mile run, so if we are making five knots, it should take four hours to cross it. We can’t go in at low tide – way too shallow. We’ve got to start two hours into the start of the high tide – that gives us a bit more water and the four hours we need to get across it. If we get stuck, the rising tide should lift us off; that is if we don’t get stuck on the way through and have to wait to be lifted. If that happens, we could be stuck there until the next high tide twelve-hours later, which will be in the middle of the night – not a pleasant prospect,” he added.

“You’ve really thought this through, haven’t you?”

“Been thinking about it for days actually,” he replied. “Let’s get a move on. If we leave now, we should arrive at the edge of the shoal right at two hours after the start of the incoming tide.”

“Ready when you are Cap,” she replied as he went up on deck to get the sail covers off.

The engine was warming up and the watermaker was making water. All good, he thought. Hopefully, that will continue throughout the day. He had thought about what he would do if they did get stuck but put the thought out of his head as he inserted the ratchet handle into the anchor windlass and started retrieving anchor chain at about eight links per pull.

As he worked the ratchet, he looked out and got a wave from Henry. They all had a good time in Cay Caulker. It certainly was the best spot that they had visited along the gringo trail and one he would someday like to come back to. He was envious of Henry and the other cruisers. They could knock around the Caribbean as long as they wanted, save for having to dodge hurricanes. Wait for one, then duck into the Rio and do some Mayan sightseeing while working on their Spanish wasn’t a bad plan, he thought as the anchor broke the surface and the sweat poured down his back. Going to get a lot hotter and stickier, he thought.

The start of Puerto Stuck was five miles south of Cay Caulker. It would be an hour run, he thought as he cleared the harbor and took up his southerly heading. The wind was a consistent fifteen as he hoisted the main, returned to the cockpit, and un-furled the Genny. Lone Eagle settled on her lines. The GPS showed that they were making 5.2 knots as he attached Monitor’s control lines and dropped the paddle that made a loud clunk as it locked into place.

It was 1000 and they were at the northern edge of the Puerto Stuck. Lone Eagle was healing nicely, so he figured she would be drawing 4.5 feet. Just then, the depth sounder alarm sounded. Better turn the alarm off as he knew it would drive them crazy. He had watched it shoal from 8 feet under the keel to now just 1.5. This was going to be nail-biting. One sand bar, and you’re aground.

He switched the Furuno from chart plotter to radar and did a twenty-mile sweep. He wasn’t looking for shipping traffic. No, too shallow for them, just other cruisers ahead or behind him was what he was looking for. The scope was clear. Just us, he thought.

“Baby, I’m going up on the foredeck. You take the tiller, and I’ll see if I can direct us to the deepest path.”

“OK,” she replied as she disengaged Monitor’s control lines as he went forward with the binoculars around his neck. No need for hooking into the jack lines; it was flat calm.

“Baby, if we do run aground, please release both sheet ropes right away. I don’t want to drive her further aground. If we stop, we might have a chance to back ourselves off.”

Cruisers had to read the water to discern depth, and the Maui Jim sunglasses he had bought were a godsend. They had the strongest polarization available and certainly made reading the water a lot easier. He had his wide-brimmed hat on, and his eyes were adjusting to the color differences in the water.

“Come five degrees to starboard,” he yelled over his shoulder as the water started to really lighten.

“Coming five degrees to starboard,” was her reply from the cockpit.

Great, he thought. Gillian really had taken on board what he had told her the other night. Repeat the order. Doing so confirmed for the captain that you had heard it. There would be a lot of that today, he thought as he yelled out the next course adjustment.

“Depth?” he yelled as he continued to scan the surface for any discernible lightening of color.

“1.5 feet,” came her response.

Course adjustments and depth readings were the order of the day. Haven’t bumped yet, he thought as he was about to drain his second water bottle. His shirt was dripping in sweat, and his hatband was soaked. Just then, he caught a glimpse of really shoal water dead ahead.

“Hard a-starboard,” he yelled. “Full reverse and release the sheets,” he shouted, hoping it would be in time.

Gillian moved quickly and with the engine in full reverse, and the sheets flapping Lone Eagle’s pace almost came to a complete stop. It took a few boat lengths, but it was enough. They had stopped in time. Just in time, he thought as he searched for a path around it. There it was. A tinge of bluer water – just off to port.

“Gillian. Leave the sheets free. Put her in gear dead slow and come fifteen degrees to port.”

He heard her repeat the order correctly and felt the engine rev. Lone Eagle eased to port and was headed for the darker blue path that seemed to stretch for a reasonable distance. He caught his breath and muttered to himself, that was a close one. Traveling at five knots, you come up on those shoal spots really fast. Sometimes you can make a course adjustment, but for others, where there is no obvious path, you’ve just got to stop, he thought, as he eased his way back to the cockpit.

Back in the cockpit, he gave her a hug and a peck on the cheek. “You’re doing a fantastic job,” he told her as he reached for the lid of the big Igloo cooler to grab a sandwich.

“I’ve got to get back on deck,” he said as he took the sandwich and another bottle of water up to his perch on the foredeck. They were on course, and the tinge of blue told him that they were okay for a while – at least long enough for him to eat his sandwich.

He checked his watch. It was 1300. They had been on the shoal for three hours and had one more to go as they had been able to maintain five knots. He also knew he had one more hour of the incoming tide to work with. He knew it was a gamble playing the end of the high tide. It gave you more water, but he knew that if he did run aground and couldn’t back them off that it would be a long afternoon and evening, before the next high tide, which was due at 0100. Not a pleasant thought as it would be impossible to read the water at that hour, even if you were able to get free.

As he scanned the way forward and passed backorders for course adjustments, he could see all of the yachtie keel drag scars on the sand bottom as they passed under Lone Eagle. Each one that passed under their keel gave him a bit of relief from the stress. Each one represented someone who had come to a screeching halt. Those screeching halts – those groundings could be really dangerous. People were thrown forward, and shit flew. Concentrate, he reminded himself. Almost there.

There were a couple more emergency stop drills, and Gillian had mastered them. She was doing such a fantastic job, he thought as he scanned the horizon with the binoculars. No deep blue visible ahead but enough blue immediately ahead to be able to run back to the cockpit to check their position on the chart plotter.

Back in the cockpit, he could see two feet on the depth sounder display, and the chart plotter showed that they would be out of the shoal in a quarter-mile. He looked at his watch and smiled to himself. He still had an hour of the incoming tide to work with but would be out of Puerto Stuck in fifteen minutes. Wow, he thought, his plan had worked, they were going to make it.

He went forward and assumed his position on the foredeck as he scanned the southern horizon, hoping to see the start of deeper water. The keel drags of the other yachties that kept passing under him were more than enough to keep him focused. He made two more course adjustments, and then it appeared – deeper, bluer water dead ahead. They had made it. Once they were in the deeper blue, he had yelled out to Gillian, “Depth?”

“Eight feet,” came the reply as he turned and headed back to the cockpit. A bit of shade would be nice, he thought as he passed the sun shower on the cabin top. It was hot to the touch even with the towel on it and he knew that hot water would feel good cascading over him when they finally had the pic down at Tobacco Cay.

Tobacco Cay was described in the guide as a small – several acres – coral atoll on the Columbus Reef. Palm-covered with a few dilapidated buildings on stilts with tin roofs. The guide said it had once been a fishing camp and then had morphed into a hippie refuge once the fishermen had left. The chart plotter showed it was just off his port bow to the southeast. Time to roll in the headsail and start the motor as he turned the ignition key and started hauling in the Genny.

They were coming up on the island’s west side, and the guide said the island had a small reef just off the beach. The east side had the big reef that dried at low tide. They slowly picked their way in and found a nice spot near the small coral reef. Might be dinner down there, he thought, as he lowered the pick to the shallow bottom. Gillian was at the tiller and he gave her the hand signal to begin to reverse slowly. She did, and within moments the pick had set, the chain became taught and Lone Eagle pivoted on its axis to face the wind coming across the island. He gave her the signal to rev up in reverse and then looked at his bearings on the island. They weren't moving. They were in. He attached the snubber to the anchor chain and returned to the cockpit. Gillian had already shut down the engine and electronics and stowed the binoculars.

“Time for a swim baby?”

“That would be lovely,” she replied as he climbed down the companionway ladder and gave her a hug and told her she had done an excellent job. They high fived and headed topside for their long-anticipated swim. He grabbed his mask and snorkel and jumped over the side with Gillian right behind him. The warm, tropical water felt cool and refreshing. When he put his mask on, he couldn’t get over how clear the water was. They swam around the boat and talked about how relieved they both were to have made it through Puerto Stuck.

After a while, she climbed up the boarding ladder. She threw him his swim fins, and he swam forward to check the set of the anchor. Hovering over it, he saw it was completely buried as he headed toward the little reef. He could see a pass through the reef that led all the way up to the beach on the island. We can take Big Dink in tomorrow and do some exploring. For now, a good look at the little reef was what he wanted. There were clouds of fish of every imaginable color, but one variety caught his eye. There they were, a school of yellowtail snapper. He paddled slowly over to them and outstretched his arm and pointed his finger right at them - they didn’t flinch.

He made his way back to Lone Eagle. As he got closer, her bottom came into sharp focus. Her lines below the waterline were as pretty as they were above the waterline. He circled her checking all the thru-hull fittings and Dynaplates – there were three of those. Two for the single sideband radio under the nav station and one under the galley sink for lightning suppression. He knew that all below the waterline was in good shape as he threw his dive gear on deck and ascended the boarding ladder.

Gillian was waiting for him with two tall vodka tonics. “Well done, Rob, I was a bit worried this morning, but you had it figured out. I hope there aren’t too many more of those kinds of nail-bitters ahead,” she said as they both sat across from each other and admired the view of the island.

“Not until we reach French Polynesia. But, between here and there will be other nail-biters, but they will be different – think about going through the locks in the Panama Canal.”

She poured them another round of vodka tonic as he looked at their ice supply in the Igloo cooler that was sitting under a towel in the back of the cockpit under the tiller. It fit perfectly and was lashed to the stern cleats. He lifted the lid and saw that their ice supply was holding nicely. Should make it to Placencia, he thought as he closed the lid, and Gillian handed up their shower kits from down below.

“You go first, and I’ll get dinner started,” she said as he went forward to retrieve the sun shower. He had covered it earlier, but when he lifted it, and it pressed against his shoulder, he realized it would be a scorching shower, but a bit of water added out of the tank would cure that problem. He hefted its five heavy gallons into the cockpit, added a kettle full of tank water, and hung it off the bimini.

He stripped off and sat down on the teak deck grate on the floor of the self-draining cockpit. The water cascading over him felt terrific. He could have drained all five gallons. He called Gillian below and said, “All yours,” as he climbed on deck and felt the cool breeze as he toweled-off. He was standing on the cabin top and loved the cool breeze all over him. The anchorage was deserted. He liked that but reminded himself that many of the cruisers took clothing-optional quite seriously. There had been to so many places where he had seen beautiful and not so beautiful naked bodies showering up on deck without a care in the world. More please, of the beautiful ones, he thought as he hung his quick-drying Pak Towel on the lifelines and headed back to the cockpit where the lovely Gillian was showering.

The next morning dawned bright and clear. The wind was out of the southeast, and they were in the lee of the island, so there wasn’t a ripple on the water around them, and you could see the bottom clearly. He checked the anchor and his bearings on the island – they hadn’t budged as he returned to the cockpit and Gillian handed him his mug of coffee and then passed her’s up to him.

When she settled into the cockpit cushions, mug in hand, she asked, “Well, cap, what would you like to do today here in our little tropical paradise?”

“How about we go ashore and do a bit of exploring. When we get back, I’d like to do a bit of diving to see if I can get some of those beautiful yellowtail snappers for dinner. I’ve had them before in the Bahamas, and if they taste anything like those, you are in for a real treat.”

“Sounds like a plan,” she said. “It doesn’t look like there is much there, but maybe we will find some interesting artifacts from the prior hippy residents.”

He pulled the starter cord on Big Dink, and they motored in through the pass he had spotted on yesterday’s dive. As they got closer to the beach, the water became translucent. Just off his bow, he could see a big starfish on the bottom in little more than two feet of water. He stopped Big Dink when it was alongside, and reached over and picked it up and handed it to Gillian. “You’re a star baby,” he said as he gave it to her. She gingerly accepted it. It was alive, and she marveled at its dark red topsides that were covered in blunt yellow points and then turned it over and was fascinated with all of its little moving tentacles on each of its five arms.

“Better put him back in before we get to shore; otherwise, he won’t make it when the tide goes out,” he said as he reached around and engaged the Yamaha’s shallow water drive for the final run to the beach.

They dragged Big Dink a few feet up the beach and set the little Danforth anchor as they took in the scene around them. There was an old plywood fish cleaning table in a sorry state of repair just above the seaweed-strewn tide line. That will come in handy, he thought as they slowly walked through all the dry seaweed that was soon replaced with a carpet of dried palm fronds. They could see several of the old structures that were situated on the ocean side of the island to catch the prevailing southeast breeze. They slowly picked their way over the palm frond carpet toward the nearest old tin roof structure when he heard a distinct thud behind him, followed by two more just off to his right. Shit, falling coconuts as his eyes looked aloft.

There were dozens of coconut palms all around them, and they all had massive clusters of coconuts. He knew those things could kill you if you took a direct hit on your coconut.

“Better make sure that when we walk, we aren’t walking directly under them,” he said as he looked for a less dangerous path that wasn’t directly under the ladened palms. That was close, he thought as they reached the old tin building.

There wasn’t much to see other than the typical remains of the less than tidy former hippy inhabitants. Lots of empty beer cans, some old clothes, some old kitchen pots and pans and a couple of old, rusty propane tanks for cooking. Having seen all there was to see, they walked out to the beach on the ocean side. It too was seaweed-covered and he could see the drying reef that the guide talked about that stretched hundreds of yards out into the Caribbean. There must be millions of lobsters out there, he thought.

There wasn’t much else to see, so they headed carefully back to Big Dink while avoiding the coconut hazard. They launched Big Dink and headed back to Lone Eagle. As they pulled alongside, he grabbed his dive gear, and they headed off to the spot where he had seen the yellowtail snapper.

Gillian threw the pick and set it while he put on his mask, fins, and snorkel. He rolled over the side as Gillian handed him his spear gun and wished him happy hunting. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky, so there weren’t any shadows. The reef was healthy, alive, and vibrant, with so many different species and colors of fish. There were plenty of yellowtail snappers too, and it wasn’t long before he shot his first one and handed it up to Gillian in Big Dink. The next two came quickly. They were dinner-plate size, so having three would yield three lovely filets a piece.

Having taken just what they needed for dinner, he handed her his spear gun and then threw his gear into the bottom of Big Dink.

“Let's go ashore and use that old fish cleaning table that our hippy friends left behind for us,” he said as he climbed over the side and sat on the bench seat next to the Yamaha.

They motored into the beach, and he took the fish out of the bucket and placed them on the well-worn, plywood fish cleaning table. He scooped up a bucket full of water from the beach and started scaling his prize catch. Glad I’m scaling them here, he thought. What a mess this would make on the boat, and if you failed to wash off every scale, the next day, it would be like it was Super Glued to the deck.

The filets were beautiful – thick and firm as he rinsed them in his saltwater bucket. Going to be delicious, he thought has he cleaned off his filet knife, and they headed for Big Dink right after he threw the three fish frames to some waiting seagulls. Astonishing how they just show up whenever anybody is cleaning fish. Must be programmed in their DNA, he thought as they made their way back to Lone Eagle.

He set up the cockpit table and enjoyed his sundowner as Gillian busied herself below, preparing what he hoped was a delicious meal. It was. Gillian couldn’t get over how sweet the yellowtail was, and said she thought it was the best fish she had ever eaten.

The sun was setting off behind them to the west. No other boats had shown up. He lit the anchor light, and the conversation turned once more to the Rio.

“How long do you want to stay in Placencia,” she asked.

“Well, I guess it might take a few hours to collect the toys and get them back on the boat. We won’t get them back until we clear out, but I figure we can clear out and spend another day if we want to. If they ask why we haven’t left, we can tell them we have a mechanical problem and will leave as soon as we fix it.”

“Sounds like a plan, but what else is there?” she asked. “Can we get ice and any provisions?”

“I don’t know,” he replied, “the guide says very little about the town and the facilities. It does say they have a large fishing fleet that works out of there. Those guys will probably have ice.”





CHAPTER XL June 29, 2002 - Placencia and Tres Puntas



Placencia, Belize

Lat: 10° 30’ 44.00” N, Long: 088° 21’ 58.00” W

In the morning, they tuned-in to the Northwest Caribbean Cruisers net, and when general traffic was over, they switched HF channels and briefed Henry on Puerto Stuck and Tobacco Cay. Not much to see here, he told him so he wasn’t surprised that Henry responded by saying that he and Lisa would stay in Cay Caulker a few more days and then catch up with them in the Rio.

They had received the morning weather fax out of NOAA New Orleans. Sunny and clear, but a tropical wave was moving westward and might be there the day after tomorrow. Not good, he thought, but let's see what the forecast is closer to our departure out of Placencia.

It was a 40-mile to run to Placencia, so they didn’t have to rush.

“Will we have good water along the way, or is it going to get sporty?” she asked.

“We’ll have plenty of water, and the entrance to the harbor is well marked. I’ve got a waypoint in the chart plotter for the entrance. All we have to hope for is that the wind that we have now holds until we get there.”

With that, he fired up the engine and then threw the switches to start the watermaker. Topping off their water tank and filling the sun shower was now their morning ritual. Before long, they were beam reaching toward Placencia. Monitor was steering, and he had the laptop up in the cockpit and was reading his Log of Lone Eagle emails that he had been sending to friends and family. He had sent one from Cuba, Isla Mujeres, and Cay Caulker. I’ll do another one when we get to the Rio.

It was 1400, and they were at the entrance to Placencia. Cute little harbor but pretty crowded with cruising boats. The Moorings, yacht charter company, had recently opened a base there, and he could see their dock and six charter boats. They would know where to get provision as he pointed the base out to Gillian. He could also see lots of fishing pangas up on the beach and a large structure with a dock that jutted out into the harbor. Must be the fish packing plant. They’ll have plenty of ice by the look of all the cooler boxes stacked on the dock.

They had the pick down and were motoring in on Big Dink in just a few minutes. Once ashore, they learned that tonight was the start of lobster fest. Here too, the town was a buzz. They located the Port Captain’s office, and he went inside and confirmed the toys were there. He told the Port Captain that they would be checking out in the morning and would come in to clear out and retrieve them.

It wasn’t as pretty as Cay Caulker, but it was just as funky. It had great little shops, and he found a fishing tackle shop and picked up a few more trolling lures to add to his growing collection. They had another lobster lunch at one of the harbor-side cantinas before heading over to the fishing dock. It was in the corner of the little harbor and had a huge, three-story processing building that had to be fifty years old. When they went inside, they were met by a mountain of ice and the clunking sound of the ice machine on the second floor that was pouring it out. It looked like it was snowing.

The manager greeted them and asked what he could do for them. All he wanted to know is if they would be willing to fill his cooler with ice. “Take all you want,” came the reply.

“I’ll bring my cooler in tomorrow,” he said as he thanked Julio and headed out of the freezing room and back into the hot, humid, and sticky air outside. Gillian picked up a loaf of bread and some fresh veg, and they made their way back to Big Dink.

Once back on Lone Eagle, he turned on the weather fax to get the latest forecast, which began downloading moments after he pressed the power button. They had made it back just in time for the 1600 forecast. Overcast. Not great, he thought, but we have got to keep pushing southward.

The next morning they were up at 0600, and he was waiting at the Port Captain’s office to be the first one to clear out and pick up the toys. He carried the toys, and Gillian carried the empty cooler over to the fish processing building where they met by Julio who kindly filled it up. “Way too heavy to carry all this back to Big Dink. I’ll go get Big Dink and bring her to the dock over here,” he said as he headed off to the dinghy dock.

Back aboard Lone Eagle, they began the process of breaking down and stowing Big Dink. This was going to be a 40-mile open water passage, and as much as he just wanted to tow her, he knew that things can go wrong towing a dink in open water. He just couldn’t take the chance as he put in the last fold and pulled the protective cover over her and lashed her to the cabin top.

The port of Livingston, Guatemala, was at the mouth of the Rio Dulce River that emptied into Bahia de Amatique. It was an open roadstead, and you couldn’t anchor there overnight. The river outflow and the bay that could act up in a good easterly breeze made that impossible. It also wasn’t possible because you couldn’t navigate your way up the river at night. You had to start up the river first thing in the morning after clearing in with the Livingston Port Captain. The only option as he understood the guide was to anchor off Tres Puntas, Honduras, which was just a few miles across Bahia de Amatique and wait for dawn to arrive at Livingston.

As the day wore on, the grey sky continued to darken, and the wind from the east slowly began to drop. Tres Puntas was part of Manabique Honduras, which was to the east of Livingston. They would be able to anchor under the lee of Tres Puntas, so if there was a blow from the east, they would be sheltered.

A misting rain began, and visibility dropped to a half-mile. He switched the chart plotter to the radar function as he started the engine. The rest of the way in was going to be a motor sail, so he didn’t mind the extra amps he would be burning with the radar as the alternator was doing its thing and replacing the charge in the batts.

The radar had picked up the peninsula that comprised Tres Puntas. The tip of the peninsula was just inside the five-mile range ring, so they were getting close. As they closed the distance, the wind completely dropped. He furled in the Genny then went forward to haul douse the main. They would be in soon. Not soon enough, he thought as the drizzle increased and was now a steady light rain.

The chart showed that it was very shallow in the area around the point, so he needed to give it quite a wide birth. Even at half a mile, the water was shoaling but was thankfully holding at eight feet as he headed for a spot a quarter-mile in from the point and nosed Lone Eagle in closer. When the sounder showed five feet, he turned and headed out to where it was eight feet. This ought to be fine, he thought as he handed Gillian the tiller and headed up on the foredeck to drop the pick.

As he focused the binoculars and did a sweep of the shoreline, he could make out a few tiny shed-like structures. None of which looked inhabited. It was 1800, and no smoke from any of the structures was visible, so apparently, no one was cooking dinner.

They high fived, and Gillian handed up two vodka tonics. There wouldn’t be a nice sunset tonight, he thought as he rolled down the bimini side curtains to keep out most of the rain. She lit a couple of oil lamps below while he pressed the start button for the 1800 weather fax out of New Orleans. He tore off the pages as they fed out and could see that they were under a tiny tropical wave that would be clear of them in the morning so they could look forward to a sunny run up the river. There was, however, a bigger, deeper tropical low a day out that wouldn’t be enjoyable anywhere from here all the way up to Cay Caulker. Hurricane season was coming. He was glad he was one step ahead of it and just a couple of miles from the best hurricane hole in the western Caribbean.

They finished the last of the lobster for dinner, and as they were washing up, when Gillian asked, “So what will the river be like tomorrow? How far do we have to go to get to the marinas?”

“Once we get out of Livingston, it’s 40 miles upriver to the marinas. It should take us all day to get there. I don’t know how much river flow we’re going to be bucking going up-stream or how slow we’ll need to go. During the first part, we go through a deep mountain gorge with 300-foot cliffs on both sides. Then it opens up into El Golfete, which is a big, long, and wide lake that is tricky to navigate. Once you clear the lake, you continue upriver to the marinas.”

“You’ve done your homework, Cap. Think we’ll see any wildlife along the way.”

“Toucans and monkeys according to the guide.”

“Going to be a big day tomorrow, so let's get the bunk set up and turn in.”

He went up into the cockpit before turning in for the night. The glow of the oil lamps below made Lone Eagle feel so warm and inviting. He unzipped a side curtain and climbed out on deck. No lights were visible anywhere, and the misting light rain wasn’t letting up. He had a strange sense of foreboding. They were the only boat for miles, but he still had that eerie sense of foreboding. He didn’t know why he was feeling it, but it felt very real to him.

He climbed below, and for the first time, he reached up and threw the barrel bolt lock to the companionway hatch. He didn’t know why – he just did it. He also glanced over at his spear gun. He saw that it was in reach as he blew out the last oil lamp and slid into bed beside her. He knew he would be sleeping lightly.





CHAPTER XLI June 30, 2002 - The Rio Dulce River



Livingston, Guatemala

Lat: 15° 49’ 18.00” N, Long: 088° 45’ 00.00” W

It was 0600, and the first rays of light were coming through the portholes as they lay at anchor in Tres Puntas. The tropical low must have passed, he thought as rolled out of their bunk. It was a sunny day, and perfect for going up the river. He lit the stove and put the kettle on as Gillian stirred. “Morning baby,” he said as he unlocked the companionway hatch and slid it open. The foreboding feeling was gone. It was replaced by the usual mild trepidation he was feeling about going to some new, unfamiliar place. He was getting used to that feeling, he thought, as removed the weatherboards and climbed into the sunny cockpit and started rolling up the bimini’s canvas side curtains. The wind was just starting to come up out of the east. Straight downwind run to Livingston. Should be there in under an hour, he thought as he scanned the shore with the binoculars.

They had breakfast and got everything ready for the clearing-in process that awaited them. As they finished their coffee, he explained about anchoring off Livingston and how the outflow of the river from the west would be running against the wind from the east – wind against tide - which could result in strange positioning of Lone Eagle and its anchor chain which would typically point directly into the wind but could be under them due to the outflow of the river.

“We want to get in and out of there as soon as possible. Launching Big Dink is going to be interesting as I am expecting it to be pretty lumpy. The good news is, we won’t have to break her down and stow her when we leave. We can just tow her right up the river.”

They pulled the pick and rolled out the headsail as he turned westward toward Livingston. It was a straight run of 11 miles with plenty of water. They were making water, but this time would be the last, he thought. When they got to the marina, they would have to pickle the watermaker. There would be plenty of water at the dock. Better read the manual and figure out how to do it, he reminded himself.

It wasn’t long before he could see Guatemala. It was hilly along the coast and mountainous further inland. The chart plotter showed that Livingston was five miles dead ahead. It slowly came into focus, and he could just make out the mouth of the river, and the town of Livingston. He could also make out quite a few multi-colored buildings and several pangas tied up to docks along the shore. There was a fair bit of panga traffic on the river but no large cargo ships. He went up on the cabin top and hoisted the quarantine flag on the port spreader.

The Rio Dulce means “Sweet River” in Spanish; he told her as he throttled back as they neared Livingston. There were two other yachts anchored off the town dock, so he took up a position nearby and headed up to the foredeck to drop the pick with Gillian at the tiller. He watched as the chain payed out and waited to see if the wind or the river flow would reposition Lone Eagle. He had lined up parallel to the other yachts, and, sure enough, Lone Eagle was holding her angle to the wind. He signaled to Gillian to put her in reverse and start increasing the revs. He had ten feet under the keel and put out 4:1. The guide said the holding was good, and it was. The pick dug in, and the chain straightened. His bearings on land told him they were in.

He drew his finger across his throat, which was the signal for her to shut down the engine. She did, and Lone Eagle settled parallel to the other yachts as he made his way back to the cockpit. This was a commercial port, and pangas were zipping by all around them. Their wakes were making it a bit rollie, but he knew they would be able to launch Big Dink. The challenge he knew was at the point in the process where Gillian lowered the 15hp Yamaha down to him using the davit at the stern. She had to lower it slow and carefully so that he could catch it and place it on Big Dink’s transom. Boat wakes would certainly require timing and balance and proper foot placement at the bottom of Big Dink.

The launch went perfectly, and he was tied alongside as Gillian handed him the ship’s paper satchel and then the toys. It was so strange walking through town with a shotgun in its soft case. Everyone knew what it was. Gillian had also included in the ship’s papers satchel the guide and the handheld VHF radio. The guide had a map of the town that showed the Port Captains Office, Customs, and Immigration buildings. As usual, there were several blocks between them and the map, unfortunately, didn’t include street names. Great, he thought as he shoved off and headed in toward a dock that had a couple of inflatable dinghies.

First stop, the Port Captain, he thought as he locked Big Dink and made his way up the side street to the main road. He always wore a smile and said Buenos Dios to the people he passed along the way. They always smiled back. Being humble, gracious and grateful to be in their country had always worked for him. Here, it looked like it would be no different.

He found the Port Captain’s Office. The guide map was good so far, he thought as he climbed the stairs where he could see the office down the hall. When he got to the door, he saw the Port Captain sitting at his desk in a cloud of smoke. There was also an inbox on the corner of the desk that contained a rather alert chicken that was standing atop a revolver lying in the bottom of the inbox. Welcome to the third world, he thought as he greeted the Port Captain in Spanish.

The friendly Port Captain checked the ship’s papers and gave him a six-month cruising permit along with some convoluted directions to the Customs Office. After some faulting attempts in Spanish to get directions from a couple of locals, he made it to the Customs Office with toys in hand. He got a few looks when he walked in the door carrying the shotgun case but had no problem with the Customs Officer who signed the receipt and told them that the toys would be locked up until his return. Next stop Immigration, and that too went well. With stamped passports, he headed back to the dinghy dock and raised Gillian on the VHF.

“How did it go?” she asked.

“No problem, but I’ll have to tell you about the inbox with the chicken and the gun.”

“The what?” she replied. “I do not copy.”

“I’ll tell you when I get back. Do you want me to pick up anything while I’m here?”

“Just a fresh loaf of bread if you can find one would be nice.”

“Will do, Lone Eagle mobile clear and standing by 16,” he added as he knew she might call him for something else to bring back.

Now I need to find a bank and change some US dollars. He had seen one just around the corner. He got Guatemalan quetzals for his greenbacks. Quite a few, he saw for the hundred he had changed.

He found a little bread shop and got the bread and a few sweet treats. The elderly woman spoke no English, and his Spanish wasn’t very good. But their smiles said it all. He pointed to the loaf he wanted, and she slipped it into a brown paper bag as she pushed a plate of baked treats covered in powdered sugar across the counter smiling and nodding for him to try one. He didn’t know what they were, but they were delicious, so he said, “por favor,” and held up six fingers and handed her what looked like a small denomination quetzal. She gave him some unknown handful of coins back, and he bade her farewell and made his way back to Big Dink.

It wasn’t long before they had the pick up and Big Dink in tow. He swung Lone Eagle upstream and brought the revs up to cruising speed. He looked at the chart plotter that showed speed over ground of 4.75 knots, and then he looked at the knot meter that showed speed through the water of 5.5 knots. Wow, he thought, .75 knots of river flow current on the nose. That will slow us down a bit, but the tide should turn and be incoming soon, and that might give us a bit of a push. How much? He had no idea.

The river was wide at the entrance but gradually started to narrow. They had twenty feet of water under the keel, so the depth wasn’t, at this point, an issue. As they proceeded upriver, the gorge began to narrow, and the peaks started to get higher. The guide said they reached 300 feet, and he didn’t doubt it. The sides of the gorge were covered in lush green vegetation and dotted with tall coconut palms. You could smell the green plant life and could make out the vivid colors of some of the wildflowers along the water. It was idyllic. They weren’t, however, alone. Livingston was a major port, and there was a lot of river traffic with pangas passing them in both directions. Off in the distance, he could see dugout canoes with men and boys standing in them as they paddled along. What balance those guys had, he thought as they passed slowly by.

As they made their way further upriver, it began to narrow, and the lush, green cliffs started to close in on them. They still had plenty of water under them, but the encroaching cliffs made for some spectacular nature watching. Gillian had been on deck with her camera snapping lots of pictures when he yelled to her, “Toucans and monkey off to port.”

When she spotted them, she giggled as the first howler monkey howled and swung from one tree to another only to disturb a toucan that emitted a loud squawk of indignation. They saw lots of toucans and howler monkey as they meandered their way upriver. There were so many of them, and the howlers were certainly doing a lot of loud, howling, which was clearly audible above the sound of Lone Eagle’s motor.

There were palm frond roofed homes scattered all along the banks of the river. Ingenious construction, he thought. These weren't shacks but lovingly constructed, multi-room houses with beautiful palm frond fringed balconies that looked out over the river. They were all neat as a pin, and all of them had their own docks along the shore where they tied up their pangas - all with 100+ hp Yamaha outboards. These guys had a bit of money to be able to afford those outboards, he thought as he figured each would run north of twenty thousand dollars in the States.

As they rounded the next bend, he could see a beautiful home on the riverbank close to their port side. This one was two-story. He could see three naked little kids splashing in the water along the riverbank. They looked like they didn’t have a care in the world. As he marveled at the construction of the house, a woman hanging clothes on a line in a beautiful white pario with bright red flowers tied around her waist came into view. She turned to face them as the sound of their engine reached her. She was topless and waved enthusiastically as they approached. So did the three little kids. She was gorgeous, and he could see her beautiful shape and even her big, bright white smile. Must be the kid’s Mom, he thought as both he and Gillian returned her wave. I’m going to enjoy the scenery here, he thought as his eyes lingered a bit too long. “Great tits, huh Cap?” he heard from behind him in the cockpit.

He checked the chart plotter and saw that the height of the gorge would be rapidly decreasing and that they would soon come upon El Golfete. According to the guide, it was shallow at eight feet in the channel and ran ten miles until the river opened up again. The guide said the channel was marked with stakes. As they approached where it should be, he throttled back and climbed up on the foredeck for a better look. He was scanning dead ahead, and a few degrees left and right with binoculars and didn’t see anything that looked like stakes marking a channel. Marshes and the odd tree were growing out of them, but no marker stakes. He gave Gillian the hand signal to throttle back even further so that Lone Eagle was barely ghosting along. Scattered sticks were sticking out of the water dead ahead. They looked like tree limbs stuck in the river bottom; some even had branches and leaves.

“Come to port five degrees,” he yelled back to Gillian. As Lone Eagle slowly came to port from their heading of 225°, he saw what he was hoping for. They were just sticks in the water, but they were also in line – a straight line. He had found the channel. They were at random intervals, but both the port ones and the starboard ones were in line. Incredible, he thought. I wonder who takes care of these?

The depth in the channel was as advertised in the guide. He had three feet under the keel all the way. The channel meandered a bit, but the sticks were there, and he was able to stay in the middle of it. They completed the ten-mile run and exited the lake back into the river, which at that point was holding at about a mile wide. He had a waypoint in for Mario’s Marina and could see that they were about a mile out from it. Gillian steered while he opened and started rummaging through the cockpit locker looking for the dock lines that they hadn’t used since Key West. He also dragged out the heavy 50-amp shore power cord. Wow, he thought, shore power. No more charging the batts and watching the amp meter every day and no more water making and cockpit Sun Showers. They would have electricity to run the AC and the fridge and would have hot running water showers, and the thought of a cold beer at the bar also popped into his head.

He raised the Dockmaster at Mario's on the VHF and was given docking instructions. He was told to come in port side to behind a ketch with a blue sheer stripe. He acknowledged the instructions and made his way up on deck to get the dock lines ready. He un-snapped three fenders off Baby Dink and placed them along the rail before returning to the cockpit. As they got closer, he scanned the marina for the ketch with the blue stripe and easily located it. They would be on the east side of the marina. Mario’s was at the end of a peninsula and was comprised of east and west side docks. On the east side, there were six boats with room for him and a couple more. On the tip of the island, there was a big building, the biggest on the peninsula with a palm frond roof and a dock with lots of inflatable dinghies tied to it that wrapped around the building. He could see the bar and restaurant and people sitting at tables. He could also see that the west dock extended at least a hundred yards down the peninsula and was home to thirty or more sailing yachts. Great place, he thought as he started his line up on their berth.

As they made their approach, he could see someone come up on deck on the ketch. He climbed onto the dock and took their lines as he slowly came alongside just behind him.

“Michael is my name.”

“Hi, I’m Rob, and this is Gillian. Nice boat. How long have you been here?” he replied.

“Got here a couple of weeks ago. We’ll be here for the season. My wife, Tina, and I are going to be here for one more week, and then we’re going off to explore some of the Mayan ruins.”

“Sounds like fun,” he replied. “What do you think of Mario’s?” he asked.

“Power is hit and miss, showers are a bit rough, but the food is good and cheap, and so is the rum, so not bad considering.”

He thanked Mike for his help, and they set about putting Lone Eagle to bed for the night. It had been a long day and a shower - any shower with running hot water sounded good to him.

Once the boat was tidied up, they went for a walk around the marina. The bar and restaurant were right on the water, and happy hour was well underway. There was a little tienda (store) that was stocked with all kinds of things. They even had freezers full of all types of frozen chicken, meat, and fish. They found the showers that did look a bit rough and also a shed with a drill press and a workbench with a vice. That will come in handy, he thought as they passed a set of tiny grass huts that were rented out to the gringos. The Dockmaster’s Office was alongside the tienda. He went in while Gillian continued her shopping. He had given her what was left of the hundred he broke in Livingston.

“Hello Lone Eagle, I’m Peter, I am the current dockmaster. Five cruisers own this place, and we take turns managing it. I’ll be turning it over to a guy named Kevin in a couple of months.”

“I’m Rob, and my partner is Gillian, and she is doing a bit of shopping in the tienda at the moment. What are you going to be doing after you turn over the marina to Kevin?”

“My wife and I will be going up into the mountains for a couple of months to live with a Guatemalan family and do a bit of farming and teaching English in the local school.”

“Sounds great. I’m hoping my Spanish will improve a bit while I’m here.”

“How long do you want to stay?”

“I figure six to seven months. We need to fly overseas for a couple of months and then come back for the New Year and head off for Panama.”

“You doing the Canal?”

“Yep, and then bound for Australia.”

“Wow,” Kevin replied. “Most of the cruisers here go back out into the Caribbean after the hurricane season. Don’t get too many going out into the Pacific. Tell you what, as you are staying with us for six to seven months, I’ll give you the yearly rate. That will be one hundred and sixty-seven dollars US a month – payable monthly in advance. Does that work for you?”

“Sure does. Thank you. Does that include shore power?”

“It does. And FYI, we do twice monthly runs in the van to Guatemala City, so if you need anything, we have a list you can add to in the tienda. We would appreciate it if you could advance the money for any purchase we need to make for you in Guat City. Otherwise, you can run a tab at the restaurant and tienda but it needs to be cleared each month when you pay your dockage.”

He thanked Peter and went into the tienda. Of course, there was a pile of stuff on the counter that Gillian had selected.

“Rob, this is Mary, Peter’s wife, she runs this wonderful little shop. They have everything here.”

“Please to meet you, Mary. I understand you will be going up in the mountains soon to do some teaching. I’m sure that it will be rewarding. The kids here look so happy.”

“I’m really looking forward to it. We did it last year, and I fell in love with the kids,” she replied as she handed Gillian the change.

“Thanks, Mary, I’m sure we will be seeing lots of each other,” he said as they turn for the door and headed down the path back to Lone Eagle. The marina grounds were lush, green, tropical, hot, and sticky. They had turned on the shore power, which was thankfully 110 volts and not 240 volts. The little AC unit in the companionway hatch was humming along and he could feel the rush of cool air as he slid the companionway hatch open.

He climbed below past the cold stream of air from the AC and took the shopping bags as she handed them down to him. Once they were both below, he closed the companionway hatch and switched on the 12-volt cabin lights – something he had rarely done while they were at anchor. They had always lit the oil lamps to conserve power. He checked the Link 10 battery monitor and saw that the battery charger was putting in 13.5 volts. Glad that still works, he thought. The last time that had been switched on was Key West.

With groceries stowed, they gathered up their shower kits and Pak Towels and headed for the showers. They really were a bit rough as he opened the door to the men’s side. He stripped off and stepped in onto the wooden floor grate and saw there were both hot and cold taps. As he looked up to the rusty rain shower head, he saw this strange looking canister that had been plumbed in just behind the showerhead that had two wires coming out of it with connecting wire nuts to a wire going up into the ceiling. That can’t be the hot water, he thought as he turned on the hot water tap. Sure enough, it was as he looked askance at the two-wire nuts and the rusty wires running 110 volts just above his head. You could get electrocuted right here, he thought as he adjusted the cold water and warily kept his eyes on the ancient wire nuts dangling above his head.

The shower was long and, thankfully, uneventful. The good news was that there was as much hot water as he wanted – no hot water tank to drain as long as those wire nuts held. Better keep an eye on them, he thought as he met up with Gillian waiting for him outside. Better not mention the wire nuts just yet as they headed back to the boat to drop their kits, hang their towels and head for the bar.

The bar was gorgeous with a wood floor where you could see the river through the cracks. There was all manner of flags and memorabilia on the walls and ceiling, and Oscar, the bartender, his soon-to-be new friend, was standing behind the bar to greet them. The place was busy with cruisers and some locals. They eagerly looked at the menu, and both ordered the spicy shrimp in pasta with garlic bread and a salad for four dollars, along with two rum and Cokes for two dollars each. Magic, he thought. The shrimp platters came out, and there had to be two dozen good size shrimp on each. Oscar told them that they were river shrimp and that the river was full of them and that they could buy them by the pound for four dollars in Fronteras.

The food and drinks were amazing. They would be eating here regularly, he thought as they headed back to Lone Eagle. Sleep would come easy tonight. AC, tied to a dock, no chance of an anchor drag, he thought as he pulled the companionway hatch closed and hit the rack.





CHAPTER XLII July 1, 2002 - Getting the lay of the land



Mario’s Marina, Guatemala

Lat: 15° 40’ 30.79” N, Long: 088° 58’ 57.46” W

As the first rays of sun started to stream into the cabin, he rolled over and pulled the covers up over his head – one more hour, he thought. He got the extra hour and woke to a cool cabin and the humming of the AC. Gillian was already up and the kettle started to whistle.

He climbed up into the cockpit and sat on the port side so that he could take in the view of the river. There wasn’t any wind, and the surface was a glistening mirror enshrouded in mist as the sun made its appearance. Everything was so still, and the quiet was only broken by the sounds of the birds – lots of them all squawking and darting through the trees. Perfect, he thought as he spied a young man in a loincloth in a small dugout canoe paddling along about a hundred yards off. He watched the boy as he stopped paddling and placed the paddle at the bottom of the canoe. As he did, he picked up a cast net and held it up over his head to get it ready for casting. It glistened in the early morning sun. He then wound-up and made a perfect arching cast. The net, glistening in the sun, looked like a giant spider’s web as it settled on the surface of the river.

Incredible. How do those guys keep their balance in those little narrow dugout canoes he thought as Gillian handed him his coffee and settled in beside him. They both sat there, taking in the idyllic scene as the boy threw the net for his second cast. As the net settled on the surface, the quiet was broken by the sound of a cell phone ringtone. It was loud and clear, and they both sat up to determine its source. How annoying, he thought as he looked around to see where it was coming from. As they turned their gaze back to the river, they saw the boy pull a flip phone out of his loincloth.

“My God, how far do we have to go to get away from those things?”

Her reply said it all, “Apparently, not far enough.”

“Well, there goes the neighborhood,” he replied.

“So, what's the plan for today? Are we going into town?” she asked.

“Yeah, let's take Big Dink over, but first, I want to find out whether they have a mechanic here. I’ve got some projects that I will need to get him working on.”

“Great. You go and find the mechanic, and I’ll get our laundry sorted – at least here, with the dock water, we won’t have to be making any water to do it.”

“Yeah, but we have to pickle that thing tomorrow. The manual says if you don’t use it for more than three days, you need to pickle it. I’ve got to read the manual this afternoon to see how hard pickling will be.”

He went up to the tienda and saw Peter in his office. He was on the VHF radio, so he waited outside his door. He heard the words Tres Punts, pirates and need a doctor. Peter was just finishing up the call, so he went into his office.

“That didn’t sound good. What was that about?” he asked.

“Seems that husband and wife cruisers were anchored off Tres Puntas to come into Livingston today, and they were boarded and attacked by pirates last night. The husband was cut up pretty badly. So was the wife. She is a nurse and was calling to find out if any of the marinas had a doctor who could stitch them up. La Tienda Marina said they had a doctor, so they are going there.”

The hair on the back of his neck was standing up and that foreboding feeling he had, came screaming back into his head.

“Geeze, we were there the night before last. That could have been us. Have there been any other recent attacks? The Northwest Caribbean net has never mentioned any.”

“There have been a few outboard motor thefts but no pirate boardings and attacks. Wrong place at the wrong time. Really sad. I hope they are okay.”

“Me too,” he replied.

The subject changed and he asked Peter about a mechanic. There was a guy by the name of Ron, and Peter said that he had seen him working on the yacht tied up just opposite the marina office. Peter mentioned that Ron was the owner of Midnight Marine, was quite a good mechanic, and that all the yachties were very happy with his work. He thanked Peter and walked over to the yacht across from the office just in time to see someone with very greasy hands holding some part with several hoses coming out of it, climbing on to the dock. He approached and introduced himself.

Ron seemed like a nice guy, and they walked over to his workshop, both lost in a conversation about what might be wrong with the pump Ron was holding. He was stunned when he entered Ron’s workshop. It was a good size with every imaginable piece of gear and motors of every size and description in various states of repair but mostly disrepair.

As Ron was working on the pump, he told him that he had several projects where he needed his help. Ron offered to stop by in the morning to have a look at what might be required, and he eagerly accepted his offer. “See you in the morning. Coffee will be hot,” he said as he headed back to Lone Eagle.

Back at the boat, he could see that Gillian was ready to go into town. He told her about the couple at Tres Puntas. She was visibly shaken. “That could have been us.”

“I know baby.”

They let the conversation drop. She had already put the soft-sided collapsible shopping trolly they had bought in Cancun into Big Dink along with their water bottles and wide-brimmed hats. It was going to be a hot day. He thought better of telling her about that foreboding feeling he had that night in Tres Puntas. Note to self. You feel it ever again, then go with your instincts and get the hell out of there.

He fired-up Big Dink’s motor, and they were away and began a slow pass around the peninsula occupied by the marina. There were all types of cruising sailing yachts tied along the finger piers that jutted-out from the main dock. There were a few people at the bar and a couple of inflatables at the dinghy dock. The marina also had a number of moorings just off the dock that had a couple of dozen yachts tied to them. Most of those looked a bit rough. As they motored by several of them, he could see why they looked so rough – mold, green mold, and it was covering everything. Not just sails and sail covers but everything – even the hulls were covered.

“That mold is going to be a big problem for us, baby. We’ve got to wash, dry, and stow every line and every bit of canvas before we head out of here. Otherwise, we’re going to come back to a hell of a mess.”

“That is going to be a problem. Easy enough to wash everything, but how do you dry it when it’s 100% humidity, and it rains every day.”

“I know, but we are going to have to try. We can’t come back to everything green,” he replied as he swung Big Dink out into the wide part of the river and brought her up to cruise speed for the twenty-minute run to Fronteras. The river was beautiful, and so was the breeze they were getting. It was a welcome relief from the sweltering heat and humidity.

Fronteras wasn’t easy to miss as it was on the north side of the river, and had a huge, concrete bridge that connected it to the little town of El Relleno to the south. The bridge was said to have been built by the US Army Corp of Engineers in the 1970s. It was an incredible structure with sixty-foot clearance at the center. Upriver from there was Lake Izabal. From the guide, he knew there was an old Spanish fort right on the river. That ought to be something to see, he thought.

As he scanned the Fronteras waterfront, there were dozens of pangas but, amongst them, he spotted a small dock where several inflatable tenders were tied. Quite a few of them actually, he noted as they got closer. This was going to be interesting. Those inflatables were three deep. He nosed his way in between them. The closest he could get was one away from the dock. They would have to climb over at least one inflatable to get ashore. They eventually did, and the locking cable was just long enough to make it around a piling.

They awkwardly made it up onto the dock with all of their gear and then walked through an alleyway stacked with cases of empty Coke and beer bottles and some rather smelly fishing nets until they got to the main road of the town. Dust, diesel fumes, and multi-colored buses were the first things to hit their senses. There were dozens of big trucks parked outside a row of little shops, and the chicken buses were lined up with luggage racks piled high with all manner of cargo, including crates of chickens, goats, and pigs. They looked like old US school buses. The aroma was pungent.

As they made their way to the central part of town, they stopped at a tiny little grocery store so that he could buy a phone card for a call to Australia. They had one, and as he was paying for it, he followed Gillian’s eyes that were focused on what could loosely be described as the deli counter. Behind it stood a young girl with a fan in her hand as she attempted to waive-off a determined swarm of flies that were trying to get to the raw meat laid out in rusty-looking trays. Better stick with the chicken, he thought as they made their way out to the busy street.

They found a phone booth, and he checked his watch and mentally did the time zone calculations. They were now two time zones west of east coast time, which would make it around 1600 in Australia as he punched in all the numbers. Moments later, he could hear her phone ringing and she picked up on the third ring.

“Hi mom, I’m in Guatemala.”

She was well. For a year after his dad’s death, she had been living with her sister Eunice at her place in the little town of Urunga thirty minutes south of Coffs Harbor on the New South Wales Mid-North Coast. It was hard for her living with her sister, so she had bought a little place two blocks away from Eunice six months earlier. She sounded good – settled thankfully, he thought. He confirmed their travel plans with her and told her that he had traded emails with his cousin Kay and that she confirmed that all of the study materials for the accounting course that he would be taking in October were now available at the College of Law. His mom told him that she would be going to Sydney next month to stay with her sister Thelma for a while and that she would go into Sydney and pick them up. All good on the Australia front, he thought as he said goodbye while watching some guy trying to get an unruly goat into a bamboo cage that he presumed would be placed atop one of the chicken buses.

Gillian was waiting for him. “I found the chicken lady that Mary told us about. Come and see the orange chicken she is selling. Mary told me it’s the corn they feed them that makes their meat look orange. Mary said they taste delicious. Let's get some for dinner.”

“Sure. Lead the way.”

The chicken really was bright orange, and they bought some. Not much else looked appealing, so they headed back to the dingy dock stopping at a small grocery store for some final things that Gillian wanted. It was a real, albeit small grocery store with air conditioning and a decent stock of goods. The AC was quite a relief from the dust and diesel fumes outside.

They shoved off from Fronteras and throttled up for the ride back to Mario’s. They pulled alongside Lone Eagle, and he handed-up the collapsible shopping trolly to Gillian. In the cockpit, the little AC unit was humming along. He pointed out to her the drain hose that he had attached to it that led to one of the cockpit sole drains. “See how much water it's putting out. That’s moisture; it’s sucking it out from the air in the cabin below.”

“I guess we’ll try to start washing and drying gear soon,” she replied as she slid the companionway hatch open and climbed down below.

“Baby, before you start unpacking, let me lift the lid on the cabin sole and get those teak pieces I’ve been saving. I want to take them up to the shop and see if I can work with them.”

She helped him with the hatch and handed the pieces of teak up to him. “Off to the shop. I’ll see you soon,” he said as he closed the companionway hatch and climbed over the lifelines and onto the dock. Michael was on the dock with an extension cord in one hand and a perplexed look on his face. “What’s up?” he asked him.

“We keep getting these power outages every night when those thunderstorms roll in. Every time that happens, our AC dies, and I have to come up on deck in the rain to fire-up the generator and re-run the AC power cord. I was just trying to figure out a way to wire the AC directly to the generator so that I don’t have to get wet every night changing the power cords.”

“It looks like your AC is plugged into the dock box. If you plugged it into an outlet on your boat instead, then when the power goes off and you fire-up your generator, it should get power because the generator will be powering the outlets on board the boat.”

“You’re a genius, Rob.”

“You’re welcome, Michael. Gotta run to the workshop and make some sawdust. We’ll catch up later,” he replied as he headed up the dock.

The workshop was little more than four walls, a tin roof, and a workbench with a vice and a very tired-looking drill press. What he needed was a band saw, and a table saw. This is going to interesting. I’m going to have to do everything with hand tools. Great, he thought as he placed the teak pieces he’d been carrying on the bench. A further look around didn’t reveal much. Just some scraps of wood and a couple of old, rusty tools that had seen better days. He headed back to the boat and filled a tool bag with all of the hand tools that he thought he was going to need and made the trek back to the shop.

His first project was to take the pattern that he created in Mexico for the mainsheet traveler splash board he wanted to make. He traced the pattern onto the teak board and then placed the board into the vice and started sawing with the little coping saw that he had brought with him. An hour or so later and a lot of sweat and sawdust produced what looked like a pretty good splashboard. The mainsheet traveler was a powder-coated I-beam that spanned most of the cabin top. The underside of it was six inches above the cabin top. The clear Viback dodger that Gus had been using was attached to the traveler I-beam. It kept most of the rain out but would let a wave sloshing across the cabin top slide right into the cockpit. He knew there would be plenty of ‘green ones’ sloshing across the cabin top that he had to keep out of the cockpit, and the splashboard fixed to the traveler I-beam was the only way he could think of to do it.

He was pleased with what he had done and headed back to the boat to see how well it fit against the cabin top. He hoped the template he made in Mexico was close to being right. He was delighted to see that it was when he checked the fitting. A couple of minor adjustments with a rasp and a bit of sandpaper was all it would take as he saw the companionway hatch slid open, and Gillian asked from below, “How did it go, Cap?”

“Great. A couple of minor adjustments and this one is done. How are you doing?”

“Lunch is ready. How does orange chicken salad sandwiches sound?”

“Great. Let's see if that orange chicken is as good as Mary said it would be.”

It was. In fact, it was probably the best tasting chicken that they had ever had. Amazing flavor. “The corn they feed them makes them taste so good.”

“What's the plan for this afternoon?” he asked.

“I’ve got to email Marge about our flights and do a few catch-up emails with my brother and a few people to let them know we’re in Guatemala.”

“Why don’t you do that and I’ll go and make the final adjustments to our new splashboard. Then we can hit the showers and head for the bar for a sundowner and some dinner. How does that sound?”

“Perfect. See you a bit later,” she replied as he climbed onto the dock, splashboard in hand, and she slid the companionway hatch closed to work on her emails.

A rasp, a bit of sandpaper, and a fair bit of sawdust later and the splashboard was finished. He left the shop and was headed back to the boat when he saw an old guy with an arm-load of string bags trying to step off his boat onto the dock. “Hang on, I’ll give you a hand,” he said as he put the splashboard down and reached up to take some of the string bags.

“Thanks for your help. I’m Harry.”

“I’m Rob, and you’re welcome.”

“Good to meet you Rob, my wife Helen and I are going to Guat City this afternoon for a doctor's appointment.”

“Are you catching a panga taxi and then taking the chicken bus?”

“No. We’re hitching a ride with Mary in the van. She makes the trip every two weeks, so we try and make our doctor’s appointments around her schedule.”

“That is certainly better than the chicken bus. Let me help you carry these bags over to the van.”

He hoisted the last bag into the van. Harry was really grateful and said he would catch up with him when he and Helen got back. Nice guy, he thought as he headed back to Harry’s boat to pick up the splashboard. When he arrived, a guy was leaning over and inspecting it. “Nice piece of work. I’m Tom, and I share the finger pier with Harry. I try and help him as much as I can.”

“Good to meet you. I’m Rob, and that looks like my partner, Gillian coming down the dock.”

He introduced Gillian, and Tom explained that Harry’s wife, Helen, was quite sick and that she and Harry made trips to Guat City a couple of times a month. He said he thought it was cancer but had never asked, and Harry hadn’t volunteered. He said that he had learned that both Harry and Helen were retired State Department employees and had been living at Mario’s for the past ten years ever since Harry did in his back, and they could no longer go cruising.

“US dollar does stretch a bit further here, doesn’t it?”

“Yeah, lots of ex-pats here. Hey, my wife, Joanne, just baked a fresh loaf of bread. Can you smell it? Would you guys like to come aboard and try a piece?”

Just then, Joanne popped her head out of their companionway hatch. “Hi Rob and Gillian, I’m Joanne. Welcome aboard Thunder. Were glad to meet you.”

As was the norm, the ladies were in the galley, and the guys were in the cockpit. After a few minutes, beautiful, thick slices of toast dripping in butter and coffee were handed up. The fresh-baked bread was delicious. Both ladies joined them with Gillian announcing, “Isn’t this bread fantastic? Joanne has offered to teach me how to make it.”

“That’s wonderful. Thanks, Joanne. Your bread is the best I’ve ever tasted. I look forward to Gillian learning your secrets and practicing on me. Hey, Tom tells me you guys are from Tampa. I once worked in Clearwater. Great spot.”

Joanne explained that this was their first year out cruising and told them that Thunder was a wreck when they bought her and that they both had spent two years fixing her up in Tampa. Joanne said they were going to hang out at Mario’s for the season and then head out to Roatan and Utila.

“I hear Roatan and Utila are gorgeous spots. We’ll be passing by them on our way to Cabo Gracias A Dios.”

“You guys doing Panama?” Tom asked.

“We are, and then on to Australia,” he replied.

The conversation lasted the better part of an hour, and they all agreed to meet up in the bar for drinks and dinner later that afternoon.

“I really like Joanne,” Gillian said on the way back to the boat.

“Yeah, Tom is great too. They have done some beautiful work on Thunder. Dinner tonight should be a lot of fun. Do you think you will be able to replicate that loaf of bread?”

“I think so, but it’s going to take some practice, and I am really going to have to become really good at using our oven. I’m really not interested in lighting the burner when it’s 100 degrees. Maybe I’ll just write down the recipe and practice as we cruise along, although doing it in port will probably be a lot easier than doing it while we’re underway.”





CHAPTER XLIII August 2002 - The Marathon at Mario’s



Mario’s Marina, Guatemala

Lat: 15° 40’ 30.79” N, Long: 088° 58’ 57.46” W

The next morning, he got out the two new bilge pumps that Ron was going to help him install and got organized for what he hoped would be a straight-forward installation. He had bought the two new bilge pumps, a float switch, and a high-water alarm back in Marathon and just hadn’t had time to install them before they left Florida. Had he had the alarm during the cockpit drain leak he had in Cuba, he would have been alerted to the leak rather than discovering it during one of his fifteen-minute engine room checks.

He would sleep better with two fixed bilge pumps – both alarmed and a portable one that could double in an emergency and for everyday use like pumping out Big Dink after heavy rain. His biggest concern was hitting a container mid-ocean that had fallen off a container ship. A friend of his who was in the commercial marine insurance industry had told him that when they wrote the insurance policies for the container ship companies that they assumed a 15% loss of containers on every voyage. He found that number deeply troubling. A lot of cruisers had hit them at sea with devastating results. They said it was like hitting a brick wall. Most boats were so severely damaged by the collision they just sunk. Other cruisers had told of spotting them floating barely at the surface, so they were impossible to see until you were right on top of them. Another had told of spotting one just at the surface and shooting a couple of holes into it to let the trapped air out so that it could sink. While most did sink, it was the ones that floated that really worried him.

While Baby Dink was stowed upright on the cabin top and ready to go as their lifeboat in just a couple of minutes, having the extra time afforded by a second bilge pump would give him a few more valuable minutes to either decide whether to use the crash mat that he had at the ready or abandon ship. It just increased the odds of survival a little more.

As he finished his coffee, Ron showed up, and within less than half an hour, they had it done and tested. Ron really did know his stuff, and he asked him if he had any fiberglass fabrication experience, which he said he did. Ron invited him back to his shop and showed him his latest project, which was an exhaust mixer that he had made out of fiberglass. Wow, he thought, my stainless steel one doesn’t look that good.

“Hey Ron, do you think you could make one of those for me?”

“Sure. I just saw yours, so I know how big to make it. Go take yours off and bring it to me, and I will make sure we use the same mount points.”

“Will do,” he replied.

The projects continued in the weeks ahead. Gillian had washed and hung the mainsail, the Genny, and the staysail on the lines he had strung between palm trees. It was a laborious process that took three days owing to the 1400 downpour that occurred every day, which required the partially dried sails to be bundled up and stowed before it started to rain. They weren’t nicely folded until they were dry, which meant bundles of sails stuffed daily into the already stuffed forepeak. They had to do the same for all the halyards and sheet lines. First, they ran messenger lines up through the mast and then washed the lines and hung them all over the boat – hundreds of feet of them. The halyards and sheet ropes took even longer to dry than the sails, and they too needed to be dragged undercover at the first sign of rain.

July rapidly turned into August, and they were removing more items on their to-do list than they were adding. Gillian was tireless and had her own projects including, managing the provisions they had and those they would need. She kept herself busy making lists of those things they would need for the 30+ days at sea they were going to have when they hit the Pacific. The lists of what needed to be bought in Balboa on the Pacific side of the Canal ran pages.

One morning he needed some seizing wire that he had stowed in a soft-sided tool bag that was stowed under the cabin sole. Gillian was sitting on the settee, and as she moved her legs, he lifted the hatch. It was a huge space where they had stored a lot of gear. As they both took in the view, he said, “I sure wish that we had a removal fuel tank in there. It would be a great spot for one. Low and on the centerline.”

“Do you really think we’re going to need more diesel fuel?” she asked. “You have ten jerry cans lashed on deck. Won’t that be enough?”

“Maybe, but we have thousands of miles in the Doldrums of no wind five degrees on either side of the Equator and three out of the ten jerry cans contain motor oil, kerosene for the stove and oil lamps and one with vodka marked as water to evade the local customs guys. That leaves seven 20 liter jerry cans with fuel or 140 liters plus another 130 in the internal fuel tank. At a cruising speed of five knots and a burn rate of three liters an hour that give us about 2,200nm range. I’d be a lot happier with 3,000nm of range.”

“There is a lot of gear down there that we will have to find other homes for. I think I can do it, but where are you going to get a fuel tank to fit in there. Is it going to be built-in and permanent? We won’t need it when we get to Oz.”

“I think Ron and I can build a removable tank out of fiberglass, and we can use the fuel transfer pump that we have to move fuel from one tank to the other.”

“How many more liters will that give us?”

“I’m hoping for 130.”

“Have you talked to Ron about it? How much do you think it will cost?”

“I haven’t and probably two hundred dollars if we’re lucky.”

“Have a chat with him and see what he thinks. In the meantime, I’ll give some thought to where we’re going to stow all the gear that comes out of there. How about you go talk to him, and we meet up at the bar for a cold one. I’m done for the day.”

“I’ll talk to him tomorrow. I saw him earlier, and he said he had to go out and bring in a boat off a mooring this afternoon as the owner was due back at the end of next week, and the owner wanted the boat brought into the dock, cleaned up, and ready. Let's head to the bar now for that cold one. It’s been a long day and some barbequed shrimp and a cold beer sound really good.”

The beer was cold, and the shrimp were delicious. Oscar was certainly a grill master. They talked through their to-do list and also the list of everything they would be taking to Australia to lighten the load. There were all kinds of clothing and all sorts of things they wouldn’t be needing. It would be tropical cruising and lighter was better. The quiet of the afternoon broke when, off in the distance, they could see a dinghy coming straight for the dock at full throttle with two guys in it both frantically yelling help, help, help.

As they got closer, he could see that it was Ron and one of Mario’s dockhands. They came in so fast he thought they were going to collide with the dock. Both looked really red and almost in shock. Everyone in the bar ran down to them. Ron stammered – “Bees. Bees in the mast.” As he said the words, he collapsed on the dock. Both men were covered by hundreds of bee stings. You could see all the stingers protruding out of every inch of their skin. Their eyes were swelling shut, and their lips were blowing up like balloons. Both were violently shaking.

Mary came running out of the tienda to see what all the commotion was about. She said she was a nurse and calmly told everybody to go get their med packs and as many pairs of tweezers that they could find – all of those stingers had to be pulled out of the guys.

Everyone was back in minutes and was instructed to go through their med-packs in search of any Eppipens or vials and syringes containing Atropine as she told everyone that the boys could go into anaphylactic shock. He had two Eippipens, and four more were found in the other med packs. The guys were placed on the picnic tables in the bar, and all of the women sat there, six to a man with three on each side sitting on the picnic benches. They started the painful process of removing the stingers one by one with the tweezers. It took a while but all the women working on them were fast, methodical and gentle.

Ron was the first to speak and said that he had gone out to the boat that was in storage on the mooring and was about to untie it from the mooring and tow it in when Jose, the dockhand, had pulled on a halyard. As he did, it tore through a bee’s nest inside the top of the mast, and a swarm of bees came out and descended upon them. He said that they dove over the side to get away from them but had to climb onto the inflatable to get away, which is when they got them both.

He listened intently and saw how much unimaginable pain they both were in. Mental note to self, he thought. Always look up at the top of the mast before you pull a halyard. If you see bees come out, run like hell or jump overboard.

Once the stinger removal process was complete, Ron and Jose were wrapped in blankets and given lots of fluids. Mary kept a close eye on them for any signs that they were going into shock. The overall red color on the guys was replaced by hundreds of swollen red welts.

An hour or so later, the two were stable and had taken in a lot of fluids. Both announced that they wanted to go home and sleep. Mary gave them some pain killers that had Codeine so that they would get some sleep.

“I think I’ve had enough excitement for one day,” he said. “Let's head back to the boat. I want to pick up my shower kit and catch a shower before dinner.”

Gillian picked up their med-pack, and they headed back to the boat. “Why don’t you go and hit the showers and I’ll get dinner started. I had my shower earlier.”

“See you in a little while,” he said as he climbed onto the dock. It had been a long day. The showers were empty, so he walked right in and organized his shower kit. The water was warm and refreshing and felt good on his sore muscles. It was good to get rid of all that sawdust that just turned into mud on his body.

He had just rinsed off and was about to shut off the water when he felt a strange tingling sensation. Electricity! He leaped out of the shower pan and landed on the wood drain lattice and looked up to see the exposed wires around the wire nuts smoldering, and then there was a bright blue flash and a loud pop which was when the lights went out. Geeze, that was close, he thought as he found his flashlight in his shower kit. The beam of his flashlight showed that the wire nuts held melted, the wires had fused and the little hot water canister above the showerhead melted.

We’ll all be using the ladies showers, he thought as he headed to the tienda to let Mary know of the incident so that she could organize repairs.

Back at the boat, Gillian was sitting in the cockpit with sundowners.

“Thanks, I need that,” he said as he drained half the glass. “Had a bit more excitement in the showers.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, there was an electrical short, a blue flash a bit of smoke, and I was almost electrocuted.”

“What?”

He went on to explain. It was funny and scary at the same time, but he knew it had been a really close call. Wow, getting electrocuted in a shower in Guatemala. Not the ending he expected, he thought and then changed the subject.

“Hey, Ron has finished the Raytheon auto tiller pilot install, and we’ve got to take Lone Eagle out in the river to swing the fluxgate compass that runs it. Let’s take her out and go up past Fronteras to Lake Izabal and have a look at Castillo de San Felipe.”

“That sounds like fun. It would be great to get Lone Eagle out for a spin. We’ve been at this dock for two months. I’ll make lunch in the morning.”

Castillo de San Felipe was a fort built by the Spanish in the 1600s along the narrowest part of the Rio Dulce River, which they used for several centuries and had been repeatedly attacked by pirates. He was looking forward to seeing it.

The next morning, they motored their way upriver and under the bridge at Fronteras. They arrived at Lake Izabal at 1000 and passed Castillo de San Felipe close to starboard. It was a fantastic structure designed to control traffic on the river. The stone masonry was incredible. It was said that the Spanish would stretch a chain across the river at night to prevent pirate traffic.

They headed upstream to a wider part of the lake and Gillian took the tiller while he attached the Raytheon auto tiller pilot, turned on the control panel and read through the steps in the manual to begin the process of swinging the boat in a big circle until the fluxgate compass got its bearings – mostly it had to figure out where north was.

They followed the steps in the manual and made dozens of circles in the river. Each time they thought they had it, they set the tiller pilot to a course and watched it steer that compass course. It worked fine for a couple of minutes but would then lose its little mind and swing the tiller hard to one side or another. They tried and tried. He read the manual again and again but to no avail. That one thousand four hundred dollars piece of gear wouldn’t work. “Well, baby, no luck today. I’ll email Raytheon when we get back to the dock and see what they have to say. I have no idea. The install was by the book. Let's go have another closer look at the castle and then head back to Mario’s.”

It hadn’t been the best of days. He was counting on that auto tiller pilot steering Lone Eagle when there wasn’t enough wind for Monitor to work. He knew he had to get it fixed.

He emailed Raytheon as soon as they got back to Mario’s and traded emails several times with them that afternoon. The only idea the guy at Raytheon had was to change the location of the fluxgate compass that was currently positioned under the nav station.

The next morning, he got Ron to help with the repositioning of it. They placed it with little difficulty under the galley sink and then headed out in the river to do some doughnuts to swing it. No luck this time, either. She would hold a course for a couple of minutes and then swing the boat violently to port or to starboard. He could use the remote control to bring her back on course, but she would only hold it for a few minutes. After about an hour of trying, they headed back to Mario’s.

“Looks like I’m going to be relying on Monitor,” he said as Ron stepped ashore.

“Good plan, Rob.”

Once he had Lone Eagle put away, he walked over to Thunder to see how Gillian and Joanne were doing. Gillian was burning more CDs.

“Hey, how did you go?” she asked from Thunder’s cockpit.

“Same as yesterday. Ron and I tried everything. Just can’t get the damn thing to work. I am going to sell it at the next treasures of the bilge swap meet.”

“Will we be alright with just Monitor?”

“Well, you know more about it than I do. You sold it to me, so I am really counting on my onboard tech support that you are going to be providing.”

‘Very funny, Cap. I have, however, been told that they do really perform well in light air, so we’re just going to have to see – aren't we?

She climbed onto the dock from Thunder with a big box of CDs and assured him that there were some great ones that she had burned. “Well, baby, that was the last project. Let’s hit the showers and then go to the bar and get some chow. I’m starving and tomorrow we start the pack and stow adventure. It’s got to be better than the wash and dry one that we’ve been on.”





CHAPTER XLIV September 10, 2002 - The Chicken Bus



Guatemala City, Guatemala

Lat: 14° 36’ 41.29” N, Long: 90° 33’ 48.99” W

It was now the first of September. They had been at Mario’s for two months, and Ron had just finished the cabin sole fuel tank. It fit perfectly and gave them the hoped-for 130 liters of fuel plus a bit more. They had re-plumbed the head (toilet) directly overboard and converted the holding tank to storage. He had found a piece of plexiglass and had been able to make the teak instrument boxes for the Furuno and for the engine control panel. Both were advertised as waterproof, but he wasn’t interested in putting that to the test. Those instrument covers would certainly protect the Furuno and engine instruments if they took a big green one in the cockpit. All of the sails and halyards had been washed, dried, and were stowed in the workshop. They had lots of gear stowed in the workshop.

The panga water taxi to Fronteras was arranged, and the chicken bus they would catch would be the daily noon bus to Guat City. Mary lined up the hotel in Guat City for them that she often used on her bi-weekly sojourns there for provisions. What was left was the packing of all the gear they would be taking to Australia. The EPIRB needed new batteries. Cruising guides of places they had already been were being brought back to Oz – the list was endless.

While most of the gear to be stowed aboard Lone Eagle was in the workshop, all the gear they were going to be taking to Oz was stuffed in all manner of places on the boat. It was an ever-present reminder that on a cruising yacht, you would tear it apart during the day for a project and then put it all back together at the end of the day so that you had a place to eat and sleep. Such was their life for the next week.

On the morning of September 9th – their departure day came very early. Four large duffel bags containing all the gear they were taking back to Australia were moved onto the foredeck and covered with a tarp. All the gear that was stored in the workshop had to be brought back to the boat. It took two hours and lots of sweat to do it. Having completed the task, they turned to moving all of it that was now piled on the dock onto the boat and then dragging it below. Everything had to be moved below including, Big Dink deflated and in its pack, its empty fuel tank, the Yamaha outboard, and all kinds of other gear that they couldn’t or didn’t want to stow in Baby Dink. Then the process of stretching and tying down blue tarps over the boom, and the foredeck began. By the time it was over, they were exhausted and had just enough time to hit the showers before the panga water taxi arrived.

The panga ride to Fronteras was great. The panga had twin 200hp Yamaha outboards and flew down the river. The breeze was so stiff that it was almost cold. The four big duffel bags between them plus two rucksacks were a heavy load. The chicken bus was waiting for them, and he helped the bus driver get their duffle bags onto the bus’s roof rack that was already stuffed with mountains of other people’s gear, not to mention two cages of chickens, one cage with a goat and two with pigs. He inspected the bus driver’s tie-down knots. He had done this before – they will hold, he thought. The smell of the animals and everyone’s sweat made the odor quite pungent. He hoped that with all the windows open that they would soon get a breeze.

It was a five-hour ride through the mountains to Guatemala City. The bus got away on time and was packed with passengers. They were able to find a seat together one row back from an old lady holding a chicken in her lap that didn’t look very friendly and kept trying to fly only to be pulled down and almost smothered by the old lady.

The bus was headed up the dusty foothill roads toward the cloud-shrouded mountains that could be seen in the distance. The roads were dirt and full of potholes. It made for a jarring first few hours. Having climbed the foothills, the bus began making its way up into the mountains. They were in the jungle with wildlife at every turn. Then came the switch-back hairpin turns that would take them higher and higher. There were no guardrails, and as they climbed higher, the drop off became hundreds of feet to the jungle floor. He was sitting by the window and could arch himself higher in his seat to see how little road the tires of the bus had and how big the drop off was.

All of a sudden, the bus driver yelled, “Movimento el derecho,” and everyone on the left side of the bus dove for the right side of the bus literally on top of the passengers. It wasn’t long before they figured out that the bus driver’s Spanish meant move to the right, apparently to get all the weight off the left wheels that were perilously close to sliding off the cliff and onto the right wheels that were the only thing keeping them from the jungle hundreds of feet below.

They quickly learned both the left and right Spanish ‘move’ commands and did as instructed. It went on for hours, and each time was a hold-your-breath exercise. The road down the mountain was even scarier. The bus driver was a master at downshifting. His only concern was that the breaks and the transmission wouldn’t let go. Meeting up with another vehicle going in the opposite direction was simply terrifying. Apparently, the custom was for the two drivers to agree on who would back up to the nearest point where the vehicles could safely pass. Whoever was closest to the wider point would do the backing up. They had to do it twice, and each time the bus driver had to rely on his mirrors with terrified passengers telling him how close his tires were to the edge of the cliff.

As they rumbled their way down the mountain, he could see that they would soon be in the foothills on the western side. What a relief. The rest of the ride was uneventful except that the old lady with the chicken lost her grip on him, and he went straight out the window. The bus driver, thankfully, didn’t stop to get him. The woman looked shattered.

The foothills gave way to suburbia if you could call it that. Abject poverty and dust was a better description. There were clouds of dust billowing from every vehicle on the choked roads. The traffic increased as they entered the more urban areas. When they arrived at the bus terminal, there were dozens of chicken buses and hundreds of people pulling, dragging, and carrying bags and suitcases of every description. The noise from dozens of caged animals was deafening, and all of them thought it was a good idea to relieve themselves after their long bus rides, so walking was made interesting and slippery.

Their bus driver was on the roof of the bus tossing down bags and bundles. He was almost knocked flat when his big, blue duffel bag with the heaviest gear was tossed down to him. With their duffel bags safely back in their possession, they made their way over to some awaiting taxis. They had the address of the hotel written in Spanish on a piece of paper and handed it to the driver who looked at it, nodded, and then stood on the accelerator. He thought taxi drivers in Italy were nuts. This guy put them to shame.

A few minutes and some hair-raising moments later, they arrived at what was purported to be their hotel. It was a big square block building with a gate and intercom. All the windows had bars on them. They made their way through the gate after a bit of halting Spanish and located the front desk – also behind bars. They paid for the night and were given a room key. As they left the office and started looking for their room number, they could see that even the rooms facing the interior courtyard had bars on them, and the doors were made of steel.

The room wasn’t much, but it did have a big bed and a decent shower. What was even better was the little window AC unit actually worked. They were exhausted. They had asked the front desk guy about any restaurants in the area. No luck. They would have to take a cab to the center of the city. The desk clerk said it was a twenty-minute ride. They hadn’t eaten the sandwiches that Gillian had made for lunch, so they opted to hit the showers and stay in their room and have a dinner of the sandwiches and snacks that she had brought with them. Not the best meal, but better than going out into an unfamiliar and obviously dangerous part of town after dark.

The next morning, they were awake by 0600, and, fortunately, the front desk attendant made them some much-needed coffee. Gillian’s Spanish was better than his, and she learned there was a little cantina down the block where they could get some pastries for breakfast. It wasn’t much, but it did fill them up. The front desk attendant told them it was a thirty-minute cab ride to the airport.

Their flight was at noon, so they didn’t waste any time getting to the airport as he had no idea how long it would take to get through security. They had a five-hour direct flight to LAX on Delta. He was sure glad that it was a US carrier. They made it to the check-in counter three hours before departure and checked in the four big duffle bags. They were very overweight as he expected. He paid the excess baggage charge with his credit card. It wasn’t as bad as he thought it would be.

With boarding passes in-hand, they made their way to security screening. They tossed their rucksacks on the X-ray conveyor belt and walked through the metal detector and waited on the other side. He could see the operator had stopped the conveyor and was peering at the screen and looking at his rucksack. Nothing in there, he thought as the operator said something unintelligible to the nearby security guard who picked up his bag and motioned him to an inspection table at the end of the conveyor. The security guard opened the bag and reached into the internal pocket and pulled out a pair of navigational dividers (used to measure distances on nautical charts). They were his father’s dividers, and he would need them when he purchased more charts in Australia.

The security guard insisted that he could not take them on the plane and that he was confiscating them. Gillian was able to get enough Spanish out so that the guard understood that they were his father’s and that he wanted them to be put in one of his checked-in bags. A discussion ensued between the guard and his supervisor, who inspected the pair of dividers and instructed them to sit in a holding area.

They waited and waited glancing at each other and their watches as boarding time neared. It was getting close, he thought just as a new guard came out of a nearby door with a rifle slung across his should and motioned him to follow him back through the door. He did, and the walk took them down a dimly lit hallway to a room where two more guards with guns were stationed outside. He was ushered into the room. It had to be the interrogation room as there were a pair of handcuffs bolted to the table, a dimly glowing light bulb hanging above, and two more guards with rifles positioned at opposite ends of the table. In the middle of the table was his big blue duffel bag. It looks like they will put the dividers in the bag, and I’ll be out of here, he thought.

He confirmed that it was his bag, and the first guard leaned over it and pulled the zipper back. A look of horror came over his face and he yelled, “Bomba, bomba!” The rifles were lowered and aimed at him as he tried to calmly reply, “No bomba, no bomba.” The guard was still terrified as he peered down into the duffle bag and stared at his bright yellow Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) that he was bringing back to Australia for new batteries. Its little test light was flashing red every few seconds, and it terrified the guard.

The guard called for another guard to come in, and his English was a little better. He explained that he was the captain of a yacht, and the thing with the flashing light was an EPIRB – a radio. This new guard was coming around but said it would be up to the pilot to decide if he would allow it on his plane. Relief, he thought. The pilot – a Delta pilot, an English-speaking pilot would know precisely what an EPIRB was – hell, he thought, they have them on the plane.

A few minutes later, the pilot entered the room. He was American, and after a short explanation and a brief examination of the EPIRB and the dividers, he was on his way back to the holding area. Gillian looked relieved but incredibly concerned and looked at her watch. “What took you so long? Are you all alright? You look like you just saw a ghost.”

“Did you ever see the movie Midnight Express? Sort of like that, but this time they saw the EPRIB and thought it was a bomb.”

“I think we’re going to miss our flight.”

“I don’t think so. I just met our pilot – nice guy. I’ll tell you later. Let's get a move on to the gate. I don’t think he is going to leave without us.”

They were wheels up and heading northward on the five-hour flight to LA. He filled her in on his Midnight Express adventure, and they settled back, had a couple of drinks, a meal, and then some blissful sleep. He was glad to be heading back to the US of A. Some real food would be nice too. The customs episode in Guat City wasn’t surprising. It was almost the eve of the first anniversary of 911, and he could just imagine how tight security was going to be at LAX.

Once on the ground, they picked up their bags and went to the customs line for returning US citizens. They cleared right through and caught a cab for the short ride to the cheap airport hotel that they had booked. The room was typical, but to them, it was five stars considering what they had been through. All around them were strip malls and plenty of fast food places. A good steak and a cold beer was their plan. Sleep came to them quickly that night.

The next morning, they grabbed a cab and headed into downtown LA to visit the Australian consulate. Gillian had been assured via email before they left that her visitor's visa would be waiting for her. It was. Off to an ATM was their next destination to pull some greenbacks since all they had were Guat dollars.

They got back to the hotel, and shortly thereafter, Gillian’s best friend Maggie and her husband Ed arrived. Maggie had helped them with all of their travel arrangements, and Ed couldn’t take his eyes off one of the charts of the Pacific that he had spread across the bed. They settled up with Maggie and took them to lunch. Fortunately, they had a car and after lunch asked if they needed to be driven anywhere which, of course, Gillian had a list.

The next day was the anniversary of 911, and they had a 1600 Qantas flight to Sydney. That morning they took a bunch of gear and headed for the post office. Shipping it was less expensive than the excess baggage charge would be, so they didn’t hesitate. A bit lighter, they headed for LAX. Check-in security was very tight. This time the dividers were in his checked bag.

It was a 14-hour flight, and they slept as long as they could. The Cruising Guide for Panama was his reading material, while Gillian caught up on the latest in-flight movies. He had the window seat and just stared out into the vast Pacific Ocean - all 12,000 miles of it. In the plane, 600 miles an hour, you were there in 14 hours. On Lone Eagle, at 6 miles per hour, it would take them seven months to cross it. God be with us, he thought.

Once they were wheels down in Sydney, they had an hour layover until their one hour flight to Coffs Harbor where his mom and aunt would be waiting for them. As they made their approach to the Coffs Harbor Airport, they flew over the Coffs Harbor Marina. “That’s where Lone Eagle will make her first landfall in Australia baby. Isn’t it a stunning spot?”

“We’ll have to check out the marina while we’re there. It does look like a lovely spot.”

He hadn’t been to his mother’s new place that she purchased since his last trip. It was a little three bedroom, one bath house a block away from her sister Eunice’s place in the small town of Urunga about thirty minutes south of Coffs Harbor. Urunga was at the confluence of the Kalang and Bellingen Rivers right on the ocean. The water was turquoise blue and the deserted beaches stretched for as far as the eye could see. And yes, there was that Pacific Ocean that he was going to cross. Looking out on it, the nearest land was South America, 12,000 miles away. There was absolutely nothing in between.

They brought their bags in and dropped them in the spare bedroom. There was nothing else in the room. All of his possessions, including his king-size bed, had been shipped over in the 40-foot container and had been unloaded into his mom’s single car garage. I hope the bed is close to the front, he thought as he slowly lifted the garage door and surveyed the remnants of his past life. It was almost like unearthing a time capsule. There were all the memories of what was once his life. He pushed down the emotions really hard. He knew there would be tears if he didn’t.

It took a couple of hours, but the bed, dresser, and nightstands had all been moved into the spare bedroom. He even found the box marked linens and found a set of king sheets for the bed. The other spare bedroom had a card table, a desk lamp, and a large pile of books. Oh God, he thought. I’ve got less than two weeks before classes start, and I’ve got to get through all of that before then. What was before him was daunting. What if he didn’t pass this time, and he wasn’t eligible to practice in Australia? Would he skip the Pacific trip and just knock around the Caribbean until the money ran out? Or, would he have to sail back to Washington with his tail between his legs? You gotta pass is all he muttered to himself as he leafed through one of the accounting books.

The days passed quickly, but they did take one afternoon to go to the Coffs Harbor Marina. He had been there on his last trip, but this was different. Then sailing to Australia had been just a hair-brain idea. Now it was real. They stopped in at the dockmaster’s office to get an idea of the dockage rates. While there, they picked up a copy of the Witworths Marine Chandlery Catalogue. One of their stores was in St. Leonards, where he would be taking his prep class. That will come in handy.

They walked out to Mutton Bird Island that was an island just offshore that was made part of the protected marina by a long rock causeway that stretched from the shore out to the island. The view from the top was breathtaking. He could see Solitary Island off to the northeast with its lighthouse, which he knew would guide him into the marina. The marina itself was entirely protected by rock walls. It had a good size fishing fleet and a fisherman’s cooperative brimming with fresh seafood. Fish and chips were lunch as they sat outside and took in the buzz of the harbor. “Better get back to hitting the books,” he said as they fed their last chips to some hungry seagulls and headed for the car.





CHAPTER XLV November 2002 - The Seven Santas



Sydney, Australia

Lat: 35° 51’ 24.42” S, Long: 151° 12’ 55.07” W

For ten days, he studied eight hours a day while Gillian hung out with his mom, her sister Eunice and his cousin Tina and her kids. Eunice was great. She took Gillian sightseeing and shopping. Christmas wasn’t far off, but for him, it would be all studying until the accounting exam was over at the end of November. Then he could have some fun in December assuming he passed it, which for him was an ever-present fear.

Gillian had lined up a cheap hotel not far from the College of Law in St Leonards in North Sydney, where the prep class would be held. The ten days of self-study in Urunga was over, and they were on a flight back to Sydney. The hotel Gillian found had tiny rooms, and the desk was barely big enough for a book. Before unpacking, Gillian went back to the front desk and approached the desk clerk and explained his need to study. The woman told her about a basement room they had that was vacant and went on to explain that it was a big room with a king-size bed, a kitchenette, and a conference table. It was perfect. They moved their bags, and Gillian checked out the kitchenette – “This will work,” she said and grabbed her purse and headed for the door – “Going to do a bit of shopping for dinner.”

The prep class was to begin in the morning, and he had never been to the College of Law. When Gillian returned, and with map-in-hand, they headed out to find the law school and to see what was nearby as the course would be for two weeks with classes of four hours each afternoon. Within blocks of the law school, they found the Witworths Chandlery and also a marine book store. It was a Sunday afternoon and both were closed but it seemed that everything was coming together.

The first half of the two-week prep program was devoted to all the regulatory requirements for client trust fund accounting. Boring was an understatement. The second half was devoted to sample test-taking, learning how to handle the timing, and figuring out the tips and tricks to getting through the exam at a pace that would enable him to finish all the questions within the allotted time. By the time he finished the class, he knew it had been a worthwhile investment. There was no way he could have passed the exam without it. His confidence was increasing with each sample test. His timing was right, and his percentage correct was even better. I’ve got a shot at this, he thought.

The exam was two hours with the first section multiple-choice questions and the second half the dreaded double-entry bookkeeping section. He made it through the multiple-choice segment with time to spare - no surprises there. The second segment began, and he methodically began plowing his way through it, using all of the tips and tricks that he had learned in the prep class. Each glance at his watch confirmed that his timing was on track. He finished, and moments later came the command – “times up; pencils down.” It was over. He felt okay. The proctor told the class that results would be posted at 1600 the next day.

As he walked out the glass doors at the College of Law, he imagined coming back the next day for one last time to look at the notice board to see his test score. As he came down the steps, Gillian was waiting for him on a nearby park bench. “Well, Cap, how did it go?”

“I feel good. The timing was fine. Results in tomorrow. I think I passed.”

She threw her arms around him. “I’m so proud of you. You worked so hard. You deserve to pass.”

“Thanks, baby. Fingers crossed. I’m starving. Let's go find some lunch.”

While they were having lunch, he could feel himself coming down. The stress he had been feeling was slowly abating. Now the anxious wait would begin. “Hey, let's go to Withorths and then the book store. Have you got the chart list with you?”

“I do, along with the list I made of a few things we will need in the galley.”

He found the webbing tie-down straps with the stainless steel ratchets that he had seen in the Witworths catalog. He needed two for the tie-down of Baby Dink in her cradle and one for the Big Dink storage bag that rested on the front of the cabin top roof. For both, he had been using lines to lash them down, but lines and knots loosen over time as things shift from the rock and roll of the boat. He was forever inspecting and tightening them. He needed those big, heavy items to be fixed with zero movement, and the ratchet tie-downs were the only way to do it. The fact that the ratchets were made of stainless steel was even better.

Gillian found everything she was looking for. They checked out and headed for the marine book store. He was really looking forward to seeing what they had. As they entered, it was clear that he could spend days in there browsing. It was a sailor’s paradise. He gave the manager his chart list. His charts from the Bellingham Cart company were for various zones in the Pacific, with only basic coverage of the Australian coast. They were fine for passage making navigation, but he knew he had to have detailed paper charts of the Australian coast even though he had the C-Map NT electronic charts for the entire east coast of Australia. He just felt safer with paper charts. The manager had all of the ones that he needed and began rolling them up.

He also found two east coast Australia cruising guides for the Queensland and New South Wales coasts and one for the Barrier Reef. The plan was to sail directly from New Caledonia to Coffs Harbor, but that was a long time from now and plans change he reminded himself.

The last item was a little Australian courtesy flag. Sure will be a great day when I hoist this aloft, he thought, as the manager ran his credit card. Boy, this stuff is expensive, he thought as there was another big Ca-Ching.

Sleep that night was elusive. His mind running through all of the what-ifs. He kept reminding himself over and over that he thought he had done well and that it was likely that he had passed, but those thoughts weren't enough to displace the thoughts of what if he hadn’t. He knew the ramifications of that would be devastating.

At the appointed hour, they walked into the College of Law and made their way to the notice board. There were the results. He hesitated. Then he looked - he had passed. No, he had nailed it. He was shocked at how good his score was. Gillian was like a little kid squealing with joy. What a relief. Mission accomplished, he thought as he read the message at the bottom of the notice. His name would now be added to the list of those scheduled to swear in before the judges of the New South Wales Supreme Court. The swear-in was the next day at 1100, and the message said that he needed an Aussie lawyer to move his admission. My God, I don’t know any Aussie lawyers. I better find someone fast.

They got back to their room, and he called his mom to let her know the good news. Eunice was there, and his mom put her on. He asked if she knew an Aussie lawyer – a solicitor who could move his admission. She told him she would call her lawyer in Sydney and that he would call him back. Within the hour, the phone rang. He had a lawyer. Thomas was his name and he would meet them for coffee at a little place opposite the Supreme Court an hour before the swear in. It was coming together.

The next morning he dug out his suit and dress shirt. Gillian had brought a great outfit, and they hastily got their Sunday best on and caught the train into the City. A gentleman was sitting by himself at the little coffee shop, and he walked up and asked him if he was Thomas. “Yes, I am and you must be Robert and you must be Gillian. Very pleased to meet you both on this very special day.”

He filled Thomas in on how all it had come to pass. He was mesmerized. He was very interested in how a Yank lawyer could become an Aussie lawyer, but he was more interested in the trip and could not believe they were flying out to do the Panama Canal and then the Pacific in three weeks. He was simply blown away.

They filed into the Supreme Court and were directed to the main courtroom that was set up like an amphitheater. The judge’s bench was high and long, with seven antique-looking high-backed chairs. Those to be admitted along with their significant others and families were seated on one side and the general public on the other side. At the stroke of 1100, two large doors behind the bench swung open, and a man, probably the clerk, dressed in something out of a Shakespeare movie bellowed, “All rise.”

What followed was the arrival of the seven Supreme Court judges all dressed in Santa clause-like bright red robes with furry white collars and powdered wigs. He couldn’t believe his eyes. The judges took their seats, and the clerk bellowed, “All having business before this honorable court be seated.” Gillian was snapping non-flash pictures.

He could see Thomas in the other section. The Chief Judge welcomed everyone and then explained the solemnness of the ceremony and the ethical responsibilities that would now be required of all those admitted. It was a thoughtful, learned, and considered speech, and he listened intently. After the speech, the first admittee’s name was called and the admittee stood. One of the other six judges bellowed, “who moves this man’s admission?” On cue, a lawyer stood, gave his name, and said, “I do.” The judge then had a short, thoughtful chat with the admittee to learn a bit about him. At the end of the brief conversation, the judge said, “Your admission is granted.” Fantastic, so considerate, he thought.

When his name was announced, Thomas stood and moved his admission. The chat with the judge was brief. He wanted to know how long he had been practicing in America. He heard the words “Your admission is granted” and in reply said: “thank you, your honor.” He was now an Australian Solicitor and Barrister. He had done it.

After the ceremony, they hooked up with Thomas and thanked him profusely for taking his entire morning to move his admission. They traded email addresses and phone numbers, and he promised to add him to the Log of Lone Eagle distribution list and look him up when they arrived in Oz. Thomas headed back to his office, and they took a leisurely walk down to the harbor. They had a wonderful lunch overlooking the Sydney Harbour Bridge. “My dad said that when he was here during the war that you could almost walk across the harbor on the ships, there were so many of them.”

“It must have been an incredible time with all of those ships and all of those sailors.”

“It was. I can’t believe my dad met mom here. They met at a big band dance club just up the road, and that started a seven-year romance. Mom was here in Sydney and remembers the day when the Japanese mini-sub torpedoed the Australian training ship right here in the harbor.”

“Your mom told me. She also told me that she was working at David Jones as a seamstress and that they pulled her out of the tailor shop to sew parachutes.”

“Yes. And did she tell you that when she met my dad it was winter here and all he had was summer lightweight clothes? Dad told me that he stuffed newspapers into his sleeves and pant legs to keep warm and that mom used her ration coupons to buy him some warmer clothes.”

“I can’t believe they wrote for seven years. I told you that I found all the letters,” he said.

“Have you read them?”

“Some of them. I plan to read every one of them when we get out here.”

The next morning they caught an early flight to Coffs Harbor. His mom and Eunice were just beaming and took them to the most beautiful little town of Bellingen for lunch. The drive there was through some of the most beautiful farmland that he had ever seen. I could easily live here, he thought. Beyond the town, he could see the rain forest that ran up to the Great Dividing Mountain Range. After lunch, Eunice took them for a drive up Waterfall Way through the rain forest. The sights were amazing. This time there were dozens of well-paved switchbacks all with guardrails – a far cry from the chicken bus.

The three weeks, which included Christmas, flew by. Christmas with the family was wonderful, but saying goodbye to his mom at the airport was hard. He knew she was worried about the trip across the Pacific. All he could think of to say was that he loved her, he would be careful and that the nine months until his return would be over before she knew it.

The trip back to Guatemala took 36 hours door-to-door. They got into LAX at 0600, boarded a Delta flight at 0900, arrived in Guat City at 1200 local time, took the chicken bus, and arrived in Fronteras at 1800. The panga water taxi had them back at Mario’s just after dark. They had called the marina from Fronteras, and thankfully, one of the bungalows was vacant. There was no way they would be able to unpack Lone Eagle enough for them to be able to sleep aboard.

They dropped their bags in the bungalow. They were exhausted, and a hot shower and dinner at the bar was their plan, but first, they walked down to see Lone Eagle. The light wasn’t very good, but they could see that she was fine but that they would be doing battle with the green mold tomorrow. Not as bad as he thought. A bit of bleach, and she would be right.

They made their way to the bar, took up stools, and were enthusiastically greeted by Oscar. It was New Year’s Eve, and the place was deserted. With the end of hurricane season December 1st, the cruisers had all headed back into the Caribbean. Oscar made them a couple of double rum and cokes. He asked how things were at Mario’s and Oscar told them that the workshop had burned down the day after they left for Australia. They were stunned. All of their gear had been stowed in there. Had they left just two more days later it all would have all gone up in smoke. It would have meant the almost certain end of the trip – there had to have been ten thousand dollars worth of gear that would have been lost.





CHAPTER XLVI January 22, 2003 - Cabo Gracias a Dios



120nm East of the Honduras / Nicaragua Border

Lat: 14° 58’ 33.71” N, Long: 083° 00’ 56.32” W

The next morning was New Year’s Day, and they slept until 0800 in the little bungalow. They were both jet-lagged, and being back at Mario’s, and not on the boat felt a bit surreal. In the daylight, Lone Eagle was a mess. The green mold monster had been hard at work while they were away. Thankfully all the canvas and all the lines had been stowed. The boat itself is what needed attention. Below deck, everything was fine. The bilge was dry and the engine fired right up. So the big scrub began. It was harder than they thought. With non-skid on the deck and the cabin top, the stubborn green stuff got in all the nooks and crannies. Scrub brushes and hands and knees were the order of the day. It took them all morning, but by lunchtime, the green monster had been vanquished.

It was winter in Guatemala, and the temperature and humidity were far better than it was in August. The next order of business was getting down below organized so that they would have a place to sleep. They got the three big sail bags up on deck and then the Big Dink pack, outboard motor, and fuel tank. With those items out of the cabin, Gillian was able to set to work below while he hooked up the new ratchet straps over Baby Dink. It was then on to getting Big Dink inflated and launched, and the main, Genny and staysail hoisted, unfurled, re-furled and folded and then put under the sail covers. That took hours.

It was now the slow season at Mario’s. There were a few boats that remained, but most had already gone, including Henry and Lisa on Grippen and Tom and Joanne on Thunder. The poor HF reception at Mario’s meant that they couldn’t tune into the net of a morning to learn what was happening in the Caribbean. Sailmail was working, and Gillian emailed Grippen and Thunder to let them know that they were back and would be heading out soon to get the latest news. The weather fax was working and Gillian was able to program it to turn on and spit out the twice-daily weather forecast and maps out of NOAA New Orleans. Those maps showed an endless procession of fronts across the States, many of them making it as far south as they were. Over the days ahead, he started to see a pattern emerging and it wasn’t a good one.

It took them a week to get Lone Eagle to a point where she was ready for sea. Ron was still around and helped with a few projects. The stocks in the tienda were limited, so they made several provisioning runs to Fronteras.

The weather fax pattern was becoming clear. A cold front from the northwest would come through every three days. The run from Livingston to Cabo Gracias a Dios off the northeastern tip of the border between Honduras and Nicaragua was a 300nm due east. It took Columbus thirty days to make it around the cape, hence the name. Hence the name – Thanks and Goodbye. Having to head 300nm east meant that they needed northerly or northwesterly winds for the run, and that meant playing the fronts, which he knew was far from an exact science. Compounding the problem was that you would lose a day getting down the river to Livingston. With a day run to Livingston, a three day run to the cape and fronts coming every three days, the odds were that you would encounter the very blustery passage of one of them somewhere along the way. Another problem was that you couldn’t wait in Livingston for a weather window. It was an open roadstead. And, Tres Puntas wasn’t an option.

The first two weeks since their arrival at Mario’s had been well organized and executed. The third week was a painful wait for the weather window. They impatiently waited that entire week until January 19th when the weather fax showed that a weather window would open the next day. We’re going.

The next morning’s weather fax confirmed the evening-before decision. They left at first light and motored their way down the river. The Furuno chart plotter had a fantastic function that displayed their prior course down the river - every twist and turn of it. They simply kept the boat on the track-back course. It made for an easy run to Livingston, where he hoped they would be able to clear out quickly.

With Big Dink in tow, they dropped the pick mid-afternoon in Livingston, and he motored in to clear out and pick up the toys. Back on the boat and with the toys stowed, they broke down and stowed Big Dink and hoisted and hung the outboard on the pulpit mount. They took up a heading to the Livingston sea buoy. When they arrived, the wind was ten knots out of the north. Visibility was barely a mile, the sky was grey, and there was misting rain. The front had passed that morning, and he was hoping it would soon clear. It didn’t.

He took up a due east heading for a waypoint opposite Roatan. The islands of Roatan and Utila were part of the Honduran Bay of Islands. Roatan rested on an exposed ancient coral reef, and the cruising guide showed that the entrance was tricky and required perfect light. Tom and Joanne were at French Harbor on the south side of Roatan. If the timing of the next front got dicey, he knew they could duck into Roatan, assuming they got there before nightfall. They didn’t.

They left Livingston at 1500. By 1500 the next day, they were 20nm west of Roatan. It was 1900 when they had French Harbor a beam of them. They tried to raise Thunder on the VHF and were quite surprised when Tom replied. He asked Tom about a possible night landing in French Harbor. Tom told him it wouldn’t be possible. He asked Tom about his take on the passage of the next front. The weather faxes showed that it was expected to pass in two days – just enough time for them to get around the cape. Tom agreed with his assessment. They chatted briefly, and the girls said goodbye as their paths wouldn’t be crossing again anytime soon.

They reluctantly gave Roatan a miss, and as its lights faded into the night, they got ready for a lumpy evening. The Mexican and Belizean runs had been on pretty flat water. This was different. They had a lee cloth for the port settee bunk, but that was on the windward side and was uncomfortable. The settee cushions were dragged onto the cockpit sole – the lowest point in the cabin. It was comfortable but made walking from one end of the cabin unsteady. He was glad he had installed the teak handrail on the cabin ceiling. You always had a handhold.

Gillian took the first watch. It was the first night of the passage, and he never slept well as he was listening to and feeling every vibration of Lone Eagle. They had gotten the 1800 weather fax and saw that the approaching front was forecasted to arrive after they made their southward turn at the cape. That was the good news. The bad news was the cape itself. Cabo Gracias a Dios sits atop of the Mosquito Shoal that extended hundreds of miles out into the Caribbean off the coast of the Honduran Nicaraguan border. To get around the cape, you had to go over the shoal. It wasn’t shallow, but the seafloor was little more than 160’ from the surface. He knew that the shallowness lent itself to short, steep, and breaking waves under normal conditions. A front would turn it into a washing machine. He hoped that those short, steep, breaking waves would be on his stern. If they were on the beam or worse, slightly forward of it, then it was going to be a rough ride that could last a couple of days.

“Baby, it's your watch” was all he heard. It seemed like minutes since he had gone below. He cleared the cobwebs and put on his foul weather gear and inflatable harness and made his way up into the cockpit as Gillian hooked him in. The rule was that if you were in the cockpit, you wore the inflatable harness and were hooked in – no exceptions.

“See anything?”

“I’ve been doing fifteen-minute radar sweeps and nothing.”

“What kind have speed have we been making?”

“Mostly in the fives but sometimes in the fours.”

“Gillian, get some sleep.”

She climbed over the companionway weatherboards, and he unhooked her so that she could get down to the cabin floor. Moments later, a can of Coke and a Mars bar appeared above the hatch. “Night baby, wake me at 0600,” she said as she slid the hatch closed.

He climbed up into the pulpit watch seat that he had made from the old teak floor grate from the head. It was quite comfortable as he could rest his back against the pulpit. It also had the advantage of giving him the best view forward. He could look over the bimini and Baby Dink all the way to the bow. He swept the entire boat with the beam of the big Maglite. Everything was fine. They had one reef in the main and had both the staysail and Genny up.

The wind was east northeast. The sky was mostly overcast, but there were breaks where a few stars would appear. They were on a port reach and the starboard rail was down and getting the occasional splash over it. He looked at the knot meter. Speed was 5.8 knots through the water, but the chart plotter showed that GPS speed over ground was only 4.7 knots. More than a knot on the nose. Not fast enough. We need at least 5.5 knots.

As he watched the mast dance across the night sky, he could see through the intermittent breaks in the clouds that the winds aloft were northerly. The shift from east to northeast and then north presaged the coming of the front. He hadn’t expected the winds aloft to be turning northerly this soon, and a look at the barometer showed that it was dropping.

“Morning, baby, it’s 0600.”

“Coming,” was the groggy reply from below as he slid the hatch cover closed to give her a few minutes to get herself organized.

A few minutes later, it opened, and she handed up steaming mugs of coffee.

“Weather fax is printing out now. I’ll bring it up when it’s finished.”

They settled in the cockpit with their coffees, and the weather faxes as an angry-looking red sun broke the horizon. The old adage: Red sky at morning, sailor take warning was very appropriate. As he looked at the morning’s weather fax, he compared it with yesterday’s 1800 report. The front was now forecasted to arrive 12 hours earlier. Not good, he thought. We’re going to take it forward of the beam. Maybe for 12 hours. Maybe longer if they couldn’t make at least five knots.

“What does it look like, Rob?”

“Not good. The front is going to get here 12 hours earlier, and we are going to get to our southward turning waypoint at the cape 12 hours later than we planned. All that means is that we are going to get hit pretty hard, and it’s going to last 24 – 36 hours. When you are done with your coffee, can you please go below and make sure that everything is really stowed. Make sure every hatch is latched. Also, you might want to break out all of our foul weather gear, including our heavy weather gear along with at least three changes of dry clothes.”

“I’ll fill a couple of Thermos’ with soup and make a bunch of sandwiches. Are we going to be okay?”

“Should be. This is the first of the big blows we’re going to encounter. The boat is ready, and so are we.”

Gillian disappeared below. They were 150nm from Cayos Cajones (aptly named), which was their next waypoint and the turning point for heading southward. It was a small cay of islands off the eastern tip of the Honduran coast, and you had to go around it. It was the point where he could begin the slow turn to the south. And it was going to be a very slow turn as he wanted to keep Nicaragua a good 120nm off to starboard.

As the day wore on, he would make hourly adjustments to Monitor to keep her on their rhumb line. Each adjustment meant that the wind was starting to back around to the north. They were out of the lee of the Bay of Islands reef with a sea of 4-6’ from the east, and the start of a couple of feet swell building from the north. It would be increasing, but by how much.

The wind was a consistent 15-18 knots with some 20+ knot gusts. The staysail was up, the Genny had been rolled-in hours ago, and they had one reef in the main. Their speed was consistently above 5 knots, and the westward setting current was holding at about a knot. Lone Eagle was powering along, and Monitor was keeping her right on course. He knew if he put the second reef in the main that there would be a significant drop in their speed. He had to keep as much canvas up as long as it was safe to do so.

Gillian put Eileen Quinn’s, Three Days Out Forty-five Wind Blues in the CD. How appropriate, he thought as he made another Monitor adjustment. He hoped they would fare better than Eileen did in that song.

The day was almost over, and he was thinking about what it would be like that evening. Probably a lot of wind and a good bit of rain. Moments later, the hatch slid open, and Gillian popped up to announce that all was ready below. They were both waiting for the 1800 weather fax that would announce what their life would be like for the next 24 hours.

“I am going to make some dinner. It looks like we are going to need it,” she said as she slid the hatch slid closed. Monitor adjustments were coming more frequently as the wind was backing through north on its way to the northwest. The hatch flew open again, and Gillian handed up the 1800 weather fax. North 25 gusting to 35. It was going to build more.

They were now 100nm from the Cayo Cajones waypoint. It was going to be a long night. The wind was holding at 20 knots with gusts now at 30. Monitor was steering perfectly, but he knew that sometime in the hours ahead that he would need to put the second reef in the main. He was torn. The old adage about putting a reef in was: if you think you should, then you should have done it earlier. He decided he still had to keep the speed up while he could. The reef could be put in later, but he wasn’t relishing the thought of having to go up on the foredeck to do it. What the hell, he thought, it would be an excellent time to test out the new ‘D’ ring that he had sewn into the forward webbing strap on Baby Dink. His harness had a long hook-in carabiner and a short one. The short one attached to the new ‘D’ ring would now give him the ability to work with both hands. Something that was desperately needed when he was trying to work with halyards and reef lines.

He was brought out of his thoughts when there was a knock on the weatherboards. He opened the hatch and was handed a fantastic dinner. Pan-fried chicken breasts, mashed potatoes, and corn. He couldn’t believe it. She had to be dying down there with the hatch closed, the stove on, and the heat and all that motion. Moments later, she came to the top of the hatch and handed him her harness line which he clipped in as she slowly climbed over the weatherboards after handing him her dinner plate.

The waves were starting to build with occasional big ones throwing big sheets of water over the boat. The bimini was keeping most of it out, as was the dodger and his new traveler splashboard. The splashboard was fantastic. She slid in next to him. He could see that making dinner had really taken it out of her. They watched as the sky darkened. He switched on the tricolor masthead light and the compass and depth sounder lights. Below, the red light at the nav station was illuminated.

Gillian took the first watch. It took a while, but he was able to drift off to sleep. He could feel the force and sound of the waves that Lone Eagle was powering through. It wasn’t long before the hatch slid open a few inches. “Rob, it’s getting pretty bad up here. Can you take over while I change into some dry clothes?”

“On my way. Give me a second to get into my foul weather gear.”

He hooked in and climbed over the weatherboards. Every wave was now sending a curtain of spray over the boat. It was 2330. “Baby, go get some dry clothes on and hit the rack. I’ve got this covered.” She reluctantly agreed and handed up a Coke and a Mars bar.

Monitor was still steering without any problems, but that northerly swell was building and each time it hit, it had a jarring effect that made it difficult to hold on. He sat on the lee side of the cockpit, which lessened the jarring but exposed him to a lot of spray and water sliding down the starboard deck where the starboard rail frequently went under. He knew it was risky, but he quickly opened the port cockpit locker hatch and quickly dragged out the spinnaker bag and put it on the floor of the cockpit. It worked like a bean bag chair and it gave much-needed relief from the jarring. He could see all the instruments and could adjust the Monitor without getting up.

It was 0400, and the wind was now north, northwest. He had adjusted the main and staysail sheets every time he adjusted Monitor. They were now 40nm from Cayo Cajones, and Lone Eagle and Monitor were not happy. As each gust of 30+ knots came, Monitor rounded Lone Eagle up and spilled off some wind. Lone Eagle then dropped back on course but the gusts were happening too frequently. He waited as long as he could. It was now 0500. There was just enough light for him to go topside and put a reef in without the need of a headlamp. He slid the companionway hatch open a few inches. “Gillian, wake up, baby. I’ve got to go up and put a reef in. We can’t wait any longer. Can you please get your gear on and come up.” She had only been asleep for an hour and he hated to wake her but the rule was if someone was on the foredeck, someone had to be in the cockpit.

The hatch opened, and he hooked her in. He also steadied her until she plunked down in the cockpit seat. He gave her a few minutes to get her bearings. It was time to do it. He hooked into the port jack line and slowly and deliberately climbed out on deck. The spray was flying and stinging his eyes. Each step, each hand-hold was thought through in advance. One slow-motion movement after another. When he made it to the mast, he inched his way up to a standing position with one hand around the Baby Dink webbing tie-down and one on the main halyard. He let go of the halyard and hooked in his short tether to the ‘D’ ring on Baby Dink. He then braced and leaned ever so slightly backward. The ‘D’ ring was perfect. Using both hands, he got the main down and started tying the reef lines through the foot of the sail. It took a while but having both hands to do it was a godsend.

Before long, he was back in the cockpit. Lone Eagle and Monitor were both happy. Lone Eagle was no longer rounding up with each gust and was much more stable. Even the jarring had lessened. The chart plotter showed that they were still making 5 knots. It also showed that they were now on the Mosquito Shoal, which was confirmed by the depth sounder that was reading 160’. He felt exhausted. Going on deck in a blow was draining. Gillian could see it on his face.

“I’m going to go and make us a cup of coffee. I don’t think there is going to be any more sleep for either of us.”

He helped her over the weatherboards. Her feet had no sooner hit the cabin floor when he looked up and saw a huge green one. He yelled, “Hang on,” slammed the hatch closed and ducked. There was so much water he took and held his breath. The cockpit was like a swimming pool. The decks drained quickly. In less than a minute, the two cockpit drains had gotten rid of most of it. He opened the sliding hatch and yelled, “Are you okay?”

“The better question is, are you okay?”

“Yeah, that was a big one. You could have gone for a swim out here.”

“From down here, it sounded like a car had just crashed into us.”

She was standing braced at the galley sink with her short tether clipped on to the stove. He slid the hatch closed and looked out to port to see if there were any more green ones coming. He shifted his gaze to the instrument boxes. He could see through the Lexan that they were dry. Even the engine control box was dry, and it had been underwater for at least a minute. Excellent, he thought.

He checked again to see if any more green ones were coming and slid the hatch open a few inches. “Gillian, I’m drenched. When I ducked, that green one went right down my collar. Can you come up here while I go below and get some dry clothes on?”

He hooked her in and helped her into the cockpit and then into the sail bag bean bag chair on the floor of the cockpit. He then went below and looked to see if a green one was coming before sliding the hatch open. They had to be careful. The nav station was right below the hatch, and even though they had the laptop raised up and strapped down under a big Tupperware box, it would be no match for a green one. Protect the bubble, he reminded himself. Always protect the bubble was an old sailor mantra. The bubble was the bubble of air down below. If it were replaced with water, they were going down.

He had just stripped off his foul weather gear when they were hit with a God-awful green one. He was almost knocked to the floor. My God, Gillian. Just as he started for the ladder, he heard her scream. He flew up the stairs and slid open the hatch. Gillian was sitting in a cockpit swimming pool with a look of terror on her face. The water-activated trigger on her life jacket had detonated, and the CO² cartridge fully inflated the life jacket with a bang. It scared the shit out of her. They both just laughed. “I’ll change after you,” was all she said. He smiled to himself, knowing that he did have a spare water-activated trigger and CO² cylinder.

They traded places. He was now dry, and she went below soaked. They were now 20-miles from their waypoint. Shit, four more hours of this. He was exhausted but knew they had to hang on. Conditions would be better when they could make the turn. They would then have those green ones on their stern. He wasn’t worried about getting pooped (swamped from behind). Lone Eagle was a double-ender, and she would rise and split any green one coming their way. The words to Eileen Quinn’s song Get Me Through This Night were in his head:

Once scared by the ocean’s jaws it will forever give you pause.

You don’t get out, you might get through.

Here’s to all the sailors who; come back stronger, come back broken, don’t come back at all.

Get me through this night, get me through this night.



How appropriate. He had put on his heavy weather foul weather gear and sea boots. He pulled the drawstring of his hood tight. He didn’t want another green one going down his collar. He also didn’t use the sail bag bean bag seat. It was too low, and he knew if he sat in it, he wouldn’t be able to see a green one coming. There would be more green ones to come, but they were as prepared as they could be.

As they approached the Cayo Cajones waypoint, he was watching the wind, which was now out of the northwest. He would have to jibe (turn the stern through the wind) when they arrived. Jibing in 30 knots of wind and 8-10’ steep, short seas wasn’t a great idea. Rounding up and tacking through it wasn’t much better – the bow would be directly into the waves and could bury and stall if he couldn’t get her through the wind. Neither was a good option. As they neared the waypoint, he decided on a jibe. The only question was power off or power on? Power off meant letting the main way out and then letting it loosely fly overhead to the other side with no strain on the mainsheet. The problem with that was that he would have no control over the boom which, with a loosened mainsheet, could fly upward and foul the rig and break at the mast if it did. A power-on jibe would mean that as the main flew over, you would sheet it in. The force of the wind hitting it full-on would be tremendous, and they risked a partial knockdown ( near rollover).

He decided on a power-on jibe. It would be tricky, but he couldn’t risk the rig. If they had a partial knockdown, Lone Eagle would come up. All they had to do was hang on and execute it flawlessly. He explained to Gillian exactly how they were going to do it. She would disengage Monitor and make a hard 45° turn to starboard. He told her to push hard on the tiller when she hit 35°. The wind, when it caught, would take them to hopefully no more than 45°. He was going to handle the mainsheet. The staysail was self-tacking and would take care of itself. As they reached the waypoint, he switched the chart plotter to the new waypoint – the San Blas Islands of Panama.

He scanned the ocean to port. No green ones. He gave her the command. She disengaged the monitor and made the turn. As she did, he winched in the mainsheet as fast as he could. The wind caught the back of the sail as he pulled with all his might on the line. He was able to pull in three feet of slack before the wind caught the sail on the opposite side. He had three wraps on the winch head and held on as he looked at the compass. It was at 45° and increasing. He grabbed the tiller from her as she was struggling to hold it. The angle of heel really increased, and the port rail went under. He let off three feet of mainsheet spilling off some wind, and Lone Eagle came back on her lines. They had done it.

They re-engaged Monitor and adjusted her to the new waypoint rhumb line. The ride softened immensely. They were going downwind on a broad reach. It was going to be a Nantucket sleigh ride. As they were getting used to the feel of the new ride, he looked behind him and exclaimed, “Green one.” They both looked. Lone Eagle was running from it, but it was going to get them. They both braced for the impact and felt Lone Eagle rise beneath them. They were halfway up its face when it broke, and a torrent of white water rushed toward them. It was met by Lone Eagle’s double-ender stern that split the white water in two and threw it off in big sheets of spray as if it was the bow of the boat was plowing through a wave. They couldn’t believe what they had just witnessed. Lone Eagle was amazing. Her hull worked just as it was designed to. He gave her a pat on the tiller and knew they would be alright.

The wind held out of the northwest, and there were intermittent squalls with the usual 30-40 knot gusts, but Lone Eagle was powering ahead at almost 6 knots. With two reefs in the main and just the staysail up, the ride was almost comfortable. There were a few more green ones but they abruptly ended when they exited the south end of the Mosquito Shoal, and the water deepened. What a relief he thought as he pulled out the cruising guide. Gillian had gone below to sort out the mess. There was a mountain of wet clothes and foul weather gear down there.





CHAPTER XLVII January 25, 2003 - Pirates and Providencia



Providencia, Columbia

Lat: 13° 20’ 19.54” N, Long: 081° 22’ 22.57” W

They were 500nm from the San Blas Islands of Panama. Four more days to go at sea, and they had just done a hard five days. They needed to put in somewhere and get some rest. 200nm dead ahead was Isla Providencia that was owned by Columbia. The cruising guide said it had been named by Columbus. It was the next decent landfall, and they needed it as much as Columbus did.

The guide said that it had a protected harbor and that provisions were available. He slid the hatch open and announced, “We’re going to Columbia.”

Gillian popped her head up. “I thought we were going to Panama?”

“Slight detour. We’re going to the same place Christopher Columbus found and named after he got the snot beaten out of him going around Cabo Gracias a Dios.”

“And where might that be?”

“The aptly named little island of Providencia. It’s right on our route to the San Blas Islands and about 200nm from here. We should be there this time two days from now.”

“Wow, sounds great. We might have one last dry change of clothes to get us there. We’ll be doing laundry for days.”

He punched in the waypoint for Providencia and hit the go button. He barely had to alter course. They were already heading right for it. The green ones were gone, the squalls had ended, and some blue sky and sunlight were streaming through the breaks in the very fast-moving clouds that were still being pushed by the front.

The first day was like a typical day at sea. Morning coffee, sundowners, and even some grilled chicken on their little Force 10 barbeque. Aside from a massive pile of wet laundry, all was right aboard Lone Eagle.

The next morning he was awoken at 0530 when Gillian slid the hatch open. “Wake up, Rob, I’ve got a radar contact.” He quickly climbed up into the cockpit and watched the radar sweeps. The Furuno was sweeping out to 40 miles. The target was off to starboard about 35 miles and out of visual range. He watched the sweeps and the movement of the target. It was moving northwestward and would cross their bow with plenty of room.

Gillian went below and lit the stove to make some coffee. Every few minutes, he would do two manual sweeps to assess the target’s progress. It was now 10 miles off and had crossed their rhumb line. Gillian handed up the coffees as he reached for the binoculars. He thought the target would be coming into visual range soon as he scanned forward and off to port. It wasn’t long before he could see it. It looked like a fishing boat, but it didn’t have any nets out, or any of the long-line radar beacons stowed on deck. A few seconds later, the target altered course and was headed directly at them just as he made visual contact with them.

They were 120nm off the Nicaraguan coast. He knew there were pirates in these waters, but thought they would be more coastal, and he was 120nm off.

“Gillian, that fishing boat just altered course and is coming toward us. It looks like a fishing boat, but it doesn’t look like he is doing any fishing. I don’t like the look of this.”

“What should we do?”

“Go below and pull out the toys. Take them out of their cases and lay them on the bunk. Once you have done that, then try and tune into the net. It’s now 0600, and the net starts at 0800. See if there is anyone up early and any chatter. Maybe there is someone that is tuned in that we can make contact with.”

Gillian tuned in the net frequency. He couldn't hear any chatter. He did another radar sweep, and the fishing boat had just crossed the five-mile ring. We’ve got ten minutes to get ready for visitors. He looked through the binoculars and could make out the shape of an aluminum tender with an outboard on the cabin top of the fishing boat. If they take steps to launch that thing, we’re going to have a problem.

“Gillian. Load the pistols as I showed you, but first, I want you to load the shotgun. Put in three buckshot rounds first followed by three deer slug rounds. I’ll be down in a second.”

Once below, he picked up the HF mic. “Securite, Securite, this is the sailing vessel Lone Eagle we are being followed by a fishing boat. We are 120nm off the Nicaraguan coast bound for Providencia. Our position is 015° 12’ N by 082° 11.5’ W, on a heading of 160° does any vessel copy?”

There was no response. He picked up the VHF mic and tried to make contact with the fishing vessel. Again no response. The fishing boat was now no more than a mile off their port side and was still closing.

Gillian. Could you please find that Ziploc bag full of boxes of thumbtacks? Open all the boxes and dump them into the Ziploc bag and hand it to me. I’m going up into the cockpit.”

He unfurled the Genny and winched her in to increase their speed. He scanned the fishing boat again with the binoculars. He couldn’t see anyone on deck or anyone on top. Good, but if they send a couple of guys up there to get the tender ready, they are going to try and board us. Cruisers had reported instances where pirates came close and begged for food or medicine. When unsuspecting cruisers stopped to help, they were boarded and robbed or worse – murdered. He wasn’t going to let them come alongside.

It wasn’t long before the fishing boat slipped past their port side at a distance of about 100 yards. It then turned to come in behind them.

“Gillian. They are coming up behind us. Hand up the bag with the water ski line.” She did. It contained 75’ of floating black polypropylene ski line. He had woven high test-strength braided fishing line through it. To each end, he had fastened a block of wood. The line could be flung out astern of them and would certainly foul the fishing boat’s prop if it ran over it. He carefully strung it on the outside of the stern pulpit and lifelines. The woodblocks were ready to be thrown over the side.

The fishing boat stayed right behind them. It was now 0700. Gillian was still unable to make contact with anyone on the net.

“Gillian. Pull out the EPRIB and extend its antenna. If I give you the word, switch it on.”

The fishing boat altered course to starboard and increased speed. He was coming abeam. Really not good, he thought, but there still wasn’t anyone on deck or, thank God, someone going up on top to launch the tender.

“Gillian, I’m coming below.” Before he did, he reached into the Ziploc with the thumbtacks and threw handfuls of them out along the decks. Thumbtacks and bare feet don’t go well and would give him time to take out at least one of them before they made it to the cockpit.

Once below, he put the 38 caliber Colt Pocket Lite in the secret spot and the 9mm Browning in his waistband and a spare clip in each pocket. Monitor was steering, so there was nothing for them to shoot at in the cockpit. He picked up the Mossberg shotgun and chambered a round. It and the next two rounds were deer slugs. The Mossberg didn’t have much range but if they came alongside, he would put a round into their pilothouse. If they launched the tender, he would put the first round in their outboard and the second below the waterline.

“Gillian. Please get down on the floor and lay flat and don’t get up until I tell you to.”

“Why do you want me on the floor?”

“Because if the shooting starts, the rounds will be coming right through our hull, and the safest place is on the floor.”

He was looking out the nav station porthole. The fishing boat was holding its position 50 yards a beam of them. He keyed the HF mic and repeated the Securite alert message. It was now 0730. A male voice came over the radio and identified himself as Mike on the cruising yacht Tempest and said he was in Utila. He confirmed their position and gave Mike a description of the fishing boat. It had no markings or registration number, and it wasn’t flying any flag. It wouldn’t be much help. He asked Mike to standby. He told him that if he issued a May Day that he should assume that hostile action had begun and to notify the authorities. Mike acknowledged.

The fishing boat hung off their starboard side at about 50 yards. No one was visible, and their pilothouse windows were tinted so he couldn’t see any movement. The fishing boat slowly started to move closer. They were now at 25 yards. Still a long shot with the Mossberg, but he had hit targets at longer ranges. They have to be deciding how hard it would be for them to board us. Lone Eagle’s cockpit was small, and the pulpit, the lifelines, and bimini would make it really hard for them.

If they closed the distance any further, he would either have to climb up into the cockpit and disengage Monitor to take evasive action or open fire on their pilothouse. If he went up in the cockpit, he would be an easy target, especially if they had AK-47s. No. Safer to shoot from down here. He had the barrel of the Mossberg in the porthole above the nav station. His field of view took in the entire fishing boat. If they came any closer, then they would be getting close enough for boarding. He knew he would have to open up on them first, to have any chance.

“Gillian, if the shooting starts, I am going to hand you the shotgun once I’ve emptied it. I will need you to quickly reload it with the buckshot rounds. Are you okay with doing it?” She nodded and pulled the box of buckshot rounds closer to her. The Browning High Power 9mm was a great gun, and he was pretty good with it. He had 42 rounds in the clips and had shown Gillian how to reload.

The wait seemed like hours. The fishing boat just hung there. Then, it turned away. He couldn’t believe it. He watched for a few seconds. Was he going to take up a position astern of them? Nope. They were really heading away from them. He told Gillian, and she stood up and joined him at the porthole.

“Why didn’t they board us?”

“Probably because they thought it would be too hard. We aren’t very big, and they mostly go after the bigger, wealthier looking boats that are a lot easier to board. I guess they didn’t think we were worth the trouble.”

“That was so scary.”

“It sure was. You did an incredible job. You were so calm and did everything perfectly. I think we have the pirate drill down pat. Could you please hand me the dust bin, and I’ll sweep up all of those thumbtacks on the deck.”

He got back to Mike and told him what had transpired. Mike agreed with him that they were probably hunting for wealthier, easier prey. He thanked him and signed-off after checking the radar. The fishing boat was now 15 miles off and heading toward the Nicaraguan coast.

They put the toys away and all the other anti-pirate gear. If there was ever a next time, they would be ready, although he was regretting that he hadn’t purchased that sniper rifle that he had his eye on back in Washington. When the most common weapon in the world was an AK-47, a sniper rifle would be the only thing that would give you a long-range advantage. A shotgun and a pistol were no match for an AK-47.

They had no energy for the rest of the day. They were both emotionally drained, and they each took turns catching a bit of sleep in the cockpit. The one awake continued the 15-minute radar sweeps. Here, they would be for pirates; the closer they got to Panama, they would be for shipping traffic. He looked at their position. They should be in by 0800 tomorrow.

They arrived at the harbor entrance waypoint just before at 0600. The wind had given them a good push overnight. Providencia did have a beautiful little harbor that was easy to get into. The island had several tall peaks, one of which was named Captain Bligh’s Ass. It sure looked like someone's ass. There was also a commercial wharf with a freighter docked. Must be the one mentioned in the guide that comes once a week with two thousand cases of beer for an island population of 200 people. My kind of people he thought as he raised the quarantine flag and made ready to drop the pick.

With the pick set, they sat in the cockpit to re-group. Gillian managed some breakfast, and they both agreed that sleep would be the first order of business. They cleared away enough of the mess below to set up the double bunk.

Twenty-four hours later, they awoke. Neither could believe that they had slept for twenty-four hours. It was a beautiful morning in Providencia. The northerly had pushed through, and the air was crisp and the sky a deep blue. It was going to be a busy morning. Big Dink was unpacked and launched and he went ashore to clear in. Meanwhile, Gillian began to get organized for all of the washing. It was laundry day.

Clearing-in went smoothly. The customs guy didn’t have a problem with them keeping the toys aboard provided they were locked, which he assured him they were. He picked up some fresh bread and veg and headed back to Lone Eagle. Gillian had four big plastic bins on the cabin top along with their massive pile of laundry. He fired up the engine and turned on the watermaker, and that started the four-hour bucket brigade. Gillian was on deck scrubbing and he was below passing up bucket after bucket of clean, freshwater. The watermaker got a workout that morning.

“OK, Cap, you can shut down the watermaker. I’ve got enough to finish this last load.”

Before he shut down the watermaker and the engine, he switched the flow to their water tank and noticed that the feedwater pump that had been replaced under warranty was acting up. It was still working but making some noises that seemed to be coming from the impeller. He had a spare impeller but figured he would wait until it died before he undertook the super fun task of ripping the galley apart to replace it. He would have to email Spectra and see if they had a dealer in Panama.

It was now much quieter, he thought as he went up on deck. There was Gillian with a massive pile of laundry. It took them a while, but it was all hung out to dry on every lifeline and every piece of rigging. He even had to string additional lines to hold it all. They were now the laundry boat. He imagined Lone Eagle would be quite a sight.

“Let’s head into town and get some lunch. I saw a nice place for lunch on the water.”

They pulled away from Lone Eagle and surveyed the scene. She certainly was a laundry boat. It looked like a family of ten lived aboard her. Once ashore, they meandered through the picturesque little town and found the waterfront café that he had seen earlier. Providencia had once been in British hands, and the locals had a distinct Creole accent. There were burgers and real French fries on the menu, and the beer was Columbian. It was strange that this little island was just off the Nicaraguan coast yet was owned by Columbia.

On their way back to the boat, Gillian found a butcher. Everything in there had come from Columbia, and he knew they produced some of the best steaks. Sure enough, they found a couple of great ones that he would put on the Force 10 barbeque. Back at the boat, all the laundry had dried, and they undertook the fold and stow task. He emailed Spectra. They had to have a dealer in Panama; otherwise, he was going to have to have a spare feed water pump and impeller kit shipped.

The next morning was an oil change day. They had done a lot of motor sailing, and it was time to do one. The process was straight forward, but it wasn’t easy or without a mess. He headed into shore and asked a couple of the local fishermen where they put their used motor oil, and they showed him the recycle tank. His plan was to leave for the San Blas Islands some 300nm south. Those old salts were a wise bunch, and they advised that the day after tomorrow would be a better time to depart. They said that there would be powerful northwest winds that would abate by the next day.

Sure enough, the next morning, the wind was honking out of the northwest. As they would be leaving the following day, they headed in to top off their provisions and to check out with the Port Captain and Customs. With that done, they headed back to Lone Eagle and started the process of breaking down and stowing Big Dink.





CHAPTER XLVIII February 2, 2003 - The San Blas Islands



Isla Porvenir, San Blas Islands, Panama

Lat: 09° 34’ 13.15” N, Long: 078° 47’ 13.93” W

It was 0400, and he was wide awake. He quietly went up on deck with the Panama cruising guide. The run to the San Blas was 300nm. With Lone Eagle averaging 120nm per day, it would be a two and half-day run. They should be in sometime on the afternoon of the third day. Timing an arrival so that you didn’t arrive in the middle of the night was always tricky, and he knew he had to be prepared to lay offshore and orbit until daylight.

They were underway by 0600, and the winds of the day before had abated just like the fishermen had said they would. They had a reef in the main, the staysail, and a good bit of the Genny out. They were making a steady five knots and maintained their fifteen-minute radar sweeps. They were heading south, and he knew that the closer they got to the canal the more shipping traffic there would be.

They had made water on their way out, and the feedwater pump was no longer making the noise that sounded like it was coming from the impeller. It might have been due to the long run it had making water for all the laundry they had done. It had run for five hours. He had gotten an overnight email reply from Spectra. No score on a Panama dealer. He would need to order a spare feed water pump and two impeller rebuild kits when they got to Panama. Spectra could ship them to him, care of the Panama Canal Yacht Club. Now there was a bar he was looking forward to visiting. He would email Spectra with the order once they were in Panama.

He was down below when he heard his fishing reel start to scream, and Gillian yelled, “Fish on.” He was on deck in seconds. This one didn’t feel as powerful as the others, but he did put up a spirited fight. As he got him in closer, the fish leaped out of the water and did a tail walk. It was a mahi-mahi and just the right size for dinner. It wasn’t long before their prize was gaffed, subdued, and on the foredeck for filleting.

The wind started to lighten, so he completely unwound the Genny. They were just holding five knots, and he was hoping for a bit more than the 10-15 knots of wind they were getting from the northwest. Maybe later.

It was a lazy day of sailing. A far cry from Cabo Gracias a Dios. As the sun faded into the west, they enjoyed their one-allowed sundowner. The mahi-mahi was perfect; the smaller ones were always sweeter. He came on watch at 2400; the radar was clear and there was no moon, but the stars were amazing. He was perched in the watch seat and watched the mast dance across the night sky. They were reflective moments. Sometimes his thoughts drifted to his dad. This night his thoughts drifted to the Panama Canal. His father had transited it dozens of times, but this time he would be doing it on a 36’ sailboat. It was going to be a lot more challenging for him.

The next morning he marked their position on the paper chart. They had only made 100nm since leaving. At this rate, he knew it could be another two days. Throughout the day, he kept his eye on the chart-plotter. Five knots was all they were making, and sometimes it was in the 4s. He shook out the reef in the main and saw that they were now hitting 5.2 knots.

As day two wore on, the wind picked up and their speed climbed into the upper 5s. If it held, that would put them into Porvenir in the early hours of the morning. Gillian took the first watch as usual. She woke him at 2400, and he could see that they were about to arrive at their next waypoint. He hit the menu button on the chart-plotter and went to his list of waypoints and used the arrow down button to scroll to the next sequentially numbered waypoint, and hit the go button. The chart-plotter recomputed the route and displayed the rhumb line and distance to the new waypoint. It was 30nm out, and no course adjustment was needed. He figured they would be off the harbor entrance by 0600.

It was now 0400. The chart-plotter was zoomed out, and he was reading. He started to reach for his drink bottle when he heard it – waves breaking. Oh shit. Just then, the depth sounder alarm started screeching. He dove for the chart-plotter and pressed the zoom-in button. His blood ran cold. They were going right over the reef at the entrance to Porvenir. He froze. All the canvas was up, and they were doing almost 6 knots and he could see their progress on the chart plotter as they were going over all of the yellow shoal spots and coral patches on the reef. Gillian yelled from below, “what’s going on?”

He yelled: “Get your life vest on and hold on.”

He braced for the crunching impact that would likely be the end of Lone Eagle as he watched the reef pass under them. They were skimming it by inches. The depth sounder was flashing, which meant zero water under the keel. Within seconds it was over. They had cleared the reef and were in a patch of water with five feet under the keel. He disengaged Monitor and let the sheets go as he started the engine. He dropped it in reverse and throttled up, and Lone Eagle stopped – sails flapping and his adrenalin pumping. Gillian popped her head through the hatch. “What the hell is going on?”

“Welcome to the San Blas Islands. Can you come up here? I’ve got to get the sails down, and we have to set the pick.”

“Are we already in the harbor?”

“We are. I’ll tell you how but first, let me get the sails down and the pick in.”

They were dead stopped in the water. It was so still. The wind was blowing, but the water was flat calm. As he went up on deck to take the main down, his hands were shaking. Actually, all of him was shaking. What had happened? How did it happen? His mind raced. With the main and the staysail down, he released the anchor and paid out 4:1 scope. He gave Gillian the hand signal, and she throttled-up. With the pick set, he gave her the command to shut down the engine. He could see three mast lights not far off, probably in the harbor, he thought. They were safe – amazingly.

Back in the cockpit, he switched off the running lights and turned on the anchor light. The chart plotter was still on, and he saw the ‘arrived at waypoint’ message was still flashing. He looked at the waypoint and its name. It was the harbor waypoint, not the reef entrance waypoint that was a mile off the reef. He then hit the menu button and went to his waypoint list. He had arrowed down one waypoint too many and selected the harbor waypoint instead of the reef entrance waypoint. My God, we could have died.

Gillian handed him up a cup of coffee and joined him in the cockpit. He looked shell-shocked. “Are you okay? What happened?”

He told her about his navigational error and showed her their trackback path on the chart-plotter right over the reef. The electronic chart showed less than five feet, and some spots were awash. A look at the local tide table showed that they had gone over at high tide. Had it been low, they certainly would have hit the reef.

At first light, they hoisted the quarantine flag and launched Big Dink. They would have to re-anchor in the harbor later, but just outside the entrance was good enough for now. They were in the beautiful San Blas Islands of Panama.

365 islands make up the San Blas archipelago on the north coast of the Isthmus of Panama east of the Panama Canal. Less than 50 of the islands are inhabited. The area was reputed to have some of the most beautiful sailing grounds on the planet. Some of the islands are inhabited by the Kunas. History has it the Kunas before the arrival of the Europeans, wore few clothes, and decorated their bodies in brightly-colored painted designs. Once the missionaries arrived and insisted that they wear clothes, the Kunas copied the designs from their bodies and sewed colorful pieces of fabric onto their clothes, replicating the designs from their bodies. Those clothes with the colorfully sewn designs are called Molas, and the Kunas were now selling them to the tourists.

Sure enough, at first light, three dugout canoes with the Kuna women and their Molas came out to Lone Eagle. The Kuna ladies were lovely, albeit a bit understandably pushy to make a sale. Their Molas were absolutely breathtaking. The intricacy of their designs and stitch work was incredible. It had to take them hundreds of hours to make some of them. They thanked the ladies but decided to wait until they were ashore to make their Mola purchases as they could see ladies stringing hundreds of them on lines tied between palms in anticipation of the arrival of the day’s cruise ship.

They took Big Dink in through the harbor entrance. Getting in in daylight would be easy. He was glad he didn’t attempt it earlier. The clear-in went smoothly, and the toys could stay aboard. They did run into one guy off one of the anchored yachts. He asked if they came in last night through the reef? “Actually, we flew over it,” he replied. He didn’t elaborate.

While ashore Gillian wanted to look at the Molas. There had to be forty Kuna ladies selling their wares. They went from lady to lady and finally picked out a couple for themselves and friends and family. They were truly unique, and the colors were vibrant.

They walked past the airstrip, it wasn’t much, with grass growing through the cracks in the runway and a couple of abandoned shacks. There was one old plane on the runway that was warming up for take-off. He didn’t know what kind of plane it was but guessed that it had to be at least forty years old.

Gillian ducked her head into one of the abandoned shacks and pointed out piles of paper. She picked one up. They were old customs clearance records. Some of them dated back to the sixties. So much for record-keeping, he thought as they made their way back to Big Dink.

They moved Lone Eagle into the harbor. As he looked out to the reef, he could see a cruise ship making its approach. There goes the neighborhood, he thought. It wasn’t long before it anchored outside the little harbor and began ferrying-in hordes of tourists. The Mola ladies must be loving it, he thought as they both watched the endless parade of tenders running back and forth.

While the tenders were ferrying in the Mola shoppers, they decided to take Big Dink for a spin out to one of the many uninhabited little atolls that were in easy reach. They flew over fabulous, gin-clear sand flats of the most beautiful, light turquoise water. They pulled Big Dink up on the beach and waded and swam in the warm waters. It wasn’t hard to see why this place was a favorite sailing destination. Even though it was winter, they were only nine degrees north of the equator, and the heat and Caribbean humidity were really stifling. The tropical water made it bearable.

By the time the sun set, they were both in the double bunk with the cabin fans pushing out a gentle breeze. He had attached the wind scoop to the forward hatch, which made for a delightful breeze down below. They were rigged for tropical sailing.

The next morning over coffee, they discussed Panama. They were 65nm from Cristobal and the entrance to the Canal. A run from the San Blas could be five hours or longer if there wasn’t much wind. Longer would also mean arrival at night, which wasn’t an option. He had found a spot where they could pull in short of the Canal some 45nm away that would only leave them 20nm to the Canal. The little place was Isla Grande, which the guide said had a great anchorage and that provisions were available.

“How long will it take us to get through the Canal?”

“I’m not sure. We have to go through add-measure, which is where they measure the boat to come up with a transit price. Once they give us the price and we pay it, we are then put in the cue for a transit date. The guide says that it can take up to two weeks.”

“So, we’re going to be there a while?”

“Yes, but be we won’t be short of things to do. I’ve got to order that new feedwater pump, and we also have to figure out the lines and the line handlers we’re going to need when we transit.”

“So, do you think we should hang out here or head to the Canal?”

“I think we should head for the Canal. We don’t know how long we will have to wait to get through it. If we’re not there, then we’re not in the cue. I think we head for Isla Grande in the morning.”

“Works for me. I’m really looking forward to having a look around Colon.”

They were underway after coffee and took up a westward heading for the seven-hour run to Isla Grande. The rhumb line he set was one mile off the shoals and fringing reefs that lined their route along the Isthmus of Panama. It was a good run, and he was able to land another mahi-mahi. They reached the last transit waypoint and took up a heading for the harbor approach waypoint. They were in and had the pick down with sundowners in hand just in time to catch the sunset.

Isla Grande had a pretty little harbor. There were numerous panga fishing boats on the beach and a cluster of buildings that were probably the downtown area. They launched Big Dink and headed in. They were greeted at the beach by Miguel, a young boy of 12 who eagerly helped them pull Big Dink up on the beach. They were low on ice and had bought in the big cooler in hopes of getting some. Gillian asked him where they might get ice, and Miguel pointed out a little shop that turned out to be his mother’s store. Sure enough, there was a big fridge around the back of the store, and they threw two bags in the cooler. Miguel’s mother was a delight and sold them some fresh fruit and veg.

Miguel helped him carry the cooler back to Big Dink. He insisted, and wouldn’t let Gillian lift it. He was so polite. Gillian gave him a couple of bucks for his trouble, and he lit up like a Christmas tree. They were about to shove off when he spotted two guys with a chain saw ripping some planks out of a tree trunk lying propped up on the ground. He went over to see what they were doing. The guy with the chain saw was a pro. He was ripping perfect thickness planks out of the log. He asked if he could buy two pieces, each about a foot in length. The guy held up three fingers and he pulled three bucks out of his pocket. The guy said thank you and then told him the wood was very hard.

“What are you going to do with the wood?” she asked.

“I’m going to see if I can sculpt it into a new outboard motor mount to go on our stern pulpit. The old one is plastic and starting to fall apart. We really need a solid mount point; otherwise, the outboard could come loose and start banging or worse, fall overboard. I figured I could work on it while we are waiting to transit the Canal.”

They headed back to Lone Eagle and hefted the big cooler aboard and stowed it under the tiller in the aft end of the cockpit. It did make a great watch seat footrest. Next came breaking down Big Dink. He had thought about towing it but decided it was still open water, and they just couldn’t risk it, even if he did take the outboard off. Over dinner, they agreed on a first light start in the morning.





CHAPTER XLIX February 9, 2003 - The run to Panama



Cristobal, Colon, Panama

Lat: 09° 20’ 68.70 N, Long: 079° 54’ 54.40 W

The plan was for an 0600 departure. That didn’t happen. They had broken down Big Dink the night before, and all was in order. As they readied to hoist the anchor, he put the ratchet handle into the anchor windlass and began ratcheting the chain in eight links at a time with each push and pull. He had a few feet in when the ratchet mechanism jammed. Try as he may, he wasn’t able to get it working. He was able to let chain out but was unable to get the ratchet to engage to retrieve it. Gillian was at the helm, waiting for his commands. He walked back to the cockpit and explained the problem. He knew it wasn’t easily fixable. He would have to unbolt it from the bowsprit and then break it down to get at the gear mechanism. He figured half a day – maybe longer.

Not wanting to lose a day, they decided to bring the anchor up by hand. He knew that they could set the anchor in Panama, and he could do the repair work there. Gillian was at the helm and kept gently goosing the motor to take the strain off the 100 feet of chain he was pulling in by hand. It was back-breaking. He finally had the chain vertical with the anchor directly below, but he had to get it out of the bottom. He could see over the side in the clear water that it was buried. He put the anchor snubber on the chain and tied-off the snubber to one of the Sampson posts. Gillian, on his command, backed down and after a few seconds of strain, the anchor broke free

The next part was tricky. He pulled with all of his might to lift the anchor clear of the bottom, but the chain he was holding went out onto the bowsprit anchor roller and then turned ninety degrees downward. There was no way to pull it. He had to go out onto the bowsprit and stand on the teak foot rails and pull it up vertically some 15 feet. He positioned his feet, bent his knees, and began pulling hand-over-hand. It was a 35lb CQR, and he got the tang of it just below the roller and knew it would take a big pull to get it up and over the roller and into its resting position. As he made his final big pull, we felt something shift in his lower back and knew he was going to have quite a few uncomfortable days ahead.

They made their way out of Isla Grande to the first waypoint a mile off the reef that would run all the way westward along the Isthmus of Panama toward Cristobal Colon. They would be below - south all the canal traffic, which would be off to their starboard. The wind was out of the north at 15 knots and the seas were a solid six feet and very lumpy, which wasn’t helping his back. He had a reef in the main, the staysail was up, and he had a bit of Genny out. They were making in the low 5s.

At that speed, it would be a four-hour run to Colon. While Gillian busied herself below, his thoughts drifted to his dad. He had sailed these waters for years. His first ship, the Cefalu, was a regular in these waters. First, as a luxury passenger ship and then as a banana boat transporting bananas from Honduras to the east coast of the US. When the war broke out the ship, and his dad were pressed into service and received orders to head for Norfolk. Once there, they were visited by an inspection team from the war department, apparently sizing-up how much and what kind of cargo the Cefalu was best suited to carry. According to his dad, the inspectors were delighted to see that the Cefalu had been fitted with tween decks (decks between decks) which ensured that the stalks of bananas wouldn’t be crushed during transit. After a bit of measuring and some weight tests, the inspectors concluded that those tween decks were also perfect for carrying 500 lb bombs. His dad said it took two days to gently load all of those bombs that were moved alongside the ship in the dead of night. When it was done, the ship was given orders to sail to Panama and the Captain was told that further orders would be issued once they cleared the canal. Once they transited the Canal, the Captain opened the sealed orders he had been given and told the crew that they were bound for Sydney. As the story goes, it was his dad’s first trip to Sydney, the one where he had met his mom. It was the summer of 1942, some six months since Pearl Harbor, and his dad was riding on a ship carrying hundreds of 500 lb bombs. “You wouldn’t have felt a thing if she went up,” his dad told him when he asked about all the Japanese subs lurking in the Pacific.

They were doing fifteen-minute radar sweeps, and as they neared Colon, the number of radar contacts increased. It was going to be an interesting afternoon, he thought as he switched on the engine. He didn’t need to run the motor as the wind was good. He ran it because he was now going to keep the radar running and it sucked amps that would be replaced by the new, powerful 120-amp alternator. At a 40 mile sweep, there were dozens of contacts both coming and going from the canal. There were discernible inbound and outbound lanes. He switched to 20 miles and concentrated on the ones nearest. Many of them were doing 20+ knots versus his 5 so being overtaken was going to happen quite a lot.

The nearest contact was five miles astern and one mile off his position. He was moving quite fast. He keyed the VHF mic, gave his position, speed, and heading along with the position, heading, and speed of the contact which he designated as Target 1. A few moments later, Target 1 came on the air and acknowledged his call. Target 1 confirmed that they had him on radar and then added that he was giving off a strong radar return. Good, he thought. I’m glad we’re showing up brightly.

There were multiple contacts all afternoon, and everyone he attempted to raise promptly responded. By the end of the day, he had nine targets that he spoke with that passed them. As they approached Colon, the transit lanes compressed, and so did the clearance between Lone Eagle and each passing ship. It was a bit nerve-racking, but it all went more smoothly than he thought it would. Before long, they had reached the waypoint for the turn into Bahia de Manzanillo, which was the bay at the entrance to the Gatun Locks.

The view as they entered the bay was breathtaking. Ships coming in and out and a huge, bustling container port came into view where ships of all flags were loading and unloading containers. He took up a heading along the eastern side of the main ship channel and got his binoculars out to look for the anchorage called the Flats. It wasn’t long before he saw the sticks (masts) of other cruising yachts in a loose cluster up ahead.

His back was really starting to bother him as he made his way forward and lowered the main and packed the staysail. As he stood on the foredeck surveying the Flats, he tested the anchor windlass. It would pay out, but it still wouldn’t retrieve the chain. It wasn’t going to be a fun project to fix it, especially since he didn’t have any spare parts for it. He bought a manual windlass because he thought it was bulletproof. Electric ones were notorious for breaking down. So much for bulletproof.

The Flats were really sheltered, which was good. The bad part was that there wasn’t much of a breeze, and the humidity had to be ninety percent. They maneuvered near the other yachts and dropped the pick. The windlass paid out the chain without any problem. He wished he had installed an electric one.

It was now late in the day, and the sun would soon be setting. With his back, the way it was, launching Big Dink the next morning sounded like a better idea. He got off the email to Spectra to order the feedwater pump and spare impellers. Standing at the nav station, he could feel the pain in his back radiating down his right leg, and he took some Naprosyn and some muscle relaxers that Gillian had gotten out for him.

Gillian had lit and hung their big anchor light up forward off the Genny. He was glad they had it given the amount of traffic that was zigging its way across the bay. The anchorage was going to be a bit rollie, but at least it was protected and really close to the Panama Canal Yacht Club. He was thankful that they had cleared in while in the San Blas.

That evening as night fell, the harbor lit up. There were lights everywhere which made it really hard to discern the marine traffic from the background lighting. The canal operated 24 hours a day 365 days a year, so there were always big ships going by. As they finished dinner in the cockpit and their second sundowners, the pain seemed to ease a bit. That double bunk was going to feel very good.

The next morning began stiff and sore. Coffee, more Naprosyn, and some breakfast was the plan. As they sat in the cockpit enjoying the last of their coffee, they were watching all of the container ships passing just off the Flats. They were huge, and each held thousands of containers bound for who knows where. He saw something hanging off the bow of one that was approaching. What was it? He picked up the binoculars and adjusted the focus. Shit, it was the mast of a sailboat that was hanging by its rigging from the giant anchor on the front of the container ship. My God, that ship had run down a sailboat. Does he even know? He picked up the VHF and hailed the container ship. They acknowledged. He explained that they had a sailboat’s mast fouled in their anchor. There was silence - dead silence. Moments later, the container ship replied. This time the person speaking identified himself as the captain and said he would investigate and thanked him for notifying them. In less than a minute, he could see several men running forward and looking over the side.

There wouldn’t be any identifying markings on the mast that would tell them the name of the yacht. They probably had no idea that they had even run over it. Just another missing yacht. No one would ever know. He could only imagine the sheer terror that their loved ones would face when they learned that their friends and family were missing when they failed to check-in. How many searches would be undertaken? Would the container ship captain even report it to the authorities? They would never know.

The Flats was an interesting place. Quite a few yachts were coming in to be locked through, and those that had been from the Pacific side were there re-grouping before sailing off into the Caribbean. More yachts were heading through to the Pacific than those going the other way.

Each morning at 0800, the unofficial Flats radio net came to life. The chatter was interesting. They just listened. Sure enough, others had heard his radio transmission with the containership. The speculation was rampant. They listened as the other cruisers talked about arranging for their add measure, paying the transit fee, sourcing the four 100’ lines, and arranging for the line handlers, and where they could obtain lots of tires to hang off the sides of their boats to protect them from the canal walls.

They listened intently but knew they would have plenty of time to take care of all of those things, but today was windlass repair day. He collected his tool bag and his bundle of wrenches and headed for the foredeck with his big straw hat. It wasn’t long before he had the windlass off and on a towel in his lap. It was a beautiful piece of bronze. The housing casting was gorgeous. It was made in China as were so many bronze cast products. Not many bronze casting foundries left in the States, he thought.

He inspected the ratchet mechanism and saw the problem. When the capstan was tightened to retrieve chain, it didn’t tighten enough to engage the ratchet. He sat there sweating and thinking if he could jury-rig something – anything. He settled on using a couple of washers as spacers that he hoped would force the ratchet over far enough to engage the ratchet when he tightened the capstan. He had some washers in his tool bag that would fit. He had to disassemble the entire mechanism, but it wasn’t long before he had it all back together. He tested it, and it seemed to work just fine. The real test would be under load and that meant remounting it to the bowsprit. He knew if it didn’t work, it would take a few more hours to try again, and with the heat, the humidity and, his back, he knew he would be spent if that happened.

He greased all the gears and painfully lifted and positioned it on the bowsprit. His back let him know that it wasn’t happy. He threaded the anchor chain over the capstan and untied the snubber to apply the load. It worked. He retrieved ten feet of chain, and the ratchet worked as it was supposed to. What a relief.

After lunch, they managed to get Big Dink launched and headed into the yacht club. The docks and the facility were showing their age, but to him and to the hundreds of thousands of people that passed through here, it was, literally, the crossroads of the world. As they entered the place, it certainly felt like it. He found the dockmaster’s office and inquired about the office accepting delivery for him of the Spectra shipment. He also asked about the dockage rate. It would be reasonable for a few nights but the Flats would be home for the foreseeable future. They passed by the little gift shop and saw that they had beautiful polo shirts with embroidery of three steps signifying the Gatun Locks with the words Panama Canal Yacht Club. They bought two. Not many marina and yacht club urchins have one of these, he thought.

The dockmaster told them that the yacht club wasn’t in the best of areas and that they should use taxis to get around. Gillian checked out the showers. They, too, were pretty tired. They took one of the taxis waiting in the club parking lot and headed to the Port Captain’s Office in town to arrange for an add measure appointment. The Port Captain asked for their clearance documents and, upon inspection, directed them to the Customs Office that was thankfully in the same building. They went up to the Customs counter, and he told the officer that he had been sent by the Port Captain. The officer inspected the papers that had been provided by their San Blas office, and a look of disgust came over his face along with a few unintelligible Spanish swear words. He asked for the ship’s papers, confirmed that the toys could stay aboard, and then proceeded to sign and stamp a pile of documents that he politely handed across the counter. They were now ‘officially’ checked into Panama.

The add measure office was next. With the updated clear-in documents, it went smoothly. An official from the add measure office would come out to Lone Eagle on Thursday, and he was to come back to the office the next day with the add measure receipt. The official couldn’t advise of the amount of the transit fee but said it would be on the add measure receipt and to bring or arrange payment when he brought it back to the office. He said they did accept credit card payments. Perfect, he thought. He knew you couldn’t just pull that kind of money out of an ATM, and a wire transfer would have been a nightmare.

They took a cab to a grocery store, and Gillian filled several bags. Luckily, the cab was waiting outside when they finished their shopping. The cabby said he was having his lunch and was happy to continue waiting for them. Two doors down was a marine chandlery and he wasn’t going to miss the opportunity to pick up a few last-minute items. He picked up an Ecuadorian courtesy flag, and as he was heading for the checkout, he spotted a perfect size Perko Stern Light. It was better than the little one on Lone Eagle and it had a Fresnel lens and a much brighter bulb. They would be much more visible to someone coming up from behind them. They hailed the driver and off they went back to the yacht club.

It had been a long, hot afternoon, and his back wasn’t doing him any favors. Getting in and out of the cab was a cringing experience. Back at the yacht club, they headed for the bar. It was huge and the walls were covered with hundreds of flags and pictures of hundreds of all manner of ships and sailing yachts. He could have spent a day in there – now that wasn’t such a bad idea, he thought.

They ordered a couple of Absolut and tonics and settled down in the comfortable lounge area. He wondered whether his father had downed a few cold ones here. He didn’t recall him ever mentioning it. He probably wasn’t allowed off the ship. He reached into his rucksack and pulled out a Cohiba cigar that was from his Cuban stash. He lit it and savored its sweet aroma.

“Do you think they will ever find that sailboat and those people? I couldn’t believe that all that was left was a mast hanging out of their anchor,” she asked.

“Baby, they are fish food. There wouldn’t have been anything left of the boat after it came out from under that ship. Just debris. They probably didn’t know what hit them.”

“Is there any way for them to know the name of the boat that they ran over?”

“Probably not as they probably have no idea when they ran over it. It could have been hundreds even thousands of miles back. Someone may find some debris somewhere like a life ring with the name of the boat on it, but otherwise, they have just gone missing – lost at sea. That’s why we do fifteen-minute radar sweeps. Those container ships are doing 20+ knots, and it doesn’t take long for them to be right on top of you.”

“Do you think the container ship captain will report it?”

“Maybe, but doubtful. He has a schedule to make, and without some kind of identifying markings on the mast, there would be no hope of identifying the vessel. No, I think he will drop anchor somewhere, shake off the mast and sail on.”

It was a quiet ride back to Lone Eagle, and Gillian was still upset. They unloaded the groceries and settled into the cockpit for a sundowner. Gillian had bought some lovely orange chicken for dinner. Why doesn’t the rest of the world corn feed them? Chicken in the States has that lovely shade of pinkish-grey with almost no flavor. The chicken over here he could live on. Come to think of it, the locals here do.

The morning radio net proved as entertaining as usual. One cruiser was asking if anyone knew of a compass swinger – a guy to calibrate his compass for the southern hemisphere. That started a spirited debate of why it was needed, and that led to the topic of compass dip which he subtly introduced. Well, that certainly set the net alight. There were quite a few cruisers who clearly became concerned that their northern hemisphere compasses wouldn’t be working in the southern hemisphere. Others just thought that there was no such thing.

The next net topic was about organizing for the four 100’ lines, the four line handlers, and all the tires needed for use as fenders while in the lock chambers. Apparently, there were lots of line handlers, and they all had access to the necessary lines and tires.

The Panama Canal Guide was helpful. There were essentially two ways to lock a boat through the canal locks. The first was center chamber which meant that the boat would be on its own in the center of the lock chamber and four guys 90’ up at the top of the lock would throw down monkey fists (lines with weights on the ends) to your four line handlers on the boat and they would attach the ends of each of the monkey fist lines to the 100’ lines lying on deck. These lines would then be lifted to the line guys on the top of the lock. Once the lock chamber began to fill with water, the four line handlers on the boat would rapidly take in the lines to keep the boat in the middle of the lock chamber. The object of the exercise was to keep the boat in the center of the chamber. The walls of the chambers were old, greasy and rough. Which is why everyone needed the tires to protect the sides of the boat in case they didn’t stay in the center and scraped their way up the side of the lock. He had seen a couple of boats that had, and the result was terrible, greasy gashes to the side of the boat that looked like someone had taken a chain saw to the hull.

The second way to lock through was side-tied to a tug. You essentially pulled into the lock after a tug went in before you and tied up to him. As the chamber filled, the tug’s winches would take in the lines. You were there for the ride. As you didn’t know which method would be used, you had to prepare for either scenario. Organizing the lines and the line handlers would have to wait until they were assigned a transit date, which would be after add measure and the payment of the transit fee.

As they listened to the rest of the net, he was thinking about the remaining projects that still needed to be completed and the watermaker. It needed to be run every two days and the water in the harbor was less than optimal and would certainly require quite a few filter changes if they stayed on the pick in the Flats.

“Baby, I think we are going to have to move to the yacht club. That way, we’ll have shore power and can just run the watermaker for a little while each day. We can then do one filter change before we head out into the Pacific. The shore power will also help, and we can run the AC without pulling out the Honda generator.”

“I think that is a good idea. It will also save us a lot of running back and forth on Big Dink.”





CHAPTER L February 11, 2003 - The Canal Yacht Club



Cristobal, Colon, Panama

Lat: 09° 20’ 68.70 N, Long: 079° 54’ 54.40 W

He radioed the dockmaster at the yacht club and organized a berth, and knew it might be for as long as a couple of weeks so the dockage bill was going to be big, but the daily rate wasn’t as bad as he thought. Up on deck, he wasn’t relishing the thought of bringing up the anchor, but it came up quickly, and they were on their way. It didn’t take long to get into the berth, and before long, they had the shore power connected, and the AC was humming. Using all the dock water they wanted was a blessing. They had gotten a side-tie berth, which meant that they didn’t have to climb over the bowsprit to get ashore.

After lunch, they sat in the cockpit and reviewed the list of remaining projects. There was the installation of the new stern light, installation of the lifting blocks for the two spinnaker poles which included the used, big pole that he bought at Mario’s, the sculpting of the new outboard motor mount, a mount arrangement for the taffrail generator (a towed propeller that turns an alternator that makes power), the rigging of the lazy jack system (a configuration of lines that would capture the sail when it was lowered), and the installation of the new ratlines (a ladder-like arrangement attached to the rigging that would allow climbing aloft). The ratlines were alternating teak and line that he had fabricated at Mario’s. The more he thought about each of the projects, the happier he was to be at a dock to do them.

The next morning the add measure guy showed up. Nice guy but visibly in a hurry. He hoped the guy would use Lone Eagle’s 30’ on deck measurement and not include the bowsprit and Monitor. No luck. The guy and his helper strung the tape from the tip of the bowsprit all the way out to the very tip of Monitor. The measurement came in at 42,’ and the transit charge was one thousand two hundred dollars USD. The add measure guy handed him the receipt and told him that he could pay it at the Canal Authority office and that they would give him a transit date. He decided they would go into the Canal Authority office the next morning. He knew he had to get stuck into the projects and get them done as quickly as he could since he had no idea how soon the transit date would be.

The next morning the net chatter was all about whether cruisers could or should go to the Marquesas via Galapagos. The distance directly from Panama to the Marquesas was 3,800nm. The distance from Panama to the Galapagos was 845nm, which was generally along the route to the Marquesas but added an additional 200nm to the overall distance making it 4,000nm. Going to Galapagos also meant spending a lot of time in the Doldrums as you would arrive at the Galapagos Islands shortly after you crossed the equator.

As they listened to the net chatter, it was clear that the rumor mill about Galapagos was in overdrive. Some cruisers said the entrance fee was one thousand dollars. Another said you had to pay one hundred dollars per day for a guide even if you never left port. Still, another said you had to apply to the Ecuadorian embassy for special permission to even enter the islands. A 9 to 10 day run to Galapagos would be better than a 30+ day run to the Marquesas, and you even got to take in Galapagos. A really attractive option, he thought, but it would require a lot more thought.

After the net, he gathered the ship’s papers and the add measure receipt, and they caught a cab to the Canal Authority office. He paid the transit fee with his credit card and was given a certificate that contained the ship’s identification number that had been assigned to Lone Eagle. The words on the certificate said that it had to be posted in the ship’s radio room and that the assigned ship number was to be given in all radio communications with the Canal Authority.

The desk clerk then went over to a wall that was a giant whiteboard calendar that showed all the scheduled transits. He studied it for a few minutes and then wrote on it. He came back to the counter and announced that their transit would be on February 27 and that Lone Eagle was to be out on the Flats orbiting and would be radioed for a pilot pick up at 0600. They thanked the clerk and caught a cab back to the yacht club. They had twelve days to get everything ready.

Back at the boat, he got going on the ratlines project. He got his sail repair thread and found the spool of heavy waxed twine that he would use to lash the first teak piece to each of the lower shrouds (two wires that extended from the mast spreaders to the chainplates that were fastened to the side of the boat). He had measured each of the alternating teak pieces, with each having a groove that he had made to ensure that they fit snugly between the shrouds. He began the whipping process (winding of the twine). It took a while, but eventually, he got each end tight enough to support his weight. One by one, they were whipped and tested.

The ratlines would be a godsend for navigating through the reefs. Up until this point, he had to stand on the bowsprit. Being able to go up the ratlines would give him so much more forward visibility. Henry on Grippen had them and used them all the time.

It was a slow process. First, a teak one and then a line one that was spliced with an eye on each end. He was relieved that he had done all the splicing and fitting in Mario’s, as the whipping he now had to do was taking forever. He managed to get the starboard side done by the end of the day. The port side was tomorrow's project.

By noon of the next day, he had the port side ratlines done and moved on to the topping lifts for the spinnaker poles (a pulley and line arrangement that enables the lifting and lowering of a spinnaker pole). Gillian hoisted him up the mast in the boson’s chair to the spreaders, and he attached the two blocks (pulleys) – one for each spinnaker pole. He also attached the small pullies he had bought for the lazy jacks. Having two spinnaker poles would allow him to pole out the staysail and the Genny or the Genny and the spinnaker. The lazy jacks would help to capture the main as it was lowered. He knew the Pacific run was going to be downwind and that it was essential to be able to pole out both sails but, more importantly, control both poles. With both poles having topping lifts and downward fore and aft control lines, the poles would essentially be locked in place. There was nothing more dangerous on the foredeck than a spinnaker pole flying around. He knew people that had been hit by them, and it wasn’t pretty. He was going to be up on the foredeck solo and couldn’t afford to take any chances.

One by one, the projects were all completed. He had spoken to the dockmaster about the lines, line handlers, and the tires. The dockmaster pointed to a guy standing at the bar and said, “He's your man. And oh yeah, here’s a package that came in for you from some outfit called Spectra.” That man was Lionel, and he had been a line handler for twenty years. Four or five times a week, he would take sailing yachts through the canal. They were 12 hour days and Lionel would catch the hour-long bus ride back to Colon each night. His skin was weathered, but he had a kindness about him that made him the favorite among the yachties. He bought Lionel a beer, and they chatted. Lionel would line up the other three line handlers and they would bring their own lines. He also said they would be able to bring 8 tires. The transit date was fine, but there was one more thing. Lionel wanted to look over Lone Eagle.

They walked down the dock, and Lionel had a good look at Lone Eagle. His eyes went straight for the Sampson posts on the foredeck and then to the big bronze cleats astern and amidships.

Lionel said, “She will be fine. I’ve had a couple lately where the cleats ripped right out of the deck.”

The fee was one hundred dollars for the lines, one hundred dollars per line handler, and eighty dollars for the tires. Payment in cash in full on the day at the time of boarding was required. Lionel told him that he would drop by the day before to make sure Lone Eagle was ready. He said that on the morning of transit, he and the boys would show up at 0500. He suggested buying plastic lawn size garbage bags to wrap the tires and also that the flexible solar panels needed to be removed as they could be damaged by a monkey fist landing on them.

Two days before their transit date, they sat in the cockpit, sipping their morning coffee, and listened to the net. Boats were coming and going every day, so sometimes, the topics were repetitive. You also couldn’t get much information from the boats coming through from the Pacific side as most were coming down the coast from California to do the Caribbean and hadn’t been out doing the islands of the Pacific.

“Hey, Cap, have you given any more thought about doing Galapagos?”

“I have. Actually, I’ve been thinking about it a lot. I think we should do it.”

A big smile came across her face. “I was hoping you would say that. I’ve always wanted to go there, and sailing right by it would be a shame.”

“I agree. Galapagos is an amazing place. I read up on it in the guide. It would be a 9 day run from Balboa.”

“What about all those fees and charges we keep hearing about on the net?”

“I don’t know how much of what we have been hearing is true. What I do know is that under international maritime law we have the right to enter any port. Whether we decide to stay or whether they will let us stay is another matter. We can, however, stay to refuel and re-provision and for as long as it takes to make necessary repairs. Assuming we get there and the fees are crazy, we can stay a day or so and then move on. At least we will have had an opportunity to stop and refuel because the next leg, the run to the Marquesas, is 25-30 days, and I think we are going to be burning a lot of fuel just getting to Galapagos.”

“Tomorrow is our last day before we transit. What else do we have to do to get ready?”

“Well, we have to feed and water the four line handlers and the pilot. The Canal Authority rules are really strict. If we don’t get through in one day, then we have to accommodate and pay the line handlers, pay a daily fee for the pilot, and pay a five hundred dollar penalty charge.”

“Is there any risk we won’t make it through in a day?”

“There is. We are going to be really loaded and slow. We will motor sail at cruise speed or better. If there is a good breeze, I’ll have all the canvas up as we go through Gatun Lake. If the wind is good, we shouldn’t have a problem. If there isn’t any wind, then it gets dicey.”

“So we have to feed and water five people plus us. I guess we better go to the store tomorrow. I’ll have to figure out what I can make for them. It’s going to be hot as hell down below, so it has got to be easy.”

“I’ve got a better idea. Did you see that Kentucky Fried Chicken place down the road? How about three big buckets of chicken and some coleslaw and potato salad? Everyone would love it since probably everyone makes them sandwiches, and you wouldn’t be stuck in the galley. All we need is some bottled water, cokes, and ice for the cooler, and we’re set. What do you think?”

“Rob, that’s a great idea. I’ll get some paper plates, paper napkins, and some plastic knives and forks. There won’t even be any clean-up. I love it.”

That afternoon he tested the watermaker. Both feedwater pumps were working. There was no point in trying to swap out a pump when it was working, so he stowed the one that had just come in the mail. He had removed the flexible solar panels and stowed them under the forepeak bunks. Everything top side looked fine. Big Dink had been washed and stowed, and the new outboard motor mount he had sculpted fit perfectly on the stern rail. Those guys he bought the wood from were right. That wood was tough stuff, and he had a couple of very dull chisels to prove it.

The next day was transit eve, so they made the run to the store and to Kentucky Fried Chicken. That afternoon Lionel dropped by and declared that everything was ready and said that he would see them at 0500. They paid the dockmaster, had dinner at the bar, and turned in early. Sleep eluded him. His mind ran through everything. He simply couldn’t turn off.





CHAPTER LI February 27, 2003 – Canal Transit



Cristobal, Colon, Panama

Lat: 09° 20’ 68.70” N, Long: 079° 54’ 54.40” W

Fifty million gallons of water. He had read that was how much water it took to lock one ship through the canal. It didn’t matter if it was a rowboat or a container ship, and all of that water came from Gatun Lake. It was the largest man-made lake in the world and was created by the damming of the Chagres River. It held all of the water necessary for the operation of the locks. Propelled by gravity, the water reached the locks by a system of main culverts located in the central and sidewalls of the chambers that were nearly as big as the tubes of the Penn Central Railroad crossing under the Hudson River. Next, the water entered several lateral culverts that ran under the lock chamber floor. Each lateral culvert had 5 holes measuring 4.5' in diameter. Those culverts distributed the water through 100 holes in the chamber floor raising the boat 85' to the level of the Gatun Lake.

All he could think about as he laid there in the bunk was how turbulent the water would be in the locks. He imagined having to yell orders to the line handlers to keep Lone Eagle in the center of the chamber. It was all very unsettling. The thought of Lone Eagle hitting the sidewalls of the chamber made his stomach turn.

“Cap, are you awake?” It was 0200.

“Yep. Can’t sleep. Been awake for hours. Might as well get up.”

They broke down the double bunk, and Gillian got the kettle boiling. It was going to take a lot of coffee, and there were three Thermos’ lined up to be filled. After clearing the cobwebs, they sat in the cockpit and enjoyed their coffee and the peace of the marina which they knew would soon give way to a day full of massive activity. Even at that hour, big ships were locking in and out of the canal.

Gillian tore up some old towels into strips and put them into the cooler. They would certainly be great face-wipes for everyone as they both knew it was going to be a sweltering, humid day.

They had some breakfast and went over their checklist. Everything was in order. He checked the engine. It was going to get a workout today. All the fluid levels were right. At 0500, Lionel and his three line handlers arrived with each was carrying a massive coil of line on their shoulders and a tire in each hand. They were all sweating profusely. With the lines and men aboard, they began the process of bagging each tire in the garbage bags and hanging them over the side and tying them off on the stanchions. There were four on each side, and he had four other fenders ready just in case.

As the men went about their preparations, he started the engine, turned on the chart plotter, depth sounder, and running lights. At 0530, they shoved off from the yacht club and headed out on the trackback course for the Flats. There was no wind and the visibility was clear but it was tough to discern the lights of marine traffic against the background lights all around the harbor that was glaringly lit up. His eyes slowly adjusted, and he as able to see the moving maritime traffic. It wasn’t too bad at that hour.

At 0545, he keyed the VHF mic and advised port control that he was on station and orbiting. They replied that the pilot was en route. It wasn’t long before a pilot boat pulled alongside, and their pilot came aboard Lone Eagle. His name was Thomas, and he looked to be in his late twenties. Gillian handed him a cup of coffee and a muffin and Thomas explained how their day would unfold. There was just enough room for the three of them in the cockpit. Lionel and his line handlers were sitting on deck with their backs to the cabin top. They had clearly done this many times before.

Thomas explained that each lock was 110’ wide and 1,050’ long. The lock doors ranged in height from 47’ to 82’. The doors themselves were 7’ thick and 65’ wide, with some weighing as much as 600 tones. With most ships designed to make use of every square foot of lock space, there wasn’t much room left in the chamber for other vessels. Vessels designed for the locks were called Panamax ships. Supertankers and aircraft carriers couldn’t fit in the locks, and they took the long way around South America via Cape Horn.

Thomas had his own hand-held VHF radio and keyed the mic to raise port control. The whole conversation was in rapid-fire Spanish, and he caught none of it. Thomas directed him to head for the first Gatun lock. It was just starting to get light, but the lights over the locks were blazing. As they approached, he could see that an enormous car carrier was already in the first lock, so Lone Eagle would be going in behind him. As he throttled back on approach, he could see a tug was already inside the chamber aft of the car carrier and was tied to the chamber wall. Thomas directed him to come in alongside the tug. This first lock was going to be side-tied to a tug, and the tug would be doing the heavy lifting for this lock. He was relieved.

Being side tied to the tug meant that the line handlers would be passengers for this first lock. It also meant that he had to break out the bow, stern, and two spring lines that he had just stowed. He retrieved them from the cockpit locker and passed them to Lionel. The line handlers set them up for a starboard side tie to the tug. With the lines ready, he eased Lone Eagle forward and entered the massive chamber. The locks ranged in height from 45’ to 84’. This one was a big one. The top of the lock towered above his mast, which was 50’ and the top of the stern of the car carrier had to be three times that height.

With the lines and the line handlers in position, he eased Lone Eagle abeam of the tug. The tug deck crew was on deck and took their lines. Thomas and Lionel instructed the handlers to make all of the lines as tight as they could tie them to keep Lone Eagle in position. Any slack in the lines could result in them breaking or cleats getting ripped out of the deck if a sudden, heavy load was placed on them. Such a load was coming.

With the lines secured, Thomas said there was another small sailboat that was coming in and would be side tying to the port side of Lone Eagle. He could see the little boat coming into the chamber was flying a Swedish flag, and that the people aboard were elderly. The skipper brought her nicely alongside Lone Eagle. Their line handling wasn’t the best, but within a few minutes, the Swedish boat was firmly tied to Lone Eagle. He looked up at the bridge of the tug and could see the tug captain watching the events unfolding below. When their eyes met, the tug captain gave him a thumbs up.

Moments later, a claxon above sounded, and within seconds, the giant lock doors slowly began to close. The lock doors swung in from the inside of the lock and formed a point upstream that would be held firmly together by the water that was about to be released into the chamber.

A second claxon sounded, and moments later, the water around them began to bubble and boil. It was a rolling boil like you would have on a stove just before you threw in the pasta. Just then, he heard the tugs hydraulic winch motors kick-in and start the slow winding of the tug’s lines that reached to the top of the chamber.

His lines to the tug and the Swedish boat's lines to Lone Eagle were holding as the water continued to boil around them. The lift wasn’t fast, but it was steady, and Gillian watched with a hopeful look on her face. It wasn’t long before they were even with the top of the lock, and the boiling and bubbling of the water subsided.

The car carrier was so big that it had little more than 2’ of clearance on either side of the lock walls. They couldn’t see the forward lock doors open for the car carrier, but they heard the claxon. Thomas instructed him to start Lone Eagle’s engine and to put her in reverse at 1/3 throttle. He was pre-straining his lines, and within seconds, he knew why.

The car carrier’s stern was no more than 100’ off Lone Eagle’s bow. When the car carrier started its engine and put it in gear to move to the next lock, a wall of whitewater from its propeller headed right for Lone Eagle’s bow. Within seconds it arrived. The turbulence was incredible, and you could hear Lone Eagle’s lines groan with the strain being placed upon them. Gillian was transfixed and worried. The Swedish skipper never took his eyes off his cleats. He knew what the Swedish skipper was thinking. So did Lionel as they glanced at each other and back to the Swede’s cleats – would they hold or pop? The whitewater lasted no more than a minute and completely dissipated as the car carrier pulled into the second lock.

Once the turbulence had subsided, Thomas directed that the Swedish boat untie its lines and break off. As soon as the Swede was clear, it was his turn. The deckhands on the tug threw his lines to his line handlers as he put Lone Eagle in gear and slowly edged away from the side of the tug. The tug followed suit as soon as he was clear and proceeded ahead of them into the next chamber. Once the tug and securely tied to the chamber wall, Thomas directed him to move forward into the second chamber to repeat the process.

The second lock worked the same as the first. So did the third lock, although this time when the gate opened, and the car carrier headed out, it did so into Lake Gatun for the 21 mile run to Culebra Cut and the next lock - Pedro Miguel. At lake level, having been lifted three times, they were now 84’ above the Caribbean.

Once in the lake, Thomas gave him a heading and pointed to the markers that denoted the channel. The tug was now way out in front, but the car carrier, for some unknown reason, was hanging back. Thomas told him to pass the car carrier and then stay close to the marks to allow for the passing of other big ships. Thomas warned him not to stray outside the marks. The channel was only 750’ wide, and with two ships passing each 100’ wide, it left little room for Lone Eagle. Thomas explained that when the Chagres River was dammed to form the lake that it covered a densely wooded jungle and that outside the channel markers, there were all kinds of submerged, old-growth, mahogany trees to run into.

The wind was out of the north at a solid fifteen knots, and their route would mean they would have a starboard broad reach. He rolled out the Genny and engaged Monitor. He had Lone Eagle at cruising speed revs, but she was barely making 5 knots with all the weight on board. With the Genny out, she was making 5.3 knots. More canvas, he thought as he went on deck to hoist the main. With the main up, they were making 5.5 knots and sometimes a bit higher.

Thomas was fascinated by Monitor. He studied it and asked lots of questions, but for the life of him, he couldn’t figure out how it worked. Thomas couldn’t believe you could leave her to steer. He explained to him that you could as long as the wind didn’t shift. Thomas remained skeptical and kept looking back at Monitor and the tiller.

It was now mid-day. The car carrier had passed them earlier, but the Swedish boat wasn’t anywhere in sight. There was still a lot of ship traffic and not a lot of room in the channel. Some ships towering over them passed little more than 100’ from their side. He kept his eyes on the ships coming up from behind because, as each passed, he had to turn sharply into their wake as they were fast-moving, and their wake was at least 6’ if not more.

It was noon, and Gillian brought out the buckets of chicken. There were smiles all around as Lionel mentioned that he and the men were so tired of sandwiches. As Gillian passed around the food, he could see on the chart plotter that they were coming up on Barro Colorado Island, where the Smithsonian had a research station. Apparently, the dense jungle around the lake and on the island made for a perfect spot for the study of the exotic wildlife, which, according to Thomas, included crocodiles.

As the island neared and between bites of a piece of chicken, he spotted a container ship closing fast from the rear. It wasn’t long before he was a beam of the island, and the container ship was a beam of Lone Eagle. There couldn’t have been more than 100’ between Lone Eagle and the jungle on the starboard side and 100’ to the container ship that was zipping by along his port side. It was surreal. Toucans and howler monkeys were howling within feet of them on one side, and a towering container ship was passing them on the other. He kept his eyes on the container ship and the marks that he was skirting while Gillian took pictures of flora and fauna and giggled at every howl of the monkeys.

Tomas checked his watch and thankfully confirmed that they were making good time and would be arriving right on schedule for Culebra Cut and the Pedro Miguel lock. They were almost across the 24 miles of Gatun Lake. The Culebra Cut on the south side of the lake was a man-made canal that was cut through the hills that made up the continental divide mountain range that ran along the Isthmus between the two continents. Culebra Cut ran for 8 miles. Over 20,000 men died digging tens of millions of tons of rock out to a depth of 40’ above Pacific sea level. At one point in the construction, more than 400,000 men were digging.

As they proceeded toward the southern end of Gatun Lake, Culebra Cut slowly came into view. It was only 45 miles as the crow flies from one side of the canal to the other. Not a very long distance, but the climatic variation was stark. On the Caribbean side, there were jungles and stifling humidity. On the Pacific side, it was dryer and more arid with a lot less vegetation. As they entered the cut, the shipping traffic continued, and with it, the constant need to watch out for ships approaching from the rear.

Once in the cut, the wind dropped, and he rolled in the Genny and dropped the main into the new lazy jacks, which worked perfectly while Gillian disengaged Monitor. Thomas provided a running commentary on the history of the cut. Ahead was Contractors Hill. It was stair-stepped down to the canal. On the east was Gold Hill with Contractors Hill on the west side. The space that was in between – the Saddle was the lowest point of the two hills rising 333’ above sea level. All of it – millions of tons of rock was dug out so that the canal had a depth of 65’. Six thousand men worked in the cut, and it took 60 million pounds of dynamite to blast their way through it. It was a fantastic sight.

They completed the 8-mile transit and arrived at the Pedro Miguel lock. It was a single lock and would be the first of the descending locks that would take them to the Pacific. As they approached, he could see that the lock’s green enter light was lit and that their friendly tug was already secured to the starboard side wall at the end of the long lock some 1,000 feet away. The lock was at lake-level and full of water, which was just a few feet from the top of the lock doors. Thomas directed him to proceed into the lock and prepare for a starboard side tie to the tug. As he slowly motored toward the tug, he glanced behind to see the big car carrier bringing up the rear. He’s going to come in behind us. That ought to be interesting. There still was no sign of the Swedish boat.

The tie-off to the tug went smoothly. By the time it was done, all eyes were focused on the car carrier that was just entering the other end of the chamber. From its bow, you could see two cables stretching to each side of the lock that were connected to the mules – little diesel locomotives that would pull the ship into the lock. As the mules dragged the ship further into the lock, the ship’s enormous, towering bow that had to be ten stories tall crept closer and closer to Lone Eagle. It was really unnerving looking at the bow of such a massive ship coming at them. The anchors hanging from the ship’s bow looked bigger than Lone Eagle and reminded them both of what they had seen on the Flats. He told Gillian that it was a viewing angle he hoped never to see again.

The mules brought the car carrier to a gentle stop. The bow was just short of being directly overhead and towered above the top Lone Eagle’s mast.

Within a few minutes, the claxon sounded. This time the water didn’t boil around them. It turned into eddies and whirlpools as the water was drained out of the lock. The lock walls got higher and higher, and you could see the deckhands on the tug paying out line off the winches as fast as they could throughout the descent.

Once the descent was complete and the massive lock doors opened, Thomas gave the command for them to break away from the tug so that the tug could proceed into the channel with Lone Eagle right behind him. It was just over a mile to the Miraflores locks, the last of which would drop them in the Pacific.

They motored their way down the Miraflores Lake toward the locks. The tug was ahead of them, and the car carrier was behind them. Thomas said that the process would be the same as at the Pedro Miguel lock with the tug and Lone Eagle in front of the car carrier.

On arrival, Thomas directed him to proceed to the front of the lock. The two locks would drop them a total of 54’ to the level of mid-tide. As there was a big tidal range, the lock operator would lower them to be even with the then-current level of the tide. Thomas warned him that when the gates of the last lock opened, there would be a lot of turbulence owing to the mixing of the freshwater from the lock and the saltwater from the Pacific.

The process was the same in the first lock as it was at the Pedro Miguel lock. When the doors of the first lock opened, they broke away from the tug, and the tug proceeded into the second chamber with him coming in slowly behind to allow the tug to tie-off before he came alongside. Next was the car carrier and the mules. As the second chamber was full, they had a birds-eye view of the port of Balboa and the Bridge of the America that spanned over it connecting North and South America. This was their last lock, and the Pacific awaited. It was an incredible sight.

The claxon sounded, and the eddies and the whirlpools began. Once at the bottom of the chamber, the massive doors opened, and the salt and freshwater began to mix. It boiled almost looking like rapids. Thomas gave the command to break away, and he took Lone Eagle immediately to full throttle. He was glad he did as even at full throttle he was barely making any headway. Thankfully it all subsided after they exited the chamber.

Ahead was the Bridge of the Americas – the gateway to the Pacific that could be seen off in the distance. They had just completed their transit of the Panama Canal. He embraced Gillian and looked up at the sky. Up in the clouds, he swore he could see his father’s face with the biggest smile and the brightest eyes. He blinked, and it was gone. He didn’t know whether it was his imagination running wild due to the excitement, but he thought otherwise - the image had been imprinted in his mind. It had been a flawless transit – his dad would have been proud.

They motored over to the Balboa Yacht Club and dropped off Thomas, Lionel, and the line handlers. He thanked all of them. They were such an incredible bunch of guys that made the day very special for him and Gillian. They took their 100’coils of lines and all of the tires with them. It was good to get all of that weight off Lone Eagle. They then headed out to pick up a mooring.

That night they celebrated and were still buzzing well into the night. They had done it. Gillian was elated that it had gone so smoothly, although she did admit there were times where she was terrified. He said he was too. The sundowners – several of them didn’t take the edge off the buzz. Neither of them wanted the day to end.

They lit the anchor light, had dinner, and watched as the port of Balboa lit up. They were in the Pacific. You could look down the harbor right out into the Gulf of Panama and see the lights of ships coming into transit the canal and those heading out into the deep blue. It was all so surreal to them both, and it bought with it the first twinges of trepidation that they would soon be heading out into the vast Pacific Ocean. Overnight runs would be replaced by multi-day passages. They were ready, he thought, but he also knew that they had to be prepared for whatever the Pacific threw at them. They would be completely alone out there. They had to be ready - for anything.





CHAPTER LII February 28, 2003 - Balboa and beyond



Balboa, Panama

Lat: 08° 56’ 17.35” N, Long: 079° 33’ 25.74” W

They both got very little sleep that first night and were exhausted the next morning. They were still coming down off yesterday’s high. It was going to be a lazy day. They needed to re-group as they knew that they had a lot to do to get themselves and Lone Eagle ready for the run to Galapagos.

“Baby, we are going to need fuel up before we head out of here, and by the looks of it, I’d rather not run the watermaker here in the harbor. If we are going to go in for fuel, we might as well tie up to a dock. If we do that, we won’t need to break out Big Dink. Keeping Big Dink nicely packed and being able to carry our provisions down the dock would also be a big help.”

“When do you want to head in?”

“I’ll radio the dockmaster and see if he has any available space. If he does, tomorrow would be soon enough for me. I am not short of things to do.”

“Me too. I’ve got to make our final provisions list and clean up from yesterday. I read in the guide that Balboa has a duty-free zone not far from here, and it says you can get literally everything right there.”

“That would be great. We can get a cab from the marina. We’ll head in tomorrow, fuel up, then tie up and head to the duty-free zone. I figure we can be on our way out of here in 2-3 days. Let's start printing out the weather faxes and see if we start seeing a discernible pattern, although it won’t matter much when we are on our way. We get what we get.”

As he sat in the cockpit, finishing his coffee, he thought about the weather fax. Up until this point, it had been used to determine whether to go or not to go. Now it’s going to be used to tell them what was coming. There was that trepidation feeling again. He repressed it by thinking of something else.

“Hey baby, could you turn on the breaker for the Furuno and hand me up that blue bag in the nav station drawer.”

Moments later, Gillian handed up the little bag. It contained all of the C-Map NT electronic charts that he bought in the Keys. They were now in the Pacific, and it was time to swap out the western Caribbean chip for the eastern Pacific chip. He opened Furuno’s little watertight compartment and ejected the Caribbean chip. He hadn’t done it before and he hoped that Furuno’s little brain wouldn’t have a stroke over the new Pacific chip. He held his breath and turned it on. It took a couple of seconds to initialize and acquire the satellites, but the chart came up, and there they were, plotted right on the Balboa chart. All systems go.

He went below and headed for the forepeak. There was a lot of gear stowed up there, but before long, he found the rolled bundle of charts from the Bellingham Chart Printers that he was looking for. He rolled up and stowed the Caribbean bundle and retrieved the Pacific bundle. As he was climbing out of the forepeak, he heard Gillian.

“Rob, can you please come and have a look at the stereo. I think it just died. I can’t get it to play any CDs, and it’s making a funny noise when I hit the play button.”

Gus was an audiophile and had installed a great 12-volt car stereo that played both cassettes and CDs and had four top-of-the-line speakers mounted in the cabin. While he was in the Keys, he spliced in two more waterproof speakers in the cockpit that he had picked up in West Marine. Splicing-in the speakers was quite a contorted job under the nav station. He wasn’t looking forward to having to replace the unit.

Sure enough. It was dead. “Gillian, I hope that duty-free zone does sell everything, including car stereos, as I really don’t want to head off into the Pacific without any music.”

“Well, Cap, they aren’t making any more which play both cassette and CDs, so there goes half of our music selection. I’m really glad I burned all of those CDs that we got from all those different boats in the Caribbean.”

He spread out the Pacific chart bundle on the nav station. They were the 1/3 size charts that were delivered while he was in the Keys. When they arrived, he barely had enough time to confirm that he had received all of the zones that he had ordered. He liked the 1/3 size because they fit perfectly on the nav station, and each one could easily be removed from the plastic binders that kept all of the charts for each zone together. He found the eastern Pacific zone and pulled out the Panama to Galapagos chart. A bit of light reading for later, he thought.

He was enjoying a leisurely afternoon even though his back still wasn’t 100%, so a bit of time lying flat on the cockpit cushions was heaven. Gillian finished her provisions list, and they traded places at the PC so that he could write the friends and family Log of Lone Eagle email to let everyone know that they had made it through the canal. He enjoyed every minute of writing it. When he finished it, Gillian read it and then loaded in all the addressees that were following their progress.

Gillian re-programmed the weather fax to receive from Point Reyes, California, and Honolulu. The reception was terrible in Balboa. They hoped it would get better once they were at sea, but they were able to tune in the 0900 Pacific Net on the HF radio, and they gave excellent weather forecasts. There were also several cruisers out ahead of them and they reported their positions and conditions every morning, which was going to be a big help.

The next morning, they headed into the fuel dock and topped up with 96 gallons of diesel and filled the water tank and sun shower. They then moved the boat into a berth and grabbed Gillian’s provisioning list and a cab to the duty-free zone. When they arrived, they saw that there were three massive buildings, each at least 4-5 city blocks long. The place did have everything, including a place that sold car stereos. They were in luck and purchased a top-of-the-line five-CD stacker for one hundred dollars US, which they knew was essential for those long night watches that they would soon be standing.

Gillian had gotten everything on her list, and they were each loaded down with string bags of all sorts of things that Gillian insisted they needed. They were exhausted and started to make their way back to pick up a cab when he spotted the duty-free liquor store. They went in and were blown away at the assortment and the prices. An imperial gallon of Absolut vodka was just seven US dollars per bottle. What was even better was that those bottles were plastic and could be stowed easily, and they even had plastic pouring spouts. They reviewed their budget, considered the weight, and bought six cases plus several liquors that Gillian picked out. They were lucky. The guy at the checkout called them a cab that pulled right up to the front door and loaded everything for them.

The challenge was to get everything from the marina parking lot to the boat. Luckily the marina had a dock trolley, and after several trips, it was all stacked on the dock, and Gillian began her strip out drill, removing all the packaging from everything. Some things were put into Ziplocs, and everything was marked. She was a machine when it came to this kind of stuff. His job was to get all of it below, and her’s was to find places to stow it. He had no idea how she did it, but she managed to stow everything out of sight just like she did in the Keys. He knew that all he had to do was stay out of her way.

The next morning, he changed the engine oil and fuel filters. The next oil change would be in 150 hours. He hoped that he wouldn’t have to do it mid-ocean, but the odds were that he would, so he put all of the gear necessary to do it within reach on top of the compartment that held his spare parts collection. He also tested the watermaker. Both feedwater pumps were working fine, so a filter change was all that was needed. He put two new filters in and stowed the dirty ones. Once they were underway, he would tow the dirty ones behind the boat, and the ocean would clean them so that they were almost brand new. It was just a little trick; one of the cruisers had shared with him.

The next challenge was the stereo. Gus was great as he made sure that all the wires were color-coded and labeled. The bad part was that the stereo was mounted above the nav station, and all of its wires went down behind the nav station and under it, which just happened to be the place where he stowed all of his tools. It took four back-breaking hours to get the new stereo installed with most of it spent under the nav station. It took another hour to put the nav station back together and to stow all of the tools that were piled on the cabin sole. But they now had tunes, he kept telling himself as he tried to straighten up and his back kept screaming at him.

The next morning was March 4th and the eve of their planned departure. They wanted to clear the canal and be in the Pacific by March. They had done it. That morning he did all the nav and plotted all the waypoints to Galapagos on the paper charts and then programmed them into the chart plotter and into a back-up handheld GPS that they kept in the cockpit. Every waypoint was triple checked and recorded in the nav logbook.

Gillian had stocked up on fresh fruit and produce along with several loaves of bread. She spent the entire morning organizing the fridge, which was a good size, but the freezer was tiny – about the size of a shoebox. There was a limit to the amount of frozen meat that it would hold and packing it to have stuff that really needed to be cold up against the freezer plate and stuff that could make it with less cold further away was an engineering feat that Gillian had mastered.

He didn’t sleep well that night, but he never did the night before a passage. His mind just didn’t shut down, although Gillian slept like a log.





CHAPTER LIII March 5, 2003 - The Equator run



Balboa, Panama

Lat: 08° 56’ 17.35” N, Long: 079° 33’ 25.74” W

They were underway at first light and took up a southerly heading that would take them through the Gulf of Panama and well offshore of Punta Mala (Point Bad), which was 80nm ahead. The Gulf of Panama was a shelf that began to drop-off into the depths of the Pacific at 120nm south of Balboa. The drop went from 80 meters to 4,400 meters of water.

The wind was out of the north and light, so they were motor sailing. They had the main and Genny out, but even with the spinnaker pole, the Genny struggled to fill. He decided to put up the spinnaker (kite). It was the original kite from Gus’s time on the boat, and they had never flown it before, so he knew that this morning was going to be an experiment. Before he left Washington, he had put a separate block fixed to the top of the mast that would ensure that the kite’s halyard was free of all other halyards. The kite was set up to be a drifter, meaning it didn’t need (but could be) poled out. It also had a snuffer, essentially a sock arrangement that could be pulled up to open it and down to close it. The snuffer lines all had to be outside of all the rigging.

He arranged the sheet lines for the kite and led them back through blocks to the winches in the cockpit. The hoist of the kite to the top of the mast and the snuffer unfurling went perfectly, and the spinnaker opened and filled. With only 5 knots of wind, Lone Eagle was running in the 4s and, at times, over 5 knots. He had the pole set and ready to go. He knew if the wind increased, he would want it poled-out to have more control over it.

It was a great sail; the sky was clear, and the wind increasing to 10 knots, which kept Lone Eagle running in the 5s and at times, nudged 6 knots. It was a comfortable ride, and they were on track to pass Punta Mala just before sunset, but he wanted the kite connected to the spinnaker pole, so he went forward, and connected the kite’s sheet line to the pole, and then hoisted, and locked the pole in place which eliminated the side-to-side drifting of the kite which, at 10 knots, was starting to become a problem.

At 1600 the wind had increased to 15 knots and started to gust higher - it was time for kite flying to be over. With Gillian in the cockpit with the kite’s sheets in hand, he went forward. He untied the halyard and held it firmly as he positioned himself in the pulpit forward of the Genny with the snuffer control lines in his other hand. It was awkward, the wind was building, and Lone Eagle started a yawing, side-to-side motion. He yelled to Gillian to adjust her course so that the main would blanket the kite. It took a few seconds, but it worked. Gillian released the windward kite sheet while he pulled the snuffer down. There was still a lot of wind in the kite that made pulling the snuffer down tricky. He yelled to Gillian, and she released more of both sheet lines, and he was able to pull the snuffer all the way down. Lone Eagle settled, and the yawing stopped. He lowered the kite taking in arm-fulls of it, bit-by-bit until it was in a heap at his feet in the pulpit. He opened the forward hatch and stuffed all of it down below.

His next high-wire act was to pole out the Genny to replace the kite. It was a lot easier as he simply had to put the Genny’s windward sheet into the beak at the end of the pole. It just took a few minutes to lower the pole, insert the sheet, and re-raise and lock in the pole. Once complete, he headed back to the cockpit. Speed was 5.5 knots, and they were 10nm from the edge of the shelf.

It was now 1700, and the sun was setting. They had another hour of light. They regrouped in the cockpit and reviewed their kite performance. The whole process went well, but Gillian though it was a bit hair raising at the end. He told her that flying kites could be like holding a tiger by the tail. You just had to have the good sense to know early enough when to take them down. As he looked out across the water, he could see the wind was now at 20 knots, and they were making 6.5 knots with a reef in the main and the Genny at 40 percent. Monitor and Lone Eagle were happy, but it wouldn’t last long.

By 1800 they were 5nm from the edge of the shelf and had only seen a couple of ships on the radar during the day. As he looked aft in the last of the light, he could see that the seas were becoming short and steep with white caps forming on top of them. Within minutes those white caps became breaking seas with walls of white water cascading down the front of them. The waves behind which had been 4-5’ doubled in size to 10’ and were breaking all around them. Thankfully, they were dead on the stern, and Lone Eagle was splitting them and throwing out great sheets of water to both sides as the white water impacted her stern.

Speed was now in the upper 8s and hitting 9.5 knots as Lone Eagle began to surf down the wave faces. The ride was a roller coaster, and he could see that Gillian was looking pale. They were sitting next to each other, and he knew she was going to be seasick. It wasn’t long before she was on the cockpit floor retching into the cockpit drains. He held her with one hand and kept looking behind them for any lurking green ones that might poop them.

By 1900 it was all over. They had crossed the edge of the shelf and were now in thousands of meters of water. They had been on the shelf as the tide was rapidly running off it and into the Pacific. The speed of the tide, when added to the speed of the wind, made for a waterfall effect, and they had been right in the middle of it. It was a terrifying experience, and Point Bad certainly lived up to its reputation. He couldn’t believe that there was no mention of it, let alone a warning in the cruising guide. They were lucky. Had the tide been rushing into the Gulf with the wind opposing, the seas would have been just as steep, and they would have been in it for hours. He shuddered at the thought.

Now clear of Point Bad, he set Lone Eagle on a southwest heading for Galapagos, which was 840nm ahead. The wind had dropped back to 15, and with the deeper water, the seas were 6-8’ with a decent interval that made the ride almost comfortable. Gillian had recovered from her bout of mal de mare, although dinner consisted of crackers for her and a sandwich for him.

Gillian insisted on taking the first watch. The tricolor was lit, she had her five CDs in the stacker, and he crawled into the bunk cushions that had been placed on the cabin sole. As he laid there, he knew sleep would be elusive as he tried to force any replay of the day’s events out of his mind and replace them with pleasant thoughts of what lay ahead.

The equator, the horse latitudes where they threw the horses over the side to lighten the load, the doldrums, and the scientific name for it – the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ICZ) were all the names for the zone that was 5° either side of the equator. Having passed Point Bad, they were now 120nm from reaching 5° north, which was where he expected the wind to start dropping.

The ICZ was the point at which the air masses of the northern hemisphere met the air masses of the southern hemisphere. Flatwater, no wind, heat, and humidity and throw in the odd thunderstorm were the expected conditions. He knew they would be motoring for days.

Their second and third days out were excellent sails. The wind held at 15 knots and they averaged 110nm per day. Not bad. The events of the first day were a distant memory. They made water every morning, and the cockpit showers were wonderful. Oddly, there wasn’t any shipping traffic. The morning net let them know that there were two boats ahead of them bound for the Marquesas and three boats behind them heading in the same direction, and none of them were heading for Galapagos. All had mentioned the expected high fees as their reason for giving it a miss.

By the morning of the fourth day, they had just passed below 5° north and had entered the ICZ. They were 540nm east northeast of Galapagos. As if, on command, the wind out of the north slowly began to drop. It was now just 5 knots. The main was fully up, and the Genny was poled fully out. The engine was at 2,000 revs, and they were still making 5 knots. He was okay with that kind of progress, but he knew it wouldn’t last.

As the day wore on, the wind continued to drop. There was still just enough apparent wind for Monitor to hold their rhumb line course. He hoped it would last. The last thing he wanted to do was pull out that pesky Raymarine auto-tiller pilot or worse, hand steer. Neither were palatable options. Just then, his fishing rod sprang to life. It wasn’t a big mahi-mahi, but it would certainly make for a great dinner.

While he was up on the foredeck fileting dinner, he looked out to the horizon. The surface of the ocean was completely flat and was beginning to take on a mirror-like appearance, much like the surface of a mountain lake on a windless morning. The sun was beating down, and without any wind, the temperature was rising both above and below deck. The weatherboards were out, and the forward hatch was open to catch whatever breeze there was. On a passage, the weatherboards were always in, and the forward hatch locked down, but out here, they had to have ventilation. With the motor running, there was no issue with power, so all the fans in the cabin were running.

Even with the fans, it was getting warmer below. They had been running the motor for four days, and the residual heat was increasing. He propped up the hatch to the engine room with a small block of wood and did the same for the two cockpit locker hatches to vent some of the hot air building up in the engine compartment. It seemed to work, but below deck remained uncomfortable.

Back on deck, he headed forward for a better look around. He stood with this back to the front of the mast and looked ahead. He was standing on the cabin top, which was the highest point on deck. As he looked around Lone Eagle, the ocean had now turned into a perfect mirror. As he looked to the horizon, he could see the curvature of the earth. He could see the horizon falling away all around them. It felt like he was standing on top of a bowl, looking at the edges below him. He thought his eyes were playing tricks and called Gillian to come and have a look. She saw it too. They stood in awe at what they were seeing.

Below he checked the engine oil and added a bit. A glance at the engine hour meter showed that they had been motoring for 125 hours, which meant that tomorrow he would be doing that oil change that he wasn’t looking forward to. They had put in 40 gallons of fuel the day before, but the fuel gauge told him that he needed to add refueling to his tomorrow to-do list.

As the sun set, the cockpit showers and the only-one-allowed sundowners were a welcome relief. He lit the Force 10 barbeque and grilled two perfect mahi-mahi filets. Gillian was relieved that she didn’t have to light the stove below. They watched the sun burn its way into the ocean. The radar on a 40-mile sweep showed a few scattered thunderstorms, but none was near enough to worry about except that his 50’ mast was the highest point for miles and would make a very attractive lightning rod if one happened to get close.

As night fell, the stars appeared and got brighter and brighter as the darkness deepened. It was quite a sight with the Milky Way stretching in an extraordinary band overhead with the Southern Cross and the Big Dipper making their appearances. The stars stretched from horizon to horizon. He went on deck and did his final chaff inspection of the sheet lines. As he stood on the cabin top, it was if he were experiencing vertigo. He lost sight of the horizon. Because the surface of the sea was a perfect mirror, the stars appeared to be both above him and below him, with the ones on the sea surface merely a reflection of those above. Not only was horizon lost, but so was his depth perception. The bright stars on the water looked like you could reach out and touch them. It was surreal. Gillian couldn’t believe it; she too felt the vertigo effect. With stars above and below, it felt like you were piloting a spaceship through the inky blackness.

Their vision had been forward, above, and out to the horizon. Neither had looked astern until they started to make their way back to the cockpit. Gillian saw it first – the green fluorescence in the water that was stirred up by their prop wash. It was a lime green iridescent trail behind Lone Eagle that stretched hundreds of feet behind them. It glowed so brightly that they were mesmerized.

Gillian took the first watch, and he went below to get some much-needed sleep. There was no sense of motion in Lone Eagle; the only sound was the dull throb of the engine, and he was asleep in minutes.

“Wakey, Wakey Rob. It's your watch.”

“Coming baby.” He had been sleeping so deeply he felt very disoriented but managed to pull on his vest and head up into the cockpit.

“Anything on the radar?” he asked.

“Nothing at all. I’ve just been watching our green trail. I’ve seen some green streaks in the water, but I don’t know what they are. I’ve also heard a couple of thuds up on the deck, but I couldn’t see anything with the flashlight. I’m going to get some sleep. I can’t keep my eyes open.”

A Diet Coke and a Mars bar soon appeared, and she was gone. He checked their progress. 4.5 knots and right on the rhumb line. He was thankful Monitor was still getting enough wind to steer. It was 2400, and he settled in for what he hoped would be a quiet night. The stern pulpit watch seat was perfect for viewing the stars above and below him. The green iridescence was a constant fascination. The first few hours, he took it all in with images that he knew would be etched in his mind forever. The glow of the cockpit instrument lights added to the surreal effect – it really felt like they were in a spaceship. Everything aboard Lone Eagle was operating perfectly, and the glow of her instrument lights was comforting.

It was 0330. He was ready for a bit of sleep himself and manage to stay awake until 0440 when he woke Gillian. He traded places with her and was asleep before his head hit the pillow. He awoke at 0630 as the sun streamed in through the now east-facing companionway. It had been a good sleep, but he knew projects awaited him.

As he poked his head up into the cockpit, Gillian said, “Do you remember me telling you about those thud sounds I was hearing? Go up on deck and have a look.”

He did. They were flying fish that had crash-landed. They flew into the cabin top and landed on the deck. There were a dozen of them and also a few small squids that in the morning sun looked like they were welded to the deck. After he tossed them over the side, he thought better of it – they would have made great bait. Back in the cockpit, he reported the on-deck body count.

He was able to put in two jerry cans worth of fuel without any problem. Mid-ocean refueling wasn’t a problem when the ocean was flat. He knew it wouldn’t be when they hit the trade winds on the way to the Marquesas. The oil change was a different matter. He shut down the engine, and with almost no wind, Lone Eagle got a bit of a sway to her, much like a bobbing cork. He removed the stairs, and the engine compartment hatch, and was met with a wave of heat. The engine had now been running for 150 hours, and every part of it was hot to the touch, which made getting to the dipstick difficult. He had to wrap a towel around his arm to avoid getting burned. It took a while, and he was dripping with sweat by the time it was done. New oil and oil filter. Gillian started her up, and he inspected for leaks. All good, he closed her up and turned on the watermaker. A morning sun shower was in order.

Day 5 and Day 6 passed much the same as Day 4. They had a visit by an exhausted swallow that hung around for a bit of sleep in a coil of rope. Those streaks that Gillian saw turned out to be dolphins streaking after fish that had been attracted to the iridescent glow that Lone Eagle was giving off each night. They came back while he was on watch in the early hours of the morning of Day 7. The iridescent streaks they made were unbelievable and when they seemed to be done with their night fishing, they hung by the side of the boat and he could listen to their breathing for what seemed like hours.

By noon of Day 7, they were within 20nm of crossing the equator. Gillian organized their sacrifice to Neptune. A bit of caviar from a tiny jar and a bottle of Champagne was their toast and their sacrifice. They hoped Neptune would be pleased. As the sun was setting the equator crossing point neared, and as the chart plotter counted down to zero degrees latitude, he thought of how many times his father had crossed it. Dozens he thought. Probably the only time I’ll be doing it on a boat - up in the air in a plane sounds better.

He went below to the head as the final countdown began. He flushed it, and the water went down clockwise. Gillian announced zero degrees latitude, and he flushed it again. This time it went down counterclockwise. It was simply incredible that just a few feet on the surface of the earth would have that effect. The Coriolis Effect was at work.

He estimated at their current speed that they would arrive at the island of Santa Cruz sometime around noon the next day. They were now 130nm east of it. The run across the equator had been a life-changing moment. He knew that few people have ever experienced what they did as they piloted the starship Lone Eagle.





CHAPTER LIV March 14, 2003 - Galapagos



Bahia de la Academia, Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz, Galapagos

Lat: 00° 38’ 21.69” S, Long: 090° 20’ 31.88” W

The words “Rob, wake up. It’s your watch,” came drifting down to him. He was half-awake.

“OK, baby, I’m coming.”

Once in the cockpit, it took a while for his eyes to adjust, but he could see that Lone Eagle’s running lights were reflecting off something. It was sea fog. You could clearly see the stars above, but it felt like you were inside a cloud. It felt eerie.

“Anything on the radar?”

“Nothing at all. It’s been really quiet if you don’t count the thuds from the flying fish. I think they had a bad night.”

It was their practice that the one going off watch would stay with the one coming on watch for fifteen minutes to make sure that they were awake. It was just enough time to clear the cobwebs. For him, it was also enough time for the Diet Coke and the Mars Bar to kick in.

Once Gillian was below, he looked at the chart plotter. They were still making 5 knots and were now 45nm off the Galapagos archipelago. They should be in by mid-day. And, he thought, that he would soon start to see the outermost islands on the radar.

There were eighteen islands in the archipelago that straddle the equator. The one in the middle of the cluster just below the equator was Santa Cruz. It was their destination as it was the port of entry and the most populated. They would sail between San Cristobal and little Santa Fe island to arrive in Bahia de la Academia or Academic Bay in the town of Porto Ayora.

It wasn’t long before San Cristobal showed up on radar. All of the Galapagos Islands were mountainous and showed up clearly owing to volcanic action that pushed some of their peaks above 2,000’. Nine of the islands were active volcanos that had erupted more than twenty times over the past forty years.

As the miles ticked by, Santa Cruz came into range. The radar had it at 30nm. His next waypoint was midway between San Cristobal and Santa Cruz just west of little Santa Fe Island. Depth wasn’t a problem as these were mainly volcanic mountains extending upward hundreds and in some cases thousands of feet up from the seafloor.

By 0600 the sun made its appearance through the sea fog, and San Cristobal could be seen through the mist low on the horizon. It was eerie and surreal. It gave off a sense of foreboding much like the images in movies. Its peak was enshrouded in clouds. There was barely a breeze, and the sails struggled to fill.

On the 40nm radar sweep, he could now see the little island of Santa Fe. Most of the islands were uninhabited by humans but according to the guide, they were teaming with wildlife with some types only found on certain islands. As the sea fog burned off, the islands slowly came into view. They were truly volcanic with little vegetation. Even though the islands straddled the ICZ, there was little in the way of annual rainfall, and what there was depended on which side of the island faced the prevailing southerly wind.

Before long, two steaming mugs of coffee appeared. “How are we doing Cap?”

“We’re about 15nm out from Academic Bay. I’m going to take in the canvas as it's not doing us much good just hanging there.”

On deck, the flying fish and squid body count were about average. This time he collected them and put them in a Ziplock bound for the fridge. Good bait was hard to come by and these waters were teaming with fish.

As Academic Bay became visible, he could see that there were about a dozen masts of cruising boats in the harbor and then double that number of tourist excursion boats with a couple of them in the 70’ range. There was plenty of room to anchor, and they chose a spot not far from what appeared to be the dinghy dock.

With the pick down and the sails furled, they did their high five. They were in the Galapagos some 850nm west of Panama. It had taken them eight days and six hours.

As they settled in the cockpit to take in the scene, splashing sounds started all around the boat. Blue-footed Boobies were divebombing all around them, coming within just a few feet of the cockpit. The birds were knifing into the water. You could look at them after impact swimming all around underneath the boat apparently feeding on small fish that had come to feed on whatever was growing on Lone Eagle’s bottom.

The boobies were incredible divers that made pelicans look like lumbering amateurs. And their feet were blue. Not just any blue - Tiffany, baby blue. They watched in amazement as the show continued. Moments later, there was a dog-like barking sound. It was a sea lion that was circling Lone Eagle. It came right alongside and was barking at them as it explored what all the commotion was about that was caused by the aerial attack from the boobies. Within minutes, as the show continued, a marine iguana swam by, its tail slithering like a snake in the water. It was a riveting show. He wondered if all the arriving boats got this kind of reception. Gillian was captivated.

In amongst the continued aerial bombardment of the boobies they launched Big Dink and tied her off alongside as he got the ship’s paper ready to go shore. “I’ll call you on the VHF and let you know how I go with customs and the port captain. If they tell me we’ve got to leave, I’ll grab some bread and whatever fruit and veg I can find.”

‘Good luck, Cap. Put on your best happy smile. We might get lucky.”

He motored into what appeared to be a rickety old dock. There were three inflatables there and a small concrete boat ramp that was covered in marine iguanas all sunning themselves, along with a dozen or so boobies on the volcanic rocks alongside the ramp. They completely ignored his arrival. Once Big Dink was tied, he had to thread his way through them on his way to the road. They had no fear of humans, and he felt as if he could reach out and pet them, but thought better of that idea.

The port captain’s office was well marked near the center of what appeared to be the hub of the lively little town. He knocked on the port captain’s door and received a warm greeting. He smiled and told the port captain that he was thrilled to be in Ecuador on these beautiful islands. The happy smile appeared to be working.

He told the port captain about the toys and was assured that they could remain on board if they were under lock and key. The port captain then offered him a sixty-day cruising permit and didn’t say anything about the cost but simply rattled off a list of the islands that were out of bounds for cruising boats generally, and those where they could go if they hired a local guide. The port captain also mentioned that there was a movie being filmed on Pinta Island, and it too was off-limits. He added that the movie was Master and Commander starring Russel Crowe. He thanked the port captain and was pointed in the direction of the customs office.

As he walked over to the customs office next door, he wondered if this would be where he might have problems, although he was puzzled. He had just been given a sixty-day cruising permit, and it didn’t cost a cent. He couldn’t imagine that customs would tell him to leave. As he entered the customs office, he pasted a big smile on his face and was also warmly greeted by the customs officer.

The customs officer filled out a few forms, stamped their passports, and said, “that will be forty dollars. Welcome to Galapagos.” He couldn’t believe it. Forty dollars and a sixty-day cruising permit. The Panama rumor mill had been just that – a rumor mill. It was so sad that so many cruisers would give this magical place a miss based upon all that false information that was circulating among the boats waiting to go through the canal. Those cruisers were now ten days into a thirty-day passage to the Marquesas. Too bad, he thought but all the better for them as the harbor wouldn’t be overrun. He thanked the customs officer and headed back to Big Dink.

“Lone Eagle, Lone Eagle mobile, do you copy?”

“Lone Eagle mobile, Lone Eagle base. 72?”

“We’re in. 60-day cruising permit and it cost forty dollars.”

“You’re kidding?”

“Nope. The Panama rumor mill got it all wrong. You’re going to love it here. Heading back in a few minutes and will pick you up.”

“Roger. Base clear. Going back to 16.”

Back at the boat, he dropped off the ship’s papers, and Gillian organized the shopping trolley and their rucksacks while he went up on deck and lowered the quarantine flag and hoisted the Ecuadorian courtesy flag. They could now enjoy their time in Galapagos.

The antics of the dive-bombing boobies continued, and two more barking seals turned up as he retrieved the Ziplock with the night’s flying fish take and threw a couple to the seals. They were curious but didn’t bother with the stiff-as-a-board flying fish that slowly spiraled down in the crystal-clear waters. Even the boobies wouldn’t touch them.

While he was waiting for Gillian, he noticed a small panga approaching. A young man, probably about 16, slowly pulled alongside.

“Hi. My name is Fausto. Welcome to my Galapagos Islands.”

“Thank you, Fausto. It’s great to be in your beautiful islands. I’m Rob. And this is Gillian.”

Fausto knew everything. He was a delight and rattled-off the places for groceries and the best tiendas for food. He also said, looking at the on-deck jerry cans that he could get diesel and ice. He thanked Fausto for coming over and told him that they were going ashore and would be back later in the afternoon. Gillian asked him if he could do a diesel-run in the morning and he readily agreed.

They were out of bread, fresh fruit, and vegetables. Most ran out or had gone off within days of leaving Panama. The shelf life just wasn’t there for most of it, but Gillian, if anything, was amazingly creative at what she could make magically appear out of the galley.

They headed in on Big Dink with Gillian still in awe of how tame the animals were. At the dinghy dock, the marine iguanas were still sunning themselves on the boat ramp. They were prehistoric, and their swimming and diving skills ensured their survival. As they made their way into town, animal life was everywhere. The little village reminded him of Cay Caulker. It was a bit funky, had brightly painted buildings and an abundance of ecotourists. The number of sightseeing tour companies was overwhelming with all of the dive shops offering trips to the local reefs.

They found a tienda on the water near a little park overlooking the harbor. They could see Lone Eagle lying at anchor and picked a table under some palm trees. It was one of the places that Fausto had recommended. At less than half a degree south of the equator anywhere in Santa Cruz was going to be hot and sticky. The first round of rum punch went down smoothly and the fish burger was local snapper that had to have just been caught.

There were a couple of cruisers at the next table. They had come in two days earlier and were equally amazed at how the Panama rumor mill had gotten it so wrong. They said that the dozen or so boats that were in the harbor did conduct a net at 0900 and that a lot of useful information about the area was shared. The couple were, David and Tina on Tiana. They, too, were bound for the Marquesas, but they both were avid divers and planned to stay in Galapagos for their entire sixty-day cruising permit. David mentioned that Fausto had also come out to greet them and that he was so polite and helpful. He also said that there was a guy by the name of Jake on Iron Maiden that was a representative for Pactor modems and that he did software upgrades.

The Pactor modem on Lone Eagle was version two. David explained that by upgrading it to version three that they would be able to get GRIB files, which he knew would give them some excellent weather forecast information. It also wouldn’t hurt their transmit and receive speed either, which was in the frustratingly low, sometimes single-digit kilobits. David wrote down Jake’s email address for him to make contact and explained that Jake was at the island of Isabella and that they could stop there for the upgrade on their way out of Galapagos.

David also told them about a freshwater grotto for diving that was a twenty-minute walk from town. He invited them for a dive which they agreed would be the next morning after the Fausto fuel run. Gillian and Tina planned to meet up for coffee and a bit of shopping while he and David were diving.

The next morning Fausto arrived, and they loaded his panga with the seven empty jerry cans that had been emptied on the way from Panama. They had motored for almost 300 hours and burned all 35 gallons in the jerry cans and another 35 from the day tank. They still had another 35 gallons in the cabin sole tank but would need every drop for the Marquesas leg if the trade winds didn’t show up. He also knew that it was time for another oil change.

As they loaded the last of the jerry cans aboard Fausto's panga, Gillian handed him the Baja filter. Fausto asked what it was, and he explained that it was a special filter for diesel to make sure no impurities or water made it into their tank. Fausto assured him that the quality of the diesel they were going to get was okay and that he needn't worry.

They arrived at the fuel dock on the far side of the harbor. Fausto held the trigger nozzle, and he held the Baja filter, and one by one, they filled the seven jerry cans. When they were done, he took the Baja filter apart and showed Fausto each of the three fine-mesh filters. Fausto couldn’t believe the amount of dirt, water, and particles that the screens caught. He had run every drop of fuel in Lone Eagle’s tanks through the filter since leaving Washington. He was glad he did.

They made two fuel runs, and Lone Eagle’s tanks were now full. He paid for the fuel at the fuel dock, and back at the boat, he paid Fausto for all his help. Fausto was glad to receive US dollars and promised he would drop in to see if they needed anything else during their stay.

After lunch aboard, they headed ashore. Tina and David were waiting for them. The ladies went their way, and he and David began the trek with their snorkel gear to the grotto. It wasn’t long before they were out of town and walking down a rough but well-worn track through the scrub. He was glad he had worn his heavy sandals as his thongs would have been cut to ribbons on the sharp volcanic rocks. By the time they reached the grotto, they were both dripping with sweat. It had to be well into the nineties.

The grotto was basically a crack in the earth’s surface with a drop of some 30’ into the bluest freshwater he had ever seen. There was a rocky path down to a tiny ledge at water level. Once at the bottom, they put on their masks and fins and jumped into the crystal-clear water. The water felt cool and the underwater view was breath-taking. Dave explained that this was one of only a couple of places on the island with freshwater. It was a gathering point for so many creatures. The walls were covered in swallow nests, and beneath the water was a feast for the senses. Shafts of light penetrated the surface, and schools of tiny iridescent fish enveloped them. There were turtles above and below the surface. The rocks around the edge of the grotto were covered in sunbathing turtles, and they were all oblivious to their presence.

The cool water felt so good that neither of them was relishing the long, hot walk back to town. As they sat on the ledge, David told him that they had sailed from California and that the ride had, at times, been quite challenging with quite a few blows. David and Tina were divers and their dream was to dive some of the World War II sites near the Solomon Islands.

They made their way back to town and found the girls at the coffee shop. David said that they would be heading to Isabella in two days to get the software upgrade and do some more diving. He thought it might be their plan as well. He wanted to get that Pactor upgrade but would talk it over with Gillian about how long they were going to stay where they were.

On the way back to Big Dink, Gillian took him into some of the souvenir shops. They had some beautifully embroidered linen shirts and shorts with Galapagos logos. They bought several as they would be perfect additions to their I-got-the-T-shirt collection.

“Did you have a good time with Tina?”

“Yes, she was great. She said they have a great music collection and invited me over to burn some more music for us. I’ll do that while you’re are doing your oil change tomorrow. She also said that we have got to go and see the Darwin Research Center. She said the animals were incredible and that you could walk among them.”

“Let’s do that tomorrow afternoon. I read about it in the guide and want to meet Lonesome George the 100-year-old giant Galapagos tortoise. They say he is the last of the Pinta giant tortoises, and he has no one to mate with. He is the last of his species.”

“Do you think we should head over to Isabella with David and Tina? Tina said that David checked with the port captain and that he said they were welcome to visit Isabella. I think we should go with them and get the Pactor software upgraded before we head off to the Marquesas.”

“I agree. Let’s do it. I’ll do the oil change first thing in the morning. Then we can do a re-provisioning run and then hit the Darwin Center. We can leave the day after with David and Tina.”

The next morning, he ran the engine and made water. With the engine warm, he completed the oil change and looked at the Yanmar manual. It was also time to adjust the valves. He had never done that before but had learned about it during the diesel class he had taken back in Washington. He had bought a torque wrench and set it to the torque settings in the Yanmar manual. He followed the steps in the manual, and before long, he had done it. He fired up the engine and checked for leaks. Finding none, he closed the compartment.

The run to the Marquesas would be 25-30 days, and they would run out of everything fresh long before then. Stocking up was a mental calculation for Gillian. Take on only what you think you will use before it spoiled was the rule, but rules would only get you so far.

They finished their provision run at the store that Fausto recommended and carried bag loads of stuff back to the dinghy dock were Gillian applied her now finely-honed strip out skills. The provisions were expensive, but that was expected since everything had to be shipped in from thousands of miles away. Before long, they had everything loaded in Big Dink and headed back for Lone Eagle. Before he knew it, she had it all stowed and they were on their way back to shore.

The Darwin Research Center was a short walk from town. The center was home to more than 100 scientists whose mission was to preserve the unique ecosystems that made up the Galapagos Islands. The center was as Tina said it was, you could freely walk among the animals.

The star was undoubtedly Lonesome George. He walked into the tortoise enclosure, and there he was. There were two smaller female tortoises to keep him company but they were not the same species as George. He was the last of the Pinta Island giant tortoises that were believed to have actually floated over from Chile at some point. George was estimated to be about 100 years old and weighed in at over 150lbs.

Gillian took a picture of him sitting on a rock next to George. She said it looked like you guys were having a conversation. To him, it felt like it too. George didn’t say much, but his shell, his armored legs, long neck, and powerful beak-like jaws were quite a sight. He could see it had been a hard 100 years for George with numerous scrapes and scars visible on his shell and his legs. He couldn’t believe he was sitting right there looking at the last of a species that would soon become extinct. Galapagos had that effect on you. You knew you were at the cradle of the animal kingdom where life evolved over thousands of years. It made him think about how short their time was on this spinning rock.

On their way back, they detoured to the fuel dock with the cooler. He had spotted ice on the way back from the Darwin Center and knew that it was their last chance to top-off before Isabela. Ice in the cooler would usually last four days, and Gillian was able to use what little space there was in the freezer to make just enough ice for their sundowners. Their goal was to have ice all the way across the Pacific and Gillian took that responsibility very seriously.





CHAPTER LV March 19, 2003 – The Penguins



Isla Isabela, Galapagos

Lat: 00° 45’ 25.30” S, Long: 091° 08’ 70.80” W

The next morning they pulled the pick and motored out of Puerto Ayora bound for Isla Isabela in the company of David and Tina on Tiana. It was going to be a day sail. They were headed for the southern coast of Isabela for Los Tuneles, which was west of the main town of Puerto Villamil. Los Tuneles had a small anchorage surrounded by low-lying volcanic rock formations, many of which formed tunnels during volcanic activity. The guide said that the snorkeling there was fantastic.

Isla Isabela was the largest of all of the Galapagos and was reputed to be a million years old, having been formed by the merger of several volcanoes, many of which were still reported to be active.

They left at first light and took up a heading for Puerto Villamil. By early afternoon it was abeam of them, and by mid-afternoon, they had the pick down alongside Tiana in Los Tuneles. Jake on Iron Maiden was anchored close by and waived as they came in. They had traded emails the day before, and he would be doing the Pactor upgrade in the morning.

The water was crystal clear, and in setting the pick, he had to take care as there were several visible boulders on the bottom that weren't far from the surface. He and David donned their snorkel gear and went over the side to check their anchor sets. His was good but there was a large boulder that would be a problem if there was any swing, so he yelled to Gillian to take in ten feet of anchor chain so that they would miss it if Lone Eagle swung on its anchor.

The water was teaming with wildlife. There were lots of turtles and a few small reef sharks that were cruising the bottom. And then there were the penguins. Many were sitting on the nearby rocks, and you could swim up to them, and they would all jump in and be darting all around them. They had no fear of humans and came right up to his face mask to have a better look at the new neighbors. There was also a seal colony on a nearby rock outcrop, and their barking could be heard throughout the little harbor. The place was simply magic. They couldn’t get over the penguins.

Gillian wasn’t much of a snorkeler, but she was riveted to the action in the water. It wasn’t long before it was time for cockpit showers and sundowners. All around them were the squawks, squeaks, and barks of the animals. He wondered whether the noise would continue into the night. It was so surreal. Barren lava rock and teeming with wildlife of every description.

The next morning, Jake from Iron Maiden came by to do the Pactor modem software upgrade. Jake and his partner Janie were from California and had been cruising for a couple of years along the California coast before heading out for the deep blue. Their plan was for a circumnavigation, and they wanted to spend a year or more in the Med but didn’t like the idea of going through either Suez or around the Cape of Good Hope. They were toying with the idea of just doing Cape Town and then across the Atlantic to the Caribbean.

The software upgrade took just a few minutes and a test of Sail Mail showed that the speed had actually improved. Jake also showed them how to download the GRIB files, which were basically weather maps with wind arrows and front lines. The GRIB files, Buoy Weather and weather fax, would be the best forecasts they could get, but he knew that it really came down to pure guesswork. You got what you got when you were a thousand miles out.

“Hey guys, some of us cruisers are having a little beach barbeque tonight. Would you like to join us?”

“We would love it. I’ll whip something up to bring. What time does it start?”

“Sundowners at five.”

“Thanks, Jake. We look forward to it,” he replied.

Once Jake was on his way back to Iron Maiden, they both had a look at the GRIB files that he had just downloaded. When added to Buoy Weather, it did add another piece to the weather puzzle.

“Cap, now that we’ve gotten the software upgrade, when do you think we should leave?”

“It’s going to be a 25-30 day run, so half of March and April we’ll be at sea. That gives us seven months in the Pacific. I think one of those months will be spent in a shipyard somewhere as Lone Eagle will be in desperate need of a bottom job. That leaves us six months, and we have seven countries. I think we should keep pushing on. Let's do the barbeque tonight and break down Big Dink in the morning. If we are underway by noon, that is fine as when we head out of here, we’ll be in the open ocean.”

“Works for me. I was reading up on the Marquesas yesterday. It really looks like a lovely spot.”

“I’ve got all the waypoints plugged in. We just have three thousand miles of ocean ahead of us. You ready?”

“Let's do it, but right now, I’ve got to figure out what we’re bringing to tonight’s beach party. I am looking forward to meeting the other cruisers. There should be about ten of us as there are five boats here in the bay.”

They pulled Big Dink up alongside the other dinks on the little beach. It was black sand made from the black lava rock formations that encircled the beach. Somehow Jake had ventured inland into the scrub and come back with an armload of sticks to get the fire started. A few charcoal briquettes didn’t hurt either, and someone managed to bring a grate for the grill.

As with all cruiser get-togethers, the conversations ranged from boat maintenance problems to planned cruising routes. The couple on Jaldamar, Martha and Mike planned on doing the Pacific over two years and said they would leave their boat ‘buried’ in Fiji for the cyclone season and go back home to Seattle for Christmas. Mike said there was a shipyard in Vuda Point, Fiji, near Nandi, where they buried boats. Mike explained that the shipyard used a backhoe to dig deep pits in the sand and then lined them with tires. The travel lift would then lower the sailing yacht into the hole, and that would hopefully protect it in the event of a cyclone. He made a mental note that there was a shipyard there. It might be the one we use, he thought.

David from Tiana was skeptical of the idea of boat burying and thought that it might not work if the island were exposed to a big cyclone-generated tidal surge. It was his view that the tidal surge would lift the boats right out of the holes.

Tina, Gillian, and Martha were immersed in their own conversations. It was a pot-luck dinner, and everyone brought a protein to grill and a platter to share along with coolers for their favorite beverages. Martha had even brought marshmallows to roast on the grill. It reminded him of his camping days on Grass Island in the Great South Bay, all those many years ago. It also reminded him of Eileen Quinn’s song Piranha Pot Luck.

Back on Lone Eagle, they poured themselves a nightcap. Tomorrow they would be back to only one sundowner a day. It was peaceful until they heard some splashing in the water, they couldn’t make out what it was, but the green iridescence was back, and there were streaks all around the boat. It almost looked like Luke Skywalker was cutting up the water with his lightsaber. As one streak faded, another appeared. Isabela was magical.





CHAPTER LVI March 20, 2003 - The Marquesas run



Isla Isabela, Galapagos

Lat: 00° 45’ 25.30” S, Long: 091° 08’ 70.80” W

As the first rays of light flooded the cabin, he laid there with that feeling of trepidation having once again returned. It would be their longest passage. Three thousand nautical miles of open ocean to the Marquesas. For him, it came down to finding the trade winds. They were now little more than half a degree south of the equator – right in the middle of the Doldrums. He ran over the waypoints that he had plugged in and the Great Circle course that he had plotted. There was one waypoint for each 5° of longitude. The nagging question was, how far south would they have to go before the Trade Winds kicked in?

He pushed that feeling of trepidation down, almost like swallowing hard as he climbed up into the cockpit. It was clear and sunny, and there was a gentle south-easterly breeze that he hoped would build as the day wore on. The volcanic peak of Isabela was enshrouded in clouds, and he could hear Gillian below and the whistle of the kettle.

“Morning Cap. Big day. You ready?”

Well, wasn’t that the question du jour, he thought. “Morning Baby. I think it’s going to be a nice day for a sail.”

It wasn’t long before Isabela started to fade into the distance. The wind had increased to 10 knots, and he had the full main and Genny up. They were making just under 5 knots, and the swell was huge. He figured well over 20’ but what was astounding was the interval – the time between the crests. He looked at his watch and saw that it was almost 20 seconds. The swells were long and smooth, and Lone Eagle just glided over them. One minute you were down in the trough with water above and all around you, and then a few seconds later, you were on the top of the swell and you could see for miles. Even below in the cabin, you could walk around without holding on and had no sensation of the massive up and down distances that you were traveling every few seconds unless you looked out the porthole.

He was at the nav station and asked, “Hey, do you remember where we put that radiofrequency list?”

“It’s in the top drawer.”

“I’m going to see if I can tune in the BBC. We haven’t had any news in weeks.”

He found the station just as the UTC clock showed that they were coming up on the top of the hour. The headline report was America had just commenced its invasion of Iraq. They both heard it. He just stood there. It was so surreal. America was at war a half-a-world away, and they were in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. He imagined all his government contract law colleagues would be working around the clock on urgent procurements of everything under the sun to help with the war effort. Had he stayed, he knew he would have been right in the middle of it. He was relieved that he wasn’t.

By mid-day, the wind was a solid 15 knots, and he wondered if the trade winds had shifted northward. All the cruising books said that they often would. The only way to know would be if they held.

As they sat in the cockpit, the knot meter was now showing in the 6s. The ride was perfect, with Lone Eagle powering ahead. His mind drifted to his magical sailing memories when the conditions were ideal, and the boat was perfectly tuned. He knew this would be one of those moments. But that feeling of trepidation was still nagging at him – how long would this breeze last?

Gillian was nestled on the leeward side of the cockpit, and he was on the windward side, and Lone Eagle had a good heal to her. The starboard rail wasn’t awash, but it was close. They were talking about something when the head of a massive whale surfaced just behind Gillian. He had just enough time to yell, “Hang on” before the whale exhaled an enormous plume of air, water, and foul stench through his blowhole right into the cockpit. Gillian followed his eyes and froze at the sight. He held on and braced for what would assuredly be a horrendous impact with the whale’s back or its tail. It didn’t happen. It was a sperm whale and it just slid away beneath them missing them probably by inches.

They just looked at each other. They couldn’t believe how close they had come to what could have been a violent collision. He knew that the damage it could have caused to Lone Eagle would have been catastrophic.

“Cap, my God that was close. Do you think there are more of them around here?”

“Probably. They travel in pods,” he replied as he reached for the binoculars and did a sweep of the area.

“I don’t see anything, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t out there. Maybe that one was just curious and came up for a look. He certainly could have flicked us with its tail if it had wanted to.”

The wind held as the day wore on, but when there were moments where it briefly lightened, he could feel a swell from the south, impacting them and spilling off a bit of their wind. It was nothing like the big following sea from the east that they were enjoying. He hoped it would abate as it came every fifteen seconds and was starting to become a bit too jarring.

As night fell, they were making in the 5s, and that was good enough, he thought as Gillian took the first watch. As he lay on the cabin sole, he listened to the sound of the water rushing past Lone Eagle’s hull. It reminded him of those summer days on his Sunfish as the water gurgled by on his way home each afternoon on a run across the Great South Bay.

Coming on watch at midnight was a bit surreal. Their speed had dropped into the 3s, and the sea fog had returned - they hadn’t found the trade winds. This was still the Doldrums, he thought as he checked their position, which showed that they were 100nm west of Isabela. Not bad, he thought. We’ll make 120nm for Day 1 and that will put us right on our first waypoint.

Before Gillian went below, he headed up on deck to adjust the preventer vang on the main and adjusted the spinnaker pole for the Genny. Back in the cockpit, he saw they were in the upper 3s, so he started up the engine, and the motor sailing began. He had to find the trade winds. With 3,000nm ahead of them, he didn’t want fuel to become an issue.

Day 2 turned out to be in stark contrast to Day 1. That annoying swell from the south continued and intensified. It was jarring and would dump what little wind they had. And, what was worse was that it was hitting them every fifteen seconds. They were making in the 4s, but he knew that what they needed was more wind to dampen the effects of the swell.

By mid-afternoon, the conditions hadn’t changed, and he knew he had to do something. He took in the main and the Genny and set the kite in drifter mode. They were still making in the upper 4s, but the effects of that southerly swell had lessened. The kite stayed full, and there was no more dumping of wind since it was flying independently of the swaying motion of Lone Eagle.

As the sunset on Day 2, thoughts of what to do with the sails overnight concerned him. The kite was working, but the idea of leaving it up at night terrified him. Having to douse it in the middle of the night was certainly a scary proposition. The alternative was to re-set the main and the Genny, but here was barely enough wind for them to fill and he knew the wind-dumping southerly swell was still there and would really slow their progress.

“We’re going to keep the kite up tonight. I don’t want to, but it’s the only way we will be able to keep up any speed.”

“That’s a bit scary. What if we have to get it down in the middle of the night. Will you be able to do it?”

“I think so, but I’m not taking any chances. I am going to sleep here in the cockpit and will keep one eye open. If the wind shifts or increases, I’ll be able to get up on deck a lot faster.”

By the early morning of Day 3, they had made only 70nm, and they were still only 2° south of the equator. They needed to head further south. Their course was 259°, and he plotted a new one at 235°. They were effectively diving southward to hit the trade winds sacrificing westward progress in search of wind. He knew he didn’t have any other choice and headed up on deck to douse the kite and set the main and the Genny.

The new heading helped with that annoying swell. It was now impacting the boat well forward of the beam. The wind was still light, out of the south-east, and even with motor sailing, they were barely making 5 knots.

By 1800 the wind began to build, and they were now 3° 30” south. Within half an hour, it increased to 15 knots - they had found the trade winds. He knew that they could be upwards of 20 knots, so he put the first reef in the main and set the Genny at 70%. It wasn’t long before the winds were reaching 18-20 knots. Lone Eagle was rocketing along with the knot meter showing consistently in the 6s and 7s.

He altered course more westerly to intersect his next waypoint 300nm away. He adjusted Monitor for their new heading and watched the chart plotter and the compass for what seemed like hours. These were the south-east trades. There weren’t any wind shifts and likely wouldn't be for the next 3,000nm.

That night sleep came to him quickly. The ride was perfect, and Lone Eagle was powering along and was steady. His last thought before drifting off was that he wouldn’t be making any sail changes in the middle of the night.

When Gillian called him for his watch, he woke refreshed. Up on deck, the breeze felt wonderful in contrast with the heavy air in the ICZ. He checked the rhumb line on the chart plotter, and they were right on it and making in the upper 6s. It was going to be a pleasant watch.

At 0600 on Day 4, he plotted their position. They had made 70nm in 12 hours. That’s great, he thought. If we can keep up that pace, we’ll be doing better than 120nm per day. Lone Eagle, despite running in the 6s and 7s, was amazingly steady. Movement in the cockpit and below deck was actually quite comfortable.

At the start of Day 5, he came on watch at his usual time of 2400. The conditions hadn’t changed, and Lone Eagle continued to power ahead. He was looking forward to seeing how many miles they had done when he plotted their position in the morning.

He took the Maglite, focused its beam, and began looking at all the possible chaff points around the boat. He adjusted the sheets a few inches to change the wear points, and focused the beam on Monitor and traced the two crossing control lines that were connected to the tiller. He thought his eyes caught something on the port control line as it entered the leg between two guide plates. There it was again. A bit of fluff on the line. As he watched it, he could see that the line was chaffing badly. Instead of sliding its way along the smooth part of the guide plate, the sharp edge of the guide plate was rubbing the control line that was coming in and out of the leg of Monitor. He estimated that it had sawed through half of it.

He just watched it for a few minutes. The fraying of the line was getting worse. The guide plate was sawing right through it. So how would he fix it? It wasn’t going to be easy. The line disappeared into the leg of the Monitor over a pulley and reappeared at the bottom of the leg where it connected to the moving paddle. How are you going to thread it through the leg? And how are you going to do that back there outside the stern pulpit and the rudder one foot above the surface of the water zipping along at 6 knots with 15-20’ following seas?

As he sat there pondering their predicament, he was mindful of timing. If he let the chaffing continue, the control line could snap and send them off on a course that could put them with the seas beam on. The same could happen if the chaffed lined fouled around the guide plate, or worse around the internal pulley, which he knew would be catastrophic.

And then it came to him. They had several spare control lines. If he could sew the end of the old one to the end of the new one, he could go over the side and pull the new one through the leg. He didn’t have any other idea of how to do it. Somehow the new one had to be threaded through Monitor’s leg, and sewing the new one and the old one together seemed the only solution.

Now the question was timing. The line was now 70% chaffed through, and it was coming up on 0500 and starting to get light. He woke Gillian, who groggily tried to take in his description of the problem. They would have to disengage the paddle which meant she would need to be hand steering which meant she really had to have her wits about her as he would be hanging off the back of Monitor and wouldn’t be able to do anything if she veered off course.

He retrieved the new control line and his sail kit and stitched the two lines tightly together. As she sat there watching him finish the sewing, she asked, “How are you going to get down there to the paddle to pull it through? It’s right at the surface of the water.”

“I think if I can climb out there and put my legs through the Monitor’s lower supports, that I can reach the head of the paddle. It looks like the line just passes through a hole on the plate at the top of the paddle and there is a figure-eight knot tied to keep it from slipping out. Is that right?”

“Yes, but I am really scared about you going out there to do it. What if you fall overboard? I’m not going to be able to pick you up.”

“I’ve got my vest and my tether line that has two hook-in carabiners. I am going to hook both of them in. If I go in drink, the vest will inflate, and I’ll be towed a few feet behind the boat until you figure something out.”

“Me, figure something out!”

“Well, I figure I’ll probably have a lot of water in my mouth, so it's going to be up to you, baby. Are you ready? We have to do this now. If that line breaks, we’re going to have bigger problems.”

The lines were ready, and he had a knife to cut the sewn splice and a small pair of Vice Grips in his pocket to increase the bend on the guide plate. He disengaged Monitor from the tiller, and Gillian started to hand steer. He then released the paddle that was hinged to the bottom of Monitor and hoisted it up into its stored position. It took a few seconds, but Gillian found her rhythm and she was right on the compass heading. When he knew she would be alright, he hooked his long tether over and around the lower end of the stern pulpit and slowly climbed over it and stood on the top of the Monitor frame which was outside the rudder.

He slowly slipped his feet through the lower support of Monitor and slid himself down so that he was sitting on the support straddling the paddle. He clipped his short tether to the upper crosspiece of the Monitor. With the upper tether in place, he was able to reach the top of the paddle where the control lines were tied and found that he was able to use both hands. It wasn’t long before he was pulling the old line through and reached the point where the two lines were sewn together. At that point, he was then able to pull the new line through the hole in the top of the paddle thanks to them being sewn together. With the new line through the hole in the top of the paddle, he cut his stitching and tied a figure-eight knot at the end of the new line, and threw the old one into the cockpit. He had done it.

His legs and feet were numb, but he managed to get back to a standing position on Monitor and waited until the feelings returned. With one hand on the pulpit, he bent down and gently bent the guide plate to give it a bit more clearance. Back in the cockpit, he dropped the paddled, locked it in, and then reengaged the new control line to the tiller. It worked perfectly, and Monitor was steering once again.

As he sat there exhausted with his head in his hands, he looked down at the old control line lying on the floor of the cockpit. He picked it up and examined the fraying; it would have broken within 10 minutes. My God, that was close.

“Well done, Cap. That was brilliant. I’ve only ever seen it done at a dock with a guy in a dinghy.”

“Thanks for not telling me that while I was out there. Maybe you can send the guys at Monitor an email and tell them about doing it mid-ocean with my little sewing trick.”

“I will. I’m sure they’ll be amazed. I wouldn’t be surprised if they put it in their newsletter.”

“You did a magnificent job of steering. I couldn’t have done it without you. Great job baby. I’ll go below and get the kettle on. I need java – badly.”

It was 0600 of Day 5. They had made 160nm – a record. He couldn’t believe it and double-checked it to make sure. It was a record.

Each morning they listened to the Pacific net. There were boats ahead of them and boats behind them all doing the same Coconut Milk Run that they were on, and they were doing better than most. One boat’s autopilot had failed, and the husband and wife couple had been hand steering for two days and said they were exhausted, and were two days out of the Marquesas and would probably be able to hang on. Several cruisers offered suggestions that ranged from potential fixes for the autopilot to tying-off the wheel. Other cruisers had things that broke, including one whose spinnaker halyard broke, and the spinnaker had gone over the side and fouled their prop. The list of boats with problems was quite long, and he was relieved that everything aboard Lone Eagle was working.

With all the motor sailing they had done to reach the trade winds, they had burned almost all of the 35 gallons in the day tank. It was time to refuel, but this time it would be quite sporty as he had to do it in 20’ seas and 20 knots of wind. Thankfully, the fuel tank fill was on the windward side just forward of the cockpit, which reduced the chance of an on-deck splash in the fuel fill hole. He hooked in and inched his way forward along the jacklines and untied the first jerry can that was lashed to the board that spanned two stanchions. It was a slow, deliberate process. Once the jerry can was untied, he slid it along the deck, back to the fill hole, attached the nozzle, and placed it in the fill hole while always keeping an eye out for any water coming over the side. It took two hours and seven jerry cans to top-off the day tank. Two of the jerry cans had to be taken from the leeward side of the boat and had to be dragged around to the windward side where the fill hole was located. Those were the really tough ones to do and all of them had to be re-lashed to the boards and the stanchions when they were emptied.

Back in the cockpit, he was exhausted but relieved. All the weight of that on-deck fuel had been removed and was now in the day tank low and on the centerline. Lone Eagle would be less top-heavy. They now had 75 gallons of fuel left.

After the morning net, they would run the engine to top up the batteries and make water. A couple of cruisers on the net had reported that their watermakers had failed and that they were rationing water. Almost all of them said that they only had single feedwater pumps and didn’t have a secondary pump or a spare. He couldn’t imagine how they could undertake a crossing of the Pacific without even a spare.

Energy production continued to be a challenge. The amperage draw overnight was high with the running lights, chart plotter, and fridge consuming 15-20 amps per hour. The morning engine runs to top-off the batteries and make water helped, but the chart plotter and the fridge were still pulling 10-15 amps per hour during the day, and the wind generator and the solar panels were struggling to keep up. The solar panels were a big problem because, by noon, they were in the shade of the sail, and he knew that maintaining his present course wouldn’t improve the situation.

He knew that the only other way to generate power was to deploy the taffrail generator. He had bought the thing – the Aqua Air 100 in the Florida Keys, and it doubled as both a wind and a taffrail generator, and it didn’t do either well. It was essentially an alternator and in taffrail mode, it had an iron propeller and shaft connected to a long line towed behind the boat. The theory was that as the propeller turned, it would twist the tow rope that would turn the spindle of the alternator and make power. When it worked, you could get 4 amps per hour.

The taffrail generator was gimballed in a stainless-steel ring that was lashed between the rails of the stern pulpit. It took a while to deploy it, but it was putting out 4 amps.

All seemed well as they caught up on their reading. It was amazing how many books they were going through. The new CD player was in constant use, which also burned a few amps, so he was glad he had deployed the taffrail generator. The downside of using it was that he couldn’t risk also trail a fishing line. The potential tangle would be a mess. The good news was that the drag it created didn’t have any effect on Lone Eagle’s speed. She was still chugging along at over 6 knots.

It was sundowner time, and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s Southern Cross was playing with the lyrics about sailing to the Marquesas. Over the music, he heard a groaning sound and it got louder. He looked all around to determine its source. He glanced back at the stern pulpit and saw that it was bending and the taffrail generator was stretching at the lashings to the pulpit. It was at that moment he thought the stern pulpit was going to get ripped right off of the back of the boat. He reached for his knife to cut the taffrail generator free and just as he stood to do it, there was a loud pop, and the groaning and stretching sounds stopped. The tow line had snapped off at the alternator’s spindle. Something had grabbed the taffrail generator prop with such force that it broke the heavy plastic connector to the spindle. Thank God it did break off when it did; otherwise, they could have lost the stern pulpit.

He had two more spare props for it and a couple of old halyards, but he wasn’t going to risk having the pulpit ripped out if the prop fouled on something else. It was either a shark that grabbed it, or it caught on something else. He wouldn’t risk it again. If they needed power, they would just have to run the motor. If the wind held, that would only be a couple of hours a day, and he knew that they would have plenty of fuel to do that.

They were now a few days out from Hiva Oa and had been averaging 140nm per day. They had been at sea for twenty-two days, and life at sea had taken on a strange and beautiful rhythm. With that many sea days, he thought that he would feel like he couldn’t wait to get off the boat. That wasn’t the case. What he was really feeling was that he didn’t want it to end. The rhythm of daily life at sea aboard little Lone Eagle was simply magic.

It was now time to swap out the eastern Pacific CMap NT chip for the French Polynesia chip. They now had logged more than 8,000nm. He shut down the chart plotter and put the new one in. Its little brain was fine with the new chip and within moments, their position was displayed and with zoom out, he could see Nuka Hiva and Hiva Oa. His waypoints were for Nuka Hiva the capital of the Marquesas, but the guide said they could also clear in at Hiva Oa, which was south of Nuka Hiva and on a direct line to their next destination, the Tuomoto Islands. He opted for the more direct run and punched in the waypoints for Hiva Oa.

One morning they were treated to a dolphin show. About a hundred yards off, a dolphin leaped into the air and completed three perfect revolutions before crashing back into the water. Within seconds there was another and then another. Before long, there were twenty or more leaping out of the water, and all of them were doing their corkscrewing acrobatics. They were Spinner dolphins, and they certainly lived up to their name. There must have been 50 or more in the pod, and the show lasted almost five minutes; then they were gone.

The days were serene with all the time in the world to read, listen to music, and contemplate life. He was doing that when he heard the fishing reel scream to life. It had been a week since he had caught any fresh fish, so mahi-mahi was back on the menu tonight, although this one was putting up a spirited fight, and he had already lost several along the way. His luck was with him, and it wasn’t long before he had him aboard and was up on the foredeck with bucket and fillet knife. He was a big bull, and by the time the filleting was over, they had enough for 10 large portions, which completely packed the fridge.

Gillian had perfected her bread recipe, and mahi-mahi sandwiches on freshly baked bread were simply heaven. As the sun set, they were treated to an almost full moon, and he knew that by the time they reached Hiva Oa, it would be full.

Before first light, on the twenty-fifth day, he picked up Hiva Oa on the radar. By dawn, they were a beam of it, passing it on its southern side, on their approach to the anchorage at Atuona. They were only a few miles off the coast when he turned on the depth sounder that had been turned off since leaving Isabela. He thought something was wrong with it because it was just flashing. That was until he looked closely at the chart and saw that even at just a couple of miles off, they were still in 3,000’ of water.

The Marquesas were geologically the youngest of the islands in French Polynesia. They were volcanic peaks that rose thousands of feet from the sea floor with only the tops visible. The summit that they were looking at was 7,000’ from the seafloor. The anchorage at Atuona was the remnant of a crater on the side of that volcanic peak that was enshrouded in clouds. The wind had now dropped and they were motor sailing. He was curious why at cruising RPMs that they were making only in the mid 4s. They should have been in the mid 5s. There wasn’t any discernible current that would explain it.

Gillian tuned in the Atuona net just as they were coming up on the approach. She heard chatter that a boat called Just Ducky was heading out of the harbor and that it was bound for Australia. He looked through the binoculars and could see a mast moving, and it wasn’t long before the boat cleared the harbor. Seeing it come out sure made it easier for him to see how to get into the tiny harbor. He raised Just Ducky on the VHF to see if they could connect on tomorrow’s Pacific net as this was the first boat that they had encountered that was bound for Australia. The guy on Just Ducky answered his call but said he wasn’t interested in making contact. Oh well, he thought – rude people everywhere.

The guide said that Atuona was a small harbor and that anchoring would be tight, requiring both bow and stern anchors. The guide was right. As he made the turn in, he could see about a dozen boats. He throttled back and got the stern anchor ready to drop. He knew that the little Fortress Danforth was a good anchor and would hold them from swinging. They found a spot and dropped the bow anchor and then let out quite a bit of chain and then dropped the stern anchor. Both set perfectly. They were in. Twenty-five days, 3,000nm. They had done it.





CHAPTER LVII April 15, 2003 - Traitors Bay, Atuona



Hiva Oa, Marquesas

Lat: 09° 48’ 20.00” S, Long: 139° 01’ 86.10” W

They were both tired as they were coming down off the high of completing the passage, and were putting the last of the sailing gear away below when he heard a female voice call out from above, “Hello Lone Eagle.”

They both went on deck and saw that it was a young girl about twelve years old rowing alongside. “Welcome,” she said as she handed up a bag loaded with fresh fruit and veg along with a baguette and some brie.

“Thank you very much. What’s your name?” Gillian replied.

“I’m Megan, and I am on Luna right over there.”

Their eyes followed, and there was Luna. On deck were Megan’s parents waving.

“It’s sort of the custom here that when a new boat comes in the other boats pitch in and make up a bag of fresh stuff since no one coming in has any, and all they want is some fresh food and a bit of sleep.”

“Megan, that’s a very nice custom. We’re exhausted, but these lovely things will make us a nice dinner, and then we can get some sleep. Thank you!”

“You’re welcome, Gillian. It was good to meet you both, and I am sure I’ll see you again. Sleep well,” she said as she rowed back to Luna.

The bag was full of goodies, and Gillian pulled together a fresh salad, and they feasted on the salad, baguette, and the beautiful French brie. It wasn’t long before they set up the double bunk and fell into a deep sleep, even though it was only mid-afternoon. Sometime after dark, they both were awoken by a strange crunching sound. They had no idea what it was. It sounded like it was coming right through the hull of Lone Eagle.

It was loud, and it didn’t stop, so he climbed up on deck with the Maglite and shone the light over the side and along the waterline. He couldn’t believe his eyes. The crunching sound was being made by dozens of fish that were munching on what looked like a shag carpet that had grown on the sides of Lone Eagle. They were munching on the tops of gooseneck barnacles that had attached themselves to the hull. They had a suction cup-like base, a thin stem about an inch long, and a clam-shaped head, almost as big as a teaspoon. There were thousands of them, and it really looked like shag carpet. No wonder they were going so slow on the way in. He just groaned at the thought of getting rid of them. He had heard that they were really tough to get off and that their little suction cups were almost impossible to remove, short of using sandpaper. Tomorrow was soon enough, he thought as he crawled back into the bunk and explained what he had seen to Gillian.

They slept for 16 hours and woke at sunrise. The harbor was magnificent, and Traitor’s Bay was surrounded by lush green peaks that towered above them and were enshrouded in clouds. This was the site of the mutiny on HMS Bounty. It was also the final resting place of Paul Gauguin. As he was sipping his coffee, he could see several cruisers in their dinks scraping their hulls. He could also see a fuel dock, which would be a big help for getting small odds and ends.

They launched Big Dink and headed over to Luna, where they met Megan’s mom and dad, Linda and Chris. They thanked them for the goodie bag that Megan had brought over and gave them a Ziplock full of mahi-mahi filets. Linda and Chris had arrived two days earlier, and Chris told him that the only thing that worked on the barnacles was a putty knife and a scraper. They promised to catch up for sundowners in a day or so. Linda said that the fuel dock had fresh baguettes every morning – heaven.

The store at the fuel dock had all kinds of things, including plenty of baguettes and a large assortment of cheeses. They even had meat in the freezer. They had to clear in and were told by the fuel dock attendant that if they just stood out on the road, someone would be along to pick them up. The next passing pickup truck did, and the woman driving was Katrina. She had lived on Hiva Oa all her life and had a little farm that she insisted that they stop there on the way into town. The ride toward Atuona was through a winding lush green rain forest. Katrina’s farm was idyllic with a beautiful little house surrounded by gardens and fruit trees. Katrina set about filling bags with all kinds of fruit and vegetables. She even filled a bag with what she called Pamplemousse, which was between the size of a softball and a soccer ball. He couldn’t believe how big they were. Katrina told them that it was in the grapefruit family and cut one open. The juice buds in the segments of the Pamplemousse were the thickness of a pencil and just burst in your mouth with the taste of sweet grapefruit.

Gillian was thinking what he was thinking. How are we going to lug all these bags around town when Katrina piped up and said she had business in town and that if they met up at noon, she could give them a lift back to the fuel dock. They readily agreed and loaded the bags into her truck and headed off with her to the little town of Atuona.

Katrina pointed them toward the Port Captain’s office, which was near the center of town. It was a beautiful little town full of French influence in all the shops that fronted the main street.

They were greeted by the Port Captain in French. Thankfully, Gillian’s French was pretty good. Being in the Marquesas meant you were in the fifth administrative region of French Polynesia, and being in Polynesia meant that cruising boats had to post a one thousand two hundred dollar US bond per crew member that was refundable upon clearing out. The bond was intended to cover the cost of airfare to send ship-jumping wayward crew members back to their home country.

Thankfully, the bond was payable via credit card. The rest of the clear-in process went smoothly. Once again, he could keep the toys aboard if they were under lock and key. They received a 60-day cruising permit and were on their way.

The shops were a sailor’s delight with all manner of French cuisine. Gillian was in heaven and loaded up with cheeses, wine, and more baguettes. He was perusing the frozen meat fridge and spotted a leg of lamb. His mouth watered at the thought of a baked dinner. It was pricy, but they hadn’t had lamb since Christmas. With all of their shopping in hand, they headed over to Katrina’s truck. She had just arrived there herself.

Katrina dropped them off at the fuel dock, and they thanked her for her kindness. Back on Lone Eagle, they stowed all the groceries, and Gillian started the preparations for the baked lamb dinner. The thought of fresh meat after a month a sea had their taste buds watering. The smell that later came out of the oven was even better.

With Gillian busying herself below, he went up on deck, lowered the quarantine flag, and hoisted the French courtesy flag. On his way, he picked up a putty knife and a scraper to see how Chris’ advice would work on Lone Eagle.

He climbed down into Big Dink and slowly pulled himself around Lone Eagle. Her hull was a mess. Almost 30 days on the same tack meant that quite a bit of the hull above the waterline had been in the water for a long time, and the gooseneck barnacles loved it. They welded themselves to the gel coat. They were also below the waterline and were even able to adhere themselves to the ablative antifoul bottom paint. Most of them were now just stumps as their heads had been munched off by the fish. He gave the putty knife a try. It would slice off the stalk but the suction cup stumps remained and could only be removed by scraper. It was going to be a tough slog doing it from Big Dink with one arm holding onto Lone Eagle and the other scraping the hull. So much for the test.

It felt so civilized to be able to sleep in the double bunk and have a sit-down meal at the cabin table. For almost thirty days, every meal was served in the cockpit in a bowl that you held under your chin. The calm nights weren’t too bad, but the rough ones made it challenging. It was a joy to see how Gillian could sense and adapt to the conditions. Their first night in the harbor was no different. The baked lamb dinner, the French wine, and the fresh fruit and cheese were gourmet cuisine. The after-dinner sundowners allowed them to take in the magic of Traitor’s Bay. Tomorrow would be different – the gooseneck barnacles awaited.

They were up by 0600, and it was off to the fuel dock for fresh baguettes. They were still warm and another chunk of brie wasn’t a bad idea either. Back at the boat, it was a quick breakfast and then over the side in Big Dink. It was an exhausting process holding on with one and scraping with the other. When his arm was about to give out, he ran a line the length of the hull so that he could hang onto it instead of the long reach up to toe rail. It helped, but by lunchtime, he had only done the port side, and the starboard side was the worst. He had thought about getting in the water to do it but had heard on the net that some boats had sighted sharks in the bay. The water wasn’t very clear, and he decided that he wouldn’t chance it.

By 1700 the starboard side was done. He was exhausted, scratched, and sunburned. The cockpit shower and the sundowners were all he wanted. He never wanted to do that again, and based on what the cruisers ahead of them said on the net, he wouldn’t have to. Rumor had it that the little creatures only lived along the equator. They hadn’t been spotted by anyone on the run to the Tuamotus.

Each morning at the start of the Pacific net, there was one minute of quiet time. Everyone was to remain silent and to listen for any distress calls from any cruisers. There were a few mornings where someone would call in like the couple whose autopilot had failed, and they were exhausted from hand steering. This morning another call came through. The signal was very weak, but you could hear a guy calling Securite, Securite. His name was Mike on Tamara, and he was solo. He was two days out of Hiva Oa and had severely cut his hand on the blades of his wind generator. He said he had lost a lot of blood but had been able to stem the flow, but the hand, was useless and he was having difficulty handling the boat. He said he didn’t want anyone to call the French authorities to mount a rescue and just asked if the cruisers could set up a radio schedule to check in with him in case his situation worsened.

By the morning of the second day, you could hear the tiredness in Mike’s voice. He asked if anyone in the harbor could locate a hospital because he knew he would need some reconstruction on his badly mangled fingers. At his present speed, he would arrive at Traitor’s Bay sometime after dark. He keyed the mic and told Mike that they would standby VHF channel 16 starting at 1800 and that someone would come out in their inflatable and help him into the harbor.

He told Gillian he was going to go out to bring Mike in. They had finished dinner with one ear on the VHF when Mike called out to any boat in Traitor’s Bay. He was the first to answer, and Mike said he was just off the harbor but needed a hand getting his sails down and getting in and anchoring. He told Mike he was on his way and to standby channel 16. He attached the suction cup running lights to Big Dink and brought along the hand-held VHF which he knew Gillian would be monitoring.

As he cleared the harbor, the ocean was really lumpy. It took a minute or so before he spotted Mike’s mast light and was on his way to Tamara, an old 25’ sloop. He was able to tie-off alongside and climbed aboard and saw Mike sitting with his back against the cabin top surrounded in dried blood and bloody rags. He told Mike everything was going to be okay and set about firing up the engine, which thankfully started right away. Then he went on deck and took down the main and the hank-on Genny. He headed Tamara for the entrance to Traitor’s Bay. He had spoken to Mike on the way in, and he said he was ready to go to a hospital. He had eaten little since the accident and seemed dehydrated. He radioed Gillian on the handheld VHF. Everyone in the harbor was listening in and ready to help. There was even a nurse on one of the boats that said she would send a tender over once they got anchored and that she would examine him and, if necessary, take him ashore. The nurse said she had already contacted the fuel dock, and they were on standby to call an ambulance if it was needed.

He steered Tamara to a good spot and ran up on deck to release the anchor. Mike was well enough to back Tamara down to complete the set. Mike thanked him for his help, just as the other tender pulled alongside. Mike gave him his keys, and he assured him he would look after Tamara. The nurse climbed aboard and began to examine Mike. She gently unbandaged his hand and saw that three fingers were almost severed. To save them, the nurse said he had to get to a hospital and radioed the fuel dock to call the ambulance. They helped Mike into the tender and the nurse fired up the outboard and they headed for the fuel dock. He remained aboard Tamara and shut down the engine and turned off the running lights and the VHF radio. He went below. It, too, was a mess, with more dried blood and bloody rags. He checked the battery meter and saw that there was more than enough charge to turn on the anchor light. He closed up Tamara, checked that the anchor was holding, and headed back to Lone Eagle.

The next morning several of the cruiser women, including Gillian, got together on the morning net and decided they would go over to Tamara and give her a bit of a cleanup. They took their dinks over and brought some fresh fruit and vegetables. By late afternoon Mike was back from the hospital. He had lost three fingers. The doctor said it had been too long since the accident to save them, but Mike was in good spirits. Back on his boat, he radioed everyone in the bay to thank them for everything that they had done to help him.

“I’m going over to Tamara to give Mike his keys. Do you want to come?”

“I’ll bring him some of the bread I baked this morning. It turned out pretty good.”

They pulled alongside Tamara. “Hi, Rob and Gillian. Great to see you guys.”

“How’s the hand?” he asked.

“A bit sore, but it’ll be fine. I still have a couple of fingers to work with, and I’ll learn to manage. Rob, thanks for coming out to get me last night. There was no way I was going to be able to get her in myself.”

“You’re welcome. We were all worried about you when we heard your call on the net. What are your plans now that you are back on the boat?”

“The stitches come out in a week. I’ll hang out here until then. I really want to get to Tahiti, but will have to see how the hand is working once the stitches come out. What about you?”

“We’ll be heading out tomorrow for the Tuamotus. We’ll be going to Tahiti after that and might see you there.”

After saying farewell to Mike, they headed back to Lone Eagle. They had topped-off with provisions and fuel earlier in the day, and the only thing left was to break down and stow Big Dink. In the morning, they would head out for the 430nm run to the Tuamotus.

They had planned a first light start. It wasn’t to be. That little Fortress Danforth anchor had buried itself in the mud. It took him the better part of an hour to break it loose using the cockpit winches. His back wasn’t enjoying it, and when it did finally come up, it had the hardest, stickiest mud that took bucket after bucket of water to finally get it clean enough to stow.

The run-out took them past the island of Tahuata, the southernmost island in the Marquesas. It was almost two weeks since their arrival, and Atuona had been a stunning spot. The town and the people were great. When they weren't going into town, he was tinkering with typical cruising maintenance projects. Rebuilding the carburetor of the Yamaha, getting the fuel transfer pump working, it all took time.

Once passed Tahuata, they took up a heading of 232°. Their next waypoint was off the island of Manihi.





CHAPTER LVIII May 4, 2003 - Island of Pearls



Manihi, Tuamoutus Islands

Lat: 14° 27’ 81.40” S, Long: 146° 01’ 97.10” W

It was a four day run to the Tuamotus. The guide said that the Tuamotus were comprised of a chain of more than eighty islands that stretched across their path to Tahiti. The easternmost islands in the chain include Bikini Atoll, the place where the US conducted nuclear tests. The word Tuamoutus in Polynesian means the dangerous islands because they were low-set and hard to see when out at sea, especially at night. They were the oldest of the geologic formations in the Pacific and were virtually all that was left of volcanoes that were millions of years old. They were the rims of the craters of extinct volcanoes. Each of the tiny atolls around the rims were called Motus, and they formed a circle like a necklace around the ancient volcanic craters. Inside the necklace were immense lagoons, some of which were twenty miles across with water described as cobalt blue.

They arrived at their waypoint a mile off the entrance to Manihi at 0500. Even though they were just a mile off, the depth sounder was just flashing. The chart showed that they had a mile of water under the keel. The guide also said that getting through the pass of Passe de Tairapa was going to be sporty. It was the only navigable pass for Minihi, and you had to time your entrance with an incoming tide; otherwise, you could have 9 knots of outflow from the lagoon on the nose.

In this part of the world, there weren’t any tide tables, so you had to refer to the formulas in the cruising guide. In and outflows were determined by moonrise and moonset times. Each would have an associated period of inflow and outflow. It was 0530, and moonset, according to the almanac, was to occur at 0630 when the inflow should begin. He figured they would orbit until 0700. By then, the inflow should have started and they would get a gentle inward push. That was, assuming all of his calculations were right.

As 0700 approached, they continued to orbit. Manihi did show up on the radar as did a slow-moving target approaching from the west. It was still out of visual range, but he kept an eye on it, as coastal freighters plying these waters often could disrupt your approach into a tricky harbor entrance. It wasn’t long before he saw that the target was a sailboat that was heading their way. He turned on the VHF to see if there was any local traffic.

It wasn’t long before the VHF came to life with that sailboat calling the boat orbiting off Manihi, which was apparently him. He acknowledged the caller on Tonka. His name was Jim, and he requested that they wait for him so that he could follow them in, as all they had for navigation was the Lonely Planet Guide. He was dumbfounded. All they have is the Lonely Planet Guide? He replied, “sure,” and they both sat there shaking their heads. God does love drunks, fools, and sailors, especially when they are all the same person.

They did have a perfect incoming tide behind them and quickly transited the harbor entrance. To starboard, was the little town and the docks were piled high with oyster traps. On the port side was a secluded resort. The guide said it had an airstrip and that it was a favorite with those rich and famous that wanted a private and a secluded getaway.

The water through the pass was incredible. It felt like Lone Eagle was floating in the air. Over the side, the water was teeming with fish of every imaginable color and description. The depth sounder read 50,’ and he could see the bottom clearly. Within a couple of minutes, they were in the giant lagoon, and the water was, as the guide described, cobalt blue. It stretched for miles. The necklace of Motus almost disappearing below the horizon.

He went up in the ratlines to get a better look. The depth sounder was still showing 40-50’, but there were lots of coral heads (bommies) that rose to within 20’ of the surface, and with the tide, he knew he needed to find a spot that was free of them so that Lone Eagle could swing on her anchor without hitting one of them or fouling his anchor chain around one of them. He directed Gillian to a path around them and spied an anchoring spot not far offshore from one of the bigger Motus. The Motu had its own lagoon-side protective reef, but he spotted a break in it that opened to a little sandy beach. Out from it was a patch that was free of bommies that would be sheltered and would have plenty of swing room. It wasn’t long before they had the pick set. It had been a good run. It wasn’t hard for them to get back into their at-sea rhythm.

The Lonely Planet boat was anchored way off on the other side of the lagoon. There was an ancient-looking boat anchored about 200 yards off their port side. It looked like it had been there for 20 years. They were a short dinghy ride from town, and the resort and having cleared in at Hiva Oa, they were cleared in for all of Polynesia.

They launched Big Dink and caught early sun showers, had a bit of lunch, and headed below for some much-needed sleep. The at-sea rhythm was good, but you were still sleep-deprived and coming down off the excitement of a passage when you arrived made for being very tired. It was the perfect combination for a good sleep in a safe harbor.

They had set up the double bunk and were drifting off to sleep when from above, they heard, “Ahoy, Lone Eagle.” He climbed up on deck and thought he was dreaming. There was an old man in a wooden rowboat that looked like it was about to sink. The guy wasn’t wearing a shirt and was dark bronze. He had a long white beard, and his old canvas shorts were held up by a length of line. He looked like the guy Ernest Hemmingway’s Old Man and the Sea.

“Welcome to the harbor. We don’t get many boats through here, so it's nice to have some company. My name’s Hector, and I’m on Kestrel, that little boat right over there.”

“Good to meet you, Hector. This is a lovely spot. We just sailed in from Hiva Oa.”

“I’ll let you guys get some sleep. Sundowners at 5 on my boat?”

“Thank you. We would love to share sundowners with you. You can tell us all about this lovely place.”

“Sure can. See you at 5.”

Hector rowed back to his boat. He had to be mid-seventies, but he certainly looked fit. He wondered how long Hector had been in this anchorage? It seemed like he hadn’t moved his boat in years. Sundowners will be interesting, he thought as he climbed below and headed for the bunk. He set the alarm for 1600, and within minutes they were asleep.

By the time the alarm went off, they had gotten four hours of sleep. Gillian set about making up some cheese and crackers and asked, “Did Hector seem a bit strange to you? His boat looks like it’s about to sink, and he looks like Robinson Caruso.”

“He’s a solo sailor, and it has been my observation of the breed that the longer they are solo, the less they care about what they look like, and that includes their boats. I am sure he’s completely harmless.”

They motored Big Dink over to Kestrel and came alongside. Hector was busy below and told them to tie-off anywhere they could, and to watch their step when they came aboard. There was all manner of gear, lines, buckets, and fishing poles all over the deck and cabin top. You really did have to watch where you were walking. Hector had a big, but low hanging awning over the cockpit, but they managed to get under it and took a seat on some cockpit cushions that had seen better days.

Hector handed up three glasses that were half full and pronounced that they were rum, and that was all he had aboard. Hector joined them in the cockpit, and Gillian opened her cooler bag and started to assemble the snack she had brought with them.

Hector told them that he had been living aboard for twenty years – the last ten on Kestrel and that he had been in Manihi for two years. His eyes were still adjusting to the shade when he glanced down below. “Hector, is that a dentist’s chair you have down there?”

“It sure is. I do all the native’s teeth around here, and they pay me in these,” Hector replied as he reached behind him and retrieved a large Ziploc from a cockpit locker. It was brimming with black pearls – big ones. Their jaws dropped. Gillian was stunned. Hector handed her the bag, and she handled it like it was a baby chick and couldn’t take her eyes off it. They were stunning pearls.

Hector explained that the Taumotus were the black pearl capital of the world, and Manihi produced the most. Whenever he needed cash, he mailed off some pearls to his sister, and she would sell them to a local jeweler and deposit the money in his account. Hector pointed out all of the oyster pots on the dock and said that a ship came in every two weeks to transport thousands of pearls to Papeete.

They had a lovely afternoon with Hector. He regaled them with so many wonderful sea stories. He was old school and still sailed with a sextant and a sounding line. He didn’t even have a radio onboard. He spent his days fishing and working on the locals' teeth. He probably had the best dentist's job in the world.

The next morning they headed into the town dock that was piled high with oyster pots. Apparently, the name Manihi means the Island of Pearls. Hector had said there were several pearl farms in the Manihi lagoon, and it sure looked like it. There were hundreds of oyster pots lining the dock. They found the local bakery and stocked up on baguettes and then headed off to the resort just on the other side of the pass.

The resort was for the rich and famous, although they didn’t see any. There were quite a few over-the-water bungalows and a small harbor-side bar and dinghy dock. The staff were amicable and told them they were free to have a look around. It was lush and tropical with all kinds of facilities. The resort had three dive boats and did a busy trade ferrying the tourists out to the best dive spots in the lagoon. The airstrip came right up to the hotel and had regular service to Papeete.

They had a drink at the waterfront bar where you could sit right over the water and see hundreds of brightly colored fish. Across the lagoon, you could see the palm-covered Manihi Motus that seemed to melt into the horizon.

With the cooler full of ice, they headed back to Lone Eagle, unloaded, and then headed to the Motu just off Lone Eagle’s bow. The little pass he had spotted was just wide enough for Big Dink. The beach, with its bleached white sand, was the perfect landing spot. They headed across the Motu to the ocean side. The Motu was covered in coconut palms, all heavily ladened. They both remembered Tobacco Cay and were mindful of protecting their coconuts. The views were amazing, but there was little else on the Motu. Back at Big Dink, they waded in the clear waters along the edge of the beach. He found some exotic live cone-shaped snails the size of a baseball in the shallows. He didn’t have any bait aboard Lone Eagle and wanted to try his hand at some fishing, so he gathered up four of the large snails and brought them back to the boat. Gillian looked them up in her shell guide; they were Tiger Maureas. He lit the stove to boil them, remembering his days in the Bahamas, where they cooked Conk to make Conk fritters. It was a smelly affair but the Tigers did yield large chunks of rubbery meat that would be perfect for bait.

The first line he dropped over the side was hit before it even reached the bottom. The line snapped in seconds. A second rig suffered the same fate. There were fish down there, but when hooked, they would head into the rocks and the coral and would break him off in seconds. Having learned his lesson, he made up a new rig with a 100lb test 6’ trace. Well, that did the trick. The next try, and he was hooked-in in seconds. It was a nice size grouper or, as they call them in the Pacific, cod. It wasn’t long before he had landed three of them. On the next line drop, it was a different story. On the reel-in, he felt a massive tug and then nothing. He reeled up and found only the head of a grouper. The reef sharks had come to the party. He threw the head over the side, and a feeding frenzy of sharks started. The shark that caught it was promptly attacked by the others. There was blood in the water, and others came. It was a really terrifying sight. He knew he would be giving snorkeling a miss in this lagoon. Fishing too, he thought as he put the rod away. His fishing strategy had to change. Catch a couple of quick ones before the sharks arrived and then put the rod away.

He fileted the three that he had caught and fired up the barbeque. Fresh grouper filets on fresh baguettes were simply heaven. There was probably no better fish sandwich. It was a lazy afternoon, and they caught up on emails and sleep. That afternoon he did the nav for the run to Rangiroa. It was an overnight run of 100nm. Timing would be important. They needed a runout tide to get out of Manihi and a run-in for the pass at Rangiroa. The almanac provided the moonrise and moonset time, and he did the calculations. A 1500 departure and an 0900 arrival looked like it would work for them.

The next morning they made a final run in for more baguettes and then broke down Big Dink and got their sailing gear ready.





CHAPTER LVIX May 10, 2003 - Avatoru Harbor



Rangiroa, Tuamotu Islands

Lat: 14° 58’ 00.00” S, Long: 147° 38’ 00.00” W

They were reluctant to leave Manihi. There were hardly any boats in the lagoon, and they both had enjoyed the solitude. Onboard Lone Eagle, Gus had fashioned stainless steel wire drink holders that hung from the lifelines in the cockpit. They swung perfectly, always stayed level, never spilled a drop, and they never lost a plastic tumbler. His coffee was sitting in the one facing the Motu and the beautiful water in front of it, so he took a photo with the digital camera, and attached it to an email that he was writing to his lawyer friend Dave in Washington. The subject line said, ‘The view over the rim of my coffee cup.’ Yes, they would miss Manihi.

He caught three more grouper and had them filleted and ready to go. Fresh fish sandwiches on the barbeque while underway was a treat. All was in order, and they pulled the pick at 1430 and looped around Kestrel and said goodbye to Hector. Once clear, he followed the trackback path on the chart plotter. Gillian was on the foredeck and kept an eye out for bommies, but the trackback made it so much easier.

They approached the pass, and he cut the engine. He could feel the pull of the outgoing tide and throttled up for the run through the pass. He couldn’t get over the feeling that Lone Eagle was flying. It was like they were suspended in the air. He was at cruise speed and looked at the chart plotter and saw that their speed over ground was 9.5 knots. They were getting a good push.

The wind was out of the northeast. Once they made the turn at the waypoint off the pass, they took up a heading that would take them 20nm to the island of Ahe. Once clear of Ahe, they would take up a heading of 240° for the 80nm run to Rangiroa. He rolled out the Genny to 100% and engaged Monitor. They were right on their rhumb line, and they were making 5.8 knots.

They passed Ahe just after sunset. He grilled the grouper fillets on the barbeque, and they had their sundowners just as the light faded. There was a new moon coming up. He always preferred making a night passage with a bit of moonlight. The worst were the inky dark overcast nights.

Gillian took the first watch, and he came on at his usual 2400. From up in the watch seat, he could see that the Southern Cross was off to port. The Milky Way stretched from horizon to horizon. This night there were quite a few shooting stars. It gave him time to think. It also gave him time to reflect on all of the people who get up in the morning and take a glance out the window. Both of them had watched hundreds of sunrises and sunsets from beginning to end. Even the timing of the tides at the passes based on the timing of moonrise and moonset was amazing. Out here, they learned and relied on the Earth’s rhythms. Those rhythms had been the same for thousands of years, and most people living in today’s world were completely oblivious to them. Time did march on, but amazingly it did so in stunningly beautiful order in patterns that gave comfort in knowing that they did repeat when they were supposed to repeat.

He had picked up James A. Michener's Tales of the South Pacific at the book swap that the ladies had run during the beach barbeque on Isabella. He was getting into it. It was first published in 1946. Each chapter was about an island or group of islands in the Pacific and was set up in a mini-novelette style that devoted the first part to the history of the island, with the second part a fictional story about people on the island during WWII. It was a fascinating read. As he and Gillian voyaged to a new island, he would read Michener's chapter about it. It would be a treasured gem. There were just some great books that he picked up along the way that he knew he wouldn’t part with.

Before long, it was 0400 and Gillian’s watch. The CD was stacked, she had her cup of tea, and her book. She was set. The conditions were perfect, and he knew he would only get an hour or two before first light. He hoped his tide calculations for the pass at Rangiroa were right.

It was 0630 when he heard “Cap, time to wake up. We are 5nm from our next waypoint, and I’ve got Rangiroa on the radar.”

It felt like he had just gone to bed. While he went on deck, Gillian came below and fired up the stove for that first cup of coffee. Strange, but the coffee always tasted better at sea. A warm mug always took the chill off the morning. They had one more waypoint to go. He had plotted it at a mile off the pass. He looked up at the moon. It would, according to the almanac, set at 0830, which would mark the start of the inflow. Based on their speed, they might get there a bit early, so he took Genny in to 50%, which dropped their speed from 5.5 to 4.5 knots. Should be about right, he thought.

Rangiroa was the largest island in the Tuamotu Island chain. The guide said that it, too, had an oval necklace shape with over 400 Motus. The guide said it was 80km long and almost 40km wide. It must have been one hell of a big volcano in its day, he thought. Avatoru Pass was their point of entry, and it was just coming into view.

He rolled-in the rest of the Genny and started the motor, just as the chart plotter showed that they had reached the pass entrance waypoint. Through the binoculars, he could see the pass just to the west of the little town of Avatoru. He was lined up for it, and there was no other shipping traffic.

As he reached the entrance, he could feel the incoming tide pulling them through. It was right on 0900, so his timing was perfect. He was at less than half throttle, but his speed over ground was 8.5 knots. They were getting a strong push into the lagoon, and once clear of the pass, they motored westward. The guide said there was a good spot to anchor just off a little resort that would be protected from the northerly winds. He could see several sailboats lying at anchor.

With the pick in, he set up the foredeck sun awning. Being in a sheltered spot was good, but it also meant less wind. Having the foredeck awning was great because it gave them shade but also put them nose into what wind there was. Gillian opened the forward hatch and handed up the two folding camping chairs. Those were a godsend, as they were the only seating on the boat that provided a bit of back support. They launched Big Dink to make room on the foredeck and then hung the sun awning. A couple of Bloody Marys, a bit of breeze, and it was heaven.

It wasn’t long before they spotted two people in a little dink coming their way. They pulled in alongside and introduced themselves. Donald and June were from Australia and on the homeward leg of what had been a circumnavigation. Their boat was Just Ducky. It was the same Australian boat that he tried to raise on the radio that was coming out of Hiva Oa that didn’t want to connect via the net. The rude guy was Donald. They chatted with them, and they seemed nice enough. June was from the UK, and so was Gillian, so they had an instant connection.

Donald asked if they wanted to do a drift dive through the pass, and said it was a favorite of the tour boat operators. Gillian begged off, but he readily agreed and went back to the cockpit to retrieve his snorkeling gear.

They all climbed into Big Dink and headed for the pass with Donald’s dink in tow. They anchored Donald’s dink just inside the pass and then headed out of the pass in Big Dink. He estimated the incoming tide to be pushing through at 4 knots. Just outside the pass and off to starboard, there where several mooring buoys. They picked up the one closest to the pass, and put on their gear and flipped over the side. The visibility was the best he had seen since the Bahamas.

As they swam toward the pass, they were picked up by the tidal inflow. It was incredible. They didn’t have to swim, and just floated moving along at 4 knots. It felt like you were flying. The marine life below made it feel like you were swimming in a fish tank. Schools of fish would come up to them and were so thick that it frequently blocked their vision. All they had to do was to use their fins to steer. It took about twenty minutes to complete, but it felt like seconds. Back at Donald’s dink, they hung onto its side to catch their breath. They all agreed it was the best dive that they had ever done. They talked about doing it again, but Donald noted that the outflow was about to begin, and they didn’t want to be shot out of the pass into the open ocean.

The tide was turning, and it was now slack water. It was neither inflow nor outflow, which was good because Donald’s little dink only had a 3hp outboard and was no match for bucking the tide. By the time they made it out to Big Dink, the tide had started to run out. They transferred into Big Dink, tied Donald’s dink to the stern, and let go of the mooring. Big Dink’s 15hp Yamaha quickly carried them back into the lagoon. He dropped Donald and June off at their boat, and when June invited them over for sundowners, he accepted.

Back at Lone Eagle, Gillian had the last of the grouper that he had caught in Manihi ready for the grill. Over lunch, he told her about the drift dive. She listened but was still reluctant to snorkel. That afternoon they went in to shore to explore the resort and the little town. The resort was small and was pretty much a bunch of beach bungalows used by mostly scuba divers. There were dive shops all around the town. There was also a bakery, and baguettes were back on the menu.

They arrived at Just Ducky at 1700. She was a 45’ steel sloop with a big mast and twin headsails. I bet she’s fast, he thought as Donald took their painter as he came alongside. Just Ducky had a comfortable cockpit with full clear enclosures, an aft cabin, and a big saloon. Donald and June said that they had bought her when she was just a rusty hull. They spent a year in Sydney restoring and refitting her. They essentially gutted her and brought her back. They had done a fantastic job. They had sailed over the top of Australia and then to South Africa. After a stop in Cape Town, they sailed across the Atlantic to Venezuela and then over the top of South America and through the canal. From the canal, they sailed directly to the Marquesas. They planned to be back in Sydney on the first of November.

Sundowners lasted for hours with Gillian and June exploring each other’s UK roots. He and Donald talked about boats. Donald was an accomplished sailor having sailed in several Sydney to Hobart races. He said he did all the rigging on Just Ducky and did all the internal fit-out work himself, including all of the wiring. Donald showed him a photo album with pictures of all the renovations. Donald and June essentially built Just Ducky from the ground up. The aft deck had seating around the stern pulpit and was covered by a bimini that had four 100-watt solar panels. Donald told him that they made more than enough power to run everything on Just Ducky.

He discussed their planned route to Australia. Donald and June would be taking the same path. Donald said that they had been in Rangiroa for five days and would be leaving in the morning for Papeete. As they boarded Big Dink, Donald and June said that they looked forward to meeting up again in Tahiti. Donald suggested an 0700 and 1900 radio schedule, which he thought would be good for getting a report on the conditions ahead.

The next morning Just Ducky was gone. The run to Papeete was a two-day 200nm run. They decided that they would leave at first light the following morning. The forecast was for 15 knots out of the northeast. He would check in with Donald at 1900 and see what kind of conditions they were getting. The morning’s plan was for a trip ashore, a bit of stocking up on provisions, and a bit of lunch at the resort.

They were having lunch when they overheard an American couple next to them talking about the cruising boats anchored just offshore. The husband was talking about how much fun it would be to go off cruising. Predictably, the wife was reluctant. She said that she didn’t want to spend a lot of time away from the kids. It was the typical sailor's lament – he wanted to go off cruising, and she didn’t. There must be so many of those guys out there, he thought.

He and Gillian talked about heading off in the morning. The couple overheard their conversation, and the husband asked if they were off one of the cruising boats. His name was Eric, and his wife was Jenny. They were from Wisconsin and were enjoying the warm weather. A break from the snow and ice they said. Eric asked all kinds of questions about their trip so far, their plans, and about Lone Eagle. He said that they had never been aboard a cruising sailboat.

Gillian said, “Why don’t you guys come out and have a look?” Eric almost leaped out of his seat. They headed down to the beach and climbed into Big Dink. He could see they were both excited. Once aboard Lone Eagle, Eric had a million more questions, and Jenny couldn’t get over how much space they had below. She even remarked to Eric, “I could live like this.”

They cracked open a few beers, and Gillian served some baguettes and cheese as the conversation meandered across all kinds of topics. Jenny needed to use the head, and Gillian took her below and showed her how to use it. A few minutes later, Jenny emerged from below and Gillian went back to the head to make sure that she had closed the water inlet valve. Once back in the cockpit, Jenny was talking about the dive they had made that morning and happened to glance over the side and remarked, “That is a strange-looking creature in the water. I’ve never seen anything like it. I wonder what it is?”

Without missing a beat, he replied, “It’s a tissue fish. They are very rare around here.”

It took a few seconds for Jenny to realize that it was the toilet paper that she just flushed over the side. She was a little shocked that they would pump the head directly into the water. He explained that in the States, you had to use a holding tank, but that, out here, there wasn’t any such requirement and then added, “when they make seagulls wear diapers, I’ll use a holding tank.”

He took Eric and Jenny back to the beach. Eric said, “I wish we were coming with you.” He bade them farewell and headed back to Lone Eagle. He had done the nav that morning. All that was left was to break down Big Dink.





CHAPTER LX May 14, 2003 - Downhill to Papeete



Maeva Beach, Papeete, Tahiti

Lat: 17° 32’ 06.00” S, Long: 147° 34’ 11.00” W

Moonset and the start of the run-out tide would commence at 0630. They had the pick up by then and followed their trackback course to the pass. It was almost a full moon, and the run-out tide was surging out of the pass. At cruise speed, they were making 10 knots. It felt like they were getting shot out of a cannon. The conditions were perfect, and the next front wasn’t expected until just after their arrival in Papeete.

Once at the waypoint outside the pass, he took up a heading of 290° that would take them to a second waypoint off the northwest corner of Rangiroa. Once there, they would turn southwestward and sail between Rangiroa and the island of Tikehau. It, too, was an extinct volcano, and its rim was awash at high tide. It didn’t even show up on the radar, but the chart plotter showed that they had half a mile clearance between the islands and almost 3,000’ of water under the keel. It was amazing how these extinct volcanoes reached up almost a mile to the surface.

They now had 187nm to Papeete and should pass the last of the Tuamotu Islands, Makatea, during the night. “Cap, I’m just looking at the guide, and it says we have to clear in again even though we cleared in Hiva Oa. It says that’s because there have been cases where some cruisers didn’t check-in and pay the crew bond in Hiva Oa.”

“Yeah, I read that too. Did you see where it also said that there were mooring buoys in the harbor that we could pick up?”

“Yes, but it also said they are very exposed and that a lot of cruisers go around the airport and anchor at Maeva Beach.”

“I think that should be our plan. If it’s too rough in the harbor, then we head around to Maeva Beach. Tonight we can raise Donald on Just Ducky and see what he encountered on his way in.”

They had finished off the last of the grouper from Manihi, so he put out his line. As he watched it trail astern, he could see its bright pink streamers. Maybe some mahi-mahi today. It was a good sail, and they were making 6 knots. He had a bit of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young playing. It was their song Southern Cross, and he heard the lyric ‘on the downhill run to Papeete.’ He had met Graham Nash in the Florida Keys. He had a gorgeous sailboat. His favorite sailing grounds were the Caribbean, and he fondly remembered that they talked about their favorite Bahama islands over a beer.

He had been trolling all day without even a bite. It was getting late in the day, and he didn’t like having a line out overnight. A shark at 0200 wasn’t his idea of fun. Gillian handed up their sundowners, and just as he put the last one in the drink holder, his fishing reel started to scream. He had his gimbaled rod belt on and climbed up to the stern pulpit and grabbed his rod. Whatever it was, was peeling off the line at an alarming rate. He struggled to get the butt of the rod into the gimble and braced himself against the backstay. This guy was diving, and having the boat moving along at almost 6 knots wasn’t helping. He thought about getting Gillian to start the motor and throw it in reverse but thought better of it. He didn’t want to foul the prop with the fishing line. No, he would have to fight this one.

His rod tip was bent way over as the fish continued its dive. The drag was already tight enough, and he knew that if he tightened it any further that the line might break. Finally, the deep dive ended, and he was able to retrieve a bit of line. That didn’t last long. Every time he recovered 10’, the fish would take 20’. It had now been twenty minutes since he hooked up and the fish was showing no signs of tiring.

First, he thought it was a tuna, and then he felt it might be a shark. It hadn’t broken the surface, so he had no idea what it was. Twenty minutes turned into thirty and he was slowly gaining on him. He had recovered half a spool's worth of line. It was backbreaking, and his arms were burning. He would pump and crank every few seconds. It was now forty minutes, and he was gaining on him. He hadn’t surfaced, so what it was was still a mystery. Gillian was transfixed and peering over the rail to see what it could be. Then there was a flash of yellowish-green. It was a mahi-mahi. He had never seen one fight so hard. Before long, he got a glimpse of him. He was huge. A big bull and he wasn’t giving up. He attempted to dive again, but by this time, he was tiring.

He was now at the tricky part. He had to climb to the side of the cockpit where he could gaff him. It wasn’t easy. He had his sail gloves on and was able to wrap the wire trace around his left hand while his right hand held the gaff with his knees firmly planted in the cockpit cushions. The fish tried a couple of head flicks to throw the lure, but he could see that the fish had swallowed the whole thing - even the pink streamers. The fish was now alongside. He was incredible. Gillian kept yelling, “Look at his colors.”

He knew with the lure down its throat that the fish wouldn’t survive even if he cut the line and released him. He slid the gaff under him and, with a sharp jerk upward, buried it just behind his gills, and with everything he had left in him, he lifted the fish onto the deck. The fish wasn’t done fighting. He tried to subdue him with the winch handle, which just made him mad. Finally, after more than a dozen wacks with the winch handle, he put his hands up in his gills and squeezed with everything left in him. It was over in a few seconds. A few seconds after that, all of the rainbow colors began to fade into a shiny silver. The battle was over.

He put a length of line through its gills, hooked in his harness to the jack lines, and slowly dragged him up on the foredeck. Gillian was right behind him with a bucket and his fillet knife. “Don’t fillet him just yet. Let me get my camera,” she said as she headed back to the cockpit. He just sat there on the cabin top with the fish at his feet. He was utterly exhausted but managed to scoop up a bucket of water and poured it over his head.

Gillian returned with her camera and a tape measure. “No one is going to believe this unless we have pictures.” She was right and started snapping. He came in at 5’6”. With the line through his gills, it took both hands, and he could barely lift him clear of the deck. “He’s got to be 65lbs, he grunted,” as Gillian kept snapping photos.

The fillets were huge - almost 3” thick on the big ends and nearly 5’ long. There were dozens of meals that this fish would yield. It took bucket after bucket of scooped up seawater to clean the mess off the foredeck. Gillian had filled two large garbage bags with filets and dragged them back to the galley. He knew the fridge would struggle to cool them down.

He lifted the carcass and slipped it over the side. He watched it spiral downward until it was out of sight. He knew he would have released the old boy if he hadn’t swallowed the whole rig. What a majestic creature, he thought, so full of fight. He had caught hundreds of mahi-mahi over the years, but none like this one. Back in Miami, it would have been a record. He knew they would be handing out a lot of Ziplocks full of mahi-mahi when they got to Papeete.

After their dinner of grilled mahi-mahi, he raised Donald on Just Ducky on the HF radio. They had arrived in Papeete a few hours earlier. Donald said that they were in Maeva Beach and that the moorings in the harbor were for much larger commercial ships. Donald also mentioned that the run within the lagoon was no problem but that he needed to be mindful of the traffic light at the southwestern end of the airport runway. He was a bit confused. A traffic light at the end of the runway? Donald explained that the lagoon channel took them right past the end of the runway and that the traffic light was there to stop sailboats with tall masts from passing across the flight path when a plane was taking off or landing. If the light was red, the boat had to wait.

Donald asked what their ETA was. He told him that he expected to arrive in the morning. Donald said that he had downloaded the forecast and that he should keep up his speed as a front from the northwest was approaching and was forecasted to arrive in the early afternoon. The forecast was for 40+ knots of wind and seas 15’–20’.

June came on the air and told Gillian that Donald had caught a nice mahi-mahi on the way in and that she would have some fresh fish waiting for them. Gillian replied that he had caught one too and that they would both be taking Ziplock bags around to all of the cruisers in the Maeva Beach anchorage when they arrived.

He came on watch at 2400 his arms were still sore from his fight with the mahi-mahi. He was reading Michener’s Tales of the South Pacific and was up to the chapter about Tahiti. During WWII, the Germans had attacked Papeete. It was strange that the war with Germany reached this far into the South Pacific, but he reminded himself that it was a world war, and that meant skirmishes all over the world. He would have thought it would have been the Japanese.

Before he headed below at the end of his watch, he checked the chart plotter and figured they would be at the Papeete harbor entrance waypoint by around 0900. They were motor sailing at 5.5 knots. He increased the throttle to take it up to 6 knots. He was thinking about the forecast and wanted to get in early. He remembered the early arrival of the front at Cabo Gracias a Dios and didn’t want a repeat performance.

Gillian woke him at 0700, and the extra hour of sleep refreshed him. They were now 5nm from the waypoint at the harbor entrance. They were still running at 6 knots, but their speed soon decreased to 5 knots due to the northward current between Moorea and Papeete that was directly on their nose. Both islands came into view, and their peaks were enshrouded in clouds with the rain forests a vibrant green.

At 0800, they reached the harbor entrance waypoint, and he scanned the shoreline with the binoculars to find the leadlights that would guide them in. It wasn’t long before he spotted them and was able to take up a heading of 148° that would bring them in just northeast of the airport. There weren’t any coastal freighters coming in or out, so they easily slipped into the harbor.

Once in, he turned to starboard and had the airport runway abeam. Papeete Airport was the only international airport in the region and was built by the French to support their nuclear testing on the island of Mururoa some 900 miles east of Tahiti.

Scanning the end of the runway off to port, he spotted the traffic light. It was green, but it soon turned to red. He could see a plane on the taxiway ready for take-off. As the plane powered down the runway, he watched it lift off not far from the end of the runway. Any sailboat passing just off the end of the runway would have been a disturbing sight for the pilot and the boat’s skipper.

As they approached the end of the runway, the light remained red. He throttled back as he saw a plane off in the distance lining up for its approach. He was now at idle speed and was hoping there wasn’t any more air traffic coming. He was in luck; as soon as the landing plane’s gear hit the ground, the light changed to green. He throttled up, and Lone Eagle scooted past the end of the runway. That was interesting; he had never had to give way to an airplane in a boat.

It was 0900 when they set the pick off Mareva Beach. It was a crowded anchorage. They weren’t far from Just Ducky, and June waived as they came in. They were preparing to launch Big Dink but decided otherwise when the sky began to darken. The front was arriving, and it looked angry. Within minutes the wind kicked up to 30+ knots out of the north. It was coming over Papeete. They were on the south side of Mareva Beach, which should have been protected, but the wind just howled down the hills.

They were in 10’ of water, and he had out 3:1 scope but thought better of it. He saw Donald up on deck, letting out more chain, and headed up on the foredeck to do likewise. Up on deck, the rain was pelting down and visibility was dropping. He went to 5:1 scope with the wind now topping 40 knots. He returned to the cockpit and eased her into gear at idle speed to take some of the load off the chain. Visibility was poor and he could see two boats aft of Lone Eagle dragging anchor. His focus was on what was in front of them and what could drag down on them.

What they were experiencing was a Maramu – strong northerly winds after the passage of a front. Other boats had left Rangiroa behind them and reported on the net that they were hove-to and waiting it out. Note to self – make sure you time your passages to arrive a full day before the next front arrives. This passage was better than Cabo Gracias a Dios, and they were safely in, but the Maramu arrived 6 hours earlier than forecasted. Too close for comfort, he thought as he sat in the cockpit peering through the wind and rain at the boats ahead of them looking for any of them going abeam to the wind. If that happened, it would mean they were dragging anchor, and he would only have seconds to react to avoid a collision.

When they were in Isla Mujeres, he had set up a procedure to deal with anchor drags. He had tied a length of line (a pennant) to the end of the chain. It was attached to the anchor locker and would payout so that the last link of the chain would come out of the hawse pipe and be easily reachable. The plan was to release all of the chain until the length of line appeared, and then to attach a float to the last link, cut the line and let it go over the side. They could always pick up the float later and retrieve the anchor chain. Jettisoning the chain meant that they could maneuver out of harm's way.

This time was a bit different as the boats ahead of them were a lot closer. If one of them dragged, he would have to accelerate forward and then veer off to either side to avoid a collision. Veering off would avoid the imminent collision, but it also meant that the boat drifting down on them could snag his anchor chain on the way past. If that happened, it would pull the boats together, and there would be a second chance of a collision. To avoid that, he payed out all of Lone Eagle’s chain so that the pennant holding the last link was on deck. If he had to power up and veer off, the plan was to buoy the anchor and cut the line. His big filet knife was at the ready and so was Gillian.

It was now 1200, and the Maramu had pummeled them for three hours, but it was finally abating. He went forward and brought in 50’ of chain. He still had 5:1 out, but with the wind easing and no boats ahead of them having dragged, they felt like they could stand down from their anchor watch and get some sleep. They could launch Big Dink and go ashore tomorrow.

The next morning the Maramu had abated, but the wind was still out of the northwest at 20 knots. He had spoken to Donald on the VHF, and they were going ashore for a round of golf, so they decided it was safe enough to launch Big Dink. Donald and June had bought clubs with them on their circumnavigation and their goal was to play around in every port they visited. June came on the VHF for Gillian and invited them both over for dinner.

Gillian had bagged up a dozen or so Ziplocs of mahi-mahi, so they made their rounds to all of the cruisers in the anchorage. Everyone was delighted to receive fresh fish. Once their rounds were complete, they headed for the shore. There wasn’t a dinghy dock, so they had to pull Big Dink up onshore and locked her up to a palm tree.

They had planned to hitch a ride into town to visit the port captain to confirm that their clear-in in Hiva Oa was accepted. They walked through the dunes toward the road, thinking it wasn’t going to be easy to transport groceries. Once at the road, they looked left and then right. He couldn’t believe his eyes. Off to the right were the unmistakable Golden Arches of a McDonalds. He hadn’t had McDonald's since the Florida Keys. They decided that they would have lunch there and then head into town.

After ordering a lunch too big for his eyes, they paid the cashier and took their tray and found a window seat. He had no sooner dug into his burger when a beautiful topless woman walked by the window. He was stunned. There was a topless beach next door to McDonald’s, and there were dozens of gorgeous topless women right outside the window. He couldn’t believe that he was sitting there in a McDonalds in Tahiti, eating a Big Mac, and looking at naked women on the beach. It had to be the best McDonalds on the planet.

They were able to flag down a cab that dropped them off at the entrance to Papeete harbor. It was a big commercial port with a massive wharf. Tied alongside was an equally massive motor yacht. Its name was Le Grand Bleu. He had worked in the yachting industry in Fort Lauderdale for years but had never seen a motor yacht this big. It had to be 400’ long, but what was truly amazing was that she had two recesses on either side that stowed a 45’ sportfishing boat and a 45’ sailing yacht. Both were in massive cradles, and she had her own crane to lift them into the water. He just looked in awe. It was the most incredible yacht that he had ever seen.

In the dockmaster's office, it was confirmed that all their paperwork was in order. The dockmaster slid the passenger manifest book across the desk and asked him to put in their names, nationality, and passport numbers. He opened the book and was the next entry after the list of Le Grand Bleu passengers and crew. All the names were Russian. He filled in their names and slid the book back to the dockmaster and pointed at the boat, and asked, “Who owns it?” The dockmaster replied Russian oligarch and rolled his eyes.

Back outside, he saw that Gillian was talking to one of the uniformed female Le Grand Bleu crew members. Their conversation was in French, and Gillian later told him that her new friend had been on the boat for just a couple of months, but that the owners were very demanding. She said it was the woman’s first time ashore in two months.

They were in the heart of Papeete and decided to take a walk through town. The guide said it had a population of over 100,000. It was a busy place, but the French influence was everywhere. So were the tourists; all of the shops were crowded with them. It wasn’t long before they found a grocery store and stocked up on lightweight items as it would be a long walk through the dunes to get back to Big Dink. The prices were high, but no more so than any of the other islands.

Back at Lone Eagle, it was time for cockpit showers and the run over to Just Ducky for dinner. Once aboard, he and Donald talked about Moorea. It was 12nm off the entrance to Papeete. They could see the tall volcanic spires from their spot at Mareva Beach. Donald mentioned that the local marine forecast was still saying that seas were 10’-15’ just outside of the pass and that they were forecasted to be 8’-10’ by morning. Donald said that he and June would be heading over to Moorea in the morning.

“Rob, why don’t you guys head over to Moorea? June and I had talked about renting a little car and driving around the island. You should join us.”

“That’s a great idea. We need to spend another day here to take care of a few things. We’ll sail over the day after tomorrow. Maybe by then, the seas will have calmed down a bit more.”

“Perfect. I’ll try and raise you on the VHF when we get there. If we can’t make contact on the VHF, we can talk on the HF tomorrow night at 1900. I’ll let you know what we find in Cook’s Bay. I hear there’s a store right on the waterfront with a dinghy dock.”

“I like the idea of a store right on the water with a dinghy dock. I’m sure Gillian will want to wait to do our shopping over there.”

They talked about all of the island groups that they both wanted to visit. Donald mentioned that he wanted to haul out and a bottom job in Fiji. He said that he had heard on the net that there was a good marina and shipyard with a 100-ton travel lift at a place called Vuda Point and that it wasn’t far from Musket Cove. Donald explained that Musket Cove was the starting point for the Fiji to Vanuatu race, and a lot of the cruisers planned their Pacific sailing routes to be at Musket Cove by the first of September. He liked what he was hearing. Lone Eagle would certainly need a bottom job by then. The gooseneck barnacles had wreaked havoc on the antifoul paint on both of their hulls, and race week at Musket Cove sounded like a lot of fun.

Over June’s mahi-mahi fish pie dinner, the discussion of cruising routes continued. After Moorea, they would head for Huahine, Raiatea, and then Bora Bora. From there, the Cook Islands. After dinner, they moved to Just Ducky’s stern deck. The lights from Papeete blotted out the night sky. The conversation turned back to Musket Cove. Donald had spoken to several cruisers that had previously done the race and that they had told him that the Fijian authorities had organized for Musket Cove to be an official clear-out point so that the cruisers didn’t have to go into Nadi to clear-out. They could just clear-out with the rest of the boats doing the race and head for New Caledonia. They agreed that would be the plan.

He told Donald about the toys, and Donald felt that if he did have to surrender them on arrival in Suva, that arrangements could be made to have them returned in Musket Cove. He hoped that would be the case. Having to backtrack from Musket Cove to Suva wasn’t a pleasant thought.

It was getting late, and Donald and June planned to be underway by first light, so they headed back to Lone Eagle. As they settled in below, he started looking over charts at the nav station. “Cap, I really like Donald and June. Do you think we should stay on our own or cruise with them? Their route is the same as ours. It might be fun.”

“Yeah, they seem like really nice peopled. Donald is certainly an accomplished sailor, so sailing along with them wouldn’t be a problem. Just Ducky is 20’ longer than Lone Eagle at the waterline so that over a three-day passage, she would be ahead of us by a day. That could be good for us because Donald could let us know about the conditions ahead. Let's do it. If it doesn’t work, we can always split-off on our own.”

“I was hoping you would say that. I think they’re going to be a lot of fun. Donald certainly is a character. What do we need to do tomorrow before we head out?”

“It’s time for another oil change, and I want to change the filters in the watermaker. Even though it’s 12nm to Moorea, we’re going to have to pull Big Dink. It’s open water out there, and it’s very lumpy at the moment. I hope it dies down a bit from that Maramu before we leave.”





CHAPTER LXI May 19, 2003 - Cook’s Bay



Moorea, Tahiti

Lat: 17° 30’ 27.90” S, Long: 149° 49’ 18.20” W

With all of their preparations completed, they headed for Moorea at first light, following the trackback course to the harbor entrance. At that hour, there were no flights to contend with at the airport, and the traffic light at the end of the runway was green, so they proceeded into the main harbor. Le Grand Bleu was gone, and they wondered if she might have headed to Moorea. They made the turn to port and headed out of the pass with the wind 10-15 knots out of the north, which would give them a beam reach to Moorea. The seas had died down a little bit and were 6’-10’, but they were still really lumpy. Even with the full main and Genny up, motor sailing would be the order of the day. With the course and Monitor set, they settled in for the uncomfortable ride and watched as the sun lit up the peaks of Moorea.

It was 0700, and he raised Donald on the VHF. They, too, had had a lumpy ride over, but Donald said that Cook’s Bay was beautiful and that they were the only boat in the bay. Donald also mentioned that there was a south setting current between the islands and that he better keep motor sailing, or it would take all day to get there.

He figured it would be a two-hour trip even though the peaks of Moorea seemed like you could reach out and touch them. Cook’s Bay was on the north side of Moorea, which was an extinct volcano that had previously blown up eons ago. When it blew, the whole north side of the crater was utterly blown away, and Cook’s Bay was what remained of the crater. It was surrounded on three sides by the crater walls that towered thousands of feet overhead and were dripping in rain forest vegetation. Moorea had a fringing reef that enabled inside, protected water navigation. He had plotted in a waypoint just off the entrance to the pass into Cook’s Bay.

It had taken longer than expected to reach the pass, but once through it, they were in flat water. It was quite a relief compared to the conditions outside. As they motored in, they could see Just Ducky tucked up into the back of the bay. They dropped the pick well aft of Just Ducky, which gave them an unobstructed view of the interior of the bay. They couldn’t get over the rain forest. There was a narrow beach, and then the pine and palm covered rain forest that extended 2,000’ up the sides of the crater peaks. It was a sight to behold.

Gillian raised June on the VHF and invited them over for dinner. It wasn’t long before they had Big Dink in the water and motored into the dinghy dock opposite the little store. It was an old building crammed full of everything, and they even rented cars and scooters. With everything they needed in hand, they returned to Lone Eagle. It was 1400, and Gillian began her dinner preparations while he worked on writing the next edition of the Log of Lone Eagle friends and family email.

He had finished Michener’s chapter on Tahiti. It was a fascinating read. It felt like you were there in the 1940s. How different things must have been then. As he keyed in words for his email, he was at a loss for words to describe the beauty of Moorea and Cook’s Bay. Then it came to him. Why not just quote Michener. He just said it better.



"...nothing in Tahiti is so majestic as what faces it across the bay, for there lies the island of Moorea. To describe it, is impossible. It’s a monument to the prodigal beauty of nature. Eons ago, a monstrous volcano exploded, and the northern half sank into the sea. The southern semi-circle remained aloft, its jagged peaks looming thousands of feet in the air. From Tahiti, Moorea seems to have about forty separate summits: fat thumbs of basalt spires tipped at impossible angles, brooding domes compelling to the eye. But the peaks which can never be forgotten are the jagged saw-edges that look like the spines of some forgotten dinosaur. They stand together, the peaks of Moorea, forever varied, forever new. I once watched them for thirty days, at dawn, at sunset, in the heat of the day, and they showed an infinite variety. They were only nine miles across the bay, but in a storm, they would seem to be at the very edge of the horizon. At dawn, the orange sunlight made them angry ghosts. At dusk lingering shadows made them quiver in the sky. They reached into the air and pulled down the clouds; they were dressed in gold and purple."

Tales of the South Pacific, by James a Michener

He was satisfied with his Michener quote and finished the email with their plans for the upcoming islands. He was getting quite a readership of The Log of Lone Eagle with probably 50 people on distribution. With the Pactor modem upgrade in Isabela, they were now able to attach files, so he attached a picture of the big mahi-mahi that he had described so that there wouldn’t be any claims of a fish tale.

Donald and June pulled alongside in their dinghy Mallard. It was the first time that Donald and June come aboard Lone Eagle. June couldn’t get over the amount of room that they had below, and Donald was fascinated by Monitor. He was determined to figure out how it worked. Donald couldn’t believe that it could hold a course so well and that even in the worst blow, the travel of the tiller was no more than a few inches. Donald explained that he was using an electronic autopilot and that during their circumnavigation that he had rebuilt it twice.

The next morning, they picked up Donald and June and headed in for the general store. They picked up a small rental car and set out for a tour of the island. It was a mountainous drive through the rain forest. Each town had black pearl and pareo shops. Several resorts had been built on the lagoon inside the fringing reef with their expensive, over-water bungalows.

Their route took them along the peak of the volcano. There were several overlooks with stunning views down the length of the bay, which revealed that they now had company in the anchorage. Two massive sailing yachts had come in. Donald agreed with his assessment. They were J boats, the old 1920s J boats that had raced in early America’s Cup races. Their masts were enormous, and their hulls were shaped like arrows. He could imagine 30 guys sitting on the rail just like in the old photographs he had seen. He remembered reading that several billionaires were getting together to re-start J class racing and that there were several that had been recently built to the old 1920’s design.

There were two other visitors to the harbor. They were visiting Japanese warships anchored bow-to-bow at the entrance to the bay just inside the fringing reef. They looked like two frigates that were blockading the pass. It was quite a sight to see.

On their way back to the lagoon, they came upon some palm-roofed buildings where a guy covered in tattoos was carving a tiki out of a log that spanned two sawhorses. They pulled over to examine his work. He was covered in tattoos, every square inch of him. His name was Fausto, and he was doing some beautiful carving work. There were tikis all over the island. Many were stone ones that had been there for years. Fausto gave him the chisel and mallet, and he tried his hand under Fausto’s watchful eye. He was pretty good with wood, and Fausto could see that he wasn’t going to ruin his artwork.

The girls had already gone into Fausto’s studio and motioned for them to come in. He had seen a lot of tikis at the tourist shops along the way, but none more beautiful than these. Fausto confirmed that he had made all of them. He had in his mind a place for one on Lone Eagle and found one that was just the right size. Donald and June bought one too.

They arrived at the lagoon and went into the store to return the car. The girls had decided that they wanted to have dinner aboard Just Ducky and did a bit of shopping while he and Donald waited outside. “Rob, what do you say we drop the girls off, and go have a look at those J boats? I’ve never seen one up close.”

“That’s a great idea. It should be fun; maybe the crew will invite us aboard to have a look.”

They dropped the girls off at Just Ducky and headed over to the J boats. Neither of them had ever seen masts so tall. The nearest one was Shamrock. He had read that she was the last of the original J boats and that she had been completely restored. She was. Her hull was a deep shamrock green with a shine that you could see yourself in it. There were a couple of crew members on deck as they slowly made a loop around her. With such a big rig, her fittings were enormous. Donald estimated that some of them would be worth twenty grand.

They stopped Big Dink and tried to strike up a conversation with some of the crew members. The crew gave a few curt answers but had no interest in talking with them. Having a chance to come aboard and have a look around wasn’t going to happen. He had worked on yachts his whole life, and there were always people that came along that were genuinely interested, and he always took the time to chat with them. These guys weren’t from the same era. They just turned their backs and went about their business.

They headed back to Just Ducky. “Man, those guys were pretty rude,” Donald said.

“Yeah,” he replied. “They could have been just a bit more polite and friendly. It wasn’t like they were at a dock and had lots of lookers asking them thousands of questions. They knew we were off cruising boats.”

Back at Just Ducky, the girls were busy with dinner, and the boys opened the bar. June had put the stereo on, and the speakers under the stern solar panel canopy were pumping out the tunes. Before long dinner was served in the cockpit, it was incredible what the girls were able to pull together for a meal. The wine flowed, and the conversation rambled until the girls decided it was time for a dance party on the stern. While the girls did their thing on the stern, he and Donald sat in the cockpit.

“Rob, you up for some fun?”

“Sure, what did you have in mind?”

“Come with me,” Donald said as he motioned him to come below.

Just Ducky had a low companionway down the starboard side of the galley that led aft, past the engine room to a stern cabin. Donald opened the watertight door to the engine room and motioned him inside into his little workshop, where he opened a drawer and pulled out a good-sized cotter pin and a small shackle. He put each in the vice on his workbench and, with a big pair of pliers, gave them a good twist. Both were completely bent and unusable. He didn’t know what Donald was up to, so he just played along. Donald put the bent cotter pin and the broken shackle in his pocket and said, “Let's go have some fun.”

Back on deck, Donald motioned for him to get onto Mallard and said, “Let's go for a little ride.” Once they were both aboard Mallard, Donald pushed off from Just Ducky. The music was still blaring, and the girls were still dancing and didn’t even notice them leaving. To keep it that way, Donald rowed them out a safe distance and fired up his little 3hp outboard and then headed for the J boats. When they were about 50 yards away, he cut the engine and started to row toward Shamrock. The plan was to quietly place the bent cotter pin and the broken shackle on Shamrock’s deck without waking anyone up.

They both were a little drunk, and the plan wasn’t perfect, but they were able to put the bent cotter pin and the broken shackle on Shamrock’s deck and get away without waking anyone. When they were far enough off Shamrock, Donald fired up Mallard’s engine, and they returned to Just Ducky and climbed aboard without being noticed. “Come back tomorrow morning a 0700 and bring your binoculars,” Donald said with a wink as he tied off Mallard’s painter, and they headed for the party on the stern.

The next morning he was up at 0600. Gillian was half awake. “What are you doing up so early?”

“Donald invited me over for coffee – said he had a project and needed my help. I’ll be back in a little while. You sleep in; you had a big night.”

“Yeah, my head hurts,” she said as she rolled over and pulled the covers over her head.

He grabbed his binoculars and their little camera and headed over to Just Ducky. He could see Donald on deck and handed him his painter as he pulled alongside. Donald said, “The fun should begin shortly. I’ve seen one guy in the cockpit, but no one has gone out on deck.”

Donald poured him a coffee, and they sat in Just Ducky’s stern seats that gave them a perfect view of Shamrock. As they sat there waiting for some activity, they talked about the overnight passage to Huahine. Donald thought it would be an easy run and stopped mid-sentence when he saw something through his binoculars.

“Hang on; it looks like their day is starting on Shamrock. There are a couple of guys going up on deck.”

As they both peered through their binoculars, he could see one of the guys walking on deck just about at the point where they left the bent cotter pin and broken shackle. The guy spotted them and bent over and picked them up to examine them. Then his head bent back – way back, as he looked up at Shamrock’s towering mast. They both started laughing. The guy took the bent and broken bits back to the cockpit and showed them to another crew member. Again, their heads bent back, and their eyes went aloft. He and Donald couldn’t stop laughing. Next, one of the crew members picked up a pair of binoculars and started looking aloft to figure out where the broken bits might have come from. He and Donald high fived. It had been a lot of fun, but it wasn’t over. Through their binoculars, they could see that there was quite a debate amongst the crew going on over at Shamrock. There were a lot of heads looking aloft, and it wasn’t long before someone brought up a bosuns chair, and they sent a crew member aloft. He was up there the better part of an hour examining every fitting on the massive rig. Meanwhile, he and Donald kept laughing.

It seemed that the show would last for some time, so he thanked Donald for the entertainment and headed off in Big Dink. He was going to go back to Lone Eagle, but couldn’t see Gillian in the cockpit and figured he would let her sleep for a while longer. He decided to do some exploring and headed over to the store’s dinghy dock.

When they had come in yesterday, he had seen a stone tiki on the edge of the woods just off the beach and walked over to where he saw it. It was a beautiful stone tiki blackened by the years on an intricately carved stone pedestal that had vines growing on it. The tiki was facing the rain forest, so he got in front of it. Behind it, through the trees, was Lone Eagle sitting at anchor. It was a perfect picture with the tiki in the foreground and Lone Eagle bobbing at anchor in the background. He snapped the photo and headed back to Big Dink.

He took a slow motor around the perimeter of the bay. In places, there were little beaches. In others, the rain forest just dripped right down into the water. It was the most beautiful island that they had visited. It was what he imagined Tahiti would be. Around a little bend, he spotted a waterfall. It wasn’t big, but it had a strong flow of water coming over a cliff 20’ above. You could comfortably shower under it, and it had a little beach, so he headed in, and pulled Big Dink ashore. He looked around, and there were no pathways, just a sheer rock face covered in vines. It was only accessible by boat, and he could see that below it was a beautiful rock pool that looked deep enough to swim in. Just magic, he thought; Gillian is going to love this.

Back at the boat, Gillian was finishing her coffee. “Hey baby, I’ve found a better alternative to a sun shower.”

“I didn’t know they had showers at the store. I’d love a nice long shower. We haven’t had a proper shower since we left the Panama Canal Yacht Club.”

“Well, it’s not at the store, but it does have all the water you want. Let’s grab our towels and shower kits, and I’ll show you.”

He motored them slowly along the shoreline. “Where are we going? It’s just jungle, and I don’t see any place for a shower.”

“Wait. You’ll see it in a minute.”

The waterfall came into view. “My God, it’s beautiful, and there’s nobody here.”

“You can only get to it by boat, “he said as they beached Big Dink.

Once ashore, they walked over to the rock pool; it was deep enough, and the water was just right. He took a bar of soap, stripped off, and headed for the waterfall. “Are you sure no one can just drop in on us?”

“Not unless they come by boat like we did, and we can certainly see them coming.”

Gillian hesitated, but stripped off and joined him. The water felt wonderful. Gillian loved it and soaped up with her shampoo. They stood under the waterfall for what seemed like ages with the water cascading over them. Then they went for a swim in the little rock pool and just floated there for what seemed like hours looking up at the jungle canopy. They were sure that they weren’t the first people to discover it, but they certainly luxuriated in the fact that they had it all to themselves.

They spent two more days in Moorea and showered at the waterfall every day. It was magic, but it was time to move on to their next island, Huahine.





CHAPTER LXII May 30, 2003 – The Leeward Islands



Iles Sous le Vent, French Polynesia

Lat: 16° 42’ 75.80” S, Long: 151° 02’ 34.50” W

They left Cook’s Bay at 1600 for the 80nm overnight run to Huahine, the first of the Leeward Islands that they would visit. Heading out of Cook’s Bay was a feast for the eyes. He knew that they could have stayed longer, but he remembered that the week he had up his sleeve could quickly be taken up by the haul out that they would be doing in Fiji.

The J boats and the Japanese warships were gone, and Donald and June had headed out an hour earlier. They motored out of the pass and were greeted by a steady 15 knots out of the east, making it a beam reach with seas running 6’-10’ just clear of the pass. He punched in the waypoint at the southern end of the island and had another one for the entrance to the pass on the western side of Huahine. The Monitor was set, and they were right on their rhumb line. With the main and Genny full, and with the engine shut down, they were making 5.7 knots.

The weather forecast showed a front out of the north that was due to develop the day after they arrived. Another Maramu wasn’t a welcome thing, but at least it was going to arrive in Raiatea a full day after they did, and they would have plenty of time to find a sheltered anchorage.

A couple of sportfishing boats crossed their path on the way back to Papeete. One passed close enough that through the binoculars, he could see that it had a big marlin hanging from its Gin Pole. Three to four hundred pounds for marlin wasn’t uncommon around here. He swept the horizon, and there were a couple of coastal freighters, but they too were heading into Papeete. Just another typical day in the neighborhood.

At 1900 he checked in with Donald, and they were now 10nm ahead, and June would be taking the first watch. He had told Donald and June about the waterfall, and they loved it too. It was such a welcome break from cockpit showers, although Donald and June were lucky, Just Ducky had a full, hot water shower. He was envious.

Gillian woke him at 0600 and said that they were coming up on their waypoint off the southern tip of Huahine. She said the mountain peaks were visible now that the sun was coming up. He climbed into the cockpit to the sun's first rays. The sky was clear, so he was looking forward to a good run in, although the guide said that there could be big swells in Passe Avapehi that would take them into Baie de Cook – another Cook’s Bay. Well, Captain Cook did get around.

His next waypoint at the pass put him ¾ of a mile off the fringing reef that encircled Huahine. At that distance, you could see the back of the waves crashing over the reef. He was hoping that they wouldn’t be a problem in the pass. He would be talking to Donald in half an hour. He should be in by then.

At 0700, he keyed the mic on the VHF, and Donald answered. He said the pass wasn’t a problem, and that the surfers were loving it. He said there were two other boats in the bay and that they had just launched Mallard and were going ashore for a look around.

They were now half a mile from the waypoint at the pass, and he could easily see the backs of the big blue waves that crashed on the reef and turned into misty clouds of spray. As they reached the waypoint, the chart showed that he should come in on a heading of 102°, which meant that they would be nose to wind. Gillian started the engine and disengaged Monitor while he went on deck to douse the main. From up on the cabin top, he could see the pass coming into view.

The swell was at least 10’ out of the northeast and rolling right through the pass. It wasn’t breaking in the pass, but it was on either side of the pass in long hollow tubes. It was a perfect spot for the dozen or so surfers there. Three jet ski tenders had brought the surfers a mile offshore to the surf break that was on either side of the pass.

As he made the approach, he throttled up Lone Eagle and kept her right on the heading. They could feel the swells lifting them. To starboard, the same swell that was lifting them was creating a massive breaking wave with a gaping hollow tube that he could look down complete with a surfer in it barreling straight at them. As the tube reached the pass, the surfer shot out of it and then kicked out no more than 20 yards from them were a jet ski was waiting to pick him up. It was a fantastic view for him, and he couldn’t imagine what it looked like form the surfer's perspective seeing a sailboat at the end of his tube ride.

There is nothing more terrifying to a sailor than the sound of breaking surf, and here, it was no more than 20 yards from them. It was another of those surreal experiences like the stars at the equator that would stay with him. It was one of the joys of being there at that moment.

Once through the pass, he looked back at the size of the rollers coming through the pass with the waves breaking on either side. He could see the surfers kicking out, right where the pass flattened out the waves. Directly ahead was a fjord-like cut at the foot of Mount Puuaretu that led to the little settlement of Fitii. He could see Just Ducky ahead and took up a spot behind her and dropped the pick.

Donald and June had just returned to Just Ducky and reported that there wasn’t much in Fitii and suggested they motor over to Avamoa Bay a mile or so away where the little town of Fare was on the north side of the bay. The guide said it had a funky beach bar. They were on their way in a few minutes and within the hour were anchored off Fare. It was a pretty spot.

Huahine in Polynesian means ‘pregnant women.’ How it got its name was quite simple. A look to the south of Fare at the hills showed the perfect profile of a pregnant woman lying on her back. The head, details of the face, the breast, and the pregnant stomach were in astounding detail.

The girls decided that lunch ashore at the funky beach bar was the plan. Donald already had Mallard in the water, so they dinghied in with them. The beach at Fare was like talcum powder, white and soft. There was a dinghy dock off the beach bar that had a palm frond roof and a collection of flags hanging from the rafters. Flags from every country on the planet had to have been there. The bar’s sand floor made it feel like the good old days at the End of the World Saloon in Bimini and the fresh grouper on the menu made for a perfect lunch.

The overnight sail had been tiring for all of them, and after a few pitchers of rum punch, it was time to head back to the boats. It was 1900 when they hit the rack, and they both slept until 0600. Gillian was up first and turned on the weather fax to get the latest report on the front that was inbound. It wasn’t looking good. It was another Maramu and had winds of 40 knots plus out of the northwest that would have it coming right down Avamoa Bay.

He looked at the printout and didn’t like what he was seeing. The other side of the island was looking like a better option, so he picked up the guide and the local chart and headed for the cockpit. Gillian handed up his mug of coffee while he did hs nav homework.

Huahine was made up of two islands. One to the north and one to the south that were connected by a bridge that was too low for them to get under. As a result, they would have to sail out and around the island to get around to the protected east side, where Passe Farera would lead them to Baie de Maroe. Baie de Maroe was a large bay with fjord-like fingers on the northwest side that would put them under the lee of the island. That was the spot where he wanted to go, so he plotted the waypoints around the island to Passe Farera.

He raised Donald on the VHF at 0700, and they discussed the inbound front and the potential refuges on the eastern side of the island. Donald agreed that Baie de Maroe was their best option. Gillian and June wanted to go ashore to top up on some provisions, and Donald said that June would be over in a few minutes to pick Gillian up. The plan was to leave as soon as they returned.

While he was talking to Donald, he could see sailboats coming through the pass. First, there were two, then two more and then five. The first boat to pull in was flying a Moorings Charter Fleet flag. It was a flotilla of Moorings boats coming in from the Moorings base in Raiatea. They started anchoring all around Lone Eagle and Just Ducky. Donald said there goes the neighborhood as they watched the anchoring antics of the bareboat charter skippers. Some were good, and some were hopeless. They both agreed it was time to leave. They both agreed that this was no place to be in a blow, especially with a harbor full of novice sailors.

When he saw Gillian and June heading back on Mallard, he went forward and began winching up the anchor. The engine was running, the waypoints were plugged in, and they were out of there.

Donald hoisted Mallard, and they were right behind them. The sky was starting to look like a front was coming as they headed out through the pass and took up a northerly heading to sail around the top of the island. The wind was out of the east northeast, and getting around the top end of the island wasn’t going to be easy. They would beam reach to the top and then close reach until they were far enough east to tack onto a port beam reach for the run to the pass.

Monitor was magic. She was incredible on a close reach. She took advantage of every lift and was outpointing Just Ducky. He just smiled, especially when Donald raised him on the VHF and asked how he could point so high. He replied with one word: Monitor.

Lone Eagle was built for hard windward sailing. Her design was based on the North Sea Rescue Boats of old, and she didn’t miss a beat. She was rail down and powering ahead to the next waypoint that would be the turn southward to the pass where she would be on a beam reach. He knew that they wouldn’t have any problems making it to Baie de Maroe.

Baie de Maroe was the biggest bay between the two islands that made up Huahine, and Farera Pass was the widest to get through. It also helped that it was on the southeast side of the island. The wind was now out of the north, and the pass was flat, so it was an easy run-in. They tucked up into the most northwestern bay, which was like a millpond.

The front was approaching, and the sky was darkening as he set the pick. As he looked up at the top of the mountains protecting them, he could see the palm trees at the summit. They were exposed to the winds of the oncoming front, and the palm fronds were standing out straight. He estimated that it was now blowing 30-35 knots and building. He was so glad that they had decided to move. Those charter boats in Avamo Bay were going to get a pounding.

Gillian and June had plans for dinner on Just Ducky, so he went up on deck and launched Big Dink. They were going to be there a while, and he was expecting that the effects of the front would not abate for at least a few days, so having Big Dink in the water would give them a chance to do a bit of exploring.

They headed over to Just Ducky just as the rain was starting. It wasn’t long before it was pouring, and he could see great sheets of it swirling as it came over the mountains. Visibility was dropping, and so was the barometer.

They settled into Just Ducky’s cockpit and discussed their next move to Raiatea. It would all depend on how long it would take for the Maramu to subside. It was only 15nm away, but the conditions between the two islands would be open to the swell from the northwest. They agreed that it was better to hang out where they were and make the most of Huahine, even if it meant a bit of squally wind and rain.

Donald said, “It’s 1900, and those charter boats are required to check in with the Moorings Base on Raiatea. Let’s tune in on the VHF and see how they’re doing on the other side of the island.” Donald tuned into the Moorings frequency, and they immediately heard a lot of nervous, if not panicked, chatter.

Boat 1: Moorings Base, this is Boat 1. We’ve lost our anchor.

Base: Boat 1, does that mean it’s no longer attached to the boat?

Boat 1: We don’t think so, but we will have a look.

Boat 2: Moorings Base, this is Boat 2. We are taking on water.

Base: Boat 2, how much water have you got?

Boat 2: It’s above our ankles.

Base: Have you closed all the portholes and hatches? It’s raining?

Boat 2: No, but we will now.

Boat 3: Boat 4 this is Boat 3 in front of you. We are dragging anchor. You need to get out of the way.

Boat 4: Boat 3; this is Boat 4. We are aground.

They listened, and they laughed. It was chaos on the other side of the island, and they could have been right in the middle of it, had they not moved. As they listened, several more boats dragged anchor. Some had collided with each other, while others went hard aground. Those people were going to have a very long night. Moorings Base would not be able to send over help until the morning and maybe not even then if the conditions were too bad to make the run from Raiatea.

The next morning he awoke to the sound of rain on the cabin top. He loved that sound. They were warm and dry, which were big things for sailors as most of the time, it could be the opposite. Coffee and catching up on emails were the order of the day. The morning printout from the weather fax showed that the front had passed, but the isobars showed that the Maramu was building. A glance up to the top of the mountain peak confirmed it; the palm fronds were still out straight.

Two days later and they managed to get ashore a couple of times to do some exploring but ended up spending more time dodging squalls than they did enjoying the sights. On the morning of the fourth day, he and Donald looked at the forecast. The Maramu was slowly subsiding, but they both knew that the 15nm run to Raiatea would be lumpy. Still, they decided to go. He had to break down Big Dink, so Just Ducky headed out first.

Donald reported it was lumpy but not too bad. With Big Dink stowed, he headed Lone Eagle out of the pass to round the southern end of Huahine. Once clear, he took up a heading for the waypoint at Passa Teavapiti on the eastern side. It was the right decision. At the point where they were halfway there, they came under the lee of the island, and the wind and swells died down to the point where the ride was comfortable.

Raiatea was the second largest of the Leeward Islands with a fringing reef that included the Island of Tahaa to the north. The traditional name for Raiatea is Havai’i, which means the homeland of the Maori people that were reputed to have migrated to New Zealand and Hawaii from the island. Once inside the pass, they were within Baie Faaro. The bay was full of Motus, and the diving was reported to be excellent around and between them. By the time they had the pick set, it was 1600. He launched Big Dink, but the plan was that they would stay aboard and do some snorkeling tomorrow if the weather was good. They were still getting the occasional squall through, but the weather fax showed that they were heading into a good run of weather.

The next morning the girls wanted to go into town, so they took Mallard, and he and Donald took Big Dink out to one of the reefs between the Motus. It was a fantastic dive, and within a few minutes, he had speared four groupers. The marine life was abundant, and the reef was healthy. He saw a few lobsters, but they were too deep to get at them. On the way to the reef, they saw that it was at least half a mile from the blue water of the lagoon across a wide shallow area that was too shallow to bring Lone Eagle and Just Ducky in any closer.

As they motored back to Just Ducky, Donald asked, “Do you think we should try motoring through the lagoon to get to the western side tomorrow? We’re going to have to leave via the western side to get to Bora Bora anyway.”

“I think that’s a good idea. We might be able to get in closer to the Motus. Here there’s too much skinny water to get in close enough to get any shelter. If there’s too much skinny water on the western side, we can head up inside the reef to Tahaa.”

He dropped Donald back on Just Ducky and gave him two of the groupers that he had speared. Back on Lone Eagle, Gillian had returned from her trip to town with June. He told her about the plan to move around to the eastern side of the island in the morning. She was thrilled with the groupers.

The next morning they pulled the pick and began their motor to the western side. It was quite an experience motoring in the lagoon as they were just inside the fringing reef, and they could easily see the breakers crashing over it. To starboard was the island and the tall peaks. The lagoon was deep enough, but he still had to worry about bommies. As they made their way around, he spent a good bit of time up in the ratlines.

As they made their way up the western side, it became clear that it was all deep water and no protected anchorages. He keyed the mic and raised Donald. They agreed that their best option was to motor across the pass between the two islands and then head into Baie Hurepiti, which was a fjord-like bay on the southwest side of Tahaa that extended inland. It would certainly provide protection. The only question was depth. Would it be too deep to anchor there?

They had to pick their way far enough up into the bay for it to get shallow enough to anchor. They dropped their picks and were satisfied with the anchorage. The only problem was that it was more than a mile dinghy ride out to the reefs and the Motus. Fortunately, he had towed Big Dink, which was one of the great benefits of being inside the fringing reef.

He picked up Donald, and they headed out to the Motus for a dive. Some of the Motus were tiny. Many of them were less than an acre. There was one that was about an acre that was connected by a reef to another, much larger one. The little pass between them looked like the perfect diving spot, so they maneuvered Big Dink as far into the pass as he could. They were in 8’ of water.

The marine life on the reef was vibrant. There were small reef sharks everywhere, and you did get used to them although the fishing experience in Manihi and the feeding frenzy were never far from his mind. They weren’t spearfishing today, so they didn’t have to worry about their catch becoming someone else’s dinner.

They had been in the water for over an hour, and he signaled Donald that he wanted to head to the beach on the smaller of the two Motus. As they came out of the water, they could see that it was a beautiful beach, and the island was covered in coconut palms. They dropped their gear and went for a wander. As they walked along the beach, he thought of how idyllic it was - a tiny palm-covered island with beautiful talcum soft white sand. Everyone’s dream, and there were hundreds of them within the lagoon. There were 24 palms on the Motu, so they named it 24 Palms Island.

Back at Lone Eagle, he and Gillian packed a picnic lunch and headed back to 24 Palms Island. Gillian loved it. There was no one in sight, so the stripped off and swam and then laid on the beach soaking up the rays. They were the kind of afternoons that they both dreamed of, just like their days at the waterfall and Moorea. It was why they made the trip.

“So Cap, do you think Bora Bora will be as pretty as this? I could spend days here.”

“According to the guide, Bora Bora’s fringing reef is supposed to be even better than this one, and you can even sail around the whole island.”

You could see Bora Bora from where they were. Mount Otemanu, 2,000’ high, was easily visible with its peak enshrouded in its own rain forest-generated cloud. He and Donald had discussed when they should head over. Donald said he would have a look at the weather reports while they were on 24 Palms Island.

They spent all afternoon on the island, and as he looked at his watch and saw that it was 1600, he looked to the west and could see a big anvil cloud forming. Looking aloft, he could see that it was over Bora Bora and heading their way. “I figure we’ve got 30 minutes before it arrives,” he said as he started Big Dink, and they headed back to Lone Eagle. It was a 15-minute ride back, and by the time they arrived back at Lone Eagle, the sky had darkened, and the lightning and thunder started.

Being as far up in the bay as they were, they only had to contend with the rain. It was a sun shower and only lasted a few minutes. He raised Donald on the VHF, and he confirmed that the weather would be perfect tomorrow for the run to Bora Bora.





CHAPTER LXIII June 11, 2003 - Bora Bora



Iles Sous le Vent, French Polynesia

Lat: 16° 29’ 50.00” S, Long: 151° 46’ 04.50” W

At first light, they headed out of Passé Paipai and ran along the fringing reef until their rhumb line to the southwestern tip of the fringing reef lined up. It would be a 20nm sail, and the conditions were perfect with the wind out of the northwest. They were under full sail and making 6 knots. He had entered two more waypoints; the first would be a mile off the fringing reef with the second at the entrance to the pass. According to the chart, he would then need to take up a heading of 115° and would see a leadlight onshore that would guide them in.

As they headed for the first waypoint, Gillian was below replying to some emails that had come in overnight. Monitor was doing its thing, as his mind drifted back to his dad and his run to Bora Bora in 1942. As his dad told it, they had sailed out of Norfolk with a cargo of 500lb bombs bound for Australia. While in Panama picking up their orders, they also picked up a man described as ‘some government guy’ that was to make the trip with them. His dad said the guy kept to himself, and none of the crew knew who he was or why he was aboard. They hit a storm mid-way to Polynesia, and the guy got seasick, so much so, that his condition deteriorated on the passage. They were under strict radio silence orders, as any radio transmission could give away their position to marauding Japanese and German submarines. His dad said that they had heard on the radio that there was a lot of German sub-activity around Papeete, so the captain of the Cefalu decided that Bora Bora was a safer option. There was a heavily fortified US base there, and it had an airstrip, so they diverted into Bora Bora and dropped off the seasick government guy. His dad said that Bora Bora was the most beautiful island that he had ever seen. He said that they stayed a couple of days and then resumed their passage to Sydney.

He took up the 115° heading and shot through the pass on an incoming tide. In the lagoon just off to port was the Bora Bora Yacht Club that had quite a few boats anchored. The marina had quite a few vacant slips. They decided to anchor among the other boats and would then take Big Dink in for a look around the yacht club.

Donald was anchored in front of them and had gotten in earlier and had already gone ashore as he lowered the Yamaha onto the stern of Big Dink. There was a busy little dinghy dock at the yacht club, but they were able to nose their way in among the other dinghies. The yacht club reminded him of the waterfront tiki bars in the Florida Keys. He found the dock master’s office and went in to inquire about dockage rates. He was shocked at the daily rate and politely said he would think about it. As he left, he saw that Gillian was standing at the entrance to the restaurant. She motioned him to come over and have a look at the menu. They couldn’t believe the prices. They were two to three times what they had seen in Papeete, and they thought the prices there were ridiculous. No wonder they have so many vacant berths.

There was a gas station across the street from the yacht club, and he could see that they had an ice fridge. They were out of ice, and he had brought in the cooler that was in Big Dink, hoping that there would be some nearby. It was ten bucks a bag, the most they had ever paid, but it was for sundowners, so they didn’t hesitate and bought three bags. As they left the gas station, they ran into Donald and June, and they wasted no time complaining about the prices that they had seen in town. Everything was expensive. June held up a baguette and said that it cost two dollars, and he reminded them that they were fifty cents in Hiva Oa.

As they walk back to the yacht club, he told Donald the daily dockage rate he had been quoted. Donald couldn’t believe it and replied, “At least our accommodation and food are covered, and they can’t charge us for blue lagoon water or any fish we catch.” So true.

It was coming up on sundowner time, so they invited Donald and June back to Lone Eagle for a drink. They came up with a plan to pull the pick in the morning and head around the point, just to the north of the yacht club that would take them into Baie Faanui. They would anchor there as the diving was reputed to be excellent just across the lagoon at Motu Manini. According to the chart, there were dozens of Motus there, all surrounded by beaches and reefs. The girls would take Mallard into the little town of Faanui to have a look around as Gillian wanted to stock up on some fresh fruit and veg.

Motu Manini was a great dive spot. There were brain coral formations as big as VW Beatles and canyons of Elkhorn and Staghorn coral that meandered endlessly. Those canyons were like mazes, and it was easy to get lost, which wasn’t a good thing as you couldn’t walk across the coral at the surface to get back to your boat. This time there were schools of manta rays that came right up to them. Some of them had to have been 8’ across. They had been in the water the better part of two hours when Donald gave the signal to head back to Big Dink. He was thinking the same.

On the way back to the boats, Donald told him about a reef in Baie Povaie that was a short motor south from where they were. Donald said the bay was big, but there were some sheltered spots just off the resorts with all the over-the-water bungalows. They agreed that they would head over in the morning. He dropped Donald off and headed back to Lone Eagle, where Gillian was catching rays on deck.

The next morning they headed for Baie Povaie. It was quite large, and the clearness and the color of the water were astounding. All along the shore were resorts that all had dozens of over-the-water bungalows perched on stilts with boardwalks connecting them. He scanned the resorts and the bungalows with his binoculars, and most appeared to be empty. They anchored in 20’ of clear water just off the Four Seasons Resort. It was a big complex, and he could see several dive boats at the main dock and lots of tourists boarding them for a day of diving. Thankfully, there were no bommies to contend with as there had been in Raiatea and Tahaa.

Donald raised him on the VHF and suggested that they follow the dive boats loaded with tourists that were coming out of the resort. They agreed that those boats would likely be heading for the best dive spots in the bay. Even though June was joining them, Gillian opted to stay aboard. He put his gear in Big Dink and headed over to Just Ducky. The dive boats had anchored, and the tourists were already in the water as they made their way to a spot as close as they wanted to get to them. The place they picked was an open area of sand surrounded on three sides with coral formations that were awash at the surface.

They flipped over the side and were greeted by schools of iridescent fish in brilliant yellows and blues. He wished he had a can of Cheese Wiz like he used at Mermaid’s Reef in Marsh Harbor in the Abacos. It was such fun to see the fish eating the Cheeze Wiz as it squirted out of the can.

They followed a canyon of Elkhorn coral until they could see the bubbles of the divers from the resort around the next bend. As they turned the corner, they saw about a dozen divers on the bottom with one in a wedding dress. They were apparently filming an underwater wedding. Donald, undaunted, swam right behind the wedding party and was clearly in the pictures of the bride and groom that were being filmed. He and June followed and waived as they went by. The wedding party looked to be Japanese and were stunned that their wedding just been crashed, but as Donald said later, they had to get through the coral canyon, and the wedding party was the shortest route.

The reef beyond was teaming with giant Wrasse of every color. They hadn’t brought their spearguns for this dive but wished they had, as the grouper were plentiful. They returned to Big Dink and headed across the bay to the island of Toopua. It was a shallow water run into the beach where they pulled up Big Dink and laughed about Donald’s wedding crashing antics. They would have loved to have seen the pictures.

“Rob, we’re thinking about heading to the Cooks the day after tomorrow. We figured we would go into town and get our crew bond back and then head out the next morning.”

“I think we’ll be ready to head out too. I’m sure Gillian will want to reprovision in the morning since it’s going to be an 8-day run.”

“Why don’t you and Gillian come over for sundowners and dinner tonight,” June said.

“That would be great. Why don’t we head back, I am sure Gillian will want to whip something up for dinner?”

Back at Lone Eagle, he shared with Gillian their plans for the Cooks. Gillian thought it was a good idea and agreed that they would need to top up provisions. As Bora Bora was their last port in French Polynesia, they would have to check out. “Cap, do you think we’re going to have any trouble getting our crew bond back?”

“I don’t think so since I paid it via credit card it should be that they refund the amount that they charged us in Hiva Oa. They should be able to do that in the port captain’s office.”

“I’m glad you paid it via credit card. June said that Donald paid their’s in cash in US dollars, and Donald wants US dollars back. They may have a problem.”

The next morning they headed for the port captain's office. It was a hot and dusty walk of about a mile into Viatape. The port captain said that Bora Bora was the jumping-off point for most cruisers and didn’t have a problem with refunding the crew bond. With the credit card receipt in hand, they walked over toward the shops. He needed to change some money and spotted a bank. He went to the bank, and Gillian said that they should meet up at the little grocery store on the town square.

As he walked through the front door of the bank, he could see Donald at one of the teller windows having a heated conversation with the teller about getting his bond back in US dollars. He didn’t want it back in Pacific francs. He understood why Donald was so adamant. If he got the bond back in Pacific francs, he would have to change it in the Cook Islands that used the New Zealand dollar and would probably lose on the exchange rate.

He quietly stood in another line for a teller, all the while listening to Donald and the heated conversation he was having. Donald’s teller wasn’t budging, and he heard her say that if he wanted US dollars, it would take a couple of days for them to get it. Donald would have none of it and kept demanding US dollars.

Just then, Donald looked away from the teller and spotted him. He exclaimed, “There’s my lawyer,” while pointing in his direction. He shrunk a few inches, and the teller that he was in line for, scowled at him. Thankfully he only wanted to change a few dollars. He wished Donald luck as he headed out of the bank as fast as he could. A few minutes later, Donald emerged. He had taken the Pacific francs and said he wasn’t going to hang around for a few more days to get US dollars.

He met up with Gillian at the store and helped her load all the bags that they would now have to drag back to the boat. There was a lot of stuff, and the bill for it all was eye-watering. That mile back walk to the dinghy dock was exhausting, and they were dripping by the time they got back to Lone Eagle.

Once Gillian was done stowing everything, he opened the engine compartment and began checking all the fluid levels. As he looked over and under the engine, he spotted several drops of oil in the engine pan way in the back of the engine right under the shaft coupling just behind the transmission. He had never seen any oil drops back there before and checked the transmission fluid dipstick, which showed that the level was fine. I’ll have to keep an eye on it, he thought as he closed the engine room hatch.

They headed over to Just Ducky late in the afternoon. Donald had just done the nav for the run to the Cooks. It was a straight run of 867nm on a heading of 238°, which would take them past a few seamounts, but on that heading, they would pass well clear of them. It didn’t matter what time they left. The weather report was good for the first day or so. Then you got what you would get and had to deal with it as best you could. Such was the way of passage making. Weather forecasts could only tell you what you would be hitting. You certainly couldn’t get out of the way of anything.

After dinner, the drinks continued to flow, and they were all still laughing about Donald’s antics at the bank. Donald was certainly a character. The girls headed out onto the stern and turned up the tunes. It was now dark, and there were a few lights on in the three nearest bungalows. Donald turned up the music a few more clicks and turned on some flashing Christmas lights that he had hung from the bimini. He even dug out an inflatable palm tree and hung it on the boom. It was a loud affair, and he could see several bungalow residents out on their balconies, wondering who these nuts were in the bay that were disturbing their high-priced peace.

While the girls were dancing, Donald asked if he wanted to have some fun. He had no idea what Donald had in mind, and reluctantly agreed. They climbed aboard Mallard and headed out into the bay. It was 2000, and Donald was scanning the bay for any anchor lights. He found one sailboat nearby and headed for it. When they were twenty yards off the boat, he cut the engine. There were no cabin lights on.

He asked Donald what he was up to. Donald was pretty drunk and just muttered a reply something to the effect that it was a Kiwi boat, be quiet, and everything would be fine. He still didn’t know what Donald was up to and just watched as he quietly rowed Mallard closer. When they were alongside the Kiwi boat, Donald grabbed its toe rail and began to pound on the hull with his fist, which set off a commotion of headbanging and swearing below deck. A few seconds later, a disheveled looking guy in a pair of boxer shorts appeared in the cockpit, and Donald exclaimed, “We’re lost. We’re out of beer, and we are looking for the Bora Bora Yacht Club. Can we come aboard and have a beer?”

Before Donald finished the sentence, he was climbing over the Kiwi boat’s lifelines and settled into the cockpit. He squeamishly followed. The Kiwi guy looked distressed, and the wife, with a look of great concern on her face, handed up two beers. He could see her looking at her partner with a look of ‘get rid of these guys,’ but her partner was reluctant and let it just play out, even though they could see that that they were getting played by an Aussie. Donald was good at it; he never allowed there to be a pause in the conversation.

To the relief of the Kiwis, they quickly finished their beers, thanked their hosts and climbed into Mallard, and beat a hasty retreat. He knew that he would have to be a bit more careful the next time Donald asked him if he wanted to go and have some fun. Moorea and the broken shackle was fun, but this could have turned ugly if the Kiwi had picked up a knife on his way up to the cockpit. He knew he would have.





CHAPTER LXIV June 15, 2003 - The Cook Islands



Avatiu Harbor, Rarotonga, Cook Islands

Lat: 21° 12’ 00.00” S, Long: 159° 47’ 00.00” W

They had cleared the pass at 1200 and had laid in a south-westerly course for the 867nm passage to Rarotonga when he went below to check the engine. They were motor sailing at 2,300 RPM, which was half throttle. He opened the engine room hatch and aimed his flashlight under the engine. There was a steady drip coming from the transmission, and he yelled up to Gillian to take her out of gear and shut her down. The transmission seal was leaking badly, and he knew that the transmission didn’t hold a lot of oil and could seize if it ran dry. He figured that he would wait until she cooled down and then top off the oil and add a bit extra. They wouldn’t be doing any motor sailing for the next five days.

He could still run the engine in neutral to charge the batteries, but running it under load wasn’t an option. He might even be able to run it to maneuver at low speed in the harbor at Rarotonga, but even that risked burning up the transmission if the seal completely let go. He knew he would have to chance it if it was their only way into the harbor.

Just Ducky was ahead of them, and he knew they would soon be out of VHF range. He raised Donald and explained the problem. Donald agreed with his assessment. They would keep their 0700 and 1900 HF radio schedule, and Donald offered to see if there was a Yanmar dealer when they got there, which would be one to two days ahead of them assuming the wind held.

That afternoon he reviewed the shop manual for the transmission. It was going to be a big job. The engine was still under warranty, but he knew that if there wasn’t a Yanmar dealer in Rarotonga, that he would have to do the work himself and might be lucky enough to get the parts for free under warranty. He looked at the list of Yanmar services centers. There wasn’t one in Rarotonga, and none of the services centers had email addresses – only phone numbers, so he was out of luck being able to order parts that would be there when they arrived. He would have to call when he got to Rarotonga and figured his best bet would be the service center in New Zealand as the Cook Islands were part of New Zealand, and there were regular flights between Rarotonga and Auckland.

He studied the shop manual all afternoon to make a list of all the parts he thought he might need. To replace the transmission seal, he would have to disconnect the shaft coupling from the transmission, unbolt the transmission from the back of the engine, hopefully, remove the seal that was pressed-in and then reassemble everything and align the shaft all while they were in the water. He knew he would have to remove the cockpit hatch, and with the new 8D battery down there right behind the transmission, he would have almost no room to work.

They were making just under 6 knots, and the wind had them on a perfect broad reach that he hoped would hold all the way to Rarotonga. The shop manual and service directories for the Yanmar were sitting beside him, and he had finished his parts list. “Well, Cap, do you think we can fix it?”

“I think so, but it’s going to take a couple of days to get the parts shipped in from Auckland. It’s also going to require us to pull the transmission off the back of the motor, which is a big job under any circumstances, let alone in the tiny space we have to work with.”

“Do you think Donald can help?”

“I think he could. He certainly knows his way around boats and engines. He told me about some of the repairs that he has done on Just Ducky. I’m sure he would know how to do it. I had the diesel class back in Maryland, but it certainly didn’t include tearing down a transmission.”

“I’m sure Donald will give you a hand. Can we run the engine to get us into Rarotonga?”

“We won't be able to do any motor sailing but can run it to charge up the batteries. We just can’t put her in gear. As for running it to get us in, that’s another story.”

“Do you mean we’re going to have to sail into the harbor? Really?”

“Well, I’ve filled the transmission with oil. I figure we can run it for a little while, like when we’re docking, but we have to do it at low RPMs and only for a few minutes since it is really leaking. Too long and the seal blows, and the transmission seizes. If that happens, we’ll be buying a new transmission, and they don’t come cheap. And the answer to your question is yes; we’ll have to sail into the harbor.”

“Are you okay with that?”

“Yes, I can do it, but if it looks like it’s impossible like it’s too narrow or there’s no room to maneuver, we can always launch Big Dink and tow Lone Eagle in. That 15hp Yamaha is strong enough to do it.”

“Yeah, but that means I have to steer. I don’t know whether I can do that.”

“Don’t worry, baby, I’ll use Big Dink like a tug and push Lone Eagle were ever we need to go.”

“OK, Cap. But I’m still worried about us sailing in.”

It was 2400 on June 15 when he came on watch. He remembered it was Father’s Day, and that day always brought a flood of memories and a few tears. His mind was now focusing less on the lousy cancer memories and more on the good ones. The image of his Dad when he cleared the canal was one of those thoughts. He held it dear and tried to remember it often. He could still remember his father’s smile and the incredible brightness of his eyes. It was an image he would never forget.

All was good aboard Lone Eagle. They were right on their rhumb line and making 6 knots, so he settled in with Michener’s book. He was reading about the Moriori that had migrated from the Leeward Islands of French Polynesia thousands of miles to New Zealand. How they navigated all those years ago was still a mystery. No one had ever figured out how they did it in a canoe with 80 guys paddling.

As he read, he came across a quote that made the hair on the back of his neck stand up, and he felt a chill come over him.

Seek ye the way! Though the distance be great, though the way be long, keep thy course O Son! Across the water is my path.

Tales of the South Pacific, by James A. Michener

Michener said it was a Moriori Paddler’s prayer from the canoe Tainui on its journey from Tahiti to New Zealand in December of 1350. He just stared at the words. It was Father’s Day, and it felt as if they were his dad’s words to him on this spot and at this moment. It brought a tear to his eye and was another one of those surreal moments to treasure. He was following his father’s path across the Pacific.

He re-read Michener’s words describing it as a paddler’s prayer. He couldn’t believe it was from the year 1350. That was 100 years before Columbus discovered the Americas. It was just incredible that the Moriori were sailing these waters and successfully navigating thousands of miles to islands no bigger than a speck seven hundred years ago. It almost beggared belief.

The weather was good, and the five-day passage set them into their daily passage making routine. It was something he did enjoy. There were always projects to do, but there was also plenty of free time to catch up on other things. Donald was reporting good weather ahead and said he expected to arrive in Avitui Harbor on the morning of the fourth day.

By the morning of the fifth day, they had Rarotonga in sight. Donald had reported that it was a very small harbor and that they were side-tied three deep to coastal freighters and had to climb over all three to get to shore. Donald also reported that the pass wasn’t very wide and that you couldn’t see the leadlights until you were almost in the harbor. It wasn’t a comforting report.

He had a waypoint set at a half a mile off the harbor entrance. Once at the waypoint, the chart showed that a heading of 192° would be in line with the leadlights. The wind was out of the north so, technically, he could sail in on a beam reach. The challenge would be that he had to be far enough above the leadlight line to avoid any southward set, which would put him on the reef in the narrow entrance.

As he approached the waypoint, he could see where a heading of 192° would put him, which looked like the entrance, but the leadlights still hadn’t come into view. He raised Donald on the VHF. He was standing by but still couldn’t see them. Just as he was about to make the turn to make the run in, Donald came on the VHF and advised that he stand down as there was a coastal freighter that was departing. He couldn’t believe it. He disengaged Monitor and tacked out to sea. They were now head to wind, close-hauled, and pounding their way back northward so that they would be above their approach waypoint. The freighter took almost an hour to clear the entrance. In that hour, they beat their way back above the harbor entrance waypoint. Time for take two, he thought as he headed back downwind for the waypoint and started the engine.

Just above the waypoint, he swung the tiller and took up the heading of 192° and sheeted in the main and the Genny. He needed power, and both sails were at 100%. Lone Eagle was surging ahead and was rail down. Now all he needed was to be able to spot the leadlights. He keyed the mic and told Donald that he still couldn’t see them. Donald said that he could see Lone Eagle and to hold his course. It wasn’t easy, but the chart plotter showed that he was right on course and would be entering the narrow pass within seconds.

He could read the color of the water. It was shoaling rapidly, and he could see the coral on either side of the pass. The wind was pushing him to the south side of the pass, and he struggled with the tiller to keep her favoring the north side, and, thankfully, there were gusts of wind that lifted them to the windward side of the channel. Normally he would ease the sheets, but this time he needed power and had to stay close-hauled. They were making 6 knots, and it wasn’t long before the leadlights became visible. He was right on 192° and the lead lights were in perfect alignment. Within seconds they were in the harbor, and he could see Just Ducky ahead tied to the coastal freighter. He decided that he would head up past Just Ducky and flip over to a port tack. With a little luck, they would sail up alongside Just Ducky, and he could let go of the sheets and spill off all of their wind. Gillian had already gotten docking lines ready and fenders over the side and was on deck ready to throw a spring line to Donald who was standing on Just Ducky’s stern with June on the bow.

He tacked Lone Eagle, and the main and Genny filled, and Lone Eagle began to pick up speed. As he approached Just Ducky, he waited until he knew that he would have enough momentum and released both of the sheets and glided alongside Just Ducky. Gillian threw Donald the spring line, and he took a wrap around a winch, and Lone Eagle came to a complete stop. Donald looked at him and gave him a thumbs up. As they were tying-off Lone Eagle, Donald told him that it was one of the best pieces of sailing that he had ever seen. They were in; Gillian couldn’t believe that they had done it.

As they put away their sailing gear, he felt completely drained. Had it not been for that freighter coming out, it would have been a lot easier. Having to pound to windward and orbit for an hour had taken it out of him, but he knew he had to check-in with the port captain and then get on the phone to Yanmar New Zealand to order the parts.

They grabbed the ship's papers and passports and began the process of climbing over the coastal freighters. Three freighters, Just Ducky and then Lone Eagle on the outside, was the docking order. The one that Just Ducky was tied to was painted bright blue. Up on top of the hatch to one of its cargo holds was a big wooden cage with a blue tarp over it. Inside was a large pig that June had named Ethel. June said she had been feeding Ethel all of their food scraps.

The port captain was a nice guy, and the clear-in process went smoothly. The port captain told him that he needed to check in every morning to see if any of the coastal freighters they were tied to were leaving. If they were, they had to stay on the boat and break off and then re-tie when the freighters departed. He hoped that he would have the transmission fixed before that happened but knew it was possible that it wouldn’t. He would have to figure out a plan for that event.

There was a little convenience store opposite the dock master’s office where he purchased a phone card and called Yanmar New Zealand. They had everything on his list in stock and would send it via DHL and advised that it should arrive in two days. Better two days than two weeks, he thought. Gillian picked up a few things, and they headed back to Lone Eagle.

Donald came aboard and looked over the shop manual and then went below and looked at the engine. The cockpit hatch would have to come up, but he thought there was just enough access to be able to disconnect the shaft coupling and remove the transmission. Donald looked at his watch and said, “Coming up on 1000. That’s when they start blasting.” Donald explained that the harbor was being expanded and that every day from 1000 – 1200, they would be blasting the coral and then spend the rest of the day carting it all away. Right on 1000 came the first boom, which was followed by a second one a few minutes later.

As they sat in the cockpit, they saw that a large two-masted sailboat was coming in through the pass. It had to be a 100’ yacht, and they both speculated as to where it might be able to tie-off as there weren’t any good spots left for such a beautiful, shiny mega yacht. As the big yacht circled right next to them, there was another boom that echoed through the harbor. They heard the skipper of the mega yacht say to the crew member standing next to him, “Was that us?” thinking the explosion might have come from somewhere aboard the yacht. He and Donald laughed as they watched the yacht make another circle. Before long, it sailed out of the harbor and dropped the pick just outside of the entrance just beyond the reef.

They had dinner aboard Just Ducky and turned in early. The next morning they climbed over the three freighters and gave Ethel some of their old produce. They stopped in at the dock master’s office to inquire about any freighters leaving that would require them to break off and re-tie. The dockmaster said there weren’t any scheduled, so they headed into town for a look around.

Avitui was a beautiful little town filled with pareo and black pearl vendors. There were dozens of them, and he wanted to get a black pearl for Gillian and one for his mom. They looked at several different vendors and settled on one that was run by a lovely woman who spent a lot of time with them, showing them her wares and explaining how the pearls were graded. They purchased two pearl necklaces and then went off and completed their shopping. Gillian was wearing her pearl necklace and kept looking at it on the way back to the boat.

They were walking along the road that paralleled the beach that led back to the harbor. It was a beautiful walk with frangipani and brightly colored bougainvillea all along the way. He was looking offshore and stopped in his tracks. Gillian stopped too as he pointed to the blue coastal freighter, and there was Ethel in her cage on deck. How did that freighter get away when it was tied to Just Ducky? And, what happened to Lone Eagle? They took off running back to the harbor. When they got there, out in the harbor was Just Ducky with Lone Eagle still tied to her. Donald was orbiting waiting to re-tie to the inner freighter. When he saw them, he rubbed his fingers together as if to say ‘how much’ are you willing to pay to get your boat back.

He was so relieved. Lone Eagle was in Donald’s capable hands. He climbed up on the freighter and helped tie-off Just Ducky. Donald said that the dockmaster came down and said they had 10 minutes to break-off and that he thought Lone Eagle as an outrigger wouldn’t be a problem for Just Ducky. From now on, he was going to bring his handheld VHF when they went ashore.

The next day the parts arrived, and the fun began. Donald was up for the project, and they dove right in doing all of the disassembly. It took all day and getting the pressed-in seal out proved to be a bit of a challenge, but thanks to Donald’s workshop they were able to pound it out and press in the new one. It took a lot of scrapes and a few blood sacrifices, but they managed to get it put back together. The last thing they had to do was to reconnect the shaft coupling and align it and the engine. The alignments were fiddly, but they finally got it done. They were both covered in grease and dripping with sweat. Donald had been phenomenal. He knew he wouldn’t have been able to do it without him. He thanked Donald, and he replied, “That’s what mates do for mates.” It was his first lesson in that wonderful Aussie tradition of mateship.

There were showers at the dock master’s office, and he spent a good hour in there. It was such a relief to get the transmission fixed. It was a couple of hundred dollars in parts, but it could have been much worse had it seized. The replacement would have cost several thousand.

Back at the boat, Gillian had just finished putting everything back together. She too was dripping in sweat and headed for the showers. As she was climbing into the cockpit, he said, “Do you remember that restaurant and bar we saw a block or so from the harbor.”

“Yeah, it looked nice, and I think they have entertainment at night.”

“Let's invite Donald and June out for dinner. Donald worked so hard today, and we should take them out to thank them.”

“Great. I’ll mention it to June when I climb over their boat.”

When Gillian came back, a new boat had arrived. It was a 60’ sailboat and was flying a Dutch flag. It wasn’t a factory-made boat. It looked well built, but was a custom design and looked a bit ungainly. It tied up to the freighter just ahead of them, and within an hour, its rigging was covered in kid’s sheets, and pillowcases and mattresses were laying all over the deck. “Hey, Cap, see that boat that just came in?”

“Yeah, Dutch boat, and did you see all that laundry that they have hanging.”

“I did, and I met the owner. His name is Klaus. His wife’s name is Hilda, and they are sailing with their three kids around the world. Klaus said they all get seasick the first few days out, which is why they have all those kids' sheets and pillowcases out. It seems the kids get seasick and then go to bed and barf, and they end up having to do laundry and air the mattresses every time they come in from a passage.”

“It doesn’t sound like fun to me. Why would anyone go to sea if they knew they were going to get seasick? Especially the whole family, including the captain. That’s just crazy.”

“Klaus said that it passes in a day or so, and the kids love the sailing and the diving.”

“Not me. When I was a kid, I got seasick every time my father took me out fishing. It was an annual event, and for years, I got seasick every time we went out. It was so bad one year that my mom took me to the doctor. I’ll never forget how terrible it made you feel. I eventually outgrew it, but those people are nuts.”

That night at dinner, Donald asked if they had seen the clog boat. He meant the Dutch boat. He, too, thought it looked ungainly to the point of looking like a clog. Donald said that he had met Klaus and had a beer with him on-board. Donald also mentioned that everything was electric, including all roller furling sails and winches. They both knew what the other was thinking – what if the power failed and you were in a blow.

The pitchers of rum punch kept coming, and the fresh swordfish steaks were the best he had tasted. The wait staff were all beautiful young ladies in colorful floral dresses with darkly tanned olive-colored skin and jet-black hair. They were simply stunning. The restaurant was quite busy, and it wasn’t long before the Polynesian music started, and all the wait staff girls began to dance. Their swaying to the music was mesmerizing and Gillian and June went up to join them.

“Donald leaned in and said, “We’re thinking about heading for Tonga the day after tomorrow. Do you want to stay here a few more days or head off with us?”

“I think the day after tomorrow would be fine. We can go into town one more time and top up provisions and then head off the following morning. Is your plan still to head to the Vava’u Group?”

“Yeah, we figured we will go into Neiafu, but you have to make your approach from the western side, so we are going to have to go around the top of the island.”

“I’ve plotted the waypoints and have several of them for the entrance to Neiafu. It looks like there are lots of islands that we would have to maneuver around to get in, but the chart shows that there is plenty of water.”

It had been a big night, and they were glad to get back to the boat, although climbing over three freighters in the middle of the night after too many pitchers of rum punch certainly made it interesting. Thankfully, Gillian had brought several flashlights.

The next morning he told Gillian about his conversation with Donald and the plan to get underway to Tonga. They had seen enough of Rarotonga, and she too was ready to head for Tonga. It was going to be a long run of 867nm that would probably take eight days if the weather was good. The plan was to head to the Vava’u Group which would take them on a route that would take them near Beverage Reef which was a coral seamount with a navigable pass and a reasonable anchorage that was fine in settled conditions, but not if there was a blow. Several boats on the net mentioned that it was a good place to stop mid-way on the run to Tonga. The route would also take them right past the island of Niue which was also reported to be a good spot, but it too had an anchorage that was only suitable in settled conditions.

“Cap, do you think we’ll be able to stop at Beverage Reef or Niue?”

“Well, we could, but that depends on two things - the weather and what time we arrive. If the weather is bad, neither of the passes will be safe to get into as both are in the middle of the ocean, and any kind of lumpy sea would make them impassable. The other issue is timing. If we get there at night, I really don’t want to be orbiting for hours in the open ocean. In either case, we would have to pass them by, unfortunately.”

They had just gotten back from town on their provision run and were stowing everything below when they heard a Dutch sounding voice calling for Donald. It was Klaus, and Donald invited him aboard Just Ducky. With Klaus aboard, Donald yelled out, “Hey, Lone Eagle. It’s happy hour.”

He went over and met Klaus, and Hilda soon arrived. June and Gillian hooked up with Hilda, and he and Donald chatted with Klaus. Klaus had the clog built in Germany, and they had been sailing it for a year. He planned to follow the same route to Cape Town that Donald had taken, but he wanted to spend a good bit of time sailing around Australia. The kids wanted to dive the Barrier Reef.

Klaus said that they were going to spend a few more days in Rarotonga and hoped that they might get up to Aitutaki in the northern Cook Islands as he had heard that it was a beautiful spot with great diving. He had heard the same thing and wished that they could have stopped there too, but with the transmission problem, it wouldn’t have been possible. The next stop would be Tonga.





CHAPTER LXV June 30, 2003 - The run to Tonga



Neiafu, Vava’u, Kingdom of Tonga

Lat: 18° 39’ 12.00” S, Long: 174° 00’ 00.00” W

They headed out of the pass of Avitui harbor at mid-day. The forecast showed that they would have good weather for the first couple of days. After that, it was going to be hit or miss as fronts were coming across. Just Ducky was ahead of them. Donald had said that he shared the same view about going into Beveridge Reef and Niue. It all depended on weather and timing.

Once clear of the pass, he engaged Monitor and set the course for his first waypoint just off Beveridge Reef some 420nm to the west and went below to check the transmission seal. He held his breath when he opened the engine room hatch and shined his flashlight into the engine bed – no leaks. He had been running at cruise speed for almost an hour. If there was going to be a leak, he was sure he would have seen evidence of it by now.

The wind was out of the southeast, and they were broad reaching at 6 knots. He could see Just Ducky off in the distance. Donald had up his full main and his big headsail. He knew Donald would soon be out of sight. It was time to settle in for a long passage. They had sailed Lone Eagle more than 8,000nm and still had almost 3,000nm to go. Places like Guatemala and Panama seemed so long ago and so far away.

At 0700, on day two, he raised Donald. They had both seen the midnight forecast, and Donald was starting to feel the effects of the first front that they would encounter. He said it was overcast and lumpy and that the winds had clocked around to the northeast. They would be checking in again at 1900. He knew that by then that they too would be starting to feel the effects of the front. He hoped it wouldn’t be a bad one.

By mid-day, the wind was starting to clock around toward the north and was now a consistent 20 knots. It was time to put the first reef in the main. As he hooked in and went up on deck, he could see that the sky to the west was darkening. It looked like they might soon be encountering a few rain squalls. He hoped there wouldn’t be too much wind in them.

Back in the cockpit, he trimmed in the main and the Genny a bit and adjusted Monitor to keep them on their rhumb line. They were still on a broad reach, but he knew that it would soon turn into a beam reach as the wind clocked further to the north.

By 1800 the wind had increased to 25 and was gusting to 30 knots, so he put the second reef in the main, hoisted the staysail, and rolled in the Genny to 50%. At 1900 Donald radioed in and said he was getting sustained 30 and gusts to 40 knots with seas of 15’. He, too, had shortened sail and expected he would have frontal passage within the next 12 hours.

He rolled in the last of the Genny before dark and put the second reef in the main. He had adjusted Monitor a couple of times during the afternoon to keep them on their rhumb line. As the wind continued to clock around, Monitor would keep them on the same angle to the wind, which meant that it would take them above their rhumb line. As he watched their track line on the chart plotter, he could see that they were now tracking above their rhumb line. Should he adjust Monitor to bring them back on their rhumb line or just go with it and watch them climb above it? Lone Eagle was riding comfortably and was maintaining 6 knots. He opted to let her climb above the rhumb line figuring that after the frontal passage, he could tack over when the wind switched northwest, which would bring them back down to it. He knew it was a gamble, but he also knew that the conditions were going to worsen and keeping Lone Eagle on a comfortable heading would mean the difference between a rough passage and a reasonable passage. Thoughts of Cabo Gracias a Dios weren’t far from his mind.

By the time of his watch at 2400, they were now 20nm above the rhumb line and almost tracking perpendicular to it. The wind was a sustained 30 and gusting to 40 knots, but Lone Eagle was riding well, and it seemed that his plan was working. By 0600, the conditions weren’t improving, and he was thinking about heaving to and riding it out. He didn’t like the idea of heaving-to. Back winding the main would put a lot of strain on the rudder and the tiller. It wasn’t worth risking it, so he watched their compass heading and the chart plotter. It would soon be time to tack over.

At 0700, he raised Donald. He was 150nm ahead and reported that the front had gone through and he now had winds out of the northwest. Lone Eagle was still getting winds out of the north, and he knew that as soon as they went northwest that he would tack over. He was starting to see breaks in the clouds, and it wasn’t long before the promised northwesterly winds arrived. They were now 35nm north of their rhumb line, but he knew that they would be tracking back toward it as soon as he tacked over.

He had thought about how he would do it. The sea was running a good 15-20,’ and the interval was pretty good, so he thought he would execute the tack when they were right on top of a wave where there would be plenty of wind to get the bow of Lone Eagle through the wind and onto the new tack. The main and the staysail were essentially self-tacking, so they wouldn’t need to trim any sheets.

He disengaged Monitor and focused on the swells until he found one that wasn’t too big and then pushed the tiller to leeward. They had just reached the top of the swell when the sails filled enough to get them through the trough and up to the next peak. Their heading was perfect. The new course would bring them back on their rhumb line just before they reached Beveridge Reef. His plan had worked. He knew it was going to be his plan for any future fronts. It certainly beat the idea of heaving-to in a big sea.

By noon they could see on the chart plotter that they were getting close to Beveridge Reef, which was a submerged atoll with only its fringing reef above the surface. It was considered part of the tiny nation-state of Nuie, which was 130 miles further to the west. They were picking up a few faint radar returns, but that was expected given that it was a reef awash in the middle of the ocean.

It had been a long few days out, and they talked about going in through the pass. At least they could anchor on the sheltered side and get some rest. As they got closer, he could see three masts anchored inside the northwest corner of the fringing reef. He keyed the mic on the VHF on channel 16 to see if anyone was monitoring the channel. Mike, on Triton, answered his call and said the anchorage was quite rolly. He told Mike that they were a mile off the pass and would be heading in soon. Mike responded that he didn’t think it was a good idea as he was watching two humpback whales humping in the pass. Well, now they had heard everything. He told Mike that they might wait it out and see if the whales moved on. Mike didn’t think that was a good idea either as the whales had been at it all morning. He added that there was one boat that was waiting to exit and had been orbiting inside the reef for two hours.

He thanked Mike for the information and told him that they would continue toward Nuie. He wasn’t interested in trying to make a run in with frisky whales getting it on in the pass. He remembered the story of the whaling ship Essex that had harpooned a female sperm whale, and the male rammed, holed, and sank the Essex. Better to let these whales have their fun and keep moving.

By the evening of the next day, they were coming up on Nuie just after dark. It didn’t matter as it was a poorly protected anchorage, and there was still a big sea running after the front. Niue was one of the largest atolls in the Pacific. It was an independent state and, according to the guide, aligned itself with New Zealand. The guide said that it had two anchorages on the western side, both of which were currently getting pounded from the sea that was running from the northwest.

It was 1900, and he checked in with Donald. They too, had considered going in but decided the anchorage would have been too uncomfortable. Just Ducky was now well past Nuie and would be arriving in the Vava’u Group the next day. Donald reported that there was another front coming but that it was very weak. He hoped that would be the case.

It was 2000, and they had just cleared Nuie. They were three miles off and could see lights on the island. He went below while Gillian took the first watch. As he tried to sleep, he kept thinking about the next front that was coming. He would have to download the morning forecast and see when it was going to reach the Vava’u Group. There were lots of islands that he had to maneuver through on the west side. Going over the top and then coming in from the west might be a challenge if it was blowing out of the northwest. Maybe that was why the harbor a Neiafu was called Refuge Bay. It wouldn’t be the first time the name fit the place, which reminded him of Providencia and how they were glad to get in there after getting pounded going around Cabo Gracias a Dios.

The next morning the wind had dropped, and the rain had started. The weather fax showed the front passing over there position, and that there wasn’t going to be much wind associated with it. Gillian had woken him at 0400, and by then, the wind had dropped off so he started the engine. With the engine running, the sails flattened, and the rain coming down, he was focused on the chart plotter and his next waypoint at the northern tip of the Vava’u Group of islands.

The waypoint at the top of the Vava’u Group was the first of seven waypoints that he had plotted that rounded the northwest corner of the island group and then threaded a path into Refuge Bay. This kind of approach was far different from all the others where he simply found the pass and entered. Here he would have to maneuver Lone Eagle around dozens of small islands. The chart showed that they would have plenty of water, but his problem was visibility. With the rain coming down, the Viback clear curtains obscured, and with Baby Dink on the cabin top, he was almost running blind.

By 0700, it was getting light, and the chart plotter showed that they were 5nm from the first approach waypoint. He raised Donald on the HF radio. Donald reported that they had arrived yesterday morning and said that he needed to be very careful coming in because the charts weren’t very accurate about the positions of some of the islands.

He had been coming in on a heading of 280° to his first waypoint. He had the main island on the radar, as he arrived at the waypoint and turned to a heading of 233° that would take them past Vaiutukakau Bay. Heeding Donald’s warning, he switched to the radar overlay mode that would superimpose the radar returns over the electronic chart image. He had played with this function before. This time he would have to rely on it as the rain was increasing and the visibility was dropping.

The radar overlay and the electronic charts were matching up perfectly as they arrived at the third waypoint as he took up a heading of 160° that would take them into the maze of tiny islands that he would have to weave his way through. The radar overlay showed lots of them, and the first, Muifaitunga, was starting to come within visual range. It was more of a rock than an island and was dark and grey and rose some 200’ out of the water. The fourth and fifth waypoints put them right between Muifaitunga and the main island that was off to port. It was like running through a canyon.

The radar overlay over the electronic charts was working flawlessly. At the fifth waypoint, he took up a heading of 057°. There were islands all around them. It was a short run to waypoint six, and the sails were hanging limply in the rain, so he rolled in the Genny and went up on deck to drop the main while Gillian held their course. It was quite nerve-racking weaving a path between the islands as the distances between the islands was quite small, frequently less than a couple of boat lengths.

Waypoint seven was their last waypoint at the entrance to Refuge Bay. He had plotted it in deep water just off the tip of a spit of land that they had to go around to get into the harbor. As they approached, the electronic chart showed the waypoint off the end of the spit of land in deep water. The radar overlay was a different story. It showed that his waypoint was on land halfway out toward the end of the spit. The electronic chart was off by at least 100 yards. From here on in, he knew it was going to be eyeball navigation.

With the rain, it was impossible to read the water. The depth sounder showed that it was starting to shoal as he rounded the end of the spit. He was running dead slow and eased Lone Eagle further off, and the depth stopped dropping. He could see the masts of several sailboats ahead. Some were on mooring buoys, and some were at anchor. He could see Just Ducky and took up a spot just aft of her and dropped the pick.

Refuge Bay and the town of Neiafu were home to a Moorings charter base. There were some charter boats anchored in the bay along with a large dock and a dinghy dock. He had the quarantine flag up and raised Donald on the VHF. The port captain and customs offices were just down the street from the Moorings offices. With Big Dink in the water, they headed in with the ship’s papers and pulled into the Moorings dinghy dock.

The Moorings base had all the facilities to support their cruising fleet, but they also offered moorings for rent and charged a nominal daily fee to cruisers for the use of their facilities. They were friendly, helpful people, and the ability to use their shower, laundry, restaurant, and bar were a godsend for all the cruisers.

They entered the port captain’s office and were greeted by the two biggest humans that they had ever seen. These Tongans were 6’5” and almost as wide. As with all Tongans, they were kind, friendly, and helpful. Clear-in was a breeze, and the toys could stay on the boat. With all the paperwork in order, they returned to the Moorings base, bought daily facilities passes, and had lunch at the restaurant overlooking Refuge Bay. The weather was clearing, and back on the boat, Gillian was busy gathering a load of laundry for the machines at the base. Panama had been the last place that they had access to laundry facilities.

Gillian took Big Dink in while he caught up on emails. The first one to come in was from Tudi, Gus’s wife, back in North Carolina. Tudi and Gus and their daughter Debbie and son Bobby had bought Lone Eagle in 1978 and owned her for 22 years before his stewardship began. The kids had grown up on Lone Eagle, and Gus meticulously maintained her. Their families had been close friends for three generations. They were hugely supportive of him making the voyage, and he had emailed them several times to see if they would come to Australia for their arrival party in Coffs Harbor. Tudi and Debbie were coming. The email said that they would book their flights when their arrival date firmed-up, but they were coming. He was thrilled and fired off a reply. He knew Gillian would be over the moon to know that Tudi was coming. They had become quite close when he stayed at their place in New Bern, North Carolina, on his way south.

Up on deck, the sun was out, and the blue sky replaced the last of the cloud cover that was moving on with the front. There were places where you wanted to stay longer and those where it wasn’t as good and you wanted to move on. This is one of those places where you wanted to linger. Refuge Bay was beautiful and there were islands that they had passed on their way in, that were a short dinghy ride away. The facilities at the base made it even better.

He was inspecting Baby Dink and her lashings to the cabin top when he heard singing. It was the choir at the church on the hillside, and the hymns were drifting down into the bay. Yep, he thought, this is a good place to rig for comfort and stay awhile.

Baby Dink was the lifeboat. She was a 7’2” Seafarer sailing dink with a mast that came in 2 parts, and a boom, all of which were stored in a sealed PVC tube that spanned her length and formed a rigid ridgeline that supported her canvas cover and the ratchet tie-down straps that held her in a teak cradle that he had built at Tudi’s place in North Carolina. Baby Dink had a red sail and an internal drop-down centerboard. He had installed pad eyes under her rub rail that he used to snap on all of Lone Eagle’s fenders, which created a floatation collar. She might be wet, but she would be unsinkable.

He had spent months reading up on lifeboat survival and lifeboat survival gear. While most cruisers relied on inflatable life rafts, he preferred a sailing dink and recalled one comment that he read that said it was better to be able to sail toward help than to sit in a life raft and be blown away from it.

Here in Refuge Bay would be an excellent place to sail Baby Dink. She had two waterproof duffle bags stowed inside her that contained all of their survival gear, including 5 gallons of water and 30 days rations. It was a good time to unpack her, check the condition of the safety gear, and take her for a sail.

He had just lowered her over the side with the mainsail halyard and rigged the mast, boom, and tiller when Gillian pulled alongside in Big Dink with three duffle bags full of neatly folded laundry. “Clean sheets tonight, Cap. I see you’ve been busy. Are we going to take a sundowner sail this afternoon?”

“We are,” he replied as he lifted the duffle bags into the cockpit. “Hey, we got an email from Tudi. She said that they would be coming to Oz for our arrival party and Debbie is coming too. Debbie said that she wants to do some surfing. I replied and told Tudi that we could work on dates when we get closer.”

“That’s such good news. I hoped that she would be able to come.”

“I’ll stow this laundry. Why don’t you sail Baby Dink over to Just Ducky so Donald can have a look at her? She looks beautiful.”

“I think I will,” he replied as he grabbed his inflatable vest and climbed over the side.

He hoisted Baby Dink’s red sail and pushed off Lone Eagle. The breeze was perfect, and within minutes, he was alongside Just Ducky. Donald came up on deck to inspect her. Donald had a keen eye for everything sailing, and he could see his eyes scanning every inch of her. Donald had hold of Baby Dink’s painter as he climbed aboard Just Ducky. “Why don’t you take her for a spin?”

“I’d love to,” he replied as he climbed over the side and gingerly stepped into Baby Dink. Donald was away in seconds and was circling Just Ducky. He said that she felt very stable as he headed off down the bay.

Donald looked like he was having the time of his life with Baby Dink. As he pulled alongside, he said that sailing her reminded him of the days he had spent on Sydney harbor as a kid racing skiffs.

“Hey, Donald, I’ve got to head back. I promised Gillian a sundowner sail. I’ll catch up with you guys tomorrow.”

He picked up Gillian and the sundowners, and he tacked Baby Dink as far windward up the bay as he could before setting her on a lazy run back to Lone Eagle, which was perfectly framed in the setting sun. It took 20-minutes for the sail back, and the downwind sail was perfect. The sound of the water gurgling by and the palm-covered shoreline made for a delightful afternoon.

The next morning they went into town for the local markets. It was an easy walk from the Moorings base, and the route took them along the bay to the town of Neiafu. The problem with all of the markets that they had visited was with the sheer variety of produce, most of which they had never heard of and had no idea what to do with it. The other problem was spoilage. You had to eat it the day you bought it. Otherwise, by day two, it had gone off. The Neiafu market was no different, and Gillian shopped sparingly.

Back in the office at the Moorings base, they found a cruising couple looking over T-shirts with one of the local women. Her name was Carmen, and she was in the business of custom silk screening. She had just completed a job for the cruisers who were inspecting her beautiful work. Her designs were from local Tongan artists combined with any custom designs like the ship's name and ship’s profile that a cruiser might want.

When Carmen had finished and was packing up, they both went over and spoke to her. They were rather surprised at how reasonable her rates were and the quality of the T-shirts and polo shirts that she was using. They looked at each other and nodded – they would place an order. Carmen asked if he could draw a profile of Lone Eagle. He remembered that he had a blueprint of Lone Eagle’s sail plan aboard, and promised Carmen he would provide her with a tracing as she pointed to her studio several houses down the block from the base.

Back at the boat, he pulled out the sail plan blueprint and found some paper and began tracing Lone Eagle’s profile. It didn’t take long to do it, and he delivered it to Carmen later that afternoon. She said that she would have it done in three days and that they could keep the silkscreens. She also said that she would teach them what they needed to know to make their own T-shirts with the screens that they could keep.

The next morning was a Saturday, and the Moorings had organized for a race in the harbor. Donald told him that he was going to go in for the committee meeting and see if he could crew on one of the boats. He said he couldn’t be bothered to race Just Ducky. They agreed to meet up at the committee meeting.

He grabbed his windbreaker and inflatable vest and sailed Baby Dink in where he met up with Donald, and they both attended the meeting. Donald found a German couple that would take him on as crew. As they went through the list of entrants, the race captain looked his way and asked if he was entering Lone Eagle. He replied that he wasn’t, so the race captain said, “Why don’t you race that cute little dink of yours?”

“Sure. That sounds like fun, but what kind of handicap am I going to be working with?”

“We’ll give you a shortened course to sail. Will that work for you?”

“It sure will.”

“OK then, you will have one mark to round, and everyone else will have two.”

The wind was 8-10 knots, and there were six boats in the race plus him. There was a lot of maneuvering around the starting line, so he hung back a bit in Baby Dink. Everyone was clustered around the windward start mark, so he favored the leeward end of the line. As the starter horn blew, he crossed the line on a starboard tack, and everyone else went off on port. He figured he would end up passing behind all of the much faster yachts. What he didn’t realize at the time was that the wind had dropped for the other boats and had picked up on his end of the starting line. Baby Dink was rail-down and driving. By the time the other boats caught some wind and picked up speed, he was in front of them and being on starboard tack, Baby Dink had the right of way and all the boats had to duck under him. Donald scowled at him as he ducked below Baby Dink and fell into second place. He had effectively screwed up everyone’s start but he loved it and Baby Dink was driving hard to the first mark in the middle of the fleet.

By the time the fleet made it to the first mark, he was well behind but was still rail-down and making as much speed as Baby Dink could muster. Donald’s boat was in second place and would have been in first had he not had to duck him at the start. All of the boats were heading to the second mark, but on that side of the harbor, the wind had dropped as the mark was in the lee of the island.

As he rounded the first mark and turned for the finish line, he still had good air, and Baby Dink was running dead downwind. He kept watching the other boats. They had just enough wind to round the second mark and head for the finish line. It was going to be close, he thought. As the fleet picked up the fresh air that he was in, they accelerated toward the finish line. Just when he thought he was going to lose, a gust of wind hit, and Baby Dink accelerated and began to plane. Donald’s boat had taken over the lead just as Baby Dink crossed the line right in front of him. He had won, and the look on Donald’s face was priceless.

The after-race party got started early. Gillian was on the dock at the base and saw the finish of the race. When he sailed Baby Dink into the dinghy dock, there was a round of applause. It had been years since he raced, and he actually didn’t enjoy it, but this time was different. Baby Dink was just great fun to sail, and he certainly didn’t mind his good fortune at the start of the race. Donald said that he thought he was a bit sneaking starting on starboard tack when all in the fleet were on a port tack. He explained that he expected to have passed below the fleet, but couldn’t pass up the opportunity to take advantage of good wind. Donald wasn’t buying it, but he was enjoying the banter.

After the fleet dinner, it was time for the fire dance. The local girls all dressed in traditional costumes came out, and several guys on drums started a slow, sultry beat that increased in tempo with the girls swaying to the music. As the beat quickened, one of the girls went to the side of the dance floor and picked up batons that had rags tied at the ends. She handed one to each girl, and the twirling began. Then she lit her baton and used it to light the ones the other girls were holding. The dance floor was ablaze with fire circles made by the twirling batons. It was a breath-taking show.

When the fire dance was over, the commodore started the awards presentations. He was called up to the podium and given a whale tail necklace and three days of free dockage at the Moorings base. Little did he know, but those three days of dockage were about to come in handy.

The next morning they had planned to pull the pick and head in for the free berth. Gillian was in the head below and spending longer than usual. She came up into the cockpit and said her stomach was quite upset and that the head was plugged and wouldn’t flush. Not a good combination, he thought as he went forward and raised the pick. At least the base had bathroom facilities that she could use while he fixed the head.

As soon as they got into the berth, Gillian made a beeline for the facilities. Donald raised him on the VHF and reported that he and June were experiencing the same symptoms, and so were some of the other fleet sailors. It was something that they had eaten at dinner that was causing it, and everyone was coming down ill. He felt fine and hoped it stayed that way.

It was time to fix the head. He knew it wasn’t going to be an easy job. The plugged sanitary line ran some 8’ from the head, through a bulkhead, around the holding tank, and to a thru-hull fitting under the port bunk in the cabin. The whole boat would have to be torn apart to get at it, and he knew that Gillian would need a bunk to get some rest.

Gillian returned from the facilities looking a bit green, and he got her settled in the starboard bunk while he pulled everything apart around her. It took two hours to disconnect the sanitary line from the head and thru-hull fitting. It seemed as if the hose had welded itself to the barbs, and it took a lot of muscle and a pair of channel-lock pliers to break it free. Once it came loose, he could see that the line was 95% blocked with what looked like sand that was as hard as cement.

He left Gillian to get some rest and headed up on the dock with the hose and his tool bag. He found a vacant berth and got to work on the blocked hose. He tried everything – banging it on a piling, bashing it with a wooden mallet, and poking it with a mop handle. He had made little progress when a cruiser walked past him and said, “I did mine last week, have fun.”

It took him hours, and he found that doing small sections at a time with the wooden mallet worked the best with chunk after chunk of the stuff breaking free. Note to self, at the next chandlery, buy some spare lengths of hose so that when it plugs, you throw the old one out. He must have looked like a mad man to any onlookers who saw him endlessly banging a hose against a piling and beating it to death with a mallet.

With the hose finally clear, he headed back to the boat and past Gillian, who was hurriedly heading up to the facilities. The re-installation was easier than the removal, and before long, he had the head working again. He had just put everything back together when Gillian returned and said, “Please tell me you’ve got it working.”

“All ready for the first inaugural flush.”

She crawled back into the bunk as he finished putting the last of the tools away. “While you get some rest, I’m going to wonder over to Carmen’s studio and see how she’s doing with our T-shirts.”

“I’ll be fine,” she said as she headed for the head as he climbed on deck. A charter flotilla of six boats had left that morning, and most of the cruisers from the fleet had been laid low with the stomach bug. He was surprised that he hadn’t caught it.

Carmen had her studio in her house and warmly greeted him at the door. She had just finished their order with their t-shirts and polos, having just been hung to dry. “Where’s Gillian?” she asked.

“Stomach bug. A lot of the cruisers caught it. Probably from something in last night’s dinner at the base.”

Carmen had done a great job and proceeded to show him how she did her silk screening. She had the screen template mounted in a wooden frame which was laid on top of a T-shirt. She then applied a large drop of ink to the center and then used a rubber squeegee to spread it around. She then carefully removed the wooden frame, and there was a perfect image.

He thanked Carmen for the lesson and told her that he would bring Gillian back when she was feeling better.

Back at the Moorings office, he saw a notice that said that the base would be holding a treasures-of-the-bilge swap meet in the morning. He had plenty of things that he wanted to get rid of and went back to the boat to start pulling things together.

Aboard Lone Eagle, Gillian was up and nursing a cup of tea. “The head works great. Thank you.”

“You’re welcome. You look to be feeling a little better.”

“I am. I think it was just a 24-hour thing.”

“Carmen has finished our T-shirts; they look great. She said that they would be dry in the morning. On my way back, I saw a notice in the office for a swap meet tomorrow. It might be a good chance to swap some books and see if we can sell some of the gear we’ve been stowing.”

“You get all the gear together, and I’ll go through our books. You can tell me which ones you want to keep.”

The next morning they set-up at the swap meet. They had bags of gear and books. So did everyone else, and there wasn’t a market for cruising guides for places that everyone had already been. They were able to swap a few novels, but they had no takers for the big offshore medical bag or for the two spare alternators that wouldn’t fit the new engine and had been rolling around in the bilge. Donald had the same luck. He said that the biggest problem was that nobody brought any money. He was right, and they ended up hauling most of it back to the boat.

After the swap meet, Donald headed back to Just Ducky with June. They still had the berth for Lone Eagle and headed over to Carmen’s studio. Gillian loved the T-shirts and polos. Carmen thought that the design was great and had kept a sample print for her wall collection. It was a great little business for her. There were dozens of swatches with boat images from all the cruising boats she had done over the years.

They met up with Donald back at the base while he was filling a jerry can with gas. “Hey guys, June and I are planning on heading out for Fiji mid-day tomorrow. Are you guys interested in heading to Suva with us?”

“Yeah, I think we’re ready to make a move. It will take us all afternoon to get everything ready as I’ve got to stow Big Dink and Baby Dink. Have you gotten a forecast?”

“I did, it looks like it will be good for the first couple of days. After that is anyone’s guess, but I figure we’ll have at least one front coming our way. Hey, June wants to make a provisioning run in the morning. I’ll have her call you and set up a time for the run into town. Maybe you guys can share a cab.”

They spent the afternoon breaking down and stowing Big Dink and Baby Dink. Baby Dink was the hardest because they had to re-stow all the survival gear and the mast and boom and then put the canvas cover over her, re-attach all the fenders, and tie her down with the ratchet straps. By then, they were dripping and headed for the showers. Thankfully, they were at the dock.





CHAPTER LXVI July 19, 2003 - The run to Fiji



Suva, Fiji

Lat: 18° 07’ 20.86” S, Long: 178° 25’ 47.75” W

In the morning, Gillian and June headed for a store in town that the Moorings recommended, which was reputed to have a lot of western goods. While they were away, he reviewed the nav and the trackback waypoints they would be using to get them back to open water. They would have to trackback five waypoints. At the fifth waypoint, they would take up a heading of 283° that would thread the needle between the islands of Totoya and Matuku that were 100nm away.

Gillian returned with the provisions, and they were underway at noon. The run-out was far better than the run-in. It was sunny, and they had a southeast breeze behind them and were able to sail out past their five waypoints. The views of the islands that they passed were breathtaking. On the way in, they were enshrouded in mist, and on the way out, the sun lit up their emerald green vegetation.

It was going to be a five-day run, and settling into cruising mode again came easy to them. When he came on deck for his first midnight watch, Lone Eagle was making a steady 6 knots under full main and Genny. The stars stretched from horizon to horizon and the moon was in a waxing phase and would provide plenty of moonlight for the passage. His thoughts were of the haul out in Fiji and their planned arrival in Australia. They still had a lot of water to cover, and this passage would take them across the International Dateline, where they would then be 19 time zones west of east coast time.

Tudi and Debbie had said they were coming, but with dates that would need to be firmed-up when they had a better estimate of their arrival date. That was going to be hard to figure as the run from New Caledonia to Coffs Harbor was an 8-day run. The latest from his cousin Kay was that she was still in the middle of chemo treatments, but that she was hoping that this round would be completed before they arrived. His other cousins were a definite maybe. They were all working, and they said that they might be able to come if he arrived on a weekend, but he knew that they all had to travel from Sydney, and to try to time their arrival for a weekend was next to impossible.

It was 0900 the next morning when they passed the islands of Totoya and Matuku. They weren't visible but showed up on the radar and were 10nm to either side of them. He marked their position on the chart; they had done 120nm on their first day out. He had checked in with Donald earlier and learned that he was 60nm ahead of them and that the forecast was looking good for the next couple of days.

As he stood each of his midnight watches, his thoughts kept coming back to what type of legal work he might want to do when he got settled in Coffs Harbor. There was international work representing US companies in Oz, and then there was just local practice where it would involve doing a little bit of everything. He wasn’t comfortable with the local practice line of work because he knew that it required a lot of local knowledge that he knew he didn’t have. Doing that kind of work would mean a steep learning curve.

It wasn’t long before they were off the waypoint at the entrance to Suva harbor. It was another pass through a reef with lead lights. The guide said it was well marked, but as he got within visual range, a thunderstorm took up a track on the radar that showed that it would come right across the entrance. He was just about to line up his approach when a coastal freighter showed up cutting across his bow and making its run into the harbor. Then, the chart plotter decided that it needed to shut down, and the screen went blank. He grabbed the handheld GPS that he always had running that had all of the waypoints, so he went below and quickly jotted down their position.

He decided to orbit until things sorted themselves out, which was a good move because the chart plotter came back to life, the freighter went in first, and the thunderstorm moved through, and the lead lights became visible. He lined up the lead lights and made his run in.

The guide described Suva harbor as a commercial port. It was, with dozens of rusty coastal freighters with seedy-looking foreign crews hanging out on deck, that all looked like they hadn’t been shore in months. What made it worse was that one side of the harbor was full of sunken old freighters that made navigation to a safe spot challenging. He saw Just Ducky anchored behind several freighters and tried to raise Donald on the VHF. He got no reply and expected they were ashore since he couldn’t see Mallard alongside or on her davits.

Gillian didn’t like the look of the place, and neither did he. He dropped the pick just behind Just Ducky and would have a chat with Donald about moving when they returned. It would give him time to figure out another plan.

The guide said that visiting yachts could use the Royal Suva Yacht Club, which was on the other side of the harbor. He raised the dockmaster on the VHF and was told that a slip would be available tomorrow and that they were welcome to anchor off their dock overnight.

Donald and June returned from their run ashore and came alongside in Mallard and told them that getting ashore at the commercial wharf wasn’t a good idea. He shared with Donald, his call with the dockmaster, and they all agreed that they would move. Donald said he wasn’t interested in paying for a berth at the yacht club but said that they would anchor off the club.

It was a short run to the yacht club, and they had their picks down in no time. Donald had just cleared-in. He had his quarantine flag up and raised the port captain on the VHF. The port captain asked where he was anchored and told him to stay aboard, and he would send out a customs officer.

Two customs officers pulled alongside and boarded Lone Eagle. They went through the usual ship's papers and passports, but when it came to the toys, the customs officer that appeared to be more senior refused to sign the inventory receipt. He told the customs officer that if he didn’t sign the receipt, he couldn’t take the toys. The customs officer made a few calls on his cell phone. Since he was speaking Fijian, they had no idea who he was talking to or what was being said.

The senior customs officer said that they would be leaving but would come back with the police. It wasn’t long before the customs officer, and a plain-clothed gentlemen returned to Lone Eagle. He asked to see the policeman’s identification and was only shown a badge. He explained to the policeman that he was willing to surrender the toys if he would sign the receipt, which he also refused to do. A few more cell phone calls ensued that were all in Fijian.

The police officer asked him to come ashore with them and bring the toys, as they would all go to the police station, and the whole matter would be sorted out there. He agreed, and they climbed into the custom’s officer’s panga and headed for the yacht club dock. Once ashore, he was escorted to an unmarked car. He sat in the back seat with the customs officer and the toys in his lap. The police officer drove and took them on a route that wasn’t leading into town. He asked where they were going and was told, ‘you will see.’

He wasn’t getting warm fuzzies – just cold prickles, and as the police officer, if that is what he was, kept driving further and further into the jungle, he was getting more worried. Thoughts of a road trip and the movie Midnight Expressed flashed through his head. They were making so many turns he knew he would never be able to find his way back.

They had to be 30 minutes into the drive when what looked like a military base came into view. There was a security checkpoint and a barbed wire fence with razor wire at the top. There were also dozens of Quonset huts, each running hundreds of feet long. The car cleared the checkpoint and stopped in front of one of the huts that had a sign above the door, which said Armory. This is going to be interesting, he thought.

When they entered, there was a front counter and behind it, a wall and a door. The police officer rang the bell on the desk, and a moment later, the biggest human that he had ever seen walked through the door dressed in greasy blue overalls. On his overalls, was a name tag that said he was the senior gunsmith. The police officer spoke to the man in Fijian. When they finished, he tried to explain that he would be pleased to surrender the toys if the gunsmith signed the receipt. He just pushed it aside and said, “Let me see the guns.”

He unzipped the cloth gun cases and opened them so that the gunsmith could see inside. A big smile crept across the gunsmith’s face, and he exclaimed, “They are so beautiful.” He admiringly picked up and looked over each of his three guns. When he had finished his expert assessment, he grabbed the receipt and scribbled his signature on it and handed it to him, and then said, “Come and see my guns.” He thought it was all going reasonably well so far, so he followed the gunsmith through the door behind the counter that led into the central part of the Quonset hut. He stopped in his tracks. There were guns as far as the eye could see, and they were all in piles as if they had just been left there by a dump truck. There had to be tens of thousands, if not millions of them. The gunsmith explained that Fiji had had its fair share of coups, and these were the guns that had been seized by the Fijian military.

The gunsmith led him through a door at the side of the Quonset hut that led out to a firing range. On the table were dozens of guns, including a 50 caliber machine gun on a tripod. The gunsmith kept handing him weapons to try and was pretty impressed with his marksmanship. The gunsmith pointed at the 50 caliber machine gun and motioned him to have a try. He had never shot anything that big and hesitated. The gunsmith stood behind him and placed his hands on the handles and his thumbs on the triggers and warned him to have no more than a two-second burst. He depressed the triggers, and the gun roared to life. The firepower was incredible, and the vibration in his arms made his teeth chatter.

At the end of the firing range lesson, they walked back through the Quonset hut weaving through the piles of confiscated guns. The gunsmith assured him that he would take good care of his guns. He knew he would. He told the customs officer and the police officer that he would be checking-out of Fiji from Musket Cove on Malolo Lai Lai Island as part of the Musket Cove, Vanuatu race on September 12 and asked if the guns could be brought by customs to the official race check-out point at Musket Cove. The customs officer wrote down some notes and the date and assured him that the guns would be given back to him at check-out in Musket Cove.

He thanked the gunsmith and left with the police officer and the customs officer with the signed receipt in hand. What he thought was going to be a scene from Midnight Express turned into a pretty good day. Back at the yacht club, the customs officer issued his cruising permit, and as he departed said, “Welcome to Fiji.”

He met Donald on the yacht club dock and hitched a ride with him on Mallard back to Lone Eagle. Donald couldn’t believe his road trip story, neither could Gillian. He knew it would be another one of those events from the voyage that would be etched in his mind. He hoped that the customs guy would live up to his word and have the toys delivered to him when they checked out of Musket Cove. He knew that if he didn’t, that the choice would be to leave without them or sail back to Suva to get them, which was on the opposite end of the island from Musket Cove. He didn’t like either of those options.

The next morning they pulled the pick and took up a berth at the yacht club. It was an old facility dripping in charm from the past. It had a bar, a restaurant, showers, and a drop-off laundry. It was also right across the street from the jail, which was a rather imposing looking place with high walls topped with razor wire. The dockmaster told him that the neighborhood around the club wasn’t the best and that they should take a taxi into town.

With Lone Eagle secured, they took the dockmaster’s advice and caught a cab into downtown Suva. It was a bustling place with a huge open-air market and plenty of nearby shops selling everything imaginable. They found a bank with an ATM and withdrew Fijian dollars and then headed for the markets. Fiji had a substantial Indian population, and it was reflected in the markets. In addition to the usual fresh fruit and veg, there were also many spice vendors. They all had their cylindrical shape burlap bags with sculpted peaks of fragrant spices. It reminded him of Grenada in the Windward Islands of the Caribbean, where they too sold spices in precisely the same way.

He was standing next to one of the spice vendor stalls when an Indian lady approached. She obviously knew the spice vendor who opened a tiny paper bag a fourth of the size of a typical paper lunch bag. The Indian lady just pointed at each of the burlap bags piled high with spices, and the vendor would take a little scoop out and add it to the bag, always looking at the Indian lady that instructed her as to how much of each spice she wanted. By the time they finished, she had added spices from ten or more different bags. He asked what the mixture was and was told that it was the Indian lady’s curry mix. He told the spice vendor that he would have the same mixture as the Indian lady. It smelled intoxicating.

He found Gillian in the butcher section and told her about his find with the spice lady. She couldn’t get over how aromatic the spice mixture was and pointed to some fresh lamb. It was going to be curry night, and with the provisions that Gillian had already purchased, they headed out to the main street to catch a cab back to the yacht club when they ran into Donald and June. On the cab ride back to the yacht club, Donald said that he had called the marina at Vuda Point and that their berths and haul out dates were confirmed.

Donald wanted to spend another day in Suva and said he would then be ready to head to Vuda Point. That suited him as it was time for another oil change, and he needed to pickle the watermaker as he knew the water wouldn’t be clean enough to run it in either Suva or Vuda Point. They agreed that they would leave at first light the following day. Donald said he had done the nav and that it would take the better part of the day to get there.

Curry night was fabulous. They both agreed that it was the best tasting curry that either of them had ever had. “Cap, how long do you think we’ll be hauled out at Vuda Point?”

“We’re booked-in for the marina on August 1st, and our haul-out date is the 4th. I figure probably two weeks on the hard. We’ll do the bottom job, but I want to see if they’ll give me a quote to paint the sheer strip. It’s badly faded, and everything I’ve used to try to polish it hasn’t worked. Labor is pretty cheap here, so maybe we can get it done while we’re doing the bottom job.”

“I hate being on the hard and having to climb up a ladder ten times a day. The dirt will be terrible. I guess I’ll dig out our work clothes and get some tarps out,” she said.

The next day was spent with the oil change and pickling the watermaker. When that was done, it was time to do the nav. Vuda Point was on the other end of the island. They planned to sail out of Suva and around the bottom of Vita Lavu via the Mbngga Passage that was inside Mbngga Reef and then through Navula Passage that led to a channel that would take them to Vuda Point.

Donald took the lead on their way out of Suva. The run out to open water was via their trackback route, which made it easy. Once in open water, he took up a heading of 230° that would take them to his first waypoint at the entrance to Mbngga Passage. The pass was big enough for coastal freighters but small enough that you could get in trouble if you weren’t careful as the sides were all jagged coral. There was enough water, but the marks weren’t easy to see, and he had to stop a few times until he found the leadlights that guided them through each twist and turn of the pass.

On clearing the pass, he headed for his next waypoint that would mark the beginning of a straight run across the bottom of Vita Lavu. They cleared three more waypoints by lunch as they reached the waypoint at the entrance to Navula Passage. The chart showed that the reef on the west side experienced large breaking swells, and today was no exception. Shooting the pass was much like the one at Huahine. You could feel the swells lifting you and watch them breaking on either side of you. He always found passes with breaking waves to be unsettling.

Once inside the pass, it was a straight run down the channel to his next waypoint just off the entrance to the narrow pass that would take them into the Vuda Point Marina. They were coming up on it when Donald called on the VHF. They were in, but he said that the pass was difficult to see until you were almost on top of it.

He stopped at the waypoint and went up in the ratlines with the binoculars. He could see the masts of other boats in the harbor, but the marks at the entrance to the pass took a lot longer to find. They turned out to be just wooden stakes on either side of the opening. Having found them, he motored up to them slowly. He could see a straight line of darker blue water that would take them between two break walls that were further in. The pass had been cut through the coral reef and was wide enough to accommodate only one boat. He had a couple of feet clearance on either side, but at least there was plenty of water under the keel.

Once through the pass, the harbor opened up. It was circular and had concrete walls. It was a med/moor docking arrangement which was difficult with a double-ender like Lone Eagle. The only way in was bow first, so he dropped the stern pick and nosed his way in until the bowsprit was a foot from the concrete wall. Gillian had already deployed three fenders on each side. Donald was there to help them with their lines and guided him in the last few feet. There were 20 boats all med/moored to the concrete wall. It was easier for them as they could bring their sterns in and set a plank to get them ashore. For Lone Eagle, it meant climbing off the end of the bowsprit. It would be fine for a couple of days.

He plugged into shore power and went below to throw the mast breaker. Just as he flicked the switch, he saw that the amber reverse polarity light was lit, but it was too late. There was a loud pop, and then smoke started to pour out of the engine compartment. He knew that the battery charger had blown as he reached for a fire extinguisher. With the fire extinguisher at the ready, he opened the engine room hatch and saw the scorched battery charger. There was another CaChing. What was worse is that he knew that when they were out of the water that they would have to rely on the solar panels and wind generator to keep the fridge running. Time to look for someplace to buy a new battery charger.

With Lone Eagle tied-off and the smoke clearing, June came aboard to catch up with Gillian, and he and Donald went for a walk over to the shipyard side of the marina while he lamented his fried battery charger. They stopped in at the yard office and were pleased to see that it was well stocked with tins of bottom paint and everything else that was needed to do a bottom job. The yard foreman confirmed that they would be lifted in the morning and showed them where their boats would be put on hardstands. They headed over to the 100-ton travel lift and saw that the lifting straps were a bit rough, but they both had scraps of carpet that would protect their hulls. As they walked through the shipyard, they found the area where they buried boats. There were several boats in pits and numerous pits without any that were lined with tires. In the next four months, they would fill the remaining holes in advance of cyclone season that started on December 1st. He knew he wanted to be out of the Pacific by the end of October, as it wasn’t unusual for a cyclone to develop before the official start of cyclone season.

As they were walking back to their boats, they could see a large sailboat coming into the circular harbor. It topped 90,’ and they both wondered how the skipper was going to med/moor it. Just as they spoke the words, the yacht came to a jarring stop with several crew members thrown forward. They had run hard aground right in the middle of the circular harbor. Donald thought she must have a deep keel – probably close to ten feet.

The skipper tried to back her off, but he wasn’t having any luck despite repeated attempts. As it was a little circular harbor, the grounding of the big yacht and the efforts to back her off drew quite an audience. Everyone med/moored to the dock was watching the show. Donald looked at his watch and said, “The tide won’t be low for three more hours, and they might not be able to get her off even at high tide.”

Back at Lone Eagle with her bow facing inward, they had ringside seats in the cockpit to watch the show on the big yacht. A woman that was aboard climbed out of the cockpit in her bikini and took up a sun lounge on the cabin top. She knew she had an audience and did her best to look unfazed by the grounding. Donald was right; the tide was running out, and as it did, the angle of heel on the big boat increased and kept increasing. Undaunted, the woman on the sun lounge kept getting up and moving it to minimize the angle of heel. On her last attempt, the sun lounge slid off the cabin top and almost went over the side. It was all they and everyone else in the harbor could do not to laugh. The woman had tried to retain her composure but finally retreated to the cabin below.

By the time they came back from the showers for their sundowners, the big yacht was listing further to the point that it was dangerously close to having one rail go under. Any further, and they would be taking on water, and he knew that spelled disaster. The captain and crew used their dink that was worth more than Lone Eagle to ferry halyards ashore to try and keep the boat from listing further. Once the halyards were tied to the concrete wharf on the opposite side of the harbor, the skipper had the crew winch in the lines on the mast winches. It was a gamble, and an act of desperation as the strain on the mast would be enormous. The skipper didn’t have any choice. He had to keep her from flooding.

On their way to the showers, they found a little restaurant next to the marina that had a gate to it from the shipyard. They stopped in and saw that pizza was on the menu; he was in heaven. After their sundowners, they headed over and had pizza and beer. He knew that they would be eating there in the nights ahead as living on the hard was bad enough, but trying to cook in the galley wouldn’t be Gillian’s idea of fun.

The next morning the lift operator guy dropped by to have a look at Lone Eagle and to tell him that he would be the first lift of the day. His name was Marcus, and he had been the lift operator at the marina for 20 years. Marcus headed back to the travel lift, and they made preparations to get underway. Donald had come over to help them with their lines and said that he would be lifted right after Lone Eagle.

He backed Lone Eagle out slowly while Gillian took in the stern anchor line. Once it was vertical, he began winching in the last of the line. He hoped it hadn’t buried as bad as it did in Hiva Oa. That had been a nightmare, but this time it easily broke free of the sand bottom. With the stern anchor stowed, he headed for the travel lift. Marcus was waiting for him and already had the slings submerged. He inched his way in, and Donald held Lone Eagle in place with a boat hook while Marcus started the lift. With the slings firmly in place, they tied a line between them to stop them from slipping and put the scraps of carpet in place to protect the hull. Marcus increased the lift until Lone Eagle’s deck was flush with the travel lift deck, and they both stepped off and moved away to watch the lift.

The last time that Lone Eagle had a bottom job was in Fort Washington. That was two years ago, and he was hoping that she would be in reasonable shape. The gooseneck barnacles hadn’t helped. As she cleared the water, he could see that there was a fair bit of slime but few barnacles. The freshwater in the Rio Dulce must have killed off the saltwater growth.

Marcus maneuvered the travel lift to the pressure wash area, and he began the high-pressure blasting process. It took about an hour, and when he had finished the blasting, Marcus returned and maneuvered Lone Eagle to a spot where she was lowered onto large blocks, and the yard crew put in place the hardstands. With Lone Eagle now supported, Marcus backed the travel lift out and away.

He began the inspection process of Lone Eagle’s hull, and it wasn’t long before he started to see a lot of osmotic blisters. They were common to all fiberglass boats, and Lone Eagle was no exception. They were formed when saltwater penetrated the barrier coat and the gel coat and got into the fiberglass. When that happened, the saltwater would react with the chemicals in the fiberglass and would cause an acidic gas to form under the gell coat that would create the blister.

He used an ice pick to prick the blisters and could see acidic liquid squirting out. While not a safety issue, they still needed to be fixed. It wasn’t going to be just a bottom job. He was going to have to grind out each blister and fill it with a mix of epoxy resin and chopped fiberglass cloth. Then they all had to be sanded flush, sealed with another coat of epoxy and then two coats of barrier coat paint and then two more of anti-foul paint. It was going to be a big job.

He went into the yard manager’s office to get some of the yard workers started on sanding off all of the old anti-foul paint so that only the barrier coat was remaining. Then it would be his turn to start the grinding and filling process. Thankfully, the shipyard stocked everything he would need to do it. He had some of what he needed on board, but the rest he had to buy, and it wasn’t cheap. He dropped three hundred dollars and walked out with armloads of supplies, and this was only day one.

Back at the boat, they had to strip off all of the canvas that was easily removed and cover the rest tightly in blue tarps. He knew that the anti-foul sanding dust that the yard crew was about to create would go everywhere. Gillian had closed all the hatches and portholes to keep the dust out of the cabin, but what that did was make inside stiflingly hot. You couldn’t be in there, and running the AC wasn’t an option because it would just suck in the dust. Later, when the dust cleared, running the AC would be their only savior.

It was after lunch when the yard crew showed up and started sanding off the old bottom paint. There were two guys per side, and they generated enormous clouds of toxic red anti-foul dust, and they weren't even wearing any protective masks. He remembered that in the States, the hull would have been tented, everyone would be wearing a powered respirator, and all the dust would have been vacuumed up. Not here, and he knew that when the yard crew was finished, that he would have to give the boat a thorough washdown.

It took two full weeks to complete all of the work. He had spent the first week grinding and filling the osmotic blisters. Then he applied two coats of barrier coat and then two coats of bottom paint. He got the yard to do the sheer stripe, which they were able to spray. It took him a full day just to mask and paper the boat to protect from overspray from the sheer stripe spraying, but the finished product was excellent. He was even able to get new lettering for the stern FedEx-ed in from the States. Lone Eagle was looking the best he had ever seen her.

By the time Marcus lowered her back in, they were both exhausted. It had been two weeks of life on the hard, and Gillian had been incredible. By the time Marcus had Lone Eagle back in the water, Gillian had already cleaned every inch of her. Once he cleared the travel lift slings, it was 0900, and they had plenty of time for the 20nm run to Musket Cove. They had timed it perfectly to arrive a week before the start of race week. They were looking forward to some fun.

He motored Lone Eagle slowly across the circular harbor and lined up on the breakwall pass that would lead them out into deeper water. As he started their run between the break walls, they both were in the cockpit, and they both saw a giant cockroach take flight off the breakwall and land on the deck. He gave Gillian the tiller and ran forward with a flipflop and was able to flatten the pesky creature. They were the bane of all cruisers, and he and Gillian had all kinds of procedures that they used to keep them off the boat. This guy timed his flight perfectly and made an excellent landing but died on arrival. Back in the cockpit, he took up a heading for Musket Cove.





CHAPTER LXVII August 18, 2003 - Musket Cove



Malolo Lai Lai Island, Fiji

Lat: 17° 47’ 45.00” S, Long: 177° 12’ 12.12” W

They motored out of Vuda Point and then followed their trackback waypoints for the new waypoint that he had entered that marked the turn into Musket Cove. Musket Cove was part of the Mamamuca Island group, which was to the southwest of Nandi, which has an international airport and ferries that run there daily.

The guide said that Musket Cove on Malolo Lai Lai Island was a yachtie-friendly resort that hosted the annual Musket Cove to Vanuatu race every September. It said that in the 1800s, an American by the name of John Armstrong purchased Malolo Lai Lai Island from a Fijian island chief for one musket.

As he throttled up for the 20nm run, he took Lone Eagle up to cruising RPMs and watched the knot meter and chart plotter and saw that they were making 6.5 knots. It was nice to have a clean bottom, which he hoped would stay that way long after they reached Australia. It was a perfect day with the wind out of the northeast, so with the Genny out, they were making 7.5 knots. Out of the dirty, dusty shipyard with a clean bottom and a pleasant breeze and he was in heaven.

He made the turn at the Musket Cove entrance and followed his waypoints into the harbor. It was a great spot, protected on all sides. There were 20 boats at anchor, but the guide said that the number would swell to over 200 during race week. There was a marina that looked quite full and a number of overwater bungalows and the beach resort. They had the pick down in no time and got Big Dink launched. They had unpickled the watermaker and made water on the way over, and the harbor had a good tidal flow, so making water wouldn’t be a problem.

He raised Donald on the VHF. Just Ducky had just cleared the travel lift slings, and they were on their way. He confirmed with Donald that all the waypoints were fine. Donald suggested that they meet up for sundowners and dinner ashore, which he thought was a great idea. They had all been living on the hard for two weeks, and it was going to be great to go ashore and not be ankle-deep in mud.

They took Big Dink into the marina and found a perfect dinghy dock that had room for dozens of dinghies. It was purpose-built and paralleled a spit of sand that connected the main island to two small islands that extended out into the bay. The smaller of the two islands had a beautiful Tiki Bar that was surrounded by a beach, barbeque grills, and palm trees. Idyllic would be an understatement to describe it.

They made their way down the sand spit and came to a building that turned out to be a grocery store. It had everything that they would need and had a fresh fish and meat section that made his mouth water. After a quick look, they headed for the dockmaster’s office, where they received a warm Fijian welcome. The Musket Cove Yacht Club was famous throughout the Pacific. Life membership cost one dollar, and you got a membership card and the name of your yacht and the name of the captain carved on a plank that would be placed at the bar.

They had a wander through the facilities. Musket Cove had everything a cruiser could want, including showers, laundry, workshop, ATM, liquor and grocery stores, and a swimming pool that looked out over the lagoon. They headed back toward the dinghy dock and stopped in at the Tiki Bar for a cold one. The Tiki Bar was known as the three-dollar bar as all the drinks were three dollars. The bartender told them that the place had evening entertainment and that anyone could use the barbeque grills and that for one dollar, you would get a plate, silverware, and barbeque implements, and for two dollars a salad. The bartender told them that they could bring their own fish or meat to barbeque, or they could buy some at the grocery store. They knew they wouldn’t be cooking aboard very often in this anchorage, and Gillian was over the moon with that idea. They had traveled thousands of miles and had never encountered a place that catered to the cruising sailor, as much as Musket Cove did. It was a sailor’s paradise.

After a couple of beers, they headed back to Lone Eagle. She looked, Bristol. The newly painted sheer stipe certainly made a big difference in her appearance. They tied-off Big Dink and agreed that they would rig for comfort. There was a great breeze through the harbor, so they opened up all the hatches and portholes, hoisted the wind scoop for the forward hatch, strung the sun awning over the foredeck and set up the camping chairs. It was great to get air flowing through the boat after spending two weeks closed up with the AC running.

The next project was to launch Baby Dink. He was looking forward to sailing her in the lagoon amongst all the visiting yachts. It took a while to get her ready and to stow all the safety gear, but she certainly looked stunning on her painter behind Lone Eagle. As he watched Baby Dink settle in behind Lone Eagle, he could see lots of activity in the anchorage. The ferry from Nandi had just dropped off a contingent of tourists, and that floating dock that he saw off to their port side turned out to be the drop-off point for the seaplanes that were coming into the resort. The place was abuzz with activity, and at least five more boats had come in since they went ashore.

They had just finished rigging for comfort when Just Ducky entered the lagoon and came alongside. Donald and June were thrilled to be out of the shipyard, and Just Ducky was in great shape. She was a steel boat, so in addition to getting a bottom job, Donald and June spent days grinding rust spots and then priming and painting them. They agreed to meet up at 1700 at the Tiki Bar. As they were pulling away to anchor, he called to Donald, “You’re going to love this place.” Donald had said to him many times that he was so disappointed with almost all of the marinas they had visited on their circumnavigation. Few catered to cruisers, and most were too expensive, with most of the cruisers choosing to anchor out and not patronize them. Here was a different story. The management did everything to make cruisers welcome. He knew they were going to enjoy their time there.

It was time to go ashore and meet up with Donald and June. Before they left, he lit the anchor light and hung it from the forestay. When they got to the dinghy dock, Donald and June had just pulled in themselves. The girls headed into the store on a mission to find some steaks for the barbeque grills. He and Donald headed for the Tiki Bar. Donald told him that some friends of theirs from Sydney would be arriving in the morning. Donald said that he had known Carol and Henry for years and that they were good fun and that they would all be participating in the race week activities.

As the sun went down, the Tiki Bar came to life. Torches were lit, and a steel drum band played while the local girls danced. Pitchers of beer were lined up, and the steaks were on the barbeque as they sat at a picnic table under the palms. It had been a tough few weeks for all of them, and Musket Cove was the respite they needed.

When it was time to head back, they climbed into their dinghies. At the entrance to the lagoon, he heard Donald say to June, “Which one’s ours?” The lagoon was lit with the mast lights of more than 30 boats, and Donald was having trouble figuring out which one was Just Ducky. He didn’t have the same problem. The anchor light on Lone Eagle was easy to spot. Over the coming days, other cruisers had similar problems and could be seen very drunk motoring along in their dinghies looking for their boats. One even told him that he hoisted a small battery-operated strobe light so that they could find their boat.

Back aboard Lone Eagle, they enjoyed a nightcap in the cockpit.

“Cap, June told me that there are some beautiful shells on the beach that you can see at low tide. How about we go for a beach walk in the morning. I want to add some new shells to our collection.”

“Low tide is at 1000, so that would be perfect. Let's turn in and sleep late. I am looking forward to coffee in the cockpit and not having to do any work on the boat.”

The wind scoop on the foredeck was pumping a cool breeze through the cabin. “I really like Musket Cove. How long can we stay?” she asked.

“I think we can stay until race day when all the boats check-out. They’ll have customs officers here to clear-out all the boats, and we need to be part of the group. Otherwise, we would have to go into the customs office in Nandi to pick up the toys.”

“That’s plenty of time for us to have fun here. I wouldn’t want to have to sail back to Nandi when customs can bring the toys here, and we can then leave straight to New Caledonia.”

“I need to talk to the dockmaster tomorrow and explain the arrangement I have with customs for the return of the toys. I’m sure he’ll be speaking with the Nandi customs office and can ask whether the toys have been transferred from the Armory.”

The next morning he caught up on emails to let everyone know that they were now in Musket Cove. He received an email from his cousin. She and her partner wouldn’t be able to come to Musket Cove, which he expected. Good, he thought. It would have been hard, especially if they wanted to stay aboard.

He refilled his mug and joined Gillian in the cockpit. She had the binoculars out and was trying to get a count of how many boats had Monitor wind vanes. They had all probably been her customers, and she was great with people and boat names. She had run into quite a few of them on the passage and loved dropping in on them. They were all quite surprised to meet her in so many faraway places.

It was low tide, so they grabbed their reef shoes and headed in for their beach walk. Gillian found some unusual shells for her collection. He asked one of the locals about fishing in the lagoon and was told that he had to go outside the pass, but that there were plenty of grouper along the fringing reef. He filed that one away knowing that he would try his hand if race week wasn’t too busy.

He went into the dockmaster’s office and explained about the toys. The dockmaster said he was going to be speaking to the Nandi customs office later that day and would make sure that if the toys were not already there that he would ask that they be transferred to the Nandi office. As he was leaving the dockmaster’s office, he saw the race week events calendar where you could put your name down as available crew and would be assigned to one of the boats that would be taking part in the activities. There was a boat-to-boat water balloon fight and an island treasure hunt. After the events, there was a beach party and barbeque at the Tiki Bar. He put both their names on the list and saw that Donald and June had already done the same.

They walked over to the resort side of the island and took a swim in the pool that overlooked the lagoon, and could see more sailboats coming in. They were having a drink at the pool-side bar when the couple sitting at the bar next to them asked if they were off one of the sailboats. The couple, Steve and Margaret, were newlyweds from New Zealand and were fascinated with the cruising lifestyle. Steve thought it would be terrifying to be hundreds of miles offshore and be caught in a storm. Steve asked them about their man overboard drill and how often they practiced it and was shocked when he simply raised his hand and waived as if to say goodbye. He had to explain that they relied on their harnesses and jack lines, and with Monitor, the main and Genny all prevented that, it wasn’t simply a matter of just turning around to pick up the person who had fallen overboard.

Back at Lone Eagle, Gillian headed for a camping chair under the sun awning while he took Baby Dink for a spin around the lagoon. He loved sailing Baby Dink among all the anchored boats that were from all over the world. He was surprised that he didn’t recognize any of their names as there were many boats on the net that said that they would be coming for the race. He knew that many more would be coming and hoped that they would catch up with some of the people that they had met along the way. It was just like that when you were cruising. People that you made friends with just might turn up somewhere down the line.

All the cruisers would wave as he sailed Baby Dink by them. There were several American boats, mostly from California, that had come via Hawaii and planned to stop at the Great Barrier Reef before slogging their way back to California. He didn’t envy them knowing that a northern Pacific route home could be a very rough ride.

Right along the anchorage was the landing zone for the seaplanes. They were coming every half hour, and everyone was busily getting ready for race week that officially started the next day. He made sure to keep Baby Dink out of their landing zone.

Gillian was sitting under the sun awning on the foredeck when he returned. He tied up Baby Dink and went below. He was looking for the canvas bag that contained the signal flags that Tudi had given him. She said that Gus always flew them on special occasions, and this would be one of them. They were cloth and beautifully sewn and had the wood toggles that would let you arrange them to send messages the old fashion way. He found the bag and would hoist them in the morning. He also pulled out the bag with all of the country courtesy flags for all the countries they had visited. He would hoist them too on the port spreader below the Norwegian and Union Jack flags. A new US Ensign with the 13 stars and anchor along with the Conk Republic flag that Phil gave him in Marathon would also go up in the morning.

The foredeck camping chairs were a great spot to watch all of the activity in the lagoon. He estimated that there were now at least one hundred boats in the anchorage. There was certainly a buzz, especially with the scheduled events that were about to begin in the morning. Inflatables were zipping all through the anchorage. Gillian said that she had seen that Donald had picked up Carol and Henry and brought them back to Just Ducky. They all planned to meet up at the Tiki Bar at 1800.

By the time they arrived at the Tiki Bar, the cruisers were three deep at the bar. Thankfully, Donald had gotten in early with June, Henry, and Carol and had laid claim to a picnic table and barbeque. The place was packed, and the three-dollar bar was doing a brisk business.

Carol and Henry were from Sydney, and Donald and June had known them for years. It was the first time that they had seen each other since Just Ducky’s Sydney departure party two years earlier. Donald and June had some incredible stories of their run over the top end of Australia, their passage across the Indian Ocean, their stop at Cape Town, and their run across the Atlantic to Venezuela. It was the first time that he had heard about some of those adventures.

It was a delight to walk amongst all the cruisers sitting at picnic tables around the Tiki Bar. There were all kinds of languages spoken, and the laughter increased as the evening wore on, and the alcohol continued to flow. The resort put on an unbelievable fire dance with twenty young women in native costume. Their hula-like dance moves were intoxicating, and the steel drum band pumped out a beat that had all the women on their feet.

It was 2400 when the party broke up and everyone headed for their dinghies in quite an inebriated state. It was hysterical to watch with drunken sailors falling overboard and others going for noisy midnight swims off the Tiki Bar beach. And then there were all the dinghy operators trying to figure out which boat in the lagoon was theirs.

Back on Lone Eagle, they had a nightcap and watched the antics of all the drunken dinghy operators cruising amongst the anchored boats looking for their boats hearing them exclaim, “I think it's over there,” and “No it isn’t, we were just over there,” echoing through the lagoon. He knew there were going to be a lot of sore heads in the morning for the water balloon regatta that started at 1000.

The next morning he raised all the signal flags and apparently started a trend with many of the other boats following his lead. It was a beautiful sight to see all the boats and all the flags going up. The harbor and the shore were ablaze in colorful flags.

They finished breakfast and headed in to shore to find out their boat assignments. He looked down the list, and they were assigned to Trident, a boat from the UK that was part of the Red Team. Donald and his crew had been assigned to Kestrel, a South African boat that was part of the Blue Team. He found Malcolm the skipper of Trident. When all of the crew had been rounded up, they boarded Malcolm’s dinghy for the run out to Trident. It took Malcolm three trips to collect everyone.

Once aboard Trident, the crew was divided into those assigned to filling water balloons and those assigned to rigging surgical tube slingshots from every available piece of rigging aboard Trident. When the signal gun sounded, it meant that each team consisting of 20 boats per team would take up positions on opposite ends of the harbor. When both teams had all of their boats assembled, a second signal gun started the water balloon fight.

The boats of each team in single file sailed toward and passed abeam of the opposing team. As each came in range, the water balloons were launched and rained down on the rival team boats. It was hysterical to watch because everyone was either ducking or firing water balloons.

He was keeping his eye out for Kestrel as he intended to see if he could get a shot off at Donald. He knew Donald would be thinking the same. It wasn’t long before Kestrel came abeam of them, and he could see Donald aiming right for him. He did likewise and launched his first one, which missed, but his second one was perfect. It hit Donald just as he was reloading. Bragging rights for tonight’s dinner were his.

The next event was the treasure hunt. The resort had selected one of the small islands in the lagoon, and all of the boats were instructed to anchor off the island and man their dinghies. When the starting gun went off, all the dinghies roared over to the island, and their crews set off to follow the clues they had been given to find the buried treasure. It was a mad scramble. One of the Red Team boats was the first to find it and were thrilled to see that it was a small treasure chest filled with bottles of rum.

The race committee had done a fantastic job organizing the two events. The cruisers just loved it and were instructed to come to the Tiki Bar at 1800 for a beach party and the awards ceremony. There had to be 300 people at the beach party. It was almost their last night in Musket Cove, and they would certainly miss the place as they both agreed it was their best stop on the entire voyage. He thought that maybe someday that they would return for another race week and see Lone Eagle’s name carved on a plank at the bar. The party went well into the night, but they knew they had a six-day run ahead of them and were back aboard by 2300.

Even though they wouldn’t be in the race to Vanuatu, both he and Donald attended the skippers meeting to get the latest weather forecast update. They would be clearing-out with the fleet that was scheduled to begin at 0800 the next morning and would leave just after the start of the race when the fleet cleared out of the lagoon.

The forecast showed that the first couple of days out would be fine, but that a front was expected. The run to Isle of Pines in New Caledonia would take six days, and a front mid-way through the passage wasn’t what they wanted, but they knew the forecast could change. They agreed that they were going to go because of the customs arrangement and because there wasn’t any point in hanging around waiting for a perfect weather window.

Back aboard Lone Eagle, they set about the process of getting ready to go to sea. They made a final provisioning and ice run and then put Baby Dink to bed. He would need Big Dink to head in for the last night race festivities and in the morning for clear-out. Then she would be broken down and stowed before they got underway. With the race starting at 1200, he figured they would be underway by 1230.

The next morning he was standing in line with all the other cruisers at 0800 with the ships' papers and passports. He had his fingers crossed that the toys had been transferred to Nandi from Suva, but knew if they hadn’t that he would have to leave without them. Sailing back around the island to Suva just wasn’t an option.

As the line progressed and he could see behind the tables where the four customs officers were sitting, he spied the two gun cases and breathed a sigh of relief. He was called by the next available customs officer and was quickly processed through and given the toys. It was interesting to see the look on the other cruiser's faces as he walked out with the gun cases.

He pulled Big Dink alongside Lone Eagle and hoisted the Yamaha onto its mount on the pulpit. It didn’t take long to get Big Dink broken down and stowed although the wash-down took a bit more elbow grease to get the slime off after two weeks in the water. The anchor chain was a whole different matter. It had a massive amount of growth on it, and he had to scrub every inch of the 150’ he had out. It took almost an hour with bucket loads of water and a scrub brush. He knew he had to do it; otherwise, the stink of it from the chain locker below would have been terrible.

Gillian had everything in the cockpit ready to go, and Donald was already underway. Lucky Donald, he thought, he had an electric anchor windlass and a high-pressure wash-down pump to deal with his anchor chain. He took the gun cases below and opened them on the bunk. All three guns had been beautifully polished and oiled. He wondered how many rounds his friend the gunsmith had fired through them and then just smiled and stowed the cases.

He throttled up Lone Eagle, and with her clean bottom, they quickly followed their trackback course and then headed to the first open water waypoint that he had plotted. They were on their way to the Isle of Pines.





CHAPTER LXVIII September 19, 2003 - Kuto Bay



Isle of Pines, New Caledonia

Lat: 22° 39’ 56.00” S, Long: 167° 26’ 41.00” W

It was 658nm to the Isle of Pines on a heading of 242°. With the wind out of the northeast, they were on a broad reach that would, in six days, put them at the southern end of Grande Terre, the main island New Caledonia. After that, it was another 830nm to Coffs Harbor. They were getting close, but there was still a lot of water yet to cover, and that front that they had seen at the skipper’s briefing wasn’t going away.

The weather was perfect, and with the clean bottom, they were running at 6.5-7 knots. Donald and June were heading to Port Moselle in Noumea. They had both seen enough islands on the way, and he knew they were both anxious to get home. He understood that they too would sail into Coffs Harbor and then make the run to Sydney. Beyond that, he had no idea what their plans were. For that matter, he had no idea what his were either.

Donald wanted to go into Port Moselle first and give Isle of Pines a miss because the guide said that all boats had to clear into Port Moselle before visiting any of the other islands of New Caledonia, and that included the Isle of Pines even though it was the first landfall they would make. He wasn’t interested in clearing-in first and then backtracking to the Isle of Pines. They were going to the Isle of Pines first, and if he had to fake a breakdown, he would.

The winds had been light for the first three days, and they had been motor sailing to keep their speed up to 5.5 knots. He wasn’t a fan of motor sailing, but he also wasn’t a fan of just sitting there waiting for the wind.

“Hey, Cap, here is the latest forecast from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). It looks like we’re going to get that front tomorrow, and they’re forecasting 40+ knots of wind and 20’ seas.”

“Not great news. I think I’m going to try the same procedure we did coming into Suva. We’ll get on the right comfortable heading, and if it blows us north of our rhumb line, that’s fine; we ‘ll just get pushed back to it when the wind changes, and we tack over.”

They had been downloading forecasts from BOM and New Zealand since Fiji. Both the New Zealand and BOM forecasts were in agreement, and so were the GRIB files and Buoy Weather. They were going to get pounded tomorrow.

The next morning after a bit of sleep coming off the midnight watch, the weather faxes showed that they would soon be feeling the effects of the approaching front. He hoisted the staysail and had a look at the reef lines. He could put a reef in the staysail, but he knew it would take a bit of fancy footwork on the foredeck if it was blowing that hard. He hoped that the staysail and two reefs in the main would be enough, but his plan, if it got bad, was to just run on the staysail. He hadn’t done that before but hoped that with the staysail close to the center of effort at the mast that Lone Eagle should ride just fine.

The wind was still light, and they were still motor sailing. While the conditions were good, he put the first reef in the main. It didn’t affect their speed as the Genny at 100% was doing most of the work. As he stood on the cabin top, putting the first reef in the main, he looked to the northwest. The sky was starting to darken, and he hoped that there wouldn’t be too much rain with the frontal passage.

Back in the cockpit, he played with Monitor to get the angle to the wind and the ride just right. Gillian was below getting a batch of chili prepared and filling Thermos’ with coffee and soup. She also broke out several sets of foul weather gear. It wasn’t long before the wind started to clock around, and he knew it wouldn’t be long before it started building, so he headed up on deck and put the second reef in the main and wound in the Genny to 50%.

On the radar, at the 40-mile range, he could see squall lines headed their way. Thankfully, they were thin bands of rain, and he wasn’t seeing any thunderstorm activity which, if it arrived, would make things very sporty as with boomers, there are gusts, and he knew that it was the gusts that could get you.

By 1800 the wind had built to 35-40 knots with higher gusts, and the barometer was dropping. He had rolled-in the Genny hours earlier, and Lone Eagle was riding well, although the knot meter gave him cause for concern. They were doing 7.5 knots but were tipping 9 knots at times as they surfed down some pretty scary looking 20 footers whose crests were being blown off. They were now 15nm north of their rhumb line, and he expected that would continue until the front passed.

By 2000 he knew that he would be sleeping in the cockpit. It just took too long to drag yourself up from below, and he didn’t want Gillian on her own until he came on watch at 2400. The only problem with sleeping in the cockpit was that you were inches away from water sloshing down the deck. Lone Eagle’s design was brilliant. She had on deck drains and hawse pipes for the midship cleats right above the drains. If the slosh were too big for the drains to handle, the water would pour out of the hawse pipes. If there was even more water rushing down the deck, it would run into the point where the deck stopped at the cockpit, which had a perfect upward slope that resulted in the water firing up and off the boat in a rooster tail. The designers at Pacific Seacraft had thought it through.

As he laid there trying to get some sleep, he was repeatedly snapped to attention by the rooster tails of water being ejected off the deck just inches from his head. The interval of the seas wasn’t too bad, but with night running, it would be impossible to see any rogue green ones until they hit. He just laid there in semi-sleep and occasionally glanced at the knot meter. If they stayed in the 8s and 9s, they would be okay, but if their speed increased any more than that, he knew he would be going up on deck to pull down the last of the main.

At 2400 he was feeling less than refreshed when Gillian went below to get some sleep. He told her that he would wake her if he had to go on deck. That was their rule. If he went on deck, she had to be in the cockpit. The Mars Bar and the Diet Coke kicked-in, and he was able to focus on the chart plotter. They were now 30nm north of their rhumb line, and the radar showed that they were through the squall lines. It wouldn’t be long before the front would be through, and he would be able to tack over on a course that would intersect their rhumb line. The plan was working again.

By 0300, he could see breaks in the clouds which revealed some stars and an occasional glimpse of the waning moon. It was time to tack over. As the main and the staysail were both self-tacking, he didn’t need to wake Gillian but knew that the effect of the tack would probably wake her. His mind shifted into surfer mode, and he concentrated on the sets of waves they were encountering. The fourth in each set was the biggest with the fifth and sixth of lesser size. He waited for the next set, and when the fifth one passed, he disengaged Monitor and pushed the tiller leeward. Perfect. Lone Eagle settled on her new tack, and he re-engaged Monitor on the same angle to the wind so that the ride stayed the same.

By 0400, it was time for Gillian’s watch, and the conditions had improved. The wind was still at 30 knots but was lessening each hour. All of the cloud cover was gone, and they were tracking back to their rhumb line at 7.5 knots, so he decided to go below and get some sleep. The mattress on the cabin sole put him at the lowest point in the cabin, and he could feel Lone Eagle and every vibration and every creak. Everything was as it should be, and he was asleep before he knew it.

Gillian had given him a couple of extra hours of sleep and woke him at 0900 for the check-in call with Donald. Just Ducky was now a day ahead of them, and Donald reported perfect weather. He knew that the conditions they were having would improve throughout the day, so he went on deck and shook a reef out of the main and put Genny out at 50%. They were making 6.5 knots and were now only 10nm north of their rhumb line. By the next morning, they would arrive at the Isle of Pines. They were right on their average of 120nm per day.

The conditions improved all day and his evening watch was far better than the one the night before. They were getting better with heavy weather sailing. Little did he know that experience was going to come in handy. At 0400 the next morning, when Gillian came on watch, he checked their position. He could get a couple of hours of sleep before they arrived at the first of four waypoints that he had programmed into the chart plotter that would get them into the Isle of Pines.

Gillian woke him as they approached the first waypoint 4nm south of Nekanmue Atoll. It was barren rock, and once past it, he took up a heading of 293° for a run of 16.5nm that would bring them to a range that would get them through a pass in Nogumatiugi reef. They were on the lee side of Kuto Bay, and the big seas that remained from the front abated as they got further under the lee to a point where the pass was flat. It was a welcome sight.

Once through the pass, they entered Kuto Bay, and they were the only boat there. The bay had a half-moon shaped beach with the most brilliant white sand that he had ever seen. The water was just as spectacular, and it too had to be the clearest he had ever seen. It even had a tinge of Tiffany blue to it. They found a protected spot not too far from an old tender pier. The guide said that the pine trees were Araucaria pines and that the tops of them formed canopies. The guide also noted that the island had been home to the Melanesian people for thousands of years but that they left when the French took possession of all of New Caledonia.

They had the pick down in minutes, and Gillian just stood there looking at the water and the blazing white sandy beach. It took his eyes a while to adjust to the brightness even with his Maui Jim sunglasses.

He had the quarantined flag up, and with the pick down, he opened the engine room hatch and laid out his tools, a water pump in pieces, and some oily rags. To complete the ruse, he propped open the compression valve on the Yanmar with a small piece of wood. He had been told by one cruiser of a story about a boat that had stopped at the Isle of Pines before clearing-in at Port Moselle. The story goes that the skipper feigned a breakdown when authorities boarded him, but the customs officer wasn’t buying it and turned the key, and the motor started. He was fined on the spot. By propping the compression valve open, there was no way the Yanmar could start, so at least he had that contingency covered.

They lunched Big Dink and thought that a swim was in order. He grabbed his mask and snorkel, and they both flipped over the side. The underwater visibility was the best he had ever seen. He thought the Bahamas was the best, but this place had the most transparent water on the planet. When they dried off, he grabbed his rucksack and put the ship’s papers and their passports in it. If they got stopped ashore, he could say he was looking for the port captain’s office. He remembered the guy in Manihi that only had the Lonely Planet Guide for navigation. There were a lot of dumb sailors out there, and he figured he could act like one if he needed to.

They beached Big Dink on the half-moon beach and pulled her way up on the sand and set her pick. There wasn’t any need to lock her as there wasn’t a soul in sight. They found a dirt road that led under the canopy of pines that the guide mentioned. The trees were enormous, and the canopy stretched over the dirt road. It was like walking in a tunnel, and the shade was a welcome relief from the blazing sun.

Half a mile up the road, they found signs of civilization. There was a small store that had a basket of baguettes and fresh brie in the fridge. They loved visiting the French islands as the food alone was always worth the visit. Next door was a little French restaurant with a dozen tables. They had a look at the menu, and the waiter asked if they liked snails. They both loved French escargot and placed their orders. He had read in the guide that they cultivated the snails right on the island and that they were reputed to be some of the best in the world. They weren't disappointed, and the French wine and fresh bread made for a perfect meal.

They walked back to the bay, and there was still no sign of any boats or people, so they took a leisurely walk over to the tender dock and some of the nearby beaches. The remnants of the past were everywhere. The tender pier had to have been used during WWII as the whole of this side of the western Pacific was under Japanese control.

They had a lazy afternoon aboard Lone Eagle and caught up on some sleep. He half expected to be woken by a patrol boat, but that didn’t happen, and by the time they got up, it was getting dark. He lit the anchor light and hung it on the inner forestay. At least if anyone were coming in, they would see him.

There was no background light pollution where they were, and the stars came out so bright that it felt like you could reach out and touch them. They sat there with their sundowners and counted the shooting stars that were streaking across the night sky. It was the most peaceful anchorage that they had been in and was certainly a far cry from Musket Cove with 200 boats.

“So, Cap, what's the plan for tomorrow?”

“I think we shouldn’t push our luck with not clearing-in. I had a look at the forecast, and on the Noumea side of Grand Terre, the seas are still running 10-12’. If we were to run outside to Port Moselle, it’s going to be a rough ride with the wind almost on the nose.”

“So, should we stay and wait for the seas to die down a bit.”

“That was what I thought until I saw in the guide that there is a protected canal called Canal Woodin between Grand Terre and the island of Ile Ouen just north of here that will give us a protected passage all the way to Port Moselle. I stepped off the miles, and we wouldn’t be able to make it in one day, but if we find a nice little anchorage along the way, we can stop for the night and get in the next morning.”

“A protected run and a nice little anchorage for the night sounds perfect. We can even tow Big Dink since it will be a protected run. We might even find another place to get baguettes.”

“Great. I’ll do the nav in the morning, and we can get underway. I sure did like it here. There is nothing better than being the only boat in an anchorage.”

The next morning he sat there with the guide and the charts and plotted eleven waypoints that would get them to Port Moselle. He had put in the new western Pacific chip into the chart plotter before they left Fiji, and the coverage of Canal Woodin and the route they would take was great. There was plenty of water, so depths and reefs wouldn’t be a concern. With the waypoint plotted on the paper charts, he entered them in the chart plotter and the handheld GPS.

They were underway by 1000, and by lunch, they had passed Ile Ouen and entered Canal Woodin with the main island of Grand Terre off to starboard. Port Moselle was on the western shore of Grand Terre, which was quite barren and had rocky hillsides that were a deep red. They seemed to glow in the sunlight, and as the sun began to set, they took on a darker, almost luminescent type of red glow.

It was time to find a place to hole-up for the night. The guide said that Baie Iré, on the northwest side of Ile Ouen, offered a bit of protection. The bay was enormous and would provide protection only if the wind held out of the northeast. If it didn’t, they would have to move. They set the pick in 20’ of water, and he set the anchor drag alarm on the GPS. If the wind shifted while they were asleep, the alarm would go off because he set the alarm for only 20’ of swing. Better safe than sorry, he thought.

They were the only boat in the bay, and where they anchored was like a millpond. Over sundowners, they took in the views. It almost looked like a moonscape as there was no vegetation, and the setting sun lit up the red rocky hillsides.

The next morning the pulled the pick and resumed the run to Port Moselle. They wound their way through the remaining waypoints and made it to the harbor entrance at 1200.





CHAPTER LXIX September 23, 2003 - Port Moselle



Noumea, New Caledonia

Lat: 22° 18’ 00.00” S, Long: 166° 24’ 60.00” W

Port Moselle was a busy commercial port with the Port Du Sud Marina right in the middle of it. It was a man-made marina with a perimeter breakwall surrounding it. Just Ducky was anchored just outside of the breakwall. He planned to take a berth at the marina to take care of all the final preparations that needed to be completed before they set off on the last leg to Oz, which included replacing the battery charger that had blown in Vuda Point.

He raised the port captain to advise of their arrival and the dockmaster, who told him that they did have a berth available. It wasn’t long before they found it and had Lone Eagle tied-off. The first order of business was to get cleared-in, so he took the ship’s papers, and their passports and head for the port captain’s office where clear in was a breeze.

Back at the marina, he stopped in at the dockmaster’s office to inquire about a marine electronics store where he might find a battery charger. He was in luck; there was one just a few blocks away. Aboard Lone Eagle, Gillian was studying the guide and the map of Port Moselle. There was a huge market an easy walk from the marina, so they headed out to visit both of them.

The main electronics store was their first stop, and it was a big place catering to yachties as well as the commercial marine industry. He was in luck. They had a 240-volt battery charger, and it had about the same footprint as the old one. It wasn’t cheap, but he knew that he had to have it, especially if they were going to be spending a lot of time at a dock in Coffs Harbor. Out on the pick, the alternator, solar panels, and wind generator were enough to keep the batteries charged. At the dock, he had to have a battery charger, and the one he was looking at would do the trick. Now the fun part would be installing it.

On the way to the markets, they passed what looked like a street dance of close to one hundred locals, all dressed in traditional grass skirt costumes. They appeared to be chanting, singing, and dancing. They later learned to their surprise that it was a protest march of some sort, but they managed to get around the large crowd and enter the markets. They had been in a lot of markets, but this one was by far the best, and the French food vendors had everything that they wanted.

Back aboard Lone Eagle, he opened the engine room hatch to begin the install of the new battery charger. The old one was cooked with black soot all over it. He hated electrical projects as he hadn’t had any training, but always seemed to muddle his way through. He removed the cover, and the wiring connections were all intact. What was fried was the circuit board. After disconnecting the old one and marking the wires, he read the installation instructions for the new one. As he was reading them, he heard Donald call out from above. Thank God, he thought. Donald knows this stuff backward and forwards. It wasn’t long before they had it connected and up and running. The battery charger problem was solved.

He was heading back from the dumpster where he had tossed the old battery charger when he saw an old man sitting on a finger pontoon fiddling with the rig on a strange-looking boat. It looked like a cross between a kayak and a submarine. It had two masts set up like a yawl with a tiny cockpit just forward of the aft mast. The forward mast was flying a small Swedish flag. He said hello and asked what the man was doing. His name was Phillip, and his boat was Peter Pan. Phillip was 82 and said he had been sailing and living aboard Peter Pan for the last ten years and had sailed her from Sweden. He couldn’t believe it. He thought Peter Pan would be a lake sailor – not a bluewater boat.

Phillip enjoyed his interest and took him for a tour. Topside, all the rigging was in miniature with tiny blocks and shackles and sheet lines that looked like clotheslines. The cockpit was snug and just big enough for one person, and you had to be sitting kayak-style to operate the boat. All the blocks, fairleads, and jam cleats were miniature. He couldn’t believe that 82-year-old Phillip could live like this, much less sail across oceans. Below deck, it got even stranger. You had to crouch to get in, and once below, you were on your hands and knees. It felt like a coffin, but Phillip was proud of her. He had a bunk, a tiny galley with a little camping stove, and a small nav station. Everything was in miniature, even the galley sink.

Back on the dock, he thanked Phillip for the tour. Phillip said his next stop was Darwin – a 2,000+nm run. He wished him well and headed back to Lone Eagle. He still couldn’t believe how Phillip lived. He had been living aboard Lone Eagle for two years and thought that was hard. He couldn’t imagine how Phillip, at 82, could do it in such a tiny boat. He got claustrophobic thinking about it.

That afternoon they had Donald and June aboard for dinner. While the girls were below, he and Donald talked about the next leg to Coffs Harbor. Donald said that they needed a good weather window, but as with all long runs, they both knew that once you were out there that you got what you got and just had to deal with it.

“Rob, I’ve got something that I want to say to you.” There was a long pause as Donald gathered his words. “You and Gillian have done a great job sailing Lone Eagle, but you are about to sail into the Tasman and Coral seas, and they are the most dangerous stretches of water on the planet. You guys need to be very careful.”

“I know. I’ve heard stories of how bad it can get. If we have to heave-to or deploy the sea anchor, it won’t be fun, but I think we can do it. Lone Eagle is a solid boat, and we may just have to button her up and wait it out a blow.”

“Double-check your safety gear and the rig before you get underway. We’ll keep our 0700 and 1900 radio schedule.”

Donald’s words stuck with him. Donald was the best sailor he had ever known, and a warning like that wasn’t to be taken lightly. They would get what they got, but that also meant that he had to be ready for whatever mother nature threw at them.

The next couple of days were a blur, with Gillian spending her time downloading weather faxes and sprucing up the boat. She had oiled all of the teak in the cabin and then went topside to start polishing the stainless steel. She wanted Lone Eagle to look her best for Tudi and Debbie. His days were filled with reading weather faxes and conferring with Donald about the fronts that were marching across the Pacific. It was going to be an eight-day run, and it seemed that a front would be passing every five days. He wasn’t liking the pattern that he was seeing.

He also spent time catching up on emails. He gave Tudi and Debbie an update on their ETA and emailed his cousin, Tina, in Urunga to provide her with their ETA and ask for her help in getting friends and family to the dock for their arrival.

The next few days were spent waiting for a weather window. On the 5th of October, they thought that they had found one that would give them at least five days of clear sailing. There were two large stationary high-pressure systems over Australia. If they held, it would be a good run. He and Donald agreed that they would have to take their chances. They were going. The next morning the girls made a final provision run, and he and Donald went to check-out. They were underway by 1200 and headed out into the Coral Sea.





CHAPTER LXX October 6, 2003 - The run to Oz



Noumea, New Caledonia

Lat: 22° 18’ 00.00” S, Long: 166° 24’ 60.00” W

They had northeast winds of 15 knots and had up the full main and Genny and took up a heading of 235° that would take them the 830nm to Coffs Harbor. Over the next few days, they averaged 120nm per day. The cruising routine again came quickly to them. Gillian had gotten Lone Eagle looking great and was downloading the forecast twice a day. The large high-pressure system over Australia was holding, and the northeast wind kept their speed up. Since Donald was also heading to Coffs Harbor to meet up with some old sailing buddies that he and June hadn’t seen in two years, he knew it was going to be a good party when they arrived.

On the 10th of October, they were 300nm northeast of Coffs Harbor. It was 0700, and he raised Donald on the HF radio. Donald was now more than a day ahead of them. They were getting close, and the excitement was building. Gillian had downloaded the midnight forecast, and it showed that the northeast wind was going to continue to push them to Coffs Harbor.

Donald asked if he had downloaded the 0200 forecast. He said he hadn’t and asked Donald if it had changed. Donald told him to download the 0200 forecast and call him back in fifteen minutes. He didn't like the sound of Donald’s voice. He downloaded the forecast. It had changed, and it wasn’t good. A front from the south was making its way up the Australian east coast and was expected to reach their position by evening. It was one of those infamous Southerly Busters that he had heard about, and it was packing 45+ knots of wind and 20-30’ seas. Southerly Busters were large, powerful cold fronts from the Antarctic that pushed northward against prevailing high systems over Australia. In advance of the front, you had hot northerly winds. When those winds encountered the colder southerly winds, the temperature gradient, and with it, the winds could be enormous.

That feeling of trepidation and foreboding crept over him as he raised Donald on the HF radio.

“I’ve downloaded the 0200 forecast; it isn’t looking good,” he said.

“No, it isn’t. We’re diverting for Brisbane. We suggest that you do the same; we’ll make it, but you won’t.”

Donald’s words hung in the air. Gillian heard them, and she looked worried.

“Donald, I’m going to recompute a course for Brisbane. I figure the front will arrive at our position at 1800. It isn’t going to be a pleasant evening.”

“Time for you guys to batten down the hatches. Let's talk again at 1900 to see what kind of conditions you’re getting. We’ll be in the Brisbane River by 1300. Good luck.”

Gillian spent all morning below securing everything and filling Thermos’ and making sandwiches. He had done the nav for Brisbane, and adjusted Monitor for the westward heading of 268°. They were now 240nm east of Brisbane. If they continued at their present rate of speed, they would be just under 200nm off the coast when the front arrived. There was no way to calculate their ETA.

In looking at the guide and the chart, he had set a waypoint just off the entrance to North East Channel that was the main Brisbane shipping channel that was just to the west of Morton Island. He had to stay far enough off the northern tip of Morton Island as there were several shoals and reefs that they would have to get around. The shipping channel ran southward through Morton Bay to the entrance to the Brisbane River, and Morton Bay was very shallow. He had no idea when they would arrive, but knew it could be in the middle of the night, and he hated night landings.

Gillian downloaded the noon forecast and confirmed that the front would arrive at approximately 1800. The steady northeasterly that they had been enjoying dropped off to 10 knots, and he fired up the engine to motor sail as fast as they could toward Brisbane. The more miles that they could put behind them meant less hard miles in front of them when the front arrived. It was a race against time, and one he knew he would lose.

At 1400 the wind was holding at 10 knots. He knew it would start clocking around to the north and then northwest as the front approached. He scanned the horizon to the south and froze. What he saw was a thin black line right where the sea met the sky. It looked like someone had taken a black marker and drew a line right across the horizon. It was a black wall of clouds that was the leading edge of the Southerly Buster. As the afternoon wore on, the line thickened and inched upward into the sky. It was now a wall, and it was getting bigger and higher by the hour. It looked ominous.

By 1600 the wind had completely dropped off. He was running at 3,200 RPM cruise speed, and the main and the Genny were hanging there limply. He rolled in the Genny and took down the main. He had thought about leaving the main up with two reefs in it and a reefed staysail but knew it would likely be way too much canvas. Instead, he would run with just the staysail. If it got too bad, he would put a reef in it making it a trysail. If it got worse than that, he knew he would have to deploy the sea anchor.

He broke out the sea anchor and the sail bag that had 300’ of 5/8ths nylon rode. He took both bags forward and lashed them against the cabin top up on the foredeck. He didn’t want to have them there but knew it would be almost impossible to drag them up there from the cockpit in the middle of the blow. He opened the sail bag and hauled out the coil of rode. He had packed it in Marathon and had tied release lines with bright red reflective tags around it. He could pull the slipknots to the red tags, and the coil would be ready to go. He found the end of the rode that had the big eye splice, the shackle, and the bridal that he had made that would go through the two bow hawse pipes and attach to the Sampson posts. He had made the bridal long enough to go well outside of the bowsprit because he knew he had to keep the end of the rode away from it. Eight tons of boat could certainly rip the bowsprit right off if it got tangled with the sea anchor rode. He knew if that happened, he would lose the rig.

He went out on the bowsprit and threaded the bridal back to the Sampson posts and then attached the shackle to the eye that he had spliced that was encased in heavy plastic tubing to prevent chafe. It was ready to go. All he had to do was pull the red release tags on the coil of rode and toss the Paratech Sea Anchor overboard along with the small fender float that was attached to it with 100’ of 3/8ths nylon trip-line which would be how he would retrieve it. He hoped he wouldn’t need it, but more importantly, if he did, he hoped it would work as advertised. Their survival might depend on it. He had memorized the instructions and checked them off in his mind as he did his final inspection before heading back to the cockpit.

The wall of clouds was bearing down on them and was almost upon them when he made his way back to the cockpit. He slipped all three weatherboards into a large plastic garbage bag and dropped them in the track and then tied the line from the top weatherboard to the cleat just above and inside the companionway stairs. He knew that losing weatherboards in a knockdown or rollover could let in enough water below to sink them.

It was 1700, and the black wall of clouds was almost directly above them. Gillian had broken out the offshore life jackets and all of their foul weather gear and laid it out below. He tested the EPIRB and took the two handheld, waterproof VHF radios off the chargers and attached them to the life vests, each of which had mesh bags attached to them, which contained handheld starburst flares, Cyalume light sticks, die markers and shoulder-mounted strobe lights. He wasn’t going to rely on their inflatable life vest harnesses if they had to abandon ship into Baby Dink.

It was coming up on 1800, and he recorded their position. They were now 180nm off Morton Island. It was eerily still, and the surface of the ocean was smooth as they motored along at 6.5 knots. They were both sitting in the cockpit looking at the towering wall of clouds that was about to envelop them. Moments later, he could see the surface of the water off to the south change. He could make out a massive downdraft of cold air moving in advance of the front that was heading straight for them. Within seconds it was upon them, the staysail filled with a crack, and Lone Eagle buried her starboard rail and accelerated ahead. He estimated the downdraft to be 40+ knots.

The downdraft dropped the temperature by 10 degrees, and Lone Eagle’s speed was topping 9 knots. He couldn’t believe the speed they were getting with just the staysail. The seas were building too, and Lone Eagle was surfing down waves at an alarming rate of over 10 knots. Monitor was rock steady and had them right on their rhumb line. The ride was freakishly steady, and the boat seemed perfectly balanced. Lone Eagle was rocketing along, and they both just watched in awe at the force that was bearing down on them and little Lone Eagle that seemed like she was in her element and reveling in it.

They downed sandwiches and mugs of soup while he scanned the radar. Heavy rain was coming and showed up at the outer edge of 40nm on the radar. It was 1900, and it was time to raise Donald on the HF radio. It was also time to call into Australian Customs and let them know that they were approaching. He raised Donald first. They were safely tucked away up the Brisbane River. Donald reported that they were getting sustained winds of 40 knots and gusts up to 50 knots. He told Donald that they were riding well with just the staysail and making 10 knots. He gave Donald their position, and they agreed to check-in again at 0700. It was going to be a long night.

Next, he raised Australian Customs and was told to radio in when they arrived. It would be Monday, the 13th of October, and the customs officer said that there would be an overtime charge for the clear-in if they arrived after regular business hours. It was the last of his worries.

It was coming up on 2000 when he plotted their position. The chart plotter showed that they were 40nm from his Morton Bay waypoint. At their current speed of 9-10 knots, they would reach it sometime after midnight, and there was no way to slow down. Lone Eagle was doing her stuff, and they would get there when they got there. He would have to deal with wherever the conditions were when they arrived.

They both had on their heavy weather foul weather gear and were glad they had put it on. Lone Eagle wasn’t taking on much water on deck, but the rain was bucketing down, and visibility was zero. Radar scans showed that there was no other boat traffic to worry about. They were the only ones crazy enough to be out there.

They were on a beam reach with the wind out of the south. The seas were just aft of the beam, but he was keeping his eyes on the ones coming in from the southeast. He was worried about big green ones that could slam them without warning. It was black as pitch, and he couldn’t see very far. It felt like being in a cave and turning out your flashlight. You couldn’t see your hand in front of your face. The only light visible was coming from the instruments and the glow in the rain aft of the stern light.

At 2400 they were 10nm away from the waypoint marking the entrance to the Morton Bay shipping channel. He had Morton Island on the radar and had hoped to duck in behind the island, but that wasn’t going to happen. The chart and the guide showed that the water was quite shoal on the north end of Morton Island, so he knew he wouldn’t be able to get in close enough to the island to get any shelter from it. He would be too far off, and the fetch would be terrible. He would have to head up Morton Bay in the shipping channel and hope there wouldn’t be much traffic.

At 0200 they reached the entrance to North West Channel. He fired up the engine and brought her up to cruising speed and turned 90° to port for the well-marked entrance. He could see a line of lit marks that would lead them in. With the turn, they were head to wind, and he hooked in and went up on the foredeck to douse the staysail while Gillian held Lone Eagle on the approach heading. Once he had the staysail bagged, he disconnected the j-hook inner forestay for the stay sail from the bowsprit and reconnected it to the deck padeye even with the upper shrouds. Lone Eagle was now sloop rigged.

Back in the cockpit, he took the tiller from Gillian. They were headed for the channel marks. The wind was still 40 knots, and it was rough – very rough, and they were taking it dead on the nose. Each wave brought a sheet of spray over the boat. He kept looking at the channel marks, which weren’t getting any closer. He looked at the knot meter, and it was showing 7.5 knots. He then looked at speed over ground on the chart plotter. It was a negative number. Shit, they were going backward. He checked the RPMs, and they were at 3200. He took it up to 3500, and it made little difference.

They were safe at the moment, and he tried to understand what was going on and then figure out what to do about it. He was exhausted, and he knew he had to think straight. The first part of the equation was simple. The wind was howling out of the south, which was where they were headed. The second part was Morton Bay. It was shallow, and the waves were short, steep, and frequent, which was why they weren’t making any headway. The third part that was the icing on the cake was that the tide was running out of Morton Bay, and the flow was heading right at them from the south. Everything was against them.

There was nowhere to hide, and heading back out into the ocean wasn’t an option. He knew that the only choice he had was to motor sail up the shipping channel. The main was stowed, but it had two reefs in it, so he hoisted it while they were head to wind and returned to the cockpit. He needed more than that. He needed the Genny, but she would be a tiger by the tail if he unfurled too much of it. He eased her out to 30% and steered off the wind to starboard. Lone Eagle powered ahead. They were now making 5 knots speed over ground on their first tack up the shipping channel.

He knew his next challenges were tacking before he hit the shoal water on the fringes of the channel and ducking any large shipping that would be heading in and out of Brisbane. He picked up the remote VHF mic in the cockpit and raised Brisbane Port Control. They answered immediately, and he gave them his position and his situation. He explained that he was tacking his way up the shipping channel and asked them to advise of any departing or arriving ships. Brisbane Port Control advised that two container ships were getting underway out of Brisbane and that they would be advised of his situation and requested that he make radio contact with them as they approached.

He ended the transmission and checked the radar. The channel markers were visible, and there was no sign of the container ships. The electronic chart showed that he would be entering shoaling water very soon. He knew that they needed to tack, and Gillian readied herself to work the winches. As soon as the depth sounder showed the depth dropping, he threw the tiller hard to leeward to begin their next tack. After a few nail-biting seconds, Lone Eagle’s bow came through the wind with a sheet of spray and, within a few seconds, began to power ahead. He was anxious about that first tack because the waves were steep and frequent, and he was concerned that they might stall and not get the bow through the wind. It was okay, the power from the engine and the momentum from Lone Eagle’s eight tons carried them through the wind onto a port tack.

North West Channel connected to Spit Fire Channel. It had taken them two hours to make it 5nm. It was now 0400, and the first container ship showed up on the radar. He was 5nm out and looked to be making about 12 knots. He looked at the chart plotter and knew he was going to have to tack again in a few minutes. He raised the container ship on the VHF, and they confirmed that they had him on radar. He told them that he would be tacking across their bow in two minutes. They acknowledged and said they would standby. As soon as the depth sounder showed shoaling, he tacked onto starboard, and they were heading directly across the path of the container ship. He could see the ship’s running lights coming straight at that them. He was riveted to the radar, and with each sweep, he judged both their speeds. If he wasn’t going to cross its path in time, he knew he would have to tack off. That wasn’t the problem. He had to judge whether he was going to get across its path in time. If he misjudged, they would get run over. He knew that there wasn’t any chance of the container ship stopping.

As he watched the radar and the closing distance, he could see that they would safely clear the container ship’s path. His next problem was that he would soon run out of water and need to tack again. He figured that the container ship would be clear by then. As he was running the calculations in his mind, the radio came to life. It was the container ship captain; he said, “Fine a bit of sailing.” He replied, “I hope I’m just as lucky with the guy coming up behind you.”

He had the second container ship on the radar at 5nm. They were now 2nm up Spit Fire Channel, and he made their next tack. He knew he would have to do one more tack in front of the container ship. He hoped that he would have enough time and speed to clear. He raised the second container ship on the VHF and was told that they also had him on their radar. As the depth sounder showed shoaling, he advised the container ship that he was going to turn across their bow and threw the tiller to leeward while Gillian worked her winch magic, and he looked at the radar. They were closing fast. It looked like they would clear, but he wasn’t sure. It was going to be close, and he knew he might have to tack off and abort. He watched the radar scope as they got closer. Lone Eagle was rail down and making 5.5 knots. He knew he needed more speed and rolled the Genny out to 50% and Lone Eagle’s speed jumped to 6.5 knots. At that moment, he knew they would clear.

It was now 0500 on the morning of the 13th of October, and the wind hadn’t abated, and the nasty chop of Morton Bay hadn’t lessened. They had made it up Spit Fire Channel and had entered East Channel, which hugged the western side of Morton Island. It would be light soon. They had both been awake for 36 hours, and the tacking and hand steering was exhausting. Thankfully there weren’t any other container ships coming their way.

Morton Bay was fifteen miles wide and thirty miles long. According to the chart plotter, they had made it fifteen miles into the bay and had another fifteen to reach the sheltered southern part of the bay where there were plenty of spots to tuck in and hide. At the rate they were going, he didn’t think he had enough strength left to continue tacking for another 4-5 hours.

A glance at the radar showed a target heading for them at high speed. It was too fast for a container ship, and it was 5nm out, so it was too early to get a visual on it. It was just starting to get light when it finally came into view. It was a Marine Rescue boat, and she pulled in alongside. The skipper called him on the VHF and asked how they were doing. He told them that they were exhausted, but okay. The skipper radioed back that they had been tracking them since they entered the bay. He talked to the skipper about potential anchorages and was told that the nearest one was 10nm ahead. He replied: ‘I’m not sure we’ll make it that far.’

The skipper came back and said that they were based in Redcliff on the western side of Morton Bay and were heading back to base, and would he like a tow to the marina at Scarborough? He thought about it for a few seconds. They were exhausted, and five more hours seemed impossible to him. He knew his first responsibility was the safety of the vessel and the crew, and replied, “Yes.” The skipper came back and asked if he was declaring an emergency. He knew he had to say yes if he wanted the tow as the skipper knew his engine was working. He replied, “Affirmative.”

The Marine Rescue boat took up a position off his bow, and he hooked in and headed forward to take in their tow line. Thankfully he could tie it to the sea anchor bridle that was already in place. Gillian was at the tiller and struggling to keep Lone Eagle’s bow into the wind. Lone Eagle was now head to wind and hobby horsing. It was hard for him to keep his footing with waves breaking over the bow. The guy in the stern of the Marine Rescue boat threw him a messenger line, which he was able to grab, and he then began the process of hauling in the heavy tow line. Once he had the end of it, he tied it to the bridle with a bowline and threw both over the bow. The deckhand on the Marine Rescue boat signaled the skipper, and he slowly took in the slack. They were now under tow. In his mind, it was a rather embarrassing arrival in Oz, but he knew they had made it safely and that nothing had broken in the blow.

They both sat in the cockpit completely drained as the Marine Rescue boat motored across the bay to Redcliff. He steered to keep Lone Eagle right behind them. It took the better part of an hour to reach the breakwater at the entrance to the Scarborough Marina. It was 0700, and he went below to raise Donald on the HF radio. For some reason, he couldn’t make contact and thought there might be something wrong with the backstay antenna. He didn’t have time to deal with it. The skipper came on the VHF and told him that he needed to tie up to the quarantine dock and radio customs to request check-in. He asked the skipper where the quarantine dock was located in the marina and was told to look for the floating pontoon dock with the big chain-link fence with the razor wire on top.

He went forward and untied the tow line and thanked the Marine Rescue guys. He slowly motored in through the breakwall and spotted the quarantined dock. Gillian got dock lines and fenders ready. He pulled alongside the floating dock, and Gillian stepped off and fastened the lines. He radioed Customs and was told that they might not be able to come and do the clear-in until the following day. Gillian was on the dock and confirmed that the fence gate was locked and could only be opened from the outside. He explained to the customs officer on the radio that he had to come ashore to call his family to let them know he and Gillian were safe. The customs officer said they were not permitted to leave the customs dock and added that they would try and get someone down there as soon as he could.

Fortunately, the quarantine dock had water and power, so they started hosing all the salt off Lone Eagle and rinsing out their foul weather gear. When they finished hanging the foul weather gear from the rigging, he saw a guy walking down the dock towards them. He said hello as he approached the fence. His name was Mike, and he said, “Looks like you have had a rough ride. Did you come through that Southerly last night?”

“Nice to meet you, Mike, and yes, we did. It was a rough ride. All I want to do now is call my family here in Oz and let them know we’re safe, but the customs guys told us that we aren’t allowed off the quarantine dock and that they might not show up to clear us in until tomorrow.”

Mike said, “Hang on, I’ll be right back,” and turned and headed down the dock to his boat. A couple of minutes later, he returned with two beers in his hand and slid them through the fence along with his cell phone.

“Call your family and tell them you are safe. Welcome to Australia.”

He thanked Mike and dialed his mom’s phone number. She answered and was so relieved to hear that they had arrived and were okay. She said the Southerly had ripped through Urunga and that everyone was worried about them. She said that Tudi and Debbie were there and were awaiting their arrival. He told her that they planned to make their way south sometime tomorrow and would arrive in Coffs Harbor the day after if the weather cooperated. She said she would pass it along to Tudi and Debbie. He could hear the relief in her voice but said he had to go as he could see two customs officers heading down the dock toward him.

He gave Mike back his phone and thanked him again for his kindness. Mike was standing by the gate when the two customs guys opened it. They didn’t look very happy and proceeded to board Lone Eagle. Below he presented them with the ship’s papers and their passports. He slid his Aussie passport to them, and they didn’t blink. The junior officer opened the fridge and began throwing their remaining fruit and veg into a big plastic bag and asked if they had any meat aboard and confiscated that too.

The senior customs guy asked about any medications that they had aboard and was given the med bag, which he began going through and then asked if they had any firearms. When he said that he did, the customs guy forgot about the meds and asked that he tell him where they were stowed. He pointed to the locker, and the customs guy leaned over and opened it and retrieved the gun cases. He gave him the receipt to sign, and the customs guy looked it over, checked the serial numbers, and the ammo count, and signed it. The senior customs guy asked how long they were planning to stay in Oz. When he replied forever, the customs guy said he could get the guns back when he got the proper licenses and permits and handed him a one year cruising permit with the admonition that if he stayed any longer than a year, that he would have to import the boat. He thanked them both as they left the boat with the junior officer saying on their way out that they were unlocking the gate, and they were free to go ashore.

Welcome to Oz, he thought, as he lowered the quarantine flag and raised the oversized Australian courtesy flag on the starboard spreader.





CHAPTER LXXI October 16, 2003 - Arrival



Coffs Harbor, New South Wales, Australia

Lat: 30° 18’ 65.00” S, Long: 153° 09’ 10.00” W

After the customs guys left, they went up to the dockmaster’s office and paid for one night’s dockage. Before they left, he headed for the chart section of the adjoining chandlery. He wanted to leave the next morning and knew that they would have to take the inside passage down Morton Bay, through the Broad Water and then back out to sea via the Gold Coast Seaway. He bought the three charts he needed, and Gillian bought a phone card. While he was looking over the charts, Gillian was calling home to let her mom and dad know of their arrival. Her dad, who had been in the hospital with a blockage in a vein in his leg, was home, but her mother was now in the hospital with a cardiac problem. Gillian’s dad told her that her mother was fine and not to worry.

They headed back to Lone Eagle and discussed the plan for heading to Coffs Harbor. The southeasterly winds were abating, and the forecast showed that they would have 10-15 knots and that the tide would be running in by mid-afternoon. With the tide behind them, he hoped that they could make it to Peel Island that marked the start of the inland waterway. An overnight anchorage at Peel Island would give them a chance for a first light start, down the channel, and that would put them at the Gold Coast Seaway pass before nightfall. They would then have an overnight run to Coffs Harbor with an expected mid-day arrival.

It was late afternoon, and they had a couple of sundowners and the remaining sandwiches and went to bed. They had gotten showers earlier at the marina and were too tired to do anything other than getting some sleep. It was 1800, and they had been up for 72 hours.

The next morning he was up at 0600 and got started working the nav after he investigated the problem he was having with the HF radio. It was a loose connection at the antenna switch that he used to switch the antenna from HF radio to weather fax. He would try to raise Donald at 0700. He had attempted to raise him on the VHF the night before but knew it didn’t have the range to reach the Brisbane River.

Gillian woke when he tried to call Donald on the HF radio. He wasn’t able to make contact, so Gillian fired off an email letting them know that they had arrived safely and were at the Scarborough Marina and would be leaving later that day for an inside passage bound for the Gold Coast Seaway. When he finished the nav, he went up to the dockmaster’s office to go over a few questions he had about the inside passage.

When he arrived, the dockmaster told him that some guy was looking for him. He couldn’t think of who that might be, and just as he did, the dockmaster pointed to the guy out through the window. He walked over to him and said: “Hi, I’m Rob.”

The guy replied: “Hi, I’m William – your cousin.”

He was shocked. The last time they had met was when he was four years old. Apparently, his mom had activated aunty-net, which he knew was a powerful family communication system. William got the call that they had landed and decided to drop by to meet his American cousin. He was thrilled to see him and took him back to Lone Eagle to meet Gillian. William couldn’t believe the small size of Lone Eagle. He told William of their plans to head to Coffs Harbor that afternoon, and William asked if he could drive them to pick up anything they needed - they took him up on his offer.

They stocked up on ice, some fruit and veg, and some fresh meat. Back at the dock, William helped them unload and wished them a safe voyage to Coffs Harbor. They shoved off from the quarantined dock and headed for the fuel wharf. He had burned a lot of diesel on the run from Port Moselle with the day tank reading less than ¼. Once fueled up, they headed out of the marina and took up a heading for their first waypoint.

They reached Peel Island as the sun was beginning to set and dropped the pick on the lee side of the island in a safe little anchorage that would assure them of a good night’s sleep. They were still feeling the effects of the days and nights before, so a couple of sundowners and some great steaks on the grill were all they needed for some much-needed rest.

The next morning they got a first light start and headed into the entrance of the channel between Macleay Island and Coochiemudlo Island. The guide said that the channel wasn’t wide, and there were a few shoal spots that they needed to be mindful of, but that there would be good water along most of the way. It proved to be an easy and enjoyable run, much like the Intracoastal Waterway. There were some rural areas at the start, and then it became much more urban and eventually ritzy as they reached the Gold Coast, with its mega-mansions on the water. It looked like Fort Lauderdale and Miami, and some of the places on the local charts shared the same names as those in Florida.

The southward route paralleled South Stradbrook Island, which, at its southern tip, marked the entrance to the Gold Coast Seaway. They rounded Porpoise Point at 1800 and took up heading for their first offshore waypoint. They were on their way with a 3-knot push from the East Australian Current. The wind had shifted to the east-northeast, which put them on a beam reach. With the current behind them, they were making 8 knots.

He went below and sent an email to his cousin, Tina, in Urunga and told her that their ETA Coffs Harbor would be around noon the following day and to let the family and Tudi and Debbie know so that everyone could be at the marina when they sailed in.

The overnight run down the Gold Coast was breathtaking. They were 2nm offshore, and the lights of the high-rises were blazing. Gillian took the first watch and woke him at the usual hour. As he sat in the watch seat, his thoughts were of the incredible voyage that they were about to complete. He knew he would miss the peace and serenity that he had enjoyed on so many of those midnight to four watches that he had stood. Those nights were incredible, but he also knew that he wouldn’t miss those storm-tossed nights that they had endured. He knew that when future Southerly Busters came through that, he would pause to think of those brave souls out there, experiencing the oceans fury. He remembered the lyrics to Eilleen Quinn’s song: “Here’s to all the sailors who; come back stronger, come back broken, and those that don’t come back at all.” He thought that they had come back stronger, but knew that there could have been times where they could have come back broken or not at all. They were lucky.

It was 0400, and time for Gillian’s watch. He was enjoying the last night of solitude and let her sleep until 0500 when he couldn’t keep his eyes open any longer. There had been a few big ships passing, but they were twenty or more miles offshore. He had been running fifteen-minute radar sweeps and had picked up several fishing boats, but they were all stationary and well lit. The loam of sunrise was beginning as he went below to get some sleep. He was exhausted, but the excitement of their arrival kept him awake.

After an hour of trying, he got up and got the kettle going. It was going to take a few cups to get him ready for the day. They had received an email from Donald and June that said they were going to stay a few more days in Brisbane and would catch up with them in Coffs Harbor. Donald added at the end: “Well done, Lone Eagle. Welcome to Oz.” He was looking forward to the arrival of Just Ducky in Coffs Harbor. They had sailed thousands of miles together. He knew their friendship would stand the test of time.

He had a waypoint just off South Solitary Island that would mark the turning point for the run into Coffs Harbor. They were coming up on it, and he could see Mutton Bird Island in the distance that formed the entrance to Coffs Harbor. He picked up the cockpit mic and called the dockmaster and was given a berth assignment. He gave the dockmaster his mom’s phone number and asked him if he could give her a call and let her know that they would be arriving within two hours. He said he would.

Gillian had Lone Eagle looking her best. She came up into the cockpit just as they were passing South Solitary Island. They could see the old lighthouse on the highest point of the island. He knew he would be looking out to it every night from their berth in the marina. He grew up with the Fire Island lighthouse on Long Island. Lighthouses were a sailor’s best friend and had often guided him home. This one would be a new friend.

They rounded Mutton Bird Island and entered the harbor. It was a beautiful sight with the mountains of the Great Dividing Range framing the scene. They motored through the breakwall entrance to the marina and found their berth. Waiting for them was the family, but he couldn’t see Tudi and Debbie. He gently put Lone Eagle into the berth and jumped onto the dock and hugged his mom. She was in tears. It had been almost a year since his last visit. His aunts were there along with Tina, his cousin, and her children. Tina told him that she hadn’t checked her email that morning and missed his ETA email of the night before. She said that when she heard that they were coming in that she called Tudi’s hotel and was told that they were out visiting an art gallery, but that she had left a message at the front desk. He and Gillian were so deflated. Tudi and Debbie had traveled all the way to Australia for their arrival and had missed it.

His aunts couldn’t believe that they had sailed 14,000nm from America on little Lone Eagle. He spoke to his mom, and she said that they had planned a gathering at her place the following night, and thought it would be a good time for Gillian to show everyone the photos of the trip. The dock party lasted about an hour, and the family departed to let them get Lone Eagle squared away. They wanted to stay that first night aboard. It was their moment to celebrate their accomplishment.

As the sun went down, the sky clouded over, and it started to rain. Below they lit all the oil lamps, which always gave Lone Eagle a beautiful glow, especially now since Gillian had oiled all the teak and polished all the brass portholes. Lone Eagle had kept them safe on their voyage. She would now be home.

From out on the dock, they heard, “Ahoy Lone Eagle.” It was Tudi and Debbie in foul weather gear dripping wet. He got them aboard and dried off and then took them below. There were hugs and tears all around. Tudi and Debbie’s eyes were darting all around the cabin. Lone Eagle had been their boat for 23 years, and they were amazed at how she was fitted out for long-distance cruising. They didn’t miss a detail and asked so many questions. Tudi hugged Gillian and said that Lone Eagle looked gorgeous. She couldn’t get over how the bronze portholes just glowed. It had taken a lot of elbow grease, but Gillian was so proud of how she had taken care of Lone Eagle. They reminisced about his time in New Bern, North Carolina, where he spent two weeks fitting out and trying to outrun winter on his way south. They talked about Gillian flying in to be with him and carrying an entire Thanksgiving dinner with her in her luggage. They all just laughed. They had a wonderful evening together and were sorry to see them go. They would meet up at his mom’s house tomorrow.

He blew out the last of the oil lamps and crawled into their big bunk. He could feel the weight of the voyage lifting off him as he fell into a deep sleep.

The next morning Gillian went up to the dockmaster’s office and called home to see how her mom was doing. She said that her dad had answered the call and said that her mother was fine and that the doctors were doing some routine tests, and that she should be home in a couple of days. He could see that Gillian was relieved as they sat in the cockpit with their morning coffee and watched the fishing boats come in and unload their catch. There was a fish market and a fish and chips shop in the marina. Up at the main road, there was a grocery, a liquor store, and a brothel. What more could a sailor ask for, he thought.

All of the lockers and compartments aboard Lone Eagle were crammed full of cruising gear that needed to be taken off the boat to give them more living space. They agreed that the sooner they got all the gear off that they wouldn’t be needing, the sooner they would have the space they needed for marina-based living.

He went up to the dockmaster’s office and was told that there was a rent-a-car place just down the road. He and Gillian went for a walk and found it. They rented a small truck and drove it out onto the breakwall opposite their finger pier. It took all morning to move all of their cruising gear into the truck. Once loaded, they drove to his mom’s place in Urunga. He opened the garage door and saw all of his belongings that he had shipped over. The feeling he had last Christmas, where it all felt like a museum of his things from another life, crept over him again. It would be all they would have to start their new life in Oz.

Unloading was easier than loading, and it wasn’t long before they had the truckload of gear stowed in his mom’s garage. They couldn’t believe how much gear had been stowed on Lone Eagle. Her waterline came up three inches. Once they finished unloading, they drove back to the rent-a-car place in Coffs Harbor. He was able to get a good deal for a one week rental of a small car and headed over to Tudi and Debbie’s hotel and picked them up and headed back to his mom’s place.

It had taken hours to move all of the boat gear, and the thought of hot showers and his king-size bed for their first night on dry land was a blessing. Tudi and Debbie helped his mom get ready for the arrival party while they showered. The family lived just down the block and turned up with armloads of food. There were lots of stories and hundreds of questions.

Gillian tapped her glass with her spoon to get everyone’s attention and said she had written some words she wanted to share with everyone and unfolded a piece of paper and stood at the head of the table.

Captain Rob

I know that our journey has been shared in so many ways by all of you, but it is also true that only Rob and I really understand what this has meant to us. We have endured storm-tossed nights that demanded our all, leaving us exhausted at the end of a passage. We have seen breathtaking sunsets, incredible sunrises, enjoyed days and nights of isolation in the middle of a flat calm ocean that have been almost surreal in their tranquility. We have looked on with delight at dolphins frolicking in our bow wake, penguins paddling alongside and watched with humility, the awesome majesty of a sperm whale breaking through the waves. We have shared a daily existence in the closest and most confined of spaces. We have yelled at each other in frustration, leaned on each other in times of need, and laughed and smiled the whole way through. The depth of the experiences we have shared is intimate to the two of us and given us great insight into each other.

A journey like this demands so much of the people who undertake it and the vessel they choose to carry them through it. Lone Eagle is a given, a true bluewater cruiser, tried and tested over many years under the loving ownership of Tudi and Gus, this much I knew when I agreed to go with Rob. I had, however, no measure of Rob’s abilities other than what he had told me. I trusted my life to this man, and in a heartbeat, I would do it again. Rob has poured his heart and soul into our voyage on Lone Eagle. The meticulous attention to detail, the hours of planning, thinking every situation through from sixty different ways, the challenges of sail trim and of navigation, the challenge of having me as crew! Rob has dealt with everything that has been thrown at us, and rising to meet that challenge has fulfilled his dream. I have watched Rob grieve hard for his father over the last two years, and I know his biggest regret is that his dad is not here with us today. Rob will probably scowl at me if I say he is the “consummate” seaman, for that is how he has always characterized his beloved dad, but Rob I do say it now, knowing that the spirits on board are smiling in agreement, for we have seen you ‘climb the wind.’ My thanks, my admiration, my respect, and my love to the Captain of Lone Eagle.

At the end of Gillian’s speech, there wasn’t a dry eye in the room, especially his. He couldn’t believe the love and thought she had put into it. He only wished his dad were there. It was sixty years ago almost to the day when his dad met his mom in Sydney after stepping off the Cefalu. Sixty years later, he met his mom on the dock after retracing his dad’s voyage to Oz.

At the end of the evening, they gave Tudi and Debbie a ride back to their hotel in Coffs Harbor. Tudi and Debbie said that they had booked a rain forest bus tour in the morning and would meet them for sundowners aboard Lone Eagle when they returned. They drove back to his mom’s place and melted into the king-size bed.

The next morning they were awoken at 0600 by the phone. He got to the phone first. It was Gillian’s dad, and he asked to speak to her. He put her on, and within seconds he could see the distress on her face and the tears welling up in her eyes. Her mom had passed away. He heard her tell her dad that she was coming home and would call him later with the details. When she hung up the phone, he held her as she sobbed. All she could say was, “I didn’t even have a chance to speak to her, even if it was just to say goodbye. I’ve got to go home and be with my father. He just got out of the hospital and isn’t well. I’ve just got to go.”

“I know, baby. Let's get on the phone and get your flights booked. I am sure you can get a flight out of Coffs Harbor to Sydney, and they have regular service to Heathrow. I’m so sorry baby.” He didn’t know what else to say.

His mom was distraught and tried to comfort Gillian, but nothing could stop the tears. He called the local travel agent and got her booked on flights that afternoon. They grabbed a couple of duffle bags and collected what she had at his mom’s place and headed for Lone Eagle so that she could pack the remainder of her things.

Back aboard Lone Eagle, Gillian went through the cabinets and lockers and filled both duffle bags. She was still distraught. He tried to comfort her but knew that her mind was a million miles away with her dad. She said that he was going to be lost without her mom.

Her flight to Sydney was at 1300, and the airport was a five-minute drive from the marina. They got off the boat with the duffle bags to head up to the car when Gillian said, “You go ahead up with the bags. I’ll be along in a minute. I want to say goodbye to Lone Eagle.”

“OK, baby, I’ll meet you at the car.”

As he walked onto the main dock, he glanced over at her. She kissed Lone Eagle’s bowsprit and turned to walk up the finger pier with her head in her hands. His heart was breaking for her. His father’s death had been a lingering one. Her mom’s death was so sudden. He didn’t know which was worse, but he certainly knew what she was going through and what she would be going through in the days and weeks ahead. Just the thought of her alone on the flight back to the UK alone was almost too much for him to bear. He remembered his flight back to the States after dropping his mom off in Oz just after his father died. It made his blood run cold.

When her flight was called, her tears kept pouring. Words escaped him. All he could say as she left his embrace and headed for the gate was, “Love you, call me when you get in.” And then she was gone. It was everything he could do to pull himself together and head out to the parking lot. They had spent every minute of two years together, and she was gone.

He drove back to the marina and climbed aboard Lone Eagle, and opened the hatch and went below. He just stood there in the cabin. It felt so empty. It felt like the heart had been ripped out of her. He knew this was going to be home, but it was so full of memories of Gillian. He made himself a cup of coffee and just sat there looking at all the gleaming bronze and brass that she so lovingly polished. He knew he had to get ahold of himself. The days ahead were going to be hard for him too.

He climbed up into the cockpit. There was a 19’ daysailor in the berth next to him, and there was a guy that had just come aboard her.

“Hey, Lone Eagle, welcome to the marina. I see you’ve come from Washington, DC. You’re a long way from home. I’m Rick.”

“Hi Rick, I’m Rob. It is good to meet you. Actually, I’m an Australian with a funny accent. My mom was a war bride, and I have dual citizenship, so this is going to be home for a while.”

“Welcome to one of the nicest spots on the planet. I’ve been here for ten years. Moved up here after practicing in Sydney for twenty years.”

“Lawyer?”

“Yeah, I’ve got a little practice just up the road. What kind of work did you do in Washington?”

“I’m a lawyer too. I was admitted to the New South Wales Bar last year.”

“Wow, admitted in the States and here. What are you going to do here?”

“I’m not sure. Maybe I’ll find a sleepy little practice. I haven’t given it a lot of thought. I figured I would take some time to get the lay of the land.”

“Well, my sleepy little practice is just up the road, and I have a spare work station if you need internet access.”

“Wow, that’s a very kind offer. Thank you. Yes, I would certainly appreciate it if I could use that spare workstation. I can’t get internet on the boat, and it would certainly come in handy.”

“Great, I’ll see you at work on Monday. We start at 8:30,” Rick said as he climbed off his boat and headed up the dock.

He wanted to say something but couldn’t find any words, and nothing came out. He looked down into the dark, empty cabin and pulled the hatch closed and stepped onto the dock. He looked back at Lone Eagle and knew that life had just happened again, and nothing was ever going to be the same.
